The '''Commonwealth Bank of Australia''' ('''CBA'''), or '''CommBank''', is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] bank with businesses across [[New Zealand]], [[Asia]], the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. It provides a variety of [[financial service]]s including retail, business and institutional banking, [[funds management]], [[superannuation]], insurance, investment and broking services. The Commonwealth Bank is the largest Australian listed company on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]] as of August 2015 with brands including [[Bankwest]], Colonial First State Investments, [[ASB Bank]] (New Zealand), [[Commonwealth Securities]] (CommSec) and Commonwealth Insurance (CommInsure).<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.asx200list.com/|title = ASX 200 List / Market Capitalisation Accurate on: 22 August 2015|date = 22 August 2015|accessdate = 3 September 2015|website = ASX 200|publisher = [[Australian Securities Exchange]]|last = |first = }}</ref> Commonwealth Bank is also the largest bank in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref name="by-marketcap">{{cite web |url = http://www.relbanks.com/worlds-top-banks/market-cap|title = World's Largest Banks by market capitalization 2015|publisher = relbanks.com|date = 2015}}</ref>

Founded in 1911 by the [[Australian Government]] and fully privatised in 1996, the Commonwealth Bank is one of the "[[Big Four (banking)#Australia/New Zealand|big four]]" Australian banks, with the [[National Australia Bank]] (NAB), [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] and [[Westpac]]. The bank was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1991.

The former global headquarters of Commonwealth Bank were the [[Commonwealth Trading Bank Building]] on the corner of [[Pitt Street]] and [[Martin Place]], [[Sydney]], which was refurbished from 2012 for retail and commercial uses, and (from 1984 to 2012) the [[State Savings Bank Building]] on [[Martin Place]], which was sold in 2012 to [[Macquarie Bank]]. The headquarters were moved to Tower 1, 201 Sussex Street and two new nine-storey buildings which were built at the site of the former [[Sega World Sydney]], in [[Darling Harbour]] on the western side of Sydney's city centre.

In 2018, findings from the [[Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry]] have indicated a negative culture within the Bank, amid allegations of fraud, deception, and money laundering, among various other crimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cocaine-girls-million-dollar-fraud-what-the-commonwealth-bank-lender-did-next-20180511-p4zeqt.html|title=Cocaine, girls, million-dollar fraud: What the Commonwealth Bank lender did next|first=Chris Vedelago, Cameron|last=Houston|date=11 May 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

===Foundation (1911–1919)===
{{See also|Reserve Bank of Australia}}
The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by the ''Commonwealth Bank Act 1911'', introduced by the [[Andrew Fisher]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government, which favoured bank [[nationalisation]], with effect on 22 December 1911.<ref name=CN_MP-TDMP2-R-02>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/about-rba/history/|title=Reserve Bank of Australia : A Brief History|website=rba.gov.au|access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=CN_MP-TDMP2-R-03>{{Cite web|url=http://advance-australia.com.au/upfiles/the_story_of_the_commonwealth_bank.pdf|title=Story of Commonwealth Bank|access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref> In a rare move for the time, the bank was to have both savings and general bank business. The bank was also the first bank in Australia to receive a federal government guarantee. The bank's earliest and most strenuous proponent was the flamboyant American-Australian Labor politician, [[King O'Malley]], and its first Governor was Sir [[Denison Miller]].

The bank opened its first branch in [[Melbourne]] on 15 July 1912.<ref>{{cite book|title=Australia Through Time|publisher=Random House Australia|year=2004|isbn=0-75931-002-5|page=191}}</ref> In an agreement with [[Australia Post]] that exists to this day, the bank also traded through post office agencies. In 1912, it took over the [[State Savings Bank of Tasmania]], and by 1913 it had branches in all six states.

In 1916, the bank moved its head office to [[Sydney]]. It also followed the Australian army into [[New Guinea]], where it opened a branch in [[Rabaul]] and agencies elsewhere.

===Central bank (1920–1959)===
In 1920, the bank began acquiring [[central bank]] powers when it took over the responsibility for the issue of Australian bank notes from the Department of the Treasury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.commbank.com.au/group_display/0,1922,CH2054,00.html |title=Commonwealth Bank – History – A brief history of the Commonwealth Bank |publisher=About.commbank.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref>

Also in 1920, the Commonwealth Bank took over the [[Queensland Government Savings Bank]].

The bank's role in central banking expanded gradually after 1920. In 1931, the bank board came into conflict with the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of [[James Scullin]]. The bank's chairman [[Robert Gibson (businessman)|Robert Gibson]] refused to expand credit in response to the [[Great Depression]], as had been proposed by Treasurer [[Ted Theodore|Edward Theodore]] unless the government cut pensions, which Scullin refused to do. The conflict surrounding this issue led to the fall of the government, and to demands from Labor for reform of the bank and more direct government control over monetary policy.

Also in 1931, it took over the savings bank business of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales (est. 1871), the current account and fixed deposit business of the NSW Rural Bank Department, and the State Savings Bank of Western Australia (est. 1863).

In 1942, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation (CBC) suspended its operations in [[Papua New Guinea]] as the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured many of the towns in which it operated, and bombed [[Port Moresby]]. The bank resumed operations later, possibly in 1944.

The bank had many branches across Papua New Guinea including Port Moresby, Boroko, Rabaul, Lae, Wau, Bulolo, Goroka, Kavieng, Madang, Mount Hagen, Kundiawa, Popondetta, and Wewak. On Bougainville, there was Kieta, Panguna, Arawa and early on a part-time sub-branch at Loloho. It maintained those facilities to support trade, local business, government, and small savers.

The Commonwealth Bank received almost all central bank powers in emergency legislation passed during [[World War II]] and at the end of the war, it used this power to begin a dramatic expansion of the economy. This was also the aim of the federal government at the time, which attempted to compel the Australian states to conduct their banking with the Commonwealth under the ''Banking Act 1945'' (Cth), but the High Court in ''Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth'' (1947) 74 CLR 31, blocked this move.

The government also dramatically expanded immigration programs. In response, the bank established a Migrant Information Service (later known as the Australian Financial & Migrant Information Service, or AFMIS). The bank expanded during this period, and in just five years it opened hundreds of branches throughout Australia and in 1951 it established a branch in the [[Solomon Islands]].

In 1958 and 1959, there was a controversy concerning the dual functions of the organization, operating as the central bank on the one hand and a commercial bank on the other. As a result, the government separated the two roles, creating the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] to exercise the central bank function, and leaving the Commonwealth Banking Corporation to operate purely as a commercial bank. Those commercial functions were exercised by the organization's constituent sections: the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, and the newly-formed Commonwealth Development Bank.

From 1958 to 1976 the Commonwealth Bank operated savings bank agencies in the [[New Hebrides]].

===Diversification (1960–1991)===
[[File:Commonwealth Bank old logo.jpg|right|thumb|1980s logo]]
A new Commonwealth Development Bank was established in 1960 and during the 1970s the bank diversified its business into areas like insurance and travel. It established a finance company, CBFC in 1974. The bank also became more heavily involved in foreign currency trading and international banking in general.

The bank actively supported the introduction of [[decimal currency]] in the years leading up to 1966 and, like most banks, it gradually converted its paper records onto a new computer-based system. The bank created the first [[credit card]] in Australia in 1974 when it established [[Bankcard]]. In later years the bank began offering [[MasterCard]] (1984) and [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] (1993) cards as well.

In 1974, as [[Papua New Guinea]] approached independence, the bank formally handed over its PNG operations to the newly created and government-owned [[Bank South Pacific|Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation]] (PNGBC).  The bank retained a restricted branch in Port Moresby that it finally closed in 1982.

In 1981 the bank transferred its operations in the [[Solomon Islands]] to the [[National Bank of Solomon Islands]], which operated as a joint venture (51% Commonwealth Bank, 49% Government of the Solomon Islands).

In 1989 the bank acquired 75 per cent of [[ASB Bank]] in [[New Zealand]].

In 1991 the bank acquired the failing Victorian Government-owned [[State Bank of Victoria]] (est. 1842).

===Privatisation (1991–present)===

[[File:Commonwealth Bank logo 2020.svg|thumb|The updated logo from 2020|150px]]
Between 1991 and 1996 the Australian Government fully privatised the Commonwealth Bank. The first share offer in 1991 was valued at $1,292 million, the second in 1993 for $1,700 million and the third was sold for $5,000 million in 1996.<ref>http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/eropa/unpan001420.pdf</ref> It is a public company, but one of the few such companies in Australia whose official name does not end in 'Limited'.

In 1994 Commonwealth sold its shares in [[National Bank of Solomon Islands]] to [[Bank of Hawaii]]. In 1994, Commonwealth took a 50% share in PT Bank International Indonesia.

On 10 March 2000, the Commonwealth Bank and Colonial Limited announced their intention to merge, with seven Commonwealth Bank shares being offered for twenty Colonial Shares. The merger received final approval from the Supreme Court of Victoria on 31 May 2000 and was completed on 13 June 2000. This brought into the fold Colonial’s stake in [[Colonial National Bank]], the former National Bank of Fiji. The bank also acquired the remaining 25% of [[ASB Bank]].

Banking opportunities in Asia saw the Bank in 2000 acquire full ownership of PT Bank International Indonesia and rename it (PT Bank Commonwealth). This bank now has over 16 branches and has opened several FX shops to cater to Commonwealth Bank clients who are tourists in [[Bali]].

In 2005, the bank established strategic co-operation agreements with two Chinese banks, Jinan City Commercial Bank and Hangzhou City Commercial Bank; it took an 11% stake in Jinan Commercial, and a 19.9% stake in Hangzhuo Commercial. Commonwealth also established a representative office in [[Bangalore]], [[India]].

On 27 January 2006, the bank acquired the remaining 49% stake in Colonial National Bank (Fiji).

At the beginning of 2008, Commonwealth Bank opened a branch in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon). Then in October, Commonwealth announced that it had purchased [[Bankwest]] and St Andrew's Insurances from their parent company [[HBOS plc]] for [[Australian dollar|A$]]2.1 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/news/media-releases/2008/081008-news-bankwest-acquisition.aspx|title=Commonwealth Bank of Australia to acquire Bank West and St Andrew's|author=Commonwealth Bank of Australia|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012083229/http://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/news/media-releases/2008/081008-news-bankwest-acquisition.aspx|archive-date=12 October 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bankwest.com.au/about-us/our-journey|title=BankWest and St Andrew's sold to Commonwealth Bank|author=Bank of Western Australia Limited|year=2020|accessdate=2020-10-27}}</ref> The acquisition was scheduled to be completed in early 2009, subject to regulatory approval.

In December 2009, Commonwealth sold [[Colonial National Bank]] to [[Bank of South Pacific]].

The bank transferred their [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] service desk from [[HP Enterprise Services]] in [[Adelaide]] to ITS (Armaguard) in [[Sydney]] from March 2012. The bank will change from [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] and [[Diebold]] ATMs to [[Wincor Nixdorf]] ATMs over the coming years.

The bank is the only financial services organisation to appear in the Dream Employers' top 20 list of preferred employers for 2010 and 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamemployers.com.au/dreamemployerawards/|title=The Dream Employers|accessdate=2013-02-16|year=2011|publisher=Dream Employers}}</ref>

During the [[Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry]] it was discovered that the Commonwealth Bank had charged dead people for financial advice services.<ref>{{cite news|title=Commonwealth Bank defends 'good decision' not to tell customers about data breach|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-02/commonwealth-bank-confirms-loss-financial-records-20m-customers/9720928|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=ABC News|date=2 May 2018|language=en-AU}}</ref> On 9 May 2018, Commonwealth Bank settled an interest rate rigging case brought by [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission|ASIC]] for $25 million.

==Controversies==
===Environmental===
Commonwealth Bank is one of the major Australian banks known to be financing and profiting from activities destructive to the Great Barrier Reef, something the bank has been facing increased public scrutiny over since a 2013 report by Market Forces;<ref>{{cite web|title=Financing Reef Destruction; How banks are using our money to destroy a national icon|url=http://www.marketforces.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/MF_Financing_Reef_Destruction.pdf|website=Market Forces|publisher=Market Forces|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref> the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' had this to say:<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hannam|first1=Peter|title=Big banks finance reef destruction, activists claim|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/carbon-economy/big-banks-finance-reef-destruction-activists-claim-20130501-2iu3x.html|accessdate=10 May 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2 May 2013}}</ref>

{{block quote|''Australia's big four banks are leading lenders to the massive expansion in coal and gas shipments through the Great Barrier Reef, contradicting their own pledges to curb carbon emissions and preserve sensitive environmental areas. ... The CBA, meanwhile, highlighted its achievement to cut carbon emissions from operations by 35,000 tonnes in 2012. A single bulk carrier shipment of coal exported from Australia would result in final emissions of four times those savings.''|Julien Vincent, campaigner with Market Forces, May 2013.}}

In 2014, CBA and the big four Australian banks faced increased pressure to end their support for reef-threatening mining projects, as surveys have shown that "the big four banks would be risking customers shifting up to $236 billion in household deposits if they were to finance a project like the Abbot Point expansion".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saunders|first1=Amanda|title=Australian banks face more pressure over support for coal projects|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/australian-banks-face-more-pressure-over-support-for-coal-projects-20140710-zt14p.html|accessdate=10 May 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=10 July 2014}}</ref>

In late 2014, it "was revealed [CBA] was advising Indian coal miner Adani on its proposed development in Queensland's Galilee basin",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chatterjee|first1=Dev|title=It's Branson vs Adani in Australia; Virgin promoter to protest Adani's mining project in Australia, saying it will damage the Great Barrier Reef|url=http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2014/11/27/policy-politics/cba-gun-galilee-coal-mine-advisory-role|accessdate=10 May 2015|work=Business Standard|date=9 May 2015}}</ref> while by 2015, it has been reported that "all the major American and European banks have refused funds to the project, citing environmental damage".<ref>{{cite news|title=CBA in gun for Galilee coal mine advisory role|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/it-s-branson-vs-adani-in-australia-115050800809_1.html|accessdate=10 May 2015|work=Business Spectator|date=27 November 2015}}</ref>

In May 2015, a report by Market Forces showed that CBA is the single biggest lender to fossil fuel projects within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area during the six-year period from 2008 to 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=van de Pol|first1=Will|title=Commbank biggest lender to coal and gas in the Reef|url=http://www.marketforces.org.au/Commbank-biggest-lender-to-coal-and-gas-in-the-Reef|accessdate=16 May 2015|publisher=Market Forces|date=16 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521052001/http://www.marketforces.org.au/Commbank-biggest-lender-to-coal-and-gas-in-the-Reef|archive-date=21 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Almost immediately following, protests were held at over fifty CBA branches in Australia and around the world.<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|last1=Milman|first1=Oliver|title=Australia's banks have 10% loans in risky fossil fuels, says investment adviser|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/australias-banks-have-10-loans-in-risky-fossil-fuels-says-investment-adviser|accessdate=20 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Thuy|title=Environment campaigners protest in central Sydney over Commonwealth Bank investment in fossil fuel projects|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-20/group-against-commbank-fossil-fuel-investment-protest-in-sydney/6484328|accessdate=20 May 2015|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

Later in May, a report by MSCI showed that while other banks are reducing their funding for fossil fuel projects, Australia's largest banks are ramping up this same funding; ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported:<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

{{block quote|''Australia's largest banks have committed about 10% of their known loan arrangements to the financing of risky fossil fuel projects that may become 'stranded' if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change, new research has estimated.|[[The Guardian]], May 2015.}}

===Information data loss of 20 million accounts 2018===
In 2018, Commonwealth admitted to losing the records of 20 million user accounts. Names, addresses, account numbers, and bank statements from 2000 to 2016 were stored on two magnetic tapes. The two tapes were marked to be destroyed by a subcontractor Fuji-Xerox in 2016 after the decommissioning of a data center. No certificate of the destruction of the tapes have been received by the bank. This caused the bank to begin an 'investigation' into whether the tapes were destroyed. The bank decided to not alert the customer on the possible data breach. The story broke through the news media website BuzzFeed. There is no information or evidence that any data stored on the tape has been compromised.

===2008 financial planning scandal===
In October 2008, former CBA financial planner [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-29/jeff-morris.jpg/9921310 Jeff Morris] alleged to the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) and subsequently a Senate Inquiry, the extent of the misconduct of CBA's financial planning arm, Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFPL), but it was not until 16 months later that ASIC would launch an investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=The man who blew the whistle on CBA|url=http://www.afr.com/p/business/financial_services/the_man_who_blew_the_whistle_on_gXRai1FAdK3vNJAKv22z0N|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=Australian Financial Review|date=28 June 2014}}</ref> "There was forgery and dishonest concealment of material facts," the Senate Inquiry found in its report.<ref>{{cite book|title=Performance of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission|date=26 June 2014|publisher=Parliament of Australia|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/senate/economics/asic/final_report/~/media/committees/senate/committee/economics_ctte/asic/final_report/report.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> They concluded a Royal Commission or Judicial Inquiry as it was deemed ASIC lacked the investigative powers required to uncover the full extent of the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senators demand inquiry into CBA|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/senators-demand-inquiry-into-cba-20140626-3awgo.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 June 2014}}</ref> A week following the Senate Inquiry, CEO Ian Narev publicly apologised while announcing a compensation scheme.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBA sorry 'too little, too late'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-sorry-too-little-too-late-20140703-3bbhy.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=4 July 2014}}</ref> Former CEO Ralph Norris also conceded that he was aware of problems within CFPL acknowledging the presence of rogue financial planners but rejected the assertion of a conspiracy to cover it up.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former CBA boss Norris blames scandal on 'rogues'|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/former-cba-boss-norris-blames-scandal-on-rogues-20140713-3bv1g.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 July 2014}}</ref> CBA has been criticised in the Senate for appointing Dr. Brendan French, who was the General Manager of Group Customer Relations before, as the head of the Open Advice Review program.<ref>{{Citation|title = Commbank CBA Brendal French - all mentions at Senate Inquiry|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMNsQend2-Y|date = 2014-06-04|accessdate = 2016-01-21|last = The Real Dr Brendan French}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = CBA executive running compensation scheme moves to new role|url = http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-executive-running-compensation-scheme-moves-to-new-role-20151127-gl9l1w.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 2016-01-21}}</ref> The CBA defended Dr. Brendan French successfully in a defamation lawsuit in 2015; the decision was a single judge decision and was not appealed.

In 2016, it was revealed that some CBA staff were implicated in an alleged $76m [[Ponzi scheme]] fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Commonwealth Bank staff implicated in alleged $76m fraud|url = http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/commonwealth-bank-staff-implicated-in-alleged-76m-fraud-20160204-gmllia.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 2016-02-13}}</ref> The alleged architects of the scam were professional poker player Bill Jordanou and accountant Robert Zaia.

===Insurance division scandal===
It was reported alleged systemic issues about the insurance division of CBA. A claimant who suffered a heart attack and nearly died had his claim declined based on an outdated medical definition in his insurance policy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=2016-03-04|title=CommInsure denying heart attack claims due to outdated definition|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-05/comminsure-denying-heart-attack-claims/7218818|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-11|website=ABC|language=en-AU}}</ref> The company admitted this decision was a bad judgement.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-03|title=CBA's CommInsure admits to 'poor judgement' over medical definition updates|url=https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/cbas-comminsure-admits-to-poor-judgement-over-medical-definition-updates-20170303-gupzqh|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Australian Financial Review|language=en}}</ref> The insurer also "refused to pay total permanent disability (TPD) and terminal illness claims on the chance that a dying person facing organ failure may have their life saved by a transplant, and that a person can claim their life insurance if they are declared terminally ill by two doctors and deemed likely to die within 12 months."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2016/comminsure-exposed/heart-attack/|title = You can't trust CommInsure - Part 1|last = Ferguson|first = Adele|website = www.smh.com.au|access-date = 2016-03-05}}</ref> In March 2016, ASIC announced it would be investigating CBA about the allegations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/business/asic-to-investigate-cbas-life-insurance-arm-20160305-gnbmox|title=ASIC to investigate CBA's life insurance arm|website=Financial Review|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> After the serious allegations were aired in an episode of ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' two parliamentary inquiries were conducted.<ref>{{Citation|title=Money for Nothing|date=2016-03-07|url=https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/money-for-nothing-promo/7217116|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-06-11}}</ref> One into the life insurance sector,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Inquiry into the life insurance industry|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/LifeInsurance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU}}</ref> and another into protection of whistleblowers.<ref>{{Cite web|date=|title=Whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-for-profit sectors|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/WhistleblowerProtections|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-11|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU}}</ref> The inquiries found that no staff involved in the wrongdoings were fired.

===Money laundering scandal===
In August 2017, the financial intelligence agency [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC) launched civil proceedings in the [[Federal Court of Australia]], alleging that CBA had breached money laundering and terrorism financing laws on 53,700 occasions. The breaches related to the bank's use of intelligent deposit machines (IDMs) between November 2012 and September 2015—the bank claimed that a programming error allowed depositors to instantly credit cash deposits to their accounts, whilst failing to report amounts over $10,000 to AUSTRAC, and not enforcing any limits to the number of transactions.<ref name="austrac">{{cite news|title=CBA accused of money laundering, terrorism financing breaches |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-03/cba-risks-massive-fines-over-law-breaches/8770992|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=ABC News|date=3 August 2017|language=en-AU}}</ref>

===Bank bill swap rate allegations===
{{see also|Libor scandal|Interbank lending market}}
ASIC commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court on 30 January 2018 alleging manipulation of the [[bank bill]] swap rate (BBSW). The BBSW rate is the rate of interest that banks charge to lend money to each other, and is a key interest rate used as the benchmark for interest rates on a number of products, most notably business loans, currency derivatives and floating rate bonds. It is alleged that the manipulations took place on three specific occasions in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=ASIC sues Commonwealth Bank for interest rate fixing on eve of royal commission |url=https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/finance-news/2018/01/30/commonwealth-bank-bbsw-asic/ |accessdate=31 January 2018 |work=The Newdaily|date=31 January 2018 |language=en-AU}}</ref>

===BankWest commercial loan book===
The change from [[Basel I]] to [[Basel II]] capitalisation requirements, due to take effect on 1 January 2009, required [https://www.bankwest.com.au/ BankWest] to increase its [[Tier 1 capital]] (share capital) by an additional A$17 billion. BankWest's owner HBOS lent this money to Bankwest, but required the money be repaid to meet HBOS's own capital requirements.<ref name="hearing20151202">{{Cite web|url=https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=COMMITTEES;id=committees/commjnt/44a392b3-aad7-41f3-86c1-d72a6045ce4a/0001;query=Id:%22committees/commjnt/44a392b3-aad7-41f3-86c1-d72a6045ce4a/0000%22|title=ParlInfo - Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services : 02/12/2015 : Impairment of customer loans|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au}}</ref>

HBOS, therefore, agreed to sell BankWest to Commonwealth Bank (CBA) in October 2008. The sale completed on for A$2.1 billion on 19 December 2008, and required Commonwealth Bank to repay the capital HBOS had loaned Bankwest.<ref name="hearing20151202"/>

One of the provisions of the sale agreement was an ability for CBA to claim a price adjustment a loan was later found to have been impaired at the time of purchase but had not been identified to Commonwealth Bank by HBOS as impaired during the acquisition.<ref name="hearing20151202"/>

Commonwealth Bank declared 1,958 out of 26,000 BankWest commercial loans impaired (in default of the loan terms),<ref name="hearing20151202"/> with a total face value of $17.9 billion. As they were deemed to be in breach of their loan conditions, the bank was able to charge increased interest rates, or require early repayment.<ref name="hearing20151202"/>

Commonwealth Bank lost A$2 billion on defaulted loans that were not repaid<ref name="hearing20151202"/> (2.1% of the loan book, in comparison to an average of 0.4% across the [[Big Four (banking)#Australia/New Zealand|Big Four Australian banks]]).<ref name="hearing20151202"/> Of the defaulted loans, the calling-in of 117 resulted in the borrowing company going into receivership.<ref name="hearing20151202"/>

Borrowers complained that they had complied with the monetary conditions of the loans: they had kept up interest payments and repayments, and disputed whether it was reasonable to apply penalty interest and require early repayment for non-monetary issues (for example, not having invested the funds for the purpose borrowed, or no longer having adequate security to back the loan).

The Australian Parliament requested that the Parliament's [[Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services]] conduct an inquiry into the matter,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/customer_loans|title=The impairment of customer loans|first=Canberra|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|website=www.aph.gov.au}}</ref> which reported on 4 May 2016.

The committee concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that impairment of loans was related to an attempt to 'claw back' any of the BankWest purchase price.<ref name="bankwestreport">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Joint/Corporations_and_Financial_Services/customer_loans/Report/b01|title=Executive summary|first=Canberra|last=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House|website=www.aph.gov.au}}</ref> However, it did find that "in a minority of cases" there was abuse of the asymmetry of power between the bank and the borrower.<ref name="bankwestreport"/> The committee recommended that there be improvements in the consistency of lenders' valuation of property used as security for loans.<ref name="bankwestreport"/>
