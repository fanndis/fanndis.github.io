'''Garnier''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡarniay}}) is a mass market [[cosmetics]] [[brand]] of [[France|French]] cosmetics company [[L'Oréal]]. It produces [[hair care]] and [[skin care]] products.

==Launch==
The company started as ''Laboratoires Garnier'' in 1904 by French creator Alfred Amour Garnier, through the launch of his first patented plant-based hair lotion, La Lotion Garnier. In the 1930s, Garnier was an early producer of sun-care items and the first to make a permanent home hair color in 1960. It was acquired by L'Oréal in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmTTs_pcd24C&q=garnier+cosmetics |title=Marketing Planning & Strategy: Casebook - Subhash C.

== Expansion and products ==
