== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Krk location map.png|thumb|left|Map]]
Archeological finds show that the island has been inhabited without interruption since the [[Neolithic]], although not much about the earliest people is known. In later periods, Greek and Latin sources refer to ''Κύριστα'' ([[Ancient Greek]]) or ''Curicta'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]) as one of the Apsyrtidian or Electridian islands held by the [[Liburnians]], an [[Illyria]]n tribe. The Liburnians called the island "Curicum", which is assumed to be an ''illyrized'' name given the island by its original inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Krk|last=Kipicic|first=Viktor|publisher=Graficki zavod Hrvatske|year=1978|isbn=|location=Zagreb|pages=|via=}}</ref>

There are the remains of prehistoric settlements near [[Draga Bašćanska]] and [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] earthworks near [[Malinska]], [[Dobrinj]], [[Vrbnik]] and [[Baška]]. [[File:Brücke Krk-Festland.JPG|thumb|[[Krk Bridge]]]]

=== Roman era ===
Krk came under Roman rule once they defeated the Liburnians. The Town of Krk (Curicum) became a town with Italic law whose status evolved to give it the rights of a municipality. Nothing is known about the internal organizations of the town of Krk during this time. Near the present day Franciscan monastery, the remains of thermal baths have been found. The defensive walls of Roman Curicum were among the most secure of all the towns on the Eastern Adriatic fortified by the Romans. Work began on their construction during the Civil War in Rome (50 BCE) and they were further strengthened in the 60s of the 2nd century CE, to enable them to withstand attacks by the Quadi and the Marcamanni who were at that time threatening the Adriatic. Not far from Krk in 49 BCE there was a decisive sea battle between [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and Pompey, which was described impressively by the Roman writer [[Lucan]] (39–65 CE) in his work ''[[Pharsalia]]''.<ref name="Naprijed">Naklada Naprijed (1999). ''The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide'', pp. 111–112, Zagreb, {{ISBN|953-178-097-8}}</ref> When the Empire was divided, Krk came under the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

=== Migrations of the nations ===
The walls of the town of Krk could not withstand attacks by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] (7th century), but in contrast to [[Salona]], [[Scardona]] and [[Aeona]], life in Krk quickly returned to normal. The Croats penetrated into the town on several occasions. They retained many of the Roman names they found there and so it is said that Krk has a "mosaic dialect". Following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (812)|Treaty of Aachen]] (812) the entire island was ceded to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was governed according to the norms of that Empire. During the reign of Emperor [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] (10th century), Krk was known as ''Vekla'', of which the Romanized variant, also used by the Venetians, was ''Veglia''.<ref name="Naprijed"/>

=== Time of the Croatian Counts and Kings ===
There are no extant documents showing when Krk became part of the Croatian state. It is known that from around 875 the Byzantine town paid the Croatian rulers 110 gold pieces a year to be able peacefully to keep their hold there. While the Croatian state was being established, Krk found itself on the Venetians' route to the Mediterranean. The Venetians conquered the town for the first time in 1001, and from then Krk's history was closely linked with the history of the [[Republic of Venice]] for seven centuries. During the reign of [[Peter Krešimir IV of Croatia|Peter Krešimir IV]] the Croatian rulers regained their power, but the Venetians took Krk for the second time in 1118.<ref name="Naprijed"/>

=== Reign of the Krk Counts (from 1430, the Frankopan family) ===
[[File:Croatia Krk BW 2014-10-12 12-09-54.jpg|thumb|left|Town of [[Krk (town)|Krk]]]]
When the Venetians conquered Krk for the second time in 1118, the local noble family, the unknown Dujams,<ref>Also called Demjen, Duimo or more generally Duym.</ref> received Krk as part of a pact with [[Venice]], and they became Counts. When Dujam died in 1163, Venice allowed his sons to make their position hereditary, after a payment of 350 [[Bezant|Byzantine gold pieces]] as tax. In a short time the Krk Counts became so strong that at one time from 1244 to 1260, Venice rescinded their authority. This failed to impede their rise, however. They increased economic exploitation, but they also endeavoured to strengthen old traditions and rights with various statutes (the [[Vinodol Code]] 1288 and the [[Vrbnik Statute]], 1388). Dujam's youngest son, who died in 1209, succeeded in extending his authority to the mainland, began to serve the Croatian-Hungarian King and received the district of [[Modruš]]. Due to his economic strength and social standing, his opponents fought each other for his favour. The Counts became so strong that no power could threaten them (until the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]). Members of his family were leaders in [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Trogir]] and [[Senj]], and from 1392 one of them ([[Ivan V Krčki (Frankopan)|Ivan V]]), became a Croatian-Dalmatian [[Ban (medieval)|Ban]]. In 1430 they took the surname [[Frankopan]] (Frangipane), claiming to have Roman origins. That year they adopted a coat of arms showing two lions breaking a piece of bread (Latin: frangere panem, break bread). From 1449, the descendants of [[Nikola Frankopan|Nikola IV]] founded eight branches of his family, and together with the [[House of Zrinski|Zrinski Counts]] were the ruling feudal family in the whole of Croatia right up to 1671.<ref name="Naprijed"/> The Frankopans produced seven Croatian Bans, and many of them were patrons of Croatian artists.

=== Under the Venetians (1480–1797) ===
Krk was the last Adriatic island to become part of the [[Venetian Empire]]. Due to its location, closest to the [[Uskoks]] of Senj, it served as a lookout point and the first line of defence against the Uskoks. From that time the ruler was a Venetian noble, but the Small and the Large Councils both had a certain autonomy. The doge controlled the clergy but public documents were written in [[Glagolitic]] which was adopted here more than anywhere else. At the beginning of the 16th century the inhabitants of inland Croatia began to settle on Krk in their flight from the Turks, but Krk suffered a decline like all other Venetian property. In 1527 the town had 10,461 inhabitants and in 1527{{Clarify|date=July 2015}}<!-- this is clearly an error, it says 1527 both times; it's necessary to check what the source says --> it had 8,000.<ref name="Naprijed"/>

=== Under the Austrians ===
[[File:Vrbnik - wyspa Krk.JPG|thumb|[[Vrbnik]]]]
Austrian rule began with the fall of Venice in 1797 and was briefly (1806–1813) interrupted by Napoleon's [[Illyrian Provinces]]. In 1822 the Austrians separated the island from Dalmatia and linked it to [[Istria]], so that Krk, [[Cres]] and [[Lošinj]] came under direct rule from Vienna. This link contributed to the Croatian National Revival and together with [[Kastav]], the town of Krk played a leading role in the spread of Croatian education and culture.<ref name="Naprijed"/>

=== 20th century ===
The Italian Occupation (1918–1920) was brief, and Krk was handed over to Croatia, then in Yugoslavia, by the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]], Italy took Krk again in the Second World War (1941–1943), and German occupation followed from 1943–1945. The post-war development of Krk was led by tourism. The building of an airport and then a bridge over to the mainland ensures the future of the development of tourism on this island. In [[Omišalj]] there has also been industrial development.

The bridge is at the north end of Krk island and uses the small island of Otoćić Sveti Marko (St. Mark's Islet) as a mid-support.

== Economics and infrastructure ==
[[File:Croatia 01.jpg|thumb|Beach ''Haludovo'' in [[Malinska]]. The view includes the island [[Cres]] and mountain [[Učka]] in the distance across the Bay [[Kvarner]].]]
Krk is located rather near the mainland and has been connected to it via a {{convert|1430|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} two-arch concrete [[Krk bridge|bridge]] since 1980, one of the longest concrete bridges in the world. Due to the proximity to the city of Rijeka, [[Omišalj]] also hosts the [[Rijeka Airport|Rijeka International Airport]] as well as an [[oil terminal]] representing a part of the [[Port of Rijeka]] and a [[petrochemical]] plant.<ref name="Omišalj-Port-Authority">{{cite web | publisher= Port of Rijeka Authority | url= http://www.portauthority.hr/rijeka/en/infrastructure/liquid-cargo-terminal.html | title= Terminals – Liquid Cargo Terminal | accessdate= August 26, 2011 | archive-date= September 9, 2020 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200909061738/https://www.portauthority.hr/rijeka/en/infrastructure/liquid-cargo-terminal.html/ | url-status= dead }}</ref><ref name="Omišalj-DIOKI">{{cite web|publisher=DIOKI d.d. |url=http://www.dioki.hr/eng/o_petrokemija/p_lokacije1.asp |title=DINA – Petrokemija d.d., Omišalj |accessdate=August 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502044910/http://www.dioki.hr/eng/o_petrokemija/p_lokacije1.asp |archivedate=May 2, 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Omišalj-JANAF">{{cite web|publisher=[[Jadranski naftovod]] | url= http://www.janaf.hr/index.php?option=terminal&lang=en | title= The Omišalj Port and Terminal | accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref>

Krk is a popular tourist destination, due to its proximity to [[Slovenia]], southern Germany, Austria, and northern [[Italy]].
Since the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], many tourists have appeared from [[Hungary]], Romania, and other former Eastern Bloc countries.

== Geography ==

Krk is like many Croatian islands, it is rocky and hilly. The rock is mostly [[karst]]. The southeast portion of the island is mostly bare as a result of the [[Bora (wind)|bora]] winds.

Some prominent features include:
* Obzova, the highest point at 568 msl <ref>http://www.krk.hr/en/the_island_of_Krk</ref>
* [[Vela Luka, Krk|Vela Luka]] a harbor on the southeastern end of the island

===Fiber access network===
In 2009 the municipality started the project of building a [[fiber-optic network]] on the whole area of the city (the town of Krk and 14 neighboring villages) as part of the town infrastructure. Thereby the focus is on building the passive part of the network, which is the most expensive one and the prerequisite for service providers being able to provide ultra-fast Internet connections and new e-Services. The project is covering 6,243 inhabitants and 6,000 households. The first issue was the elaboration of a cost-benefit analysis <ref>[http://www.grad-krk.hr/lijeviMenu/Programi-i-inicijative/Projekti/Analiza-isplativosti-uvo%C4%91enja-gradske-opticke-mrez.aspx Town of Krk: projects, city fiber network]</ref> in 2009/2010 followed by a preliminary network planning. At the beginning of 2013 the building authority issued the relevant approval. The next step is the elaboration of the main project which is the condition for getting the building permission and by which the project can apply for EU structural funds.

== Culture and religion ==
Krk has historically been a center of [[Croats|Croatian]] culture. Various literature in the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was created and in part preserved on Krk (notably the [[Baška tablet]], one of the oldest preserved texts in [[Croatian language|Croatian]]). A [[monastery]] lies on the small island of [[Košljun]] in a bay off the coast of Krk.

Krk belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]] during much of the Middle Ages until its [[Treaty of Campo Formio|dissolution]], when its destinies followed those of [[Dalmatia]]. It became part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later called Yugoslavia) after World War I, in 1920.{{citation needed|reason=Yugoslavia formed in 1918. Did Krk not leave Italy until two years later?|date=August 2019}} After that date, the village of Veglia/Krk remained the only predominantly Italian-speaking municipality in Yugoslavia. After World War II, most of the Italians left.

The island of Krk is a participant in the 2020 [[European Capital of Culture]] project. Through the program "27 neighborhoods", the [[Krk (town)|city of Krk]], [[Malinska]] and [[Vrbnik]] will be involved in different events during the entire year.<ref name="Visit Krk">{{cite web|publisher=Visit Krk | url= https://www.visitkrk.com/en/the_island_of_krk__neighbourhood_of_european_culture_capital_of_2020/504_504/33 | title= The island of Krk - neighbourhood of European culture capital of 2020 | accessdate=June 6, 2020}}</ref>

== Language ==

Krk is well known for its historical language diversity. The [[Middle Chakavian]] dialect of Croatian is the primary dialect used on the island. Up to 1898 <ref name="Roegiest">{{cite book |author=William B Brahms |title=Notable Last Facts: A Compendium of Endings, Conclusions, Terminations and Final Events throughout History |publisher=Reference Desk Press |year=2005 |location=Original from the [[University of Michigan]] |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wIwYAAAAIAAJ |isbn=978-0-9765325-0-7 }}</ref> {{sfn|Spicijarić Paškvan|2014|p=73}} (the day the last speaker of [[Dalmatian language]], [[Tuone Udaina]] died in 1898), five languages were spoken on the island: [[Venetian language|Venetian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], Croatian, [[Dalmatian language#Vegliot dialect|Dalmatian]], [[Istro-Romanian language|Istro-Romanian]].
