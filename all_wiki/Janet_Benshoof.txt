==Legal work==
Benshoof established landmark legal precedents in the U.S. Supreme Court and international forums.

Her training on gender rights and international law at the [[Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal|Iraqi High Tribunal]] resulted in the first legal decision in the Middle East to confer women rights under international law.<ref name=harvard/>

She also lectured and trained women leaders, judges, parliamentarians, and various UN bodies on implementing [[Human rights#International law|international human rights laws]] (such as [[CEDAW]]) and [[international humanitarian law]], including women's rights to criminal accountability under Security Council Resolutions and by the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref name=globaljusticecenter/>

In 1992, Benshoof left the ACLU to found the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (now the [[Center for Reproductive Rights]]), the first international human rights organization focused on women's rights to equality; she served as its first president.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/nyregion/public-lives-defending-the-defenders-of-abortion-rights.html|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Defending the Defenders of Abortion Rights|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Joyce Wadler|date=November 4, 1998|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/profile/janet-benshoof|title=Janet Benshoof|date=2011-05-05|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref>

Concerning [[contraceptive mandates]] she wrote in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that, "there are strong stereotypes about women that are behind this discrimination. Men are meant to have erections and sexual pleasure. Hence, fund Viagra. Women are designed to get pregnant, become mothers, and not be sexual. Hence don't fund 'unnatural' contraception or abortion."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicole-skibola/whos-getting-paid-to-have_b_1319981.html?ref=politics|title=Who's Getting Paid to Have Sex?

In a 2016 piece in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Benshoof argued that the United States should assume the lead in prosecuting [[ISIS]] fighters for genocide, writing, "Prosecution of ISIS crimes as genocide is both a legal and a moral obligation. American leadership to ensure that these prosecutions take place will reinforce the global values of diversity that ISIS is seeking to destroy."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/16/opinion/isis-crimes-of-genocide.html|title=ISIS Crimes of Genocide|date=May 16, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
