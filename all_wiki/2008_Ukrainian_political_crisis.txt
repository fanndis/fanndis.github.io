The '''2008 Ukrainian political crisis''' started after [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]]'s [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] (NU-NS) withdrew from the governing coalition following a vote on a bill (4 September 2008) to limit the President's powers in which the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]]'s [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] (BYuT) voted with the opposition [[Party of Regions]].

Foreign media reported that the political crisis was sparked by the [[2008 South Ossetia War|armed conflict between Russia and Georgia]] that started in early August 2008 and began with a dispute between President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] over Ukraine's reaction to that conflict. The President gave his support for Georgia and strong criticism of Russia whereas other parties professed more balanced positions towards the two parties of that conflict. On 16 September, the collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced.<ref name="afp.google.com">{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtUOmlRyOSVtaxRetvox2V-OZ_fQ|title=Ukraine's pro-Western coalition collapses: speaker|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916205510/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtUOmlRyOSVtaxRetvox2V-OZ_fQ|archivedate=16 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the failure to re-create the coalition, the Ukrainian parliament was dissolved by president Yushchenko on 8 October 2008, giving way to the [[2008 Ukrainian parliamentary election|third parliamentary election in three years]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ukraine gets third election in three years |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands]] |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5999526/Ukraine-gets-third-election-in-three-years |accessdate=8 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081011032654/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5999526/Ukraine-gets-third-election-in-three-years |archivedate=11 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

During the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree requiring advance notice of the movements of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] into and out of the Ukrainian port of [[Sevastopol]]. He also came out strongly in support of [[President of Georgia|Georgia's President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], condemning Russia's attacks within Georgia. Tymoshenko and her bloc put forward a less critical position towards Russia and the Prime Minister herself was out of public view during much of the conflict. On 18 August 2008 Yushchenko's office accused the Prime Minister of taking a softer position as a way to win the support of Russia during the 2010 Presidential election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, said Tymoshenko's actions showed "signs of high treason and political corruption" adding that documents supporting these allegations were being handed over to prosecutors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/ukraine-pm-accused-high-treason-georgia/article-174801?Ref=RSS |title=Ukraine PM accused of 'high treason' over Georgia |publisher=EurActiv |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920121724/http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/ukraine-pm-accused-high-treason-georgia/article-174801?Ref=RSS |archivedate=20 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tymoshenko denied the accusations<ref>{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jXHYKgM3583Rlhsa_hYLkIo5nBSA|title=Ukraine PM rejects traitor accusations: report|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=20 August 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921010516/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jXHYKgM3583Rlhsa_hYLkIo5nBSA|archivedate=21 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> and rejected the accusation that she was soft in her support for Georgia, saying that she supported the "sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia" but she does not agree with the president’s tough stance on the Black Sea Ports and defends her position as being "in line with the European Union and not to drag Ukraine into conflicts".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf|title=Newsletter for the international community providing views and analysis from the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) |publisher=[[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] |date=8 September 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029054137/http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>

Andriy Semchenko, an MP from the Tymoshenko bloc, called on the President and the head of the President's Secretariat Viktor Baloha to apologize to the PM before there could be constructive work in the coalition.

On 1 September 2008 Prime Minister Tymoshenko put forward draft legislation which would facilitate the procedure for impeachment, though she insisted it would not affect President Yushchenko and was meant for future presidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-270322.html|title=Tymoshenko "calms down" Baloha saying his chief must not be concerned|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914183607/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-270322.html| archivedate= 14 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> When the legislation came to a vote two days later, Tymoshenko's bloc voted together with the Party of Regions and [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]] to pass it. They also approved legislation limiting the powers of the President while increasing the powers of the Prime Minister. In particular the parties approved legislation which would strip the President of the right to reject a candidate for Prime Minister, dismiss the Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministers and appoint a head of the State Intelligence Service. Yushchenko promised to veto the legislation.<ref name=Time>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838848,00.html |title=Why Ukraine's Pro-Western Coalition Split |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908011536/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1838848%2C00.html |archivedate=8 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bloomberg>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=avVAAysbcd8I&refer=europe|title=Yushchenko May Dissolve Ukraine Parliament, Call Vote|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008}}</ref>

Following the vote President Yushchenko's bloc pulled out of the governing coalition saying Tymoshenko was colluding with the opposition and the President warned he would call a snap election if a new coalition was not formed within the required time. He further accused Tymoshenko of trying to set up a "dictatorship of the prime minister" and calling the parliamentary vote "a political and constitutional coup d'état." Tymoshenko rejected the allegations and said the real reason the president "declared a war against me is to ensure his victory in the next presidential elections." In spite of this Tymoshenko has called for restoring the coalition between the two groups.<ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"/> She also defended her position on Georgia saying it was "in line with the European Union and it is not to drag Ukraine into conflicts."<ref name=Time /> Parliament further increased the powers of the Prime Minister by passing legislation requiring the appointment and dismissal of the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]] by the President to receive the consent of the Prime Minister and giving the government power to appoint local heads of government if the President rejects the candidates.<ref name="zik.com.ua"/>

The same day Yan Bernazyuk, Yushchenko's liaison to the government of Tymoshenko, said representatives of the Presidential Secretariat were not allowed to attend the government session.
