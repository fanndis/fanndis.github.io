==History==
{{Main|History of the University of South Carolina}}

===Foundation and early history===
[[File:JonathanMaxcy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The university's first president, Reverend [[Jonathan Maxcy]]]]The university was founded as South Carolina College on December 19, 1801, by an act of the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] initiated by [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[John Drayton]] in an effort to promote harmony between the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Lowcountry]] and the [[Upstate South Carolina|Backcountry]]. On January 10, 1805, having an initial enrollment of nine students, the college commenced classes with a traditional classical curriculum. The first president was the [[Baptist]] minister and theologian Reverend [[Jonathan Maxcy]]. He was an alumnus of [[Brown University]], with an honorary degree from [[Harvard University]]. Before coming to the college, Maxcy had served as the second president of Brown and the third president of [[Union College]]. Maxcy's tenure lasted from 1804 through 1820.<ref>[http://president.sc.edu/FormerPresidents.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307234601/http://president.sc.edu/FormerPresidents.php|date=March 7, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:South Carolina College Horseshoe 1850.jpg|left|thumb|South Carolina College as it appeared in 1850 looking from College Street]]
When South Carolina College opened its doors in 1805, the building now known as Rutledge College was the only building on campus. Located one block southeast of the State Capitol, it served as an administrative office, academic building, residence hall, and chapel. However, the master plan for the original campus called for a total of eleven buildings, all facing a large lush gathering area. In 1807, the original President's House was the next building to be erected. The building now known as DeSaussure College followed shortly thereafter, and the remaining eight buildings were constructed over the next several decades. When completed, all eleven buildings formed a U-shape open to Sumter Street. This modified quadrangle became known as the Horseshoe.

As with other southern universities in the antebellum period, the most important organizations for students were the two literary societies, the [[Clariosophic Society]] and the [[Euphradian Society]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Durham|first=David|title=A Southern Moderate in Radical Times: Henry Washington Hilliard, 1808–1892|date=2008|publisher=LSU Press|location=Baton Rouge|isbn=978-0807133286|page=13}}</ref> These two societies, which arose from a split in an earlier literary society known as the Philomathic, grew to encapsulate the majority of the student body from the 1820s onward.

The college became a symbol of the South in the antebellum period as its graduates were on the forefront of secession from the Union. With the generous support of the General Assembly, South Carolina College acquired a reputation as the leading institution of the [[Southern United States|South]] and attracted several noteworthy scholars, including [[Francis Lieber]], [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Joseph LeConte]].

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
Seventy-two students were present for classes in January 1862 and the college functioned as best it could until a call by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government for South Carolina to fill its quota of 18,000 soldiers. A system of conscription would begin on March 20 for all men between the ages of 18 and 45, but many students at the college volunteered for service.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beach|first=Frederick Converse|title=The Americana: A Universal Reference Library, Comprising the Arts and Sciences, Literature, History, Biography, Geography, Commerce, Etc., of the World|publisher=Scientific American Compiling Department|year=1907|volume=14}}</ref> Despite the depletion of students, the professors issued a notice that the college would temporarily close and would reopen to those under 18 years old. When the college reopened on March 17, only nine students showed up for classes.

On June 25 with the consent of the state government, the Confederate authorities took possession of the college buildings and converted them into a hospital. After many unsuccessful attempts to reopen the college, the trustees passed a resolution on December 2, 1863, that officially closed the college. By February 1865, [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] army had reached the outskirts of Columbia and the college was spared from destruction by the Union forces because of its use as a hospital. In addition, a company of the [[25th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] was stationed at the campus on February 17 to protect it from harm and to thwart off pillaging Yankee soldiers.
[[File:USCHorseshoe1872.jpg|thumb|left|An 1872 aerial illustration of the University of South Carolina Horseshoe]]

The Union army took possession of the college on May 24, 1865, and although the future for the college appeared bleak with it under military control, General [[John Porter Hatch]] sent a letter on June 19 to the remaining professors at the college that it should reopen as soon as possible. The appointment of [[Benjamin Franklin Perry]] as provisional [[governor of South Carolina]] on June 30 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] restored civilian rule to the state. Perry reinstated the trustees to their positions and the board met on September 20 to authorize the college to reopen on the first Monday of January in 1866. In a message to the legislature in October, Perry sought to convert the college into a university because with the state in an impoverished situation, it would provide a more practical education. Little opposition developed to change the college into a university and bill to establish the '''University of South Carolina''' was passed by the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on December 19, 1865.

The University Act of 1869 reorganized the university and provided it with generous financial support. An amendment was added to the act by [[W. J. Whipper]], a black representative from [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], that would prevent racial discrimination from the admissions policy of the university.  The legislature further proved its seriousness towards racial equality by electing two black trustees, [[Benjamin A. Bozeman]] and [[Francis Lewis Cardozo]],<ref>{{cite news |title=USC celebrates 110 years of black presence |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/60433048/black-history-of-university-of-south/ |newspaper=The Index–Journal ([[Greenwood, South Carolina]]) |date=December 2, 1983 |first=Loretta Costello |page=9 |last=Brown}}</ref> to the [[University of South Carolina Board of Trustees|governing board of the university]] on March 9, 1869. A [[normal school]] was established by the legislature on the campus of the university as well as a preparatory school since most of the black students of the state were ill-prepared for the academic work required at a university. In addition, to encourage enrollment by blacks, tuition and other fees were abolished. On October 7, 1873, [[Henry E. Hayne]], the [[Secretary of State of South Carolina]], became the first black student when he registered for the fall session in the medical college of the university.<ref>{{cite book |first=John S. |last=Reynolds |title=Reconstruction in South Carolina |url=https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni01reyngoog |year=1969 |publisher=Negro University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/reconstructioni01reyngoog/page/n237 233]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |first=Daniel Walker |last=Hollis|title=University of South Carolina |year=1956 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press|volume=II|page=66}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:University of South Carolina, Davis College.jpg|thumb|left|Built in 1909, Davis College was the university's first new building after the Civil War and currently houses the School of Library and Information Science]] [[Old Campus District, University of South Carolina|The Horseshoe]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and most of its buildings reflect the federal style of architecture in vogue in the early days of the nation. Among them is the [[University of South Carolina Library|South Caroliniana Library]], which was designed by [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]] and is the first freestanding academic library in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.edu/library/socar/about.html |title=About the South Caroliniana Library – University Libraries |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

Over the years the 11 original buildings on the Horseshoe survived a fire, an earthquake, and the Civil War, but in 1939 McKissick Museum replaced the original President's House. The President's House would eventually return to the Horseshoe after extensive remodeling of one of its original buildings, which was dedicated as such in 1952.

During the 20th century: the campus began to spread out dramatically from the Horseshoe. Today it includes the student union, 24 residence halls, numerous academic buildings, Longstreet Theatre, the [[Koger Center for the Arts]], the [[Carolina Coliseum]], the [[Colonial Life Arena]], [[Carolina Stadium]], and various facilities for [[Olympic Games|Olympic sports]]. ([[Williams-Brice Stadium]] is located approximately one mile off campus.) Recent additions to the campus are the Strom Thurmond Wellness and Fitness Center, the Greek Village, the Green Quad, the Honors College Residence Hall, the Public Health Research Center, the Graduate Columbia hotel, the Colonial Life Arena and Carolina Stadium. Future plans also include a new home for the School of Law (to be constructed in the block bounded by Gervais, Senate, Pendleton, and Bull streets with construction scheduled to begin in 2013) and a new home for the Moore School of Business, currently under construction at the corner of Assembly and Greene streets.<ref>[http://www.sc.edu/highlights/item.php?hid=8 University of South Carolina – Highlights] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218070336/http://www.sc.edu/highlights/item.php?hid=8 |date=December 18, 2014 }}</ref>

[[File:University of South Carolina Horseshoe.jpg|thumb|The University of South Carolina's historic Horseshoe, on which the university's first building was built in 1805]]

The campus continues to expand west toward the [[Congaree River]] in support of its research initiatives (see below). Three separate sites, each specializing in its own research area, will initially cover {{Convert|500000|sqft|m2|sigfig=3}} spread over six city blocks and will eventually grow to {{Convert|5000000|sqft|m2|sigfig=3}}. This new district of campus, named Innovista,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://innovista.sc.edu/ |title=Innovista: Innovative Research and modern, urban lifestyle |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=December 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203204649/http://www.innovista.sc.edu/ |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> will mix university and private research buildings, parking garages, and commercial and residential units. At the center will be a public plaza called Foundation Square.

The University of South Carolina also operates a transit system under Parking Services called Carolina Shuttle which operates 7 routes and 14 buses including converted buses that use more energy-efficient biodiesel. The system operates during the Fall and Spring semesters, with limited operation during the summer, reading days, and holidays. Service is free for the university's students, faculty and staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.edu/vmps/shuttle.html |title=USC Vehicle Management & Parking Services |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> A new system called "Cocky's Caravan" was added in 2008 as a weekend service, shuttling students from main areas on campus to the local entertainment district [[Five Points (Columbia)|Five Points]]. In 2011, Cocky's Caravan was shut down and replaced by a partnership with Checker Yellow Cab known as "Carolina Cab" that offers students free rides from Five Points to their homes within {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of campus.

Former President [[Andrew Sorensen]] raised even larger sums for research, including a $300 million grant for [[colorectal cancer]]. In the spirit of Palms' budget, the board of directors moved to transform university land on Assembly Street into an "innovation district" called [[Innovista]] that will develop four strengths: [[biomedicine]], [[nanotechnology]], [[environmental science]] and [[alternative fuels]].

Innovista is a partnered development with the City of Columbia. The {{Convert|200|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} campus will house offices and private research firms among the university offices and labs, as well as residences and retail. Innovista is planned to add five million square feet of floor space to the metro area and is intended to set Columbia on a more urban path.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.che.sc.gov/Commission%20Calendar&Materials/Aug2008MtgMaterials/USC-Columbia.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint – USC 2009 CHEPresentation-FINAL 7–31 [Compatibility Mode&#93; |format=PDF |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721062026/http://www.che.sc.gov/Commission%20Calendar%26Materials/Aug2008MtgMaterials/USC-Columbia.pdf |archive-date=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In May 2009, the University of South Carolina was selected by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] as one of 31 universities nationwide to house an [[Energy Frontier Research Center]] that is expected to bring $12.5 million in federal funding, the largest single award in the university's history, to the College of Engineering and Computing. President Pastides commented on the grant, "This award solidifies the university's position as a leader in alternative-fuel research."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.edu/news/newsarticle.php?nid=175 |title=Record award to create Energy Frontier Research Center |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

The University of South Carolina is a member of the SEC Academic Consortium. Now renamed the [[Southeastern Conference#The formation of SECU and SEC academic network|SECU]], the initiative was a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship and achievement amongst the member universities in the [[Southeastern conference]]. The SECU formed its mission to serve as a means to bolster collaborative academic endeavors of [[Southeastern Conference#Member universities|Southeastern Conference universities]]. Its goals include highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], students and its universities and advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities.<ref>{{cite web |title=SECU |url=http://www.secsymposium.com/secu.php|publisher=SEC|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SECU: The Academic Initiative of the SEC |url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/AcademicConsortium|publisher=SEC Digital Network|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref>

==Student life==

===Demographics===
Over 34,500 <ref>sc.edu</ref> students attend the Columbia campus of the University of South Carolina, coming from all 46 South Carolina counties. In addition, students from all 50 states and more than 100 foreign countries are represented here. (Almost 16,000 students study at the regional campuses of the [[University of South Carolina System]].)


===Housing===
[[File:WestQuad.jpg|thumb|right|West Quad, also called the "Green Quad", became the University of South Carolina's first LEED certified residence hall when it opened in 2004.]]
The University of South Carolina campus is home to 25 residence halls; the most recently completed hall opened in the fall of 2011. The housing on campus is under the supervision of Department of Student Housing, and quality of life is enhanced through the [[Residence Hall Association]], whose structure was determined by former president and vice president Amanda Pippin and Steve Smith.

University Housing provides over 6,200 on-campus housing units. Most of these Housing Centers have rooms that are air-conditioned and offer phone and cable television outlets and data connections networked to the university mainframe with access to the Internet. Housing provides many types of living experiences on the campus. Some include family residents in the nine-story Cliff Apartments, where each apartment has a stove and refrigerator. Rent includes all utilities. Freshmen housing, these centers, or residence halls, have layouts that maximize opportunities for student interaction. Freshman Centers typically feature double rooms and a central bathroom on each floor per unit. Notable freshmen centers include the 11-story Columbia Hall, 10-story Bates House and Patterson Hall, as well as South Tower which has 18 floors. Apartment style units in the modern housing units, which are often referred to as the "Quads", are the most requested type of housing among upper-level students. All are air-conditioned featuring two-, three-, and four-private bedroom floor plans with a living/dining area, kitchen, and bath.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.housing.sc.edu/virtualtour/apartment_style_index.html |title=Apartment Style Description |publisher=Housing.sc.edu |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> Undergraduates may choose housing in a specific "living and learning community". The concept is to create a better social and learning environment by housing students with similar academic or career interests together.<ref>[http://www.housing.sc.edu/rsl/rescom.html Living and Learning Communities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033257/http://www.housing.sc.edu/rsl/rescom.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}</ref> Learning communities enhance students' living experience by providing active learning experiences, faculty-student interactions, and opportunities to explore diversity, community service, undergraduate research, and study abroad; some of these centers are the Carolina International House at Maxcy College, Galen Health Fellows, the Rhodos community, Green Quad, Capstone, and [[Preston Residential College]].<ref>[http://www.housing.sc.edu/rsl/pdf/LLC.pdf Living and Learning Communities Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720043557/http://www.housing.sc.edu/rsl/pdf/LLC.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref>

Nine-story Patterson Hall, with a capacity of approximately 600 freshmen, is the university's largest residence hall. The tallest and most notable landmark on the Columbia campus is the 18-story Capstone House. Top of Carolina Dining Room is on the 18th floor and was the only revolving restaurant on an American college campus. In the fall of 2004, the $29 million West Quad (now Green Quad) opened and became one of only four in the world to be certified by the U.S. Green Building Council's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program. The {{Convert|172000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex includes three four-story buildings with the latest technology and environmental features for conserving water and energy and creating a healthier, greener environment for the 500 undergraduate students. West Quad, which was built with a significant amount of recycled materials, ranging from the cement blocks and copper roof to the interior carpet, is also intended to encourage students to learn more about their environment.<ref>[http://www.housing.sc.edu/westquadgo.asp West Quad Grand Opening] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808195016/http://www.housing.sc.edu/westquadgo.asp |date=August 8, 2007 }}</ref>

Since campus academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing, the university is adding more residence halls, most of which will be suite-style. As a result, some students live in popular off-campus housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipr.sc.edu/ |title=USC Institutional Assessment and Compliance |publisher=Ipr.sc.edu |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Student government===
The university's student government is composed of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. A 50-member Student Senate is led by the student body speaker of the Senate. The Student Senate enacts referendums, resolutions, and bills to enhance the student body in non-academic fields, maintains a budget for student life programs and organizations, confirms nominations for cabinet positions, and makes recommendations for change within the university. Student government is operated entirely by students with a Constitutional Council (its version of a Supreme Court) and Elections Commission. Authority derives from the Student Government Constitution, a document written and adopted with the inception of student government and overseen by the President of the University of South Carolina and the university's board of trustees.

===Media===
''[[The Daily Gamecock]]'' is an editorially independent student newspaper founded in 1908 that is published Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters and nine times during the summer, with the exception of university holidays and exam periods. It has a readership of more than 30,000 and is distributed across the university campus and regional campuses in the University of South Carolina System.

The student run radio station, [[WUSC]], began broadcasting on the AM dial in 1947. In January 1977 WUSC began broadcasting on the FM dial, and in 1982 the station found its current home at 90.5 FM. In June 2006, WUSC upgraded to a current digital transmitter and are now broadcasting in HD radio. WUSC-FM was one of the first stations in the state to broadcast in HD and recently made history by being the first station in the state to broadcast in HD2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wusc.sc.edu/index.php?q=about |title=About WUSC |publisher=Wusc.sc.edu |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

Students also publish a literary magazine, ''Garnet & Black'', which was formed in 1994 as a consolidation of the university's former yearbook and its literary magazine. The magazine focuses on timely issues and trends of student interest and regularly offering tidbits on current events and a "Create" section showcasing students' literature and artwork. It is published four times a year and is free to students at many locations across the Carolina community.<ref>[http://www.sa.sc.edu/studentmedia/garnetblack.htm Usc: Student Media] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506212752/http://www.sa.sc.edu/studentmedia/garnetblack.htm |date=May 6, 2008 }}</ref>

The University of South Carolina established its first television station in the Fall 2006, Student Government Television (SGTV). It was funded by Student Government until April 2007 when Student Government released SGTV to the Department of Student Media, which also operates [[The Daily Gamecock]], Garnet & Black Magazine and [[WUSC-FM]]. It was then that the station changed its name to it current name, Student Gamecock Television (SGTV). SGTV airs student created content 24/7 that can be seen on campus cable channel 4. It can also be watched live off-campus during the academic year on its website. SGTV strives to provide original, informative and entertaining programming while serving as an outlet for student work.

===Greek organizations===
About 22% of undergraduate men and 34% of undergraduate women participate in Greek organizations.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-south-carolina-3448/student-life</ref> Greek life is governed by an internal body that is called the Greek Council. There are two separate councils, one for males and another for females, that oversee activities and recruitment for fraternities and sororities on campus. The organizations hold two rush classes for the fall and spring semesters. The Greek organizations are heavily involved on campus with community service projects and spirit contests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sa.sc.edu/greeklife/ |title=USC Greek Life |publisher=Sa.sc.edu |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002201352/http://www.sa.sc.edu/greeklife/ |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The University of South Carolina also has four Musical Greek organizations; [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], [[Tau Beta Sigma]], [[Phi Mu Alpha]], and [[Sigma Alpha Iota]].

There are two service sororities, [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]] and [[Omega Phi Alpha]]

There are two service fraternities, [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and [[Epsilon Tau Pi]].

There are four co-ed professional fraternities on campus; [[Alpha Kappa Psi]], [[Delta Sigma Pi]], Sigma Omega Upsilon, and [[Theta Tau]].

The most prominent features of Greek life at the university are the large, mostly Greek Revival style mansions maintained by the national fraternities and sororities as chapter houses. Lining Lincoln Street, Gadsden Street, and Mark Buyck Way are the houses referred to as the Greek Village. All students who live in these residences are members of a sorority or fraternity, and while the properties are managed by the university, each house is privately owned by a fraternity or sorority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sa.sc.edu/greeklife/greek-housing/ |title=USC Greek Housing |publisher=Sa.sc.edu |date=October 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002201448/http://www.sa.sc.edu/greeklife/greek-housing/ |archive-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Lake Murray (South Carolina)|Lake Murray]] and the three rivers ([[Saluda River]], [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], and [[Congaree River]]) around [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]] offer students many recreational activities. The South Carolina coast—[[Charleston, SC]], [[Myrtle Beach]], [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head]]—is only a 1.5- to 2-hour drive for additional recreational activities.

==Athletics==
{{Main|South Carolina Gamecocks}}
[[File:Cocky.jpg|thumb|upright|The university's mascot, Cocky entertaining Gamecock fans at Gamecock Village prior to game vs. LousLaf in 2007.]]
[[File:Williams_Brice_Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|[[Williams-Brice Stadium]] (est. 1930, renovated 1996)]]
The university offers club, intramural, and varsity sports. Its 19 varsity sports teams compete in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (except for men's soccer which competes in [[Conference USA]] and women's sand volleyball which competes as an independent) and are known as the '''[[Gamecock]]s'''. The Gamecocks have won ten national team championships: [[2017 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|2017]] NCAA Championship in women's basketball; [[2010 College World Series|2010]] & [[2011 College World Series|2011]] NCAA Championships in baseball; [[NCAA Women's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships|2002]] NCAA Championship in women's outdoor track & field; 2005, 2007, and 2015 National Championships in [[National Collegiate Equestrian Association|women's equestrian]]; and 2005, 2006, and 2007 [[Hunt Seat]] National Championships in women's equestrian. Also, the men's and women's track & field teams have produced many NCAA individual champions, world championship medalists, and Olympic medalists. The baseball and basketball teams have also produced Olympic medalists. Other significant accomplishments include 2010 SEC Eastern Division Champions in football, NCAA runner-up four times in women's track & field (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), NCAA runner-up four times in baseball (1975, 1977, 2002, 2012), 1993 NCAA runner-up in men's soccer, 2005 & 2006 [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champions in men's basketball, and the 1980 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[George Rogers (American football)|George Rogers]].  See the [[South Carolina Gamecocks|Gamecocks article]] for more history and accomplishments.

===Fight song and alma mater===
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games are: ''[[The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way]]'', the University of South Carolina [[fight song]] and ''[[We Hail Thee Carolina]]'', the university's alma mater.

====Fight song====
The university's band director James Pritchard obtained a band arrangement of the [[Elmer Bernstein]]-penned song "Step to the Rear" from the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] ''[[How Now, Dow Jones]]'' in 1968 and the marching band played the song at the first game of the 1968 season.<ref name="USC Music Library">[http://www.sc.edu/library/music/CBC_contents.html The Carolina Bands Collection: Series I: Sheet Music (1914-2000s): 1/12 "Step to the Rear."] The Music Library at the University of South Carolina website. Retrieved December 1, 2009.</ref>  It caught the ear of Coach [[Paul Dietzel]] who contacted Pritchard about making it the official fight song of the university to replace the original "Carolina Fight Song" (or "Carolina Let Your Voices Ring," now called the "Old Fight Song").<ref name="USC Music Library"/>  Dietzel wrote the lyrics for the song, but asked that he remain anonymous because knowledge that the football coach wrote the lyrics might render it unacceptable to the basketball program.<ref name="USC Music Library"/>  The song was officially introduced on November 16, 1968, prior to the football game against [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] and has been the fight song since the Fall of 1969.<ref name="USC Music Library"/>

====Alma mater====
''[[The Daily Gamecock|The Gamecock]]'' reported in its March 1911 issue that very little progress had been made on the alma mater for the university despite a reward of $50 by the faculty.  English professor, George A. Wauchope, took it upon himself and wrote the lyrics for the alma mater in 1911 set to the tune ''Flow Gently, Sweet Afton'' by [[Robert Burns]].  Other songs were written and sung, but Wauchope's song proved to be the most popular and it was adopted by the university in 1912.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://registrar.sc.edu/html/graduation/tradition.stm#ALMAMATER |title=USC: Office of the University Registrar: A University Tradition |publisher=Registrar.sc.edu |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

The tradition has developed that alumni raise their right hand as though raising a cup for the phrase "Here's A Health, Carolina" as if offering a toast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sc.edu/usc/almamater.html |title=USC: Alma Mater |publisher=Sc.edu |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref>
