On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of [[Wuhan]], Hubei, China, informed the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] about a cluster of acute pneumonia cases with unknown origin in its province.

===January 2020: First confirmed cases===
On 31 January, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in [[Rome]]. A Chinese couple, originally from Wuhan, who had arrived in Italy on 23 January via [[Milan Malpensa Airport]], travelled from the airport to [[Verona]], then to Parma, arriving in Rome on 28 January. The next afternoon, they developed a cough, and by evening the man had a fever; the couple were taken to the [[Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases]] where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised.<ref name="prima">{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/cronache/20_gennaio_31/virus-primi-due-casi-italia-due-cinesi-marito-moglie-italia-dieci-giorni-e365df1c-43b3-11ea-bdc8-faf1f56f19b7.shtml|title=Prima a Milano, poi l'hotel a Roma: le tappe dei 7 giorni di viaggio della coppia contagiata|last=Frignani|first=Rinaldo|date=31 January 2020|website=Corriere della Sera|language=it|access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref><ref name="Corriere_20Jan"/> On 2 February, a team from the same institute composed of scientists Maria Rosaria Capobianchi, Francesca Colavita, and Concetta Castilletti isolated the genomic sequence of the virus and uploaded it to [[GenBank]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Armstrong |first1=Mark |title=Italian scientists isolate DNA sequence of coronavirus |url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/02/italian-scientists-isolate-dna-sequence-of-coronavirus |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=euronews |date=2 February 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://tg24.sky.it/cronaca/photogallery/2020/02/02/coronavirus-italia-spallanzani-roma.html |work=[[Sky TG24]]|accessdate=2 February 2020|language=it|title=Le tre ricercatrici che hanno isolato il Coronavirus allo Spallanzani di Roma.}}</ref>

Riots erupted on 23 October 2020 at night in Naples as people took to the street following the imposition of a curfew to reduce the spread of coronavirus. This came after Vincenzo De Luca, President of the Campania region, said that he was considering imposing a total lockdown, closing schools, businesses and leaving only essential services open, to prevent further spread of the virus. They were the first such demonstrations in Italy since the start of its coronavirus outbreak eight months ago.<ref>[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/riots-erupt-naples-lockdown-protest-22898101]</ref>

According to a few surveys, many Italians feel betrayed by the European Union's response to the crisis. This has led to an increase in [[euroscepticism]], with the number of Italians agreeing that EU membership is a disadvantage jumping from 47% in November 2018 to 67% in March 2020, according to a ''Tecnè'' survey. Former president of the European Commission [[Donald Tusk]] said that the risk for the European Union is greater than the [[European debt crisis]] of 2009, and that despite the fact that EU aid to Italy is greater than from other countries, its perception is crucial.<ref name=FT6April>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Miles |last2=Fleming |first2=Sam |last3=Chazan |first3=Guy |title=Coronavirus: Is Europe losing Italy? |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f21cf708-759e-11ea-ad98-044200cb277f |accessdate=6 April 2020 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=6 April 2020}}</ref>
