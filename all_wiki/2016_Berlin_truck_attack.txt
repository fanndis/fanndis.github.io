}}On 19 December 2016, a [[Vehicle-ramming attack|truck was deliberately driven into]] the [[Christmas market]] next to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at [[Breitscheidplatz]] in [[Berlin]], leaving 12 people dead and 56 others injured. One of the victims was the truck's original driver, Łukasz Urban, who was found shot dead in the passenger seat. The truck was eventually stopped by its [[Advanced Emergency Braking System|automatic brakes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/automatic-brakes-stopped-berlin-truck-during-christmas-market-attack/a-36936455|title=Automatic brakes stopped Berlin truck during Christmas market attack |date=2016-12-28|publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref> The perpetrator was Anis Amri, an unsuccessful [[asylum seeker]] from Tunisia. Four days after the attack, he was killed in a shootout with police near [[Milan]] in Italy. An initial suspect was arrested and later released due to lack of evidence.

The [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] gave Anis Amri instructions. ISIL released a video of Amri pledging allegiance to the terror group's leader, [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].<ref name="heavy-pledge" />

== Background ==
The Berlin attack took place during a time of [[Islamic terrorism in Europe|heightened Islamist terrorist activity in Europe]]. Several terrorist attacks in 2016, in Germany and in neighboring countries, have been linked to ISIS;<ref name="bbcbackground">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36882445 "Germany attacks: What is going on?"].

Retrieved 21 December 2016.</ref> some of them were similar to the truck attack on the Christmas market in Berlin (e.g. the [[2014 Nantes attack]] and the [[2016 Nice truck attack]]).

In March, 32 people were killed by [[2016 Brussels bombings|three coordinated suicide bombings]] in the Belgian capital [[Brussels]]. On 14 July, a Tunisian man [[2016 Nice truck attack|deliberately drove a truck into crowds]] celebrating [[Bastille Day]] in the French city of [[Nice]], killing 86 people. Four days later, an Afghan asylum seeker [[2016 Würzburg train attack|stabbed five people on a train]] near [[Würzburg]], Germany. On 24 July, a Syrian refugee [[2016 Ansbach bombing|blew himself up outside a music festival]] in the German city of [[Ansbach]], wounding fifteen people. Two days later Islamists [[2016 Normandy church attack|attacked Christians attending a church service]] in [[Normandy]], killing an elderly priest.<ref name="bbcbackground" /> On 26 November a 12-year-old Iraqi-German boy [[2016 Ludwigshafen bombing plot|planted a nail bomb]] at a Christmas market in [[Ludwigshafen]], but it failed to detonate.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38343124 "German-Iraqi boy, 12, 'tried to bomb Christmas market'"].

In an interview with ''The Guardian'' on 29 December, he narrated the incident of his arrest on 19 December. According to him, after leaving a friend's house and crossing a road in central Berlin on the evening, a car started following him after which he walked faster. When he realised that it was a police car, he stopped when they asked him to and showed his identification documents to them. He was allowed to go, but was called back seconds later and arrested. He claimed that he was tied up, blindfolded and also slapped by the police after refusing to undress for photographs. He said in the interview that he had gone into hiding, fearing for his life. ''The Guardian'' also said he had applied for asylum in Germany as a member of a [[Baloch nationalism|secular separatist movement]] in [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] [[Administrative units of Pakistan|province]] of Pakistan.<ref name=TGNB/>

Italy's [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Interior Ministry]] announced on 12 March that it had deported a 37-year-old Tunisian man whose telephone number was in Amri's contact list. The ministry stated that he had been in contact with the attacker and his number was also linked to a [[Facebook]] profile supporting jihadist ideology where he connected with supporters of ISIL. It added that he was living in [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] where he associated with fellow extremists who opposed a moderate imam at a local mosque.<ref name=DWdeports>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/italy-deports-tunisian-with-links-to-berlin-market-attacker-anis-amri/a-37910648|title=Italy deports Tunisian with links to Berlin market attacker Anis Amri|publisher=Deutsche-Welle|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=TheLocaldeports>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170313/italy-deports-terror-suspect-who-was-in-contact-with-berlin-attacker|title=Italy deports terror suspect linked to Berlin attacker|website=The Local|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref> In late-March, Turkey arrested more than 6 men allegedly linked to Amri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/europe/turkey-3-suspects-held-over-links-to-berlin-attack/775549|title=Turkey: 3 suspects held over links to Berlin attack|publisher=Anadolu Agency|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yenisafak.com/en/news/turkish-court-holds-2-suspects-in-berlin-truck-attack-2632070|title=Turkish court holds 2 suspects in Berlin truck attack|publisher=Yeni Şafak|date=20 March 2017|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Defective investigation and obstruction of justice ===

On 17 May 2017 the Interior Ministry of Berlin stated that already in November 2016 intelligence was given that Anis Amri was involved in criminal offenses concerning drug trafficking. On this basis authorities would have been able to apprehend Amri already at the time, however they did not. An investigation was launched trying to find out to what extent these informations were withheld by the [[Landeskriminalamt|State Criminal Police Office]] of Berlin after the attack happened.<ref>[https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/berliner-senat-beschuldigt-lka-der-strafvereitelung-im-fall-amri-15020618.html "Hat das LKA im Fall Amri Fehler verschleiert?  "], (german) retrieved 4 June 2017.</ref> Several days later, while the investigation for [[obstruction of justice]] was still going on, a speaker of the Interior Ministry said that manipulations of the file of Amri have been carried out by officers of the criminal investigation department after the attack.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2017-05/anschlag-berlin-anis-amri-lka-manipulation-akten "Weitere Manipulationen an Akte Amri"], (german) retrieved 4 June 2017.</ref> On 22 May 2017 a commission of inquiry was initiated starting in July. Meanwhile, a special prosecutor was appointed to the case.<ref>[https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article164825625/Im-Fall-Anis-Amri-ermittelt-nun-ein-Untersuchungsausschuss.html "Im Fall Anis Amri ermittelt nun ein Untersuchungsausschuss"], (german) retrieved 4 June 2017.</ref> In addition to the ongoing investigation concerning manipulations of the file and withholding of information, national TV reported on 1 June, that officers who were ordered by an [[Examining magistrate|investigating judge]] in Berlin to observe Amri until October 2016 for criminal offenses and possible terrorist links did not do so and instead included untrue records regarding observing actions in his file.<ref>[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/rbb-story-8459.html "LKA-Beamter täuschte Amri-Observation vor"], (german) retrieved 4 June 2017.</ref>

The German government reformed its security rules in response to the attack.

== Aftermath ==
{{See also|Islam in Germany#Salafism}}
In February 2017, the German Salafist mosque organisation ''Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein'' was banned by authorities. Amri was said to be among its visitors. In March 2017, the German Muslim community organisation ''Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim'' was also banned after investigators found that its members were preparing to travel to the conflict zone in Syria to fight for the Islamic State. According to the [[Federal Agency for Civic Education]], these examples show that Salafist mosques not only concern themselves with religious matters, but also prepare serious crimes and terrorist activities.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bpb.de/politik/extremismus/islamismus/268726/orte-der-islamistischen-radikalisierung|title=Orte der islamistischen Radikalisierung {{!}} bpb|last=Jaschke|first=Hans-Gerd|work=bpb.de|access-date=2018-12-01|language=de}}</ref>

He is said to have been using six different names under three different nationalities. Later in the day, a reward of up to €100,000 (£85,000) is offered by German authorities for information leading to Amri's arrest. The country's security is placed under fresh scrutiny following revelations that covert surveillance of the 24-year-old Amri had been discontinued after more than six months, due to police finding nothing to substantiate an initial tip-off.
