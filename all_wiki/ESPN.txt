'''ESPN''' (originally an initialism for '''Entertainment and Sports Programming Network''') is an American multinational [[basic cable]] [[sports channel]] owned by [[ESPN Inc.]], owned jointly by [[The Walt Disney Company]] (80%) and [[Hearst Communications]] (20%). The company was founded in 1979 by [[Bill Rasmussen]] along with his son [[Scott Rasmussen]] and Ed Egan.

ESPN broadcasts primarily from studio facilities located in [[Bristol, Connecticut]]. The network also operates offices in [[Miami]], [[New York City]], [[Seattle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], and [[Los Angeles]]. [[James Pitaro]] currently serves as chairman of ESPN, a position he has held since March 5, 2018, following the resignation of [[John Skipper]] on December 18, 2017.<ref>{{cite news |title=John Skipper is promoted to ESPN president |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/23/business/fi-ct-espn-20111123 |work=Los Angeles Times |last=James |first=Meg |date=November 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127191740/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/23/business/fi-ct-espn-20111123 |archivedate=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> While ESPN is one of the most successful sports networks, there has been much [[criticism of ESPN]].

==History==
{{main|History of ESPN}}
[[Bill Rasmussen]] conceived the concept of ESPN in late May 1978, after he was fired from his job with the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Hartford Whalers|New England Whalers]]. One of the first steps in Bill and his son [[Scott Rasmussen|Scott]]'s (who had also been let go by the Whalers) process was finding land to build the channel's broadcasting facilities. The Rasmussens first rented office space in [[Plainville, Connecticut]]. However, the plan to base ESPN there was put on hold because of a local ordinance prohibiting buildings from bearing rooftop [[satellite dish]]es. Available land area was quickly found in Bristol, Connecticut (where the channel remains headquartered to this day), with funding to buy the property provided by [[Getty Oil]], which purchased 85% of the company from Bill Rasmussen on February 22, 1979, in an attempt to diversify the company's holdings. This helped the credibility of the fledgling company, however there were still many doubters to the viability of their sports channel concept. Another event that helped build ESPN's credibility was securing an advertising agreement with [[Anheuser-Busch]] in the spring of 1979; the company invested $1 million to be the "exclusive beer advertised on the network."<ref name="A">{{cite news|last1=Hill|title=ABC buys stake in ESPN|work=The New York Times|date=January 3, 1984}}</ref>

[[File:ESPN's Old Logo.png|thumb|ESPN's first logo from 1979 to 1985]]
ESPN launched on September 7, 1979, beginning with the first telecast of what would become the channel's flagship program, ''[[SportsCenter]]''. Taped in front of a small live audience inside the Bristol studios, it was broadcast to 1.4 million cable subscribers throughout the United States.<ref name="A" />

ESPN's next big break came when the channel acquired the rights to broadcast coverage of the early rounds of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. It first aired the NCAA tournament in March 1980, creating the modern day television event known as "[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|March Madness]]." The channel's tournament coverage also launched the broadcasting career of [[Dick Vitale]], who at the time he joined ESPN, had just been fired as head coach of the [[Detroit Pistons]].

In April of that year, ESPN created another made-for-TV spectacle, when it began televising the [[National Football League Draft|NFL Draft]]. It provided complete coverage of the event that allowed rookie players from the college ranks to begin their professional careers in front of a national television audience in ways they were not able to previously.

The next major stepping stone for ESPN came over the course of a couple of months in 1984. During this time period, the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) purchased 100% of ESPN from the Rasmussens and Getty Oil.<ref name="A" /> Under Getty ownership, the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding, leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the [[National Hockey League]] (to [[USA Network]]) and [[NCAA Division I college football]] (to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]). For years, the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[Major League Baseball]] refused to consider cable as a means of broadcasting some of their games.<ref name="B">{{cite journal|last1=Wolverton|first1=Brad|last2=López-Rivera|first2=Marisa|last3=Killough|first3=Ashley C.|title=A Powerful League Piles Up Its Advantages.|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=September 4, 2009|volume=56|issue=2|pages=A1–A28|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Rise-of-the-SEC/48197/|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref> However, with the backing of ABC, ESPN's ability to compete for major sports contracts greatly increased, and gave it credibility within the sports broadcasting industry.

Later in 1984, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] could no longer monopolize the rights to negotiate the contracts for college football games, allowing each individual school to negotiate broadcast deals of their choice. ESPN took full advantage and began to broadcast a large number of NCAA football games, creating an opportunity for fans to be able to view multiple games each weekend (instead of just one), the same deal that the NCAA had previously negotiated with TBS.<ref name="B" /> ESPN's breakthrough moment occurred in 1987, when it secured a contract with the NFL to broadcast eight games during [[1987 NFL season|that year's regular season]] – all of which aired on Sunday nights, marking the first broadcasts of Sunday NFL primetime games. ESPN's ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' games would become the highest-rated NFL telecasts for the next 17 years (before losing the rights to [[NBC]] in 2006).<ref name="C">{{cite news|last1=Goodwin|first1=Michael|title=ESPN Ends season in middle of pack|work=The New York Times|date=October 28, 1987}}</ref> The channel's decision to broadcast NFL games on Sunday evenings actually resulted in a decline in viewership for the daytime games shown on the major broadcast networks, marking the first time that ESPN had been a legitimate competitor to NBC and CBS, which had long dominated the sports television market.

In 1992, ESPN launched [[ESPN Radio]], a national [[sports talk radio]] network providing analysis and commentary programs (including shows such as ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' and ''[[The Herd with Colin Cowherd|The Herd]]'') as well as audio play-by-play of sporting events (including some simulcasted with the ESPN television channel).<ref name="A" />

On October 10, 1993, [[ESPN2]] – a secondary channel that originally was programmed with a separate lineup of niche sports popular with males 18–49 years old (with [[snowboarding]] and the [[World Series of Poker]] as its headliners) as well as serving as an overflow channel for ESPN – launched on cable systems reaching to 10 million subscribers.<ref name="A" /> It became the fastest growing cable channel in the U.S. during the 1990s, eventually expanding its national reach to 75 million subscribers.<ref name="A" />

Ownership of ABC, and in effect control of ESPN, was acquired by [[Capital Cities Communications]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/03/19/capital-cities-communications-to-buy-abc-for-35-billion/7e2d4fa9-144b-4704-8d2e-498bc5496057/|title=Capital Cities Communications To Buy ABC for $3.5 Billion|first=David A.|last=Vise|date=March 19, 1985|publisher=|access-date=December 23, 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref> ESPN's parent company renamed themselves as Capital Cities/ABC Inc.

On April 26, 2017, approximately 100 ESPN employees were notified that their positions with the sports network had been terminated, among them athletes-turned-analysts [[Trent Dilfer]] and [[Danny Kanell]], and noted journalists like [[NFL]] beat reporter [[Ed Werder]] and [[Major League Baseball]] expert [[Jayson Stark]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/tech-media/2017/04/26/espn-layoffs-firings-list-details|title=ESPN layoffs: Firings list, details on state at network &#124; SI.com|date=April 26, 2017|publisher=Time Inc.|author=Richard Deitsch|periodical=Sports Illustrated|access-date=October 28, 2017}}</ref> The layoffs came as ESPN continued to shed viewers, more than 10 million over a period of several years, while paying big money for the broadcast rights to such properties as the NFL, [[NBA]] and [[College Football Playoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/sports/espn-layoffs.html?_r=0|title=A Struggling ESPN Lays Off Many On-Air Personalities|date=April 26, 2017|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=Joe Drape and Brooks Barnes|periodical=The New York Times|access-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> Further cost-cutting measures taken include moving the studio operations of ESPNU to Bristol from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article146919714.html|title=ESPN layoffs hit Charlotte offices|date=April 26, 2017|publisher=The McClatchy Company|author=Katherine Peralta|periodical=The Charlotte Observer|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> reducing its longtime MLB studio show ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' to Sundays as a lead-in to the [[Sunday Night Baseball|primetime game]] and adding the [[MLB Network]]-produced ''[[Intentional Talk]]'' to [[ESPN2]]'s daily lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/espn-layoffs-baseball-tonight-intentional-talk.html|title=ESPN cutting Baseball Tonight to Sundays only, partnering with MLB Network on Intentional Talk|date=April 27, 2017|publisher=Awful Announcing|author=Ian Casselberry|periodical=Awful Announcing|access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

ESPN, as with Disney/ABC's other television networks, broadcasts HD programming in the [[720p]] resolution format; this is due to the fact that ABC executives had proposed a [[progressive scan]] signal that resolves fluid and high-speed motion in sports better, particularly during slow-motion replays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hd.espn.com/hd/pdfs/playbook.pdf|title=The HD Experience|publisher=ESPN|archivedate=March 9, 2008|accessdate=July 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309195610/http://hd.espn.com/hd/pdfs/playbook.pdf}}</ref> The network's Digital Center itself natively holds [[4K resolution|2160p]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|UHD/4K]] operations and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvtechnology.com/news/0002/espn-opens-new-digital-center/270611|title=ESPN Opens New Digital Center|last=Butts|first=Tom|date=May 28, 2014|work=TV Technology|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3060717/the-technology-behind-espns-digital-transformation|title=The Technology Behind ESPN'S Digital Transformation|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=June 13, 2016|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}</ref> In 2011, ESPNHD began to downplay its distinct promotional logo in preparation for the conversion of its standard definition feed from a [[4:3]] full-screen to a letterboxed format (via the application of the [[Active Format Description|AFD]] #10 display flag), which occurred on June 1 of that year.

==In popular culture==
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}
ESPN has been a part of [[pop culture|popular culture]] since its inception. Many movies with a general sports theme will include ESPN announcers and programming into their storylines.

Many jokes have been made by comedians about fake obscure sports that are shown on ESPN. [[Dennis Miller]] mentioned watching "[[sumo]] [[rodeo]]," while [[George Carlin]] stated that ESPN showed "Australian [[Human penis|dick]] [[wrestling]]." One of several ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketches poking fun at the network features a fictional ESPN2 program called ''Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly'', which includes a fake advertisement for "Senior Women's Beach Lacrosse." ''SNL'' also parodies [[ESPN Classic]] with fake archived obscure women's sports event telecasts from the 1980s (such as bowling, [[Powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[curling]]), with announcers who know nothing about the sport, and instead focus on the sponsors, which were always for feminine hygiene products. In the early years of ESPN, ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' even featured a "Top Ten List" segment poking fun at some of the obscure sports seen on ESPN at the time. One of the more memorable sports on the list was "Amish Rake Fighting." A recurring skit on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' named ''[[List of sketches from Late Night with Jimmy Fallon#Sports Freak-Out!|Sports Freak-Out!]]'' is a parody of ''SportsCenter''{{'}}s overexcited anchors.

The 2004 comedy film ''[[DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story]]'' gently lampoons the channel's multiple outlets by referencing the fictional ESPN8, "The Ocho",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,613698,00.html |title=Movie Preview: Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story |accessdate=July 30, 2008 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 21, 2004}}</ref> a reference to a nickname formerly used by ESPN2, "the Deuce". ESPNU was rebranded ESPN8 The Ocho on August 8, 2017, airing obscure competitions such as [[disc golf]], [[kabaddi]], [[arm wrestling]] and [[roller derby]].<ref>[http://dailyhive.com/calgary/espn-8-the-ocho-august-8-2017 Life imitates art: ESPN 8 'The Ocho' debuts August 8] - Rob Williams, Daily Hive, August 4, 2017</ref> On August 8, 2018, the special returned on ESPN2, featuring competitions such as [[jousting]], [[lightsaber]] fighting, [[ultimate frisbee]], [[spikeball]], [[lawn mower racing]], [[roller derby]] and [[chess boxing]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/08/07/espn2-is-now-espn-the-ocho-heres-whats-on-tv/?noredirect=on ESPN2 is now ESPN ‘The Ocho.’ Here’s what’s on TV.] - Jacob Bogage, August 8, 2018</ref>

Japanese videogame publisher Konami launched the ''[[ESPN MLS GameNight]]'' and ''[[ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002]]'' soccer games. In the early 1990s, [[Electronic Arts]] games featured a logo for a fictional sports TV network, EASN (Electronic Arts Sports Network); this was soon changed to [[EA Sports]] after ESPN requested that the company stop using the similar name. In 2005, both companies signed a 15-year partnership, where the ESPN brand and personalities are integrated into EA Sports video games. [[Grid 2]] also features prominent ESPN branding.<ref>[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-28-grid-2-review Grid 2 review] - Martin Robinson, Eurogamer, May 28, 2013</ref>

An occasional joke used in comedic television and film involves people getting ESP (the common abbreviation for [[extrasensory perception]], that was coincidentally the [[working title|working abbreviation]] for the channel prior to its launch) confused with ESPN, often including someone saying a sentence along the lines of "I know these kinds of things, I've got ESPN." There are also at least 22 children that are named after the network.<ref name="names">{{cite news |url= https://www.espn.com/espn/news/story?id=1829996 |publisher=ESPN |title=Texas toddler at least third named ESPN |date=June 16, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-02-07-hiestand-lampley_x.htm |title=Lampley nearing most-called Olympics |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |last=Hiestand |first=Michael |date=February 7, 2006 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |quote=ESPN says it's heard of at least 22 babies named ESPN}}</ref>

In 2015, ESPN2 broadcast Heroes of the Dorm, the grand finals of the ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' collegiate tournament. The first-place team from the University of California, Berkeley received tuition for each of the teams players, paid for by [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] and [[Tespa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2015/03/06/heroes-of-the-storm-tournament/24493989/|title=Blizzard unveils 'Heroes of the Storm' tournament|last=Molina|first=Brett|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> The top four teams won gaming equipment and new computers. This was the first time an eSport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network.

On November 19, 2017, in Season 29, episode 7 of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', entitled "[[Singin' in the Lane]]", the bowling tournament is being streamed on ESPN8, which is a parody of ESPN8: The Ocho.
