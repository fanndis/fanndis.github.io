In March, 1864, [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]], former [[List of Governors of Colorado#Governors of the Territory of Colorado|Governor]] of the [[Colorado Territory]], appointee of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], founded the '''Colorado Seminary'''<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YW5_CQAAQBAJ&q=university+denver+founded+march+4+1864+jjohn+evans&pg=PT12 |title = A Brief History of South Denver & University Park|isbn = 9781614238287|last1 = Fisher|first1 = Steve|date = April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_EEDAAAAYAAJ&q=colorado+seminary+march+4+1864+jjohn+evans&pg=PA388 |title = Echoes from Peak and Plain, Or, Tales of Life, War, Travel and Colorado Methodism|last1 = Beardsley|first1 = Isaac Haight|year = 1898}}</ref><ref name="HistDenver">{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scVEAQAAMAAJ&q=colorado+seminary+march+4+1864+jjohn+evans&pg=PA758 |title = History of Denver: With Outlines of the Earlier History of the Rocky Mountain Country|last1 = Smiley|first1 = Jerome Constant|year = 1901}}</ref> in the newly created (1858) city of Denver, which was then a mining camp. At its founding the seminary was non-sectarian  and operated by [[Methodist Episcopal]] church. It struggled in the early years of its existence.<ref name="HistDenver"/> In 1880 it was renamed the University of Denver. Although doing business as the University of Denver, DU is still legally named Colorado Seminary.<ref>[http://www.du.edu/controller/media/documents/w92014.pdf Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification]. University of Denver. Retrieved on November 26, 2016.</ref> The first buildings of the university were located in downtown [[Denver]] in the 1860s and 1870s, but concerns that Denver's rough-and-tumble frontier town atmosphere was not conducive to education prompted a relocation to the current campus, built on the donated land of potato farmer Rufus Clark, some seven miles (11&nbsp;km) south of the downtown core. The university grew and prospered alongside the city's growth, appealing primarily to a regional student body prior to World War II.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} After the war, the large surge in [[GI bill]] students pushed DU's enrollment to over 13,000 students, the largest the university has ever been, and helped to spread the university's reputation to a national audience.

==Campus==
[[Image:University of Denver campus pics 015.jpg|thumb|University Hall, built in 1890]] 
The heart of the campus has a number of historic buildings. The longest-standing building is University Hall, which has served DU since 1890, and was built in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style. The cornerstone to this building is exactly one mile above sea level. Just a few blocks off campus sits the historic [[Chamberlin Observatory]], opened in 1894. Still a fully operational observatory, it is open to the public twice a week as well as one Saturday a month.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denverastro.org/chamberlin.html |title=The University of Denver's Historic Chamberlin Observatory |publisher=Denver Astronomical Society |access-date=August 27, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218075943/http://www.denverastro.org/chamberlin.html |archive-date=February 18, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The central campus area also includes [[Evans Memorial Chapel]], an 1870s-vintage small church which was once located in downtown Denver, and was relocated to the DU campus in the early 1960s. Buchtel Tower (1913) is all that remains of the former Buchtel Chapel, which burned in 1983.

[[Image:University of Denver campus pics 044.jpg|left|thumb|Margery Reed Hall]]
The administrative offices are located in the Mary Reed Building, a former library built in 1932 in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] style.  Margery Reed Hall (named for the daughter of Mary Reed) was also built in the collegiate gothic style in 1929.  Margery Reed Hall has recently{{when|date=February 2014}} been designated to house the Undergraduate Program for the Daniels College of Business; an $8 million overhaul and renovation was just completed early 2014. The update for the building was to include more classroom space, a larger hall to host guest speakers, as well as mechanical and technical improvements.

New (2018) construction on campus includes the rebuilding of the current Driscoll Center Student Union into a new "Community Commons," a new residence hall and a new, larger alumni/career center to replace the Leo Block Alumni Center.  These project are slated for completion in the early 2020s.

In 2005 the Graduate School of Social Work completed the renovation and significant expansion of its building, renamed Craig Hall.

In autumn 2003, DU opened a new $63.5 million facility for its College of Law, what was later named the "Sturm College of Law." The building includes a three-[[Storey|story]] library with personal computers accessible to students. Donald and Susan Sturm, owners of Denver-based American National Bank, had given $20 million to the [[University of Denver College of Law]]. The gift is the largest single donation in the 112-year history of the law school and among the largest gifts ever to the university.

The Daniels College of Business was completed in September 1999 at the cost of $25 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradprofiles.com/u-denver-daniels.html|title=University of Denver Daniels School of Business Denver, Colorado|work=Grad Profiles|access-date=March 30, 2019}}</ref> The business school has been nationally recognized by organizations such as ''Forbes'' magazine, ''Business Week'', and the ''Wall Street Journal'' where it is ranked second in the nation for producing students with high ethical standards.<ref>Daniels College of Business (September 17, 2007). http://www.daniels.du.edu/news-announcements-WSJ.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126093909/http://daniels.du.edu/news-announcements-WSJ.aspx |date=November 26, 2007 }}</ref>

[[F.W. Olin Hall]] was built in 1997 to house Biological and Natural Sciences.  Olin Hall promotes an exceptional collaborative learning and study space for DU science students.

Additionally, the university opened the $70 million [[Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts]], which houses the acclaimed Lamont School of Music. The center includes June Swaner Gates Concert Hall, a, four-level opera house seating just under 1,000, the Frederic C. Hamilton Family Recital Hall, a 222-seat recital hall with the largest (2,850 pipes) "tracker" organ in the region, and the Elizabeth Ericksen Byron Theatre, a flexible theatre space seating up to 350. The Newman Center serves as home to many professional performing arts groups from the Denver region as well as the University's ''Newman Center Presents'' multi-disciplinary performing arts series.

[[Image:DU campus picss 005.jpg|thumb|Fritz Knoebel School of Hospitality Management]]
In the last two years, DU has also built and opened a new building for the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Management (Fritz Knoebel School of Hospitality Management). Inside the building there are numerous classrooms, a large wine cellar, meeting rooms, and an all-purpose dining room that hosts numerous city and university events, weddings, and formal parties. The school helps DU rank near the top of all hotel schools in the United States. The program had its first graduating class in 1946.

The university has the 11th highest telescope in the world located at 14,148 feet near the summit of [[Mount Evans]] called the [[Meyer-Womble Observatory]]. This telescope is most commonly used by the university's Natural Science and Mathematics Department, and more specifically the Department of Physics and Astronomy at DU.

[[Nagel Hall|Nagel Residence Hall]] was completed in the Fall of 2008 to house upperclassman and is one of the most unusual buildings on campus, offering a wide collection of art throughout the building donated by the Nagel family. The building is certified Gold in LEED standards to be environmentally friendly and more sustainable. As well as Nagel, Nelson Hall is another LEED residence hall that was built in the last eight years.

DU completed the first ever (Peter S. Barton) lacrosse-only stadium that was specifically designed for the sport in 2005, as well as  [[University of Denver Soccer Stadium|Ciber Field soccer stadium]] (2010) on the northern end of campus, adjoining the Nagel studio space for the School of Art, as well as the Pat Bowlen varsity sports weight training facility underneath the stands.

The environmentally friendly $25 million Morgridge College of Education was opened in June 2010.

At the beginning of the summer of 2011, the 41-year-old Penrose Library closed for a $32 million renovation, and reopened in the Spring of 2013 as the Anderson Academic Commons, a 21st-century high-tech collaboration and study space - one of the most advanced and technologically capable libraries among universities throughout the country.

The university has five residence halls, Johnson McFarlane Hall (JMac), Centennial Halls, Centennial Towers, Nelson Hall and Nagel Hall. Johnson McFarlane Hall was energy star certified in September 2011 as one of the most energy efficient buildings on campus,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.du.edu/housing/sustainability/facilities/jmac.html|title=Johnson-McFarlane ENERGY STAR Certification - University of Denver|website=www.du.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://magazine.du.edu/campus-community/j-mac-residence-hall-earns-energy-star-certification/|title=J-Mac residence hall earns Energy Star certification|first1=Sydney says|last1=October 18|first2=2011 at 10:45|last2=Am|date=October 18, 2011|website=University of Denver Magazine}}</ref> and is the oldest co-ed dorm in the western United States.

The art and music scene of DU is on the rise due to the recent construction of the [[Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts]]. This building houses the Lamont School of Music, the [[University of Denver Department of Theater]], and the University's ''Newman Center Presents'' performing arts series. The Lamont School of Music is a structured conservatory setting which allows students to focus on their talents in a competitive manner. The theatre department, reestablished in 1985, is being transformed into a nationally competitive theatre school.

With the recent addition of more faculty members and renovation beginning on Margery Reed Hall, the Theatre Department has become a magnet for theatre students in the region. Much of the faculty have many professional connections with local theatre companies (Curious, DCPA), as well as contacts in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other regions, providing students with many available options for internships and quick job placement.

The university has established the Emergent Digital Practices program, focusing on art, design, media, culture, and technology studies in a hands-on, collaborative environment.

=== Study abroad program ===
In the 2017–18 academic year, DU had a 77.5 percent of participation leading them to be third in national rank. The director of the Office of International Education, Denise Cop, acknowledged that there is an increase in cultural self-awareness and knowledge of cultural worldview frameworks of the students that go study abroad. The top destinations of DU students are United Kingdom, Spain and Italy, however many students go to universities in Australia, New Zealand and Scotland. DU's Office of International Education also offers to their students support and advice for all undergraduate students who want to study abroad.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.du.edu/du-recognized-for-study-abroad-program/|title=DU Recognized for Study Abroad Program|last=Stone|first=Jon|date=November 13, 2017|work=DU.edu|access-date=November 16, 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

==Athletics==
{{Main|Denver Pioneers}}
DU's [[Sports|athletic]] teams are known as the Denver [[Settler|Pioneers]] since 1925. The school has been fielding athletic teams since 1867, winning 33 NCAA Division One titles since 1949—among the top 15 of all schools. Denver is best known as a major power in winter sports, in particular, skiing and ice hockey. DU has won 24 NCAA national team skiing championships (more than any other school). Ice hockey is DU's flagship spectator sport, with eight NCAA titles (tied for second among all schools), most recently in 2017 and including back-to-back crowns in 2004 and 2005.  The program has produced 75 NHL players and regularly sells out the 6,000 seat [[Magness Arena]] on campus, the showpiece of the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness.

The Pioneers' major conference affiliations changed in July 2013. Denver moved its primary affiliation from the [[Western Athletic Conference]] to [[The Summit League]], hockey moved from the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] to the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]], and men's lacrosse moved from the [[ECAC Lacrosse League]] to the [[Big East Conference]]. In addition, the women's gymnastics team joined the newly formed [[Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference]] in 2013 and later moved to the [[Big 12 Conference]] in July 2015.

The Pioneers won the national championship in men's lacrosse in 2015, beating Maryland, 10–5. They were the first Division I men's team west of the Appalachians to win a men's lacrosse NCAA national championship. The 2016 men's soccer team advanced to the [[NCAA College Cup]].

The school has identified itself as the Pioneers since 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.du.edu/about/overview|title=About DU|website=DU.edu|access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2019}} Previous mascots were Pioneer Pete (1920s to 1968), [[Denver Boone]] (1968 to 1998), and Ruckus the red-tailed hawk (1998 to 2007). A 2013 task force generated three new mascot options, but none of them carried enough votes from the University community to merit selection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/20/daniel-boone-like-mascot-for-denver-college-deemed-too-offense-by-administration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821024914/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/20/daniel-boone-like-mascot-for-denver-college-deemed-too-offense-by-administration/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 21, 2013|title=Daniel Boone-like mascot for Denver college deemed offensive by administration|last=Chiaramonte|first=Perry|date=August 20, 2013|website=[[FOX News]]|access-date=August 21, 2013}} </ref>
