'''Safran S.A.''' is a [[France|French]] [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[aircraft engine]], [[rocket engine]], [[aerospace]]-component and defense company. It was formed by a merger between the aircraft and rocket engine manufacturer and aerospace component manufacturer group [[SNECMA]] and the security company [[SAGEM]] in 2005. In 2018 Safran took control of [[Zodiac Aerospace]], significantly expanding its aircraft equipment activities. Its headquarters are located in [[Paris]]. 
Employing over 95,000 people and generating 24.64 billion euros in sales in 2019, Safran operates in the [[aircraft propulsion]] and [[aircraft equipment|equipment]], [[Rocket engine|space]] and [[Defence industry|defense market]]s. The company is listed on the [[Euronext]] stock exchange and is part of the [[CAC 40]] and [[Euro Stoxx 50]] indices.<ref name=4jun2018PR/>

==Name==
The name Safran was chosen from 4,250 suggestions, including 1,750 proposed by employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/2005/03/sagem-et-snecma-donnent-naissance-a-safran-600957|title=Sagem et Snecma donnent naissance à " Safran "|date=2005-03-21|website=Les Echos|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/release/54524/sagem,-snecma-merge-into-safran-(mar.-21).html|title=Snecma and Sagem Merge, Changing Name to Safran|website=www.defense-aerospace.com|access-date=2019-08-27}}</ref> As a [[holding company]] for many subsidiaries, the name was deemed suitable for the suggestion of direction, movement, and strategy. Safran translates as [[rudder]] blade and as [[saffron]], which the company highlights as one of the catalysts for early international trade.<ref name=AW170120/>

==History==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

===Origins===
In 1905 Louis Seguin created the company [[Gnome Engine Company|Gnome]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.safran-group.com/timeline|title=Safran Timeline|website=Safran|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Production of the first [[rotary engine]] for airplanes, the Gnome Omega, started in 1909.<ref name=":0" /> This company merged with the [[Le Rhône]], a company created in 1912 by Louis Verdet, to form the [[Gnome et Rhône]] engine company.<ref name=":0" /> Gnome & Rhône was [[nationalized]] in 1945, creating [[Snecma]].<ref name=":0" /> In 2000, this company gave its name to the “Snecma Group”, and carried out a number of acquisitions to form a larger group with an array of complementary businesses.<ref name=":0" />

[[Sagem]] (Société d’Applications Générales de l’Electricité et de la Mécanique) was created in 1925 by Marcel Môme.<ref name=":0" /> In 1939, Sagem entered the telephone and transmissions market by taking control of Société anonyme des télécommunications (SAT).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It acquired Société de Fabrication d’Instruments de Mesure (Sfim), a measurement instrument specialist, in 1999.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  However, by 2008 Sagem Mobile and Sagem Communications had been sold. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}  Sagem Mobile became [[Sagem Wireless]] in January 2009.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

=== Safran Group ===
The Safran Group was created on May 11, 2005, with the merger of [[Snecma]] and [[Sagem]] SA.<ref name=":0" />

In June 2014, Arianespace CEO [[Stephane Israel]] announced that European efforts to remain [[market competition|competitive]] in response to [[SpaceX]]'s recent success have begun in earnest.  This included the creation of a new [[joint venture]] company from [[Arianespace]]'s two largest [[mixed economy|shareholders]]:  the launch-vehicle producer [[Airbus]] and engine-producer Safran.<ref name=pdo20140618>{{cite news |last1=Abbugao|first1=Martin |title=European satellite chief says industry faces challenges |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-06-european-satellite-chief-industry.html |access-date=2014-06-19 |publisher=Phys.org |date=2014-06-18 }}</ref>

By May 2015, Safran had created with Airbus Group a launcher joint venture called [[Airbus Safran Launchers]].<ref name=sn20150529>

In January 2017, Safran initiated a [[takeover]] of the aircraft interior supplier [[Zodiac Aerospace]] to create the third largest aerospace supplier with $22.5 billion revenue, behind [[United Technologies]] with $28.2 billion and [[GE Aviation]] with $24.7 billion; the new group will be 92,000-employee strong, with 48% of its business in aircraft systems and equipment, from landing gears to seats, 46% in propulsion and 6% in defense.<ref name=AW170120>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/tier-1-consolidation-continues-safran-takes-over-zodiac |title= Tier 1 Consolidation Continues As Safran Takes Over Zodiac |date= Jan 20, 2017 |author= Thierry Dubois and Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>
