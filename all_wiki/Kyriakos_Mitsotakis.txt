==Controversy==
=== Siemens scandal allegations ===
In 2007, it was reported that Mitsotakis was involved in the [[Siemens Greek bribery scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c%3D110%2Cid%3D74151416%2C43446968%2C15515192%2C21432248%2C79944568%2C37645624%2C44118392 |title=Ελευθεροτυπία - Τιμολόγια για τρεις Μητσοτάκηδες στη "Ζίμενς" |access-date=2017-05-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225084100/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c%3D110%2Cid%3D74151416%2C43446968%2C15515192%2C21432248%2C79944568%2C37645624%2C44118392 |archive-date=February 25, 2011 }}</ref> However, Mitsotakis has repeatedly denied any involvement and no indication of guilt has so far been proven. The Siemens trial, in which Mitsotakis is not involved, is still pending.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naftemporiki.gr/story/1174442/ypothesi-siemens-stis-24-febrouariou-arxizei-i-diki|title=Υπόθεση Siemens: Στις 24 Φεβρουαρίου αρχίζει η δίκη &#124; naftemporiki.gr|date=November 22, 2016|website=www.naftemporiki.gr}}</ref>

Electronic office equipment, call centers, air conditioners etc. worth {{circa|€130,000}} were received in the period preceding the 2007 elections (June to September 2007) by Mitsotakis from Siemens and two of its subsidiaries. The invoices indicate payment period of up to 60 days, however no part of the amount was paid until February 2008, when part of it was paid, just when the Siemens case was reopened by the courts, and an amount of €43,850 was paid by check from Mr. Mitsotakis on Monday June 2. Earlier (on 29 May) testimonies had been made about "donations and grants by Siemens to politicians" and on 30 May 2008 the prosecutor's investigation took place at the company's offices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/9988/emplokh-kyr-mhtsotakh-sto-skandalo-siemens/|title=στο σκάνδαλο SIEMENS|date=2015-12-23|website=protothema.gr|language=el|access-date=2008-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kathimerini.gr/324733/article/epikairothta/politikh/106-thlefwnikes-syskeyes-gia-ena-grafeio|title=107 τηλεφωνικές συσκευές για ένα γραφείο|date=2015-12-23|website=kathimerini.gr|language=el|access-date=2008-06-07}}</ref>
