The '''Flint water crisis''' was a public [[health crisis]] that started in 2014,<ref name=startdate/> after the [[drinking water]] source for the city of [[Flint, Michigan]], was contaminated. In April 2014, Flint changed its water source from treated [[Detroit Water and Sewerage Department]] water (sourced from [[Lake Huron]] and the [[Detroit River]]) to the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]]. Officials failed to apply [[corrosion inhibitor]]s to the water. As a result, [[lead]] from aging [[Piping|pipes]] [[leaching (chemistry)|leached]] into the water supply, leading to extremely elevated levels of the [[Lead poisoning|heavy metal neurotoxin]] and exposing over 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Meltdown: Why Our Systems Fail and What We Can Do About It |last1=Clearfield |first1=Chris |last2=Tilcsik |first2=András |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2018 |isbn=978-0-7352-2263-2 |location=New York |pages=121–128}}</ref> A pair of scientific studies proved that lead contamination was present in the water supply.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis"/><ref name=vatech/> The city switched back to the Detroit water system on October 16, 2015.<ref name=switchback/> It later signed a 30-year contract with the new [[Great Lakes Water Authority]] (GLWA) on November 22, 2017.<ref name=glwa30/>

On January 5, 2016, Michigan Governor [[Rick Snyder]] declared a state of emergency in [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee County]], of which Flint is the major population center.

==Background==
Some water service lines in Flint were installed between 1901 and 1920.<ref name=gcsd/> As with many other municipalities at the time, all of the service lines from the [[Cast iron pipe|cast iron]] [[Water supply network|water mains]] to end users' homes were constructed of lead, because it was relatively inexpensive and easy to work. Lead from the pipes can leach into the water, especially if certain contaminants are present. However, the water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been [[water treatment|treated]] well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf |title=The City of Flint Police Department Crime Reduction Strategy |last1=Snyder |first1=Richard D. |last2=Calley |first2=Brian |author-link1=Rick Snyder |author-link2=Brian Calley |date=January 20, 2016 |website=Flint Water Study |access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> There are an estimated 43,000 service lines in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized steel lines, and 9,000 unknown service lines.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/05/city_ready_to_accept_proposals.html |title=City officials set to accept proposals to replace lead lines in Flint |first=Jiquanda |last=Johnson |date=May 31, 2016 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref>

Lead exposure across the U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no blood-lead level is considered completely safe. Children under age five, and especially infants and unborn children, bear the greatest risk of deleterious and irreversible health outcomes.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis" /> From 2012 to 2016, the CDC set a "reference level" of 5 micrograms per deciliter (µg/dL), in order to target for case management the 2.5% of young American children with the highest blood-lead levels. At 45&nbsp;µg/dL, [[chelation therapy]] is considered.<ref>{{cite web |title=Update on Blood Lead Levels in Children |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref> Among the many ways lead can enter a modern American's bloodstream is through lead plumbing. Acidic water makes it easier for the lead found in pipes, leaded solder, and brass faucets to dissolve and to enter a home's drinking water. Therefore, public water treatment systems are legally required to use control measures to make water less acidic. Plumbing that contains lead is often found in buildings constructed in the 1980s and earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp13.pdf |title=ATSDR Toxicological Profile for Lead |date=August 2007 |website=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref>

On April 1, 2013, DWSD demanded that the state deny Flint's request, as it would start a [[Water conflict|water war]], which would essentially hurt DWSD. This press release also provided an option for Flint: the sale of raw, untreated water. [[Drain commissioner|Drain Commissioner]] Wright of Genesee County accused the DWSD of media negotiation and then replied, "It would be unprecedented for the state to force one community to enter into an agreement with another, simply to artificially help one community at the other's expense ... this is exactly what the [Detroit Water and Sewerage Department] is arguing ..."<ref>{{cite news |last=Fonger |first=Ron |date=April 2, 2013 |title=Detroit 'water war' claims 'wholly without merit,' Genesee County drain commissioner says |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/04/genesee_county_drain_commissio_28.html |newspaper=The Flint Journal |access-date=January 11, 2016}}</ref>

==Early water contamination==
After the permanent switch to the Flint River, city residents began complaining about the color, taste, and odor of their water. In August and September 2014, city officials detected levels of [[coliform bacteria]], so residents were advised to boil their water. MDEQ determined that cold weather, aging pipes, and a population decline were the cause of these bacteria. According to Stephen Busch, an MDEQ district supervisor, the city took appropriate measures to limit a recurrence. General Motors (GM) made the first complaint about the corrosivity of the water. GM stopped using Flint water in October 2014, after reporting that the water was corroding car parts.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/21/us/flint-lead-water-timeline.html |title=Events That Led to Flint's Water Crisis |date=January 21, 2016 |work=The New York Times |last1=Lin |first1=Jeremy C.F. |last2=Rutter |first2=Jean |last3=Park |first3=Haeyoun |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> General Motors requested to switch back to the DWSD water source, which was later approved by city officials.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pulido |first=Laura |date=July 2, 2016 |title=Flint, Environmental Racism, and Racial Capitalism |journal=[[Capitalism Nature Socialism]] |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=1–16 |doi=10.1080/10455752.2016.1213013 |issn=1045-5752 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Prior to August 2014, additional chlorine had been added to eliminate bacteria from the Flint River. This is likely the cause of a spike in [[trihalomethane]]s, unsafe chlorine byproducts, in one of eight water locations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_water_has_high_disinfect.html |title=City warns of potential health risks after Flint water tests revealed too much disinfection byproduct |date=January 2, 2015 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |last1=Fonger |first1=Ron |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref> Long-term exposure to these chemicals has been linked to cancer and other diseases.

=== Return to Detroit water ===
In March 2015, Flint voted to switch back to the DWSD. This vote was motivated by residential complaints and recommendations from [[Veolia]] North America to prevent the city from further violating the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. Ambrose disagreed with the reintroduction of the Detroit water source. Ambrose argued, "Flint water today is safe by all Environmental Protection Agency and Michigan Department of Environmental Quality standards, and the city is working daily to improve its quality."<ref name=fjf10/> In August 2015, it was found that local organizations observed that high concentrations of chloride caused the water to be orange and that the water contained high levels of lead.

=== Hurley Medical Center study I (2015) ===
[[File:Dr. Hanna Attisha smiling in lab coat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mona Hanna-Attisha]] led the first Hurley Medical Center lead poisoning study.]]
On September 24, 2015, [[Hurley Medical Center]] in Flint released a study led by [[Mona Hanna-Attisha]], the program director for pediatric residency at Hurley Children's Hospital, confirming that the proportion of infants and children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had nearly doubled since the city switched from the Detroit water system to using the Flint River as its water source.<ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/><ref name=waterwashpost/> Using hospital records, Hanna-Attisha found that a steep rise in blood-lead levels corresponded to the city's switch in water sources.<ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/> The study was initially dismissed by MDEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel, who repeated a familiar refrain: "Repeated testing indicated the water tested within acceptable levels."<ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/> Later, Wurfel apologized to Hanna-Attisha.<ref name="ErbHanna-Attisha"/> The team's study appears in the February 2016 issue of ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]''.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis">{{Cite journal |title=Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Children Associated With the Flint Drinking Water Crisis: A Spatial Analysis of Risk and Public Health Response |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |date=December 21, 2015 |issn=0090-0036 |pages=283–290 |volume=106 |issue=2 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.303003 |first1=Mona |last1=Hanna-Attisha |first2=Jenny |last2=LaChance |first3=Richard Casey |last3=Sadler |first4=Allison |last4=Champney Schnepp |pmid=26691115 |pmc=4985856}}</ref>

Hanna-Attisha's research found that the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels (above five [[microgram]]s per deciliter, or 5 × 10{{Sup|–6}} grams per 100 milliliters of blood) rose from 2.4% (2013, before the change in water source) to 4.9% (2015, after the change in water source). In areas where water lead levels were considered high at ≥ 15 ppb, which is the maximum amount of lead allowed in water per the Safe Drinking Water Act Lead and Copper Rule, the average proportion of Flint children with elevated blood-lead levels rose from 4% to 10.6%.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis" /> Michigan Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program data agree an increase occurred, suggesting an increase from 2.2% of children (May 2013 – April 2014) to 3.0% (May 2014 – April 2015). Hanna-Attisha's data were taken from hospital laboratory records for children less than five years old.

Hanna-Attisha's sample numbers were large, both for the pre-switch and post-switch time periods and for Flint children (1,473) and for children not exposed to Flint water (2,202). Demographics were meaningfully different among the two groups. In terms of race, 24.4% of the children outside of Flint were African American, while 76.8% of the children in areas of high water lead levels (≥ 15 ppb) were African American, and 67.0% of the children in areas of lower water lead levels (< 15 ppb) were African American. Children outside of Flint had a younger average age (1.86 years) compared to areas inside Flint (2.04-2.09 years). Socioeconomic status also represented a meaningful difference with children inside of Flint being more disadvantaged than those children who lived outside of Flint.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis"/> In conclusion, the study demonstrated that elevated lead levels in children's blood was correlated with elevated lead levels in Flint water. Because lead screening is not completed for all children, such data may be skewed toward higher-risk children and thus overestimate lead exposure, especially in non–high-risk areas.<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis"/>

Hanna-Attisha and Flint resident LeeAnne Walters were awarded PEN America's Freedom of Expression Courage Award on May 16, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pen.org/multimedia/2016-pentoni-and-james-c-goodale-freedom-of-expression-courage-award-lee-anne-walters-and-dr-mona-hanna-attisha/ |title=2016 PEN/Toni and James C.

=== Hurley Medical Center study II (2018) ===
In June 2018 the ''[[Journal of Pediatrics]]'' published<ref name=jped>{{cite journal |last1=Gómez |first1=Hernán |last2=Borgialli |first2=Dominic |date=June 2018 |title=Blood Lead Levels of Children in Flint, Michigan: 2006–2016 |journal=[[The Journal of Pediatrics]] |volume=197 |pages=158–164 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2017.12.063 |pmid=29599069 |doi-access=free}}</ref> a much expanded study of blood lead levels measured at Hurley Medical Center. The original 2015 study of Hurley records involved a total of 1,473 children "younger than 5 years" whose address could be mapped to a site inside Flint in two pre/post 8.5 month periods. The 2018 study, led by Hernán F. Gómez, involved 15,817 children "aged ≤ 5 years" over the 11-year period 2006–2016. Data for 2012–2016 were available from center's Epic EMR system; records for earlier years were scrounged from legacy systems. The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], Gómez argues the change is not statistically significant. These results are consistent with a CDC report<ref name=cdc160624>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0624-water-lead.html |title=CDC investigation: Blood lead levels higher after switch to Flint River water |date=January 1, 2016 |website=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]}}</ref> which found that the fraction of "all children under age 6" with elevated lead blood level "was nearly 50 percent higher after the switch to Flint River water." The striking result of Gómez et al. however is that during the 11-year period, the "crisis years" are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels. That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably because of the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.

=== Virginia Tech water study ===
[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the first Virginia Tech Flint water study.]]
In September 2015 a team from Virginia Tech arrived in Flint. Led by Marc Edwards, an expert on municipal water quality, the team came to perform lead level testing on the Flint water supply, working under a [[National Science Foundation]] grant. Edwards had been contacted by Flint resident LeeAnne Walters, whose family suffered from extreme health problems almost immediately following the switch to the Flint River water. Walters had attempted to act locally, but she was repeatedly ignored by city, state, and EPA officials.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/23/virginia-tech-expert-helped-expose-flint-water-crisis/79251004/ |title=Virginia Tech expert helped expose Flint water crisis |last=Kozlowski |first=Kim |date=January 24, 2016 |newspaper=The Detroit News |accessdate=January 24, 2016}}</ref> The study found that Flint water was "very corrosive" and "causing lead contamination in homes".

Edwards was shocked by the extent of the contamination, but even more so by the inaction of the proper authorities after being made well aware of the contamination. Edwards and his team found that at least a quarter of Flint households had levels of lead above the federal level of 15 ppb and that in some homes, lead levels were at 13,200 ppb. Edwards said, "It was the injustice of it all and that the very agencies that are paid to protect these residents from lead in water, knew or should've known after June at the very very latest of this year, that federal law was not being followed in Flint, and that these children and residents were not being protected. And the extent to which they went to [[Coverup|cover this up]] exposes a new level of arrogance and uncaring that I have never encountered."<ref name="Lazarus" /> Edwards' team created a website called "''Flint Water Study''", with the main purposes of informing, and creating support for, Flint residents during the crisis.

On January 11, 2016, the Virginia Tech research team led by Edwards announced that it had completed its work. Edwards said, "We now feel that Flint's kids are finally on their way to being protected and decisive actions are under way to ameliorate the harm that was done." Edwards credited the Michigan [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] and the group Water You Fighting For with doing the "critical work of collecting and coordinating" many water samples analyzed by the Virginia Tech team. Although the labor of the team (composed of scientists, investigators, graduate students, and undergraduates) was free, the investigation still spent more than $180,000 for such expenses as water testing and payment of Michigan Freedom of Information Act costs.

She added the study yielded a lead reading of 13.9 ppb, just below the federal action level of 15 ppb. However, Pieper acknowledged the sampling, which was conducted by volunteer residents, does not fulfill the testing requirements of the federal Lead and Copper Rule. State testing of the most-recent six month monitoring period, which began January 1 and complied with Lead and Copper Rule regulations, showed a 90th percentile lead reading of 20 ppb, which exceeds the federal action level. Roughly 93 percent of samples from the third round of expanded state sentinel site testing showed results below the lead action level.

On January 24, 2017, the MDEQ told Mayor Weaver that the lead content of Flint water had fallen below the federal limit.

On March 7, 2017, MDEQ reported that Flint water sampled in February registered below the federal threshold for lead with 90 percent of samples at or below 8 ppb.

On April 23, 2019, ''Status Coup'' released the documentary ''Flushing Flint'' which claimed that the water testing conducted by MDEQ was falsified by MDEQ staff taking water samples after flushing running water from taps for several minutes before taking the samples, contrary to normal procedures for water testing, and by MDEQ staff telling residents that they should take water samples after flushing running water from their taps for several minutes.<ref name="auto3" /><ref name="auto2" /> This would clearly contravene the EPA guidance that samples taken must be "first-draw samples at taps in homes/buildings".<ref name="auto11" /> These claims cast doubt on the MDEQ reports of improvements in water quality over previous years.

''The Flint Journal'' obtained documents via the Michigan Freedom of Information Act on the Legionnaires' outbreak and published an article on them on January 16, 2016. The documents indicated that on October 17, 2014, employees of the Genesee County Health Department and the Flint water treatment plant met to discuss the county's "concerns regarding the increase in Legionella cases and possible association with the municipal water system." By early October 2014, officials at MDEQ were aware of a possible link between the water in Flint and the Legionnaires' outbreak, but the public was never informed, and the agency gave assurances about water safety in public statements and at public forums. An internal email on January 27, 2015, from a supervisor at the health department said that the Flint water treatment plant had not responded in months to "multiple written and verbal requests" for information.

In January 2015, following a breakdown in communication between the city and the county on the Legionnaires' investigation, the county filed a FOIA request with the city, seeking "specific water testing locations and laboratory results ... for [[coliform]], [[E-coli]], [[heterotroph]]ic bacteria and [[trihalomethane]]s" and other information. In April 2015, the county health department contacted the CDC, and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was "very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation." However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.<ref name="FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning">{{cite news |first=Ron |last=Fonger |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html |title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |date=January 16, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>

"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread," said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. "The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system." Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates—or bacteria—matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there "suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere."<ref name="1stGeneticLink" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak |title=New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak |first=Steve |last=Carmody |date=February 16, 2017 |website=Michigan Radio |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

On March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak. Janet Stout wrote in an affidavit: "(It) is my opinion to a reasonable degree of probability that the source water change and the subsequent management of the municipal water system caused conditions to develop within the municipal water distribution system that promoted Legionella growth and dispersion, amplification, and the significant increases in cases of Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County in 2014 and 2015." J. David Krause, director of Forensic Analytical Consulting Services, and Hung K. Cheung, a doctor specializing in environmental and occupational medicine agreed with her claims.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/03/experts_affidavits_point_to_fl.html |title=Experts' affidavits point to Flint water as source of Legionnaires' outbreak |first=Ron |last=Fonger |date=May 7, 2017 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

On February 5, 2018, a study published in the journals ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' and ''[[mBio]]'' concluded that the 2014-2015 outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Flint was caused by low levels of chlorine which, at higher levels, would have made it difficult for bacteria to replicate.<ref name=":2" /> Because chlorine reacts with [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]]s like lead and iron, high levels of both in Flint's water may have been responsible for the decreased amount of chlorine available.<ref name=":3" /> On December 4, 2019, research institute KWR from the Netherlands published the results of their re-investigation of the outbreak in ''[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]''. They found evidence for three sources: strong evidence for exposure to a Flint hospital in 2014 and 2015 for 42 of 86 confirmed cases, and weaker evidence for exposure to city water at home or living in the proximity of a specific cluster of cooling towers, both only in 2014. Each source could be associated with only a proportion of cases. They concluded that focus on a single source may have delayed recognition and remediation of other significant sources of ''L. pneumophila'' and provided recommendations to improve Legionella prevention.<ref name="SmithHuss.et.al">{{cite journal |title=Multiple Sources of the Outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease in Genesee County, Michigan, in 2014 and 2015 |first1=Anya F. |last1=Smith |first2=Anke |last2=Huss |first3=Samuel |last3=Dorevitch |first4=Leo |last4=Heijnen |first5=Vera H. |last5=Arntzen |first6=Megan |last6=Davies |first7=Mirna |last7=Robert-Du Ry van Beest Holle |first8=Yuki |last8=Fujita |first9=Antonie M. |last9=Verschoor |first10=Bernard |last10=Raterman |first11=Frank |last11=Oesterholt |first12=Dick |last12=Heederik |first13=Gertjan |last13=Medema |date=4 December 2019 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=127 |number=12 |page=127001 |doi=10.1289/EHP5663 |pmid=31799878 |pmc=6957290 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In an interview with the ''[[Detroit News]]'' published on January 12, 2016, Hedman said that "the recommendation to DEQ (regarding the need for corrosion controls) occurred at higher and higher levels during this time period. And the answer kept coming back from DEQ that 'no, we are not going to make a decision until after we see more testing results.'" Hedman said the EPA did not go public with its concerns earlier because (1) state and local governments have primary responsibility for drinking water quality and safety; (2) there was insufficient evidence at that point of the extent of the danger; and (3) the EPA's legal authority to compel the state to take action was unclear, and the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel, who only rendered an opinion in November. Hedman said the EPA discussed the issue with its legal counsel and urged the state to have MDHHS warn residents about the danger.<ref name="LynchEPA"/> On January 21, Hedman's resignation (effective February 1) was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Melissa Nann |last1=Burke |first2=Jim |last2=Lynch |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/21/top-epa-official-midwest-resigning-amid-flint-crisis/79140290/ |title=Top EPA official in Midwest resigning amid Flint crisis |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

Assessments of the EPA's action varied. Edwards said that the assessment in Del Toral's original June memo was "100 percent accurate" and criticized the EPA for failing to take more immediate action. State Senate Minority Leader [[Jim Ananich]], Democrat of Flint, said, "There's been a failure at all levels to accurately assess the scale of the public health crisis in Flint, and that problem is ongoing. However, the EPA's Miguel Del Toral did excellent work in trying to expose this disaster. Anyone who read his memo and failed to act should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law."<ref name="LynchEPA"/> Del Toral later told ''The Flint Journal'', "I was stunned when I found out they did not have corrosion control in place. In my head, I didn't believe that. I thought: That can't be true ... that's so basic." He also confirmed that unfiltered Flint water is still unsafe to drink, and did not know when that would change.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/epa_official_says_he_was.html |title=EPA official 'stunned' by failure to treat Flint water for lead leaching |first=Ron |last=Fonger |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

Two of the lawsuits had reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Appeals Court]]; in both cases, the Court rejected the city officials' claims of immunity to allow the cases to continue.

The officials had petitioned to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on the question of immunity, but in January 2020, the Supreme Court declined to hear either case, allowing both cases to proceed at the lower court.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-flint-idUSKBN1ZK1S5 |title=U.S. Supreme Court lets Flint, Michigan residents sue over water contamination |first=Andrew |last=Chung |date=January 21, 2020 |accessdate=January 21, 2020 |website=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>

At a news conference on February 9, 2016, Flint mayor Karen Weaver said that the city would remove and replace all of the city's 15,000 water service lines containing lead piping. Work was expected to begin in March 2016. The project will receive technical advice from the Lansing Board of Water and Light, which removed over 13,000 lead pipes in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Lansing mayor [[Virg Bernero]] volunteered to provide the assistance. Weaver appointed Michael C.H. McDaniel, a retired [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] [[brigadier general]], to oversee the group leading the project, the Flint Action and Sustainability Team (FAST).

Flint's water service line records were largely unreliable, meaning the city could not say how many lead pipes existed, nor where they were. The City therefore started using a machine learning model to prioritize excavations starting in September 2016.<ref name="auto5"/> Researchers from the University of Michigan developed this predictive model, using utility and parcel-level data to develop a more accurate service line inventory and calculate the probability that a given service is connected with a lead line. As pipes are dug up and more data is gained, the model updates accordingly and yields more accurate results. Using the model to prioritize excavations throughout 2016 and 2017 yielded a hit rate of about 80%.

A University of Michigan study, conducted by the same researchers responsible for developing the machine learning model, was released on December 1, 2016, stating a total of 29,100 pipes, from all parcels regardless of occupancy, were estimated to be lead.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/12/study_says_nearly_30000_flint.html |title=Number of homes that need new water pipes in Flint has doubled, study says |first=Jiquanda |last=Johnson |date=December 1, 2016 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref> This was based on a representative sample taken of the city's water service lines (approximately 200 homes) using Hydrovac method, which revealed the problem was more extensive than the city anticipated.

On March 26, 2018, a U.S. federal court mandate requires the city to return to using the machine learning model to prioritize excavations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/order-amending-settlement-agreement-flint-20190326.pdf |title=Order Amending Settlement Agreement.

==Long term effects of lead poisoning==
Childhood lead exposure causes a reduction in intellectual functioning and [[IQ]], [[academic performance]], and [[problem-solving]] skills, and an increased risk of [[attention deficit disorder]], aggression, and hyperactivity. According to studies, children with elevated levels of lead in the blood are more likely as adults to commit crimes, be imprisoned, be unemployed or underemployed, or be dependent on government services.<ref name="LeadCosts">{{cite web |first=Julie |last=Mack |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/thousands_of_michigan_children.html |title=Lead levels elevated for thousands of Michigan children outside of Flint |website=MLive.com |date=February 1, 2015 |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first1=Kathryn M. |last1=Barker |first2=Farah |last2=Qureshi |url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/public-health/lead-poisoning-exposure-health-policy |title=Lead poisoning: Sources of exposure, health effects and policy implications |website=Journalist's Resource |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Aaron E. |last=Carroll |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/upshot/what-the-science-says-about-long-term-damage-from-lead.html |title=What the Science Says About Long-Term Damage From Lead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 8, 2016 |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref> While changes in IQ may appear small from the elevated blood levels, it has been estimated that each increase in an IQ point raises worker's productivity by 1.76–2.38%, and that the economic benefit for each year of 3.8 million 2-year-old children could be from $110 to $319 billion.<ref>{{cite book |title=Toxicological Profile of Lead |date=August 2007 |website=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry |location=Atlanta, GA |url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp13.pdf}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' notes, "Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry." Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and "efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation." The crisis called attention to a "resource gap" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that "federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees," with "serious implications for states' ability to protect public health."<ref name="WinesSchwartz"/>

In the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil. [[Lead abatement]] efforts are slow.<ref name="WilkinsonBridge">{{cite web |first=Mike |last=Wilkinson |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/01/27/many-michigan-cities-higher-lead-levels-flint/79438144/ |title=Kids' lead levels high in many Michigan cities |website=Bridge Magazine |date=January 28, 2016 |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

=== Reforming the Lead and Copper Rule ===
The water crisis in Flint, Michigan has made it apparent that reform needs to be made nationwide to improve water infrastructure. Michigan, as the center of the water crisis, has since strengthened its [[Lead and Copper Rule]], making it the strongest advocate against lead contaminated water in the country. The new Lead and Copper Rule in Michigan requires that all lead contaminated pipes be replaced within the next twenty years. In 2019, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] suggested the first change to the Lead and Copper Rule in almost three decades to set more strict protocols for when lead is identified in water.<ref>{{Cite web|title=EPA Proposes New Regulations For Lead In Drinking Water|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/11/769047500/epa-proposes-new-regulations-for-lead-in-drinking-water|access-date=2020-08-24|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>

After the crisis in Flint, Michigan, Trump’s administration created a new set of regulations that would allow states to react more effectively and in a faster manner in the event of a public health crisis. These changes, proposed in amendments to the Lead and Copper Rule, still allow lead water lines to service communities, which has drawn a lot of criticisms from the public. This new proposal highlighted four changes in the Lead and Copper Rule, a rule that previously has not been revised in years. The proposed revisions consist of:

* Requiring water systems to create a database of where the lead pipes are located, and when the water running through the pipes reaches lead levels greater than 15 parts per billion, the problem must be investigated and fixed. 
* Create an alert when water samples reach 10 parts per billion so that communities can determine how to lower the lead levels in the water before it reaches 15 parts per billion. 
* Require water systems to alert customers within a one-day period if their water sample tests higher than 15 parts per million.
* Require water systems to replace water service lines to a home if they are contaminated with lead, and if the homeowner chooses to replace the piping. Every year thereafter, the water system must replace three percent of the lead contaminated water system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|title=Years after Flint crisis, Trump administration proposes changes to lead rules|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/10/10/lead-and-copper-rule-trump-administration-changes-post-flint/3934044002/|access-date=2020-08-24|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

However, critics are calling for the replacement of all lead service lines in communities; a project that would cost billions of dollars, which was not a part of the proposed amendments to the Lead and Copper Rule. 

The problem with the current Lead and Copper Rule is that it allows states to test their own water systems. This can cause problems because the water systems in individual homes affect the quality of the water there.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 14, 2017|title=EPA asks for input on changes to rules regarding lead in water supplies|url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/12/14/epa-asks-input-changes-rules-regarding-lead-water-supplies/951761001/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Detroit Free Press}}</ref> Therefore, water pipes could be contaminated and never get tested, or the test results are never reported. Since the crisis in Flint, the Environmental Protection Agency has called for more aggressive replacement of contaminated pipes, as well as improved education so people know to test their water. The crisis in Flint spurred the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) to test water systems across the nation for possible contaminants.

These violations could be positive results of contaminated water, failing to test water and water systems, and the failure to report contaminated water systems to the proper authorities.

Flint residents themselves have identified racism as a contributing factor to the crisis. In a qualitative study done by The Center for Research on Ethnicity, Culture and Health (CRECH) at the University of Michigan, researchers investigated Flint youth's perceptions of the Flint Water Crisis. The young Flint residents, with 93% identifying as black, were asked questions regarding the socioeconomic factors that attributed to the crisis.<ref name="Env Racism">{{cite journal |last1=Muhammad |first1=M. |last2=Loney |first2=E.H. |last3=Brooks |first3=C.L. |last4=Assari |first4=S. |last5=Robinson |first5=D. |last6=Caldwell |first6=C.H. |title="I think that's all a lie…I think It's genocide": Applying a Critical Race Praxis to Youth Perceptions of Flint Water Contamination |journal=Ethnicity & Disease |date=2018 |volume=28 |issue=Supp 1 |pages=241–246 |doi=10.18865/ed.28.S1.241 |pmid=30116093 |pmc=6092172}}</ref> In these interviews, themes of race, genocide, and oppression became apparent as youth expressed opinions on how their "poor Black city" was stigmatized and deprioritized by those in power.<ref name="Env Racism"/> Researchers noted that these results can help academics study the racialized mental trauma and stress among youth who experienced the Flint water crisis.<ref name="Env Racism"/>

The [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights|Michigan Civil Rights Commission]] later reiterated this belief in a 138-page report titled "The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint". Its writers said of it, "Policy makers, government leaders, and decision makers at many levels failed the residents of Flint," said Agustin Arbulu, Director of the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. "By not challenging their assumptions, by not asking themselves the tough questions about how policy and decisions play out in different communities, especially communities primarily made up of people of color, those decisions and actions – or in some cases, lack of action – led to the tragedy taking place in Flint." "We strongly believe that the actions that led to the poisoning of Flint's water and the slow response resulted in the abridgement of civil rights for the people of Flint," said Arthur Horwitz, co-chair of the Commission during the time of the investigation. "We are not suggesting that those making decisions related to this crisis were racists, or meant to treat Flint any differently because it is a community of color. Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them. We hope this report is a step in that direction."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/racism_played_a_role_in_flint.html |title=Racism played a role in Flint water crisis, says state report |first=Jiquanda |last=Johnson |date=February 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdcr/VFlintCrisisRep-F-Edited3-13-17_554317_7.pdf |title=The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint |author=Michigan Civil Rights Commission |date=February 17, 2017 |website=Michigan.gov |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

The Governor's office responded: "Some findings of the report and the recommendations are similar to those of the (Flint Water Advisory Task Force and) the legislative panel and the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee," said Gov. Rick Snyder spokeswoman Anna Heaton. "The Governor takes the reporting of each of these panels very seriously, and appreciates the public input that was shared." The findings were no surprise for State Senate Minority Leader [[Jim Ananich]]. "The presence of racial bias in the Flint water crisis isn't much of a surprise to those of us who live here, but the Michigan Civil Rights Commission's affirmation that the emergency manager law disproportionately hurts communities of color is an important reminder of just how bad the policy is. Now is the time to address this flawed law," Ananich said. He went on to say, "The people of Flint deserve the same level of safety, opportunity and justice that any other city in Michigan enjoys".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/belief_that_racism_played_role.html |title=Racism playing a role in Flint water crisis is not new, officials say |first=Jiquanda |last=Johnson |date=February 17, 2017 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

===Media responses===
On October 8, 2015, the editorial board of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' wrote that the crisis was "an obscene failure of government" and criticized Snyder.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/10/08/flint-water-crisis-obscene-failure-government/73578640/ |title=Flint water crisis: An obscene failure of government |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |date=October 8, 2015 |accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref>

On December 31, 2015, the editorial board of the [[MLive]] group of Michigan newspapers called upon Snyder to "drop [[executive privilege]] and release all of his communications on Flint water," establish a procedure for compensating families with children suffering from elevated lead blood levels, and return Flint to local control.<ref name="SnyderNeedsToDoMor" />

Some of the most important reporting on the crisis was conducted by investigative reporter Curt Guyette, who works not for a news organization but for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Michigan Democracy Watch Project.

====West Virginia University/University of Kansas study====
On August 7, 2017, [[West Virginia University]] published a study validating the correlation between the intake of lead contaminated water and the increase of fetal deaths along with miscarriages during November 2013 to March 2015.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grossman |first1=Daniel |last2=Slutsky |first2=David |title=The Effect of an Increase in Lead in the Water System on Fertility and Birth Outcomes: The Case of Flint, Michigan |journal=College of Business and Economics Working Paper Series |date=August 7, 2017 |number=No.17–25 |pages=1–64 |url=https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/econ_working-papers/20 |accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref> The study was led jointly by [[Daniel Grossman (physician)|Daniel Grossman]] of West Virginia University and David Slusky of the [[University of Kansas]].

====William Paterson University/University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Study====
On November 6, 2017 a retrospective cohort study was published in the ''Journal of Public Health Policy'' regarding birth weight outcomes in Flint in the early stages of the water crisis.<ref name="wisconsin-milwaukee">{{cite journal |last1=Abouk |first1=R. |last2=Adams |first2=S. |title=Birth outcomes in Flint in the early stages of the water crisis |journal=Journal of Public Health Policy |date=2018 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=68–85 |doi=10.1057/s41271-017-0097-5 |pmid=29109518|s2cid=21994642 }}</ref>The study was completed using birth data from 2005 to 2015 to assess the birth weights of infants born before and after the Flint, Michigan, water supply was changed. Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 grams. Beginning with January 2014 conception dates, the Flint, Michigan, population saw the incidence of low birth weight infants increase from 13.3% to 15.7%.<ref name="wisconsin-milwaukee"/> Further analysis, using other counties as controls with similar demographics during the same time period, were then assessed in order to prove these lower birth weights did not happen by chance.

Overall, birth weight in Flint was found to be 48.9 grams less than the control group with a statistically significant 1.53% increase in incidences of low birth weight.<ref name="wisconsin-milwaukee"/> The study also analyzed the effects of race in regards to changes in birth weights. White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties. Also, the birth weights after the climax of the crisis were not assessed to see if they bounced back to pre-crisis weights. Increased lead consumption and stress were hypothesized to be reasons behind the increase in low birth weights, but there were likely many additional confounding factors.<ref name="wisconsin-milwaukee"/>

====Wayne State University, Department of Communication Study====
In a study published in the journal ''Communication Studies'', researchers conducted a survey on the crisis communications methods used during the Flint water contamination by looking at media use between different racial groups. The results were accordant with past research, where racial minorities generally utilized more interpersonal and social connections as informational resources in comparison to their white counterparts.<ref name="communication study">{{cite journal |last1=Day |first1=A.M. |last2=O'Shay-Wallace |first2=S. |last3=Seeger |first3=M.W. |last4=McElmurry |first4=S.P. |title=Informational Sources, Social Media Use, and Race in the Flint, Michigan, Water Crisis |journal=[[Communication Studies (journal)|Communication Studies]] |volume=70 |issue=3 |date=2019 |pages=352–376 |doi=10.1080/10510974.2019.1567566 |pmid=33041609 |pmc=7545967 |doi-access=free}}</ref> Additionally, the study found that "In almost every category pertaining to health effects and other topics related to the Flint water crisis, African American respondents wanted additional information at higher levels than White respondents."<ref name="communication study"/> Lastly, researchers found that Instagram was widely used by African-American residents to receive crisis information.<ref name="communication study"/> The results from this study can further inform government agencies on how to effectively communicate with African-American communities, and use new social media platforms like Instagram to disperse important crisis information.

===Other possible causes and responses===
The crisis highlighted a lack of transparency in Michigan government; the state is one of just two states that exempts the governor's office from state freedom-of-information legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc12.com/home/headlines/Three-water-class-action-lawsuits-filed-by-Flint-residents-365832711.html |title=Flint water crisis highlights lack of transparency with Michigan government |website=Michigan Radio |date=January 25, 2016 |accessdate=January 25, 2016 |first=Natalie |last=Zarowny}}</ref> A number of commentators framed the crisis in terms of [[human rights]], writing that authorities' handling of the issue denied residents their [[right to water|right to clean water]].<ref name="Graham"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Spoer |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2016/1/flints-water-crisis-is-a-human-rights-violation.html |title=Flint's water crisis is a human rights violation |website=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 9, 2016}}</ref>

Robby Soave, writing in ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' magazine, said that administrative bloat in [[public-sector trade union]]s was to blame for the crisis: "Let's not forget the reason why local authorities felt the need to find a cheaper water source: Flint is broke and its desperately poor citizens can't afford higher taxes to pay the pensions of city government retirees. As recently as 2011, it would have cost every person in Flint $10,000 each to cover the unfunded legacy costs of the city's public employees."<ref>{{cite web |first=Robby |last=Soave |url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/21/the-government-poisoned-flints-waterso-s |title=The Government Poisoned Flint's Water—So Stop Blaming Everyone Else |website=Reason |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 21, 2016}}</ref> "Flint was a government-made disaster from top to bottom.

The crisis brought the National Water Infrastructure Conference to Flint in early March 2017. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver spoke on the first day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wnem.com/story/34682627/flints-lead-water-crisis-part-of-infrastructure-conference |title=Flint's lead water crisis part of infrastructure conference |date=March 7, 2017 |website=WNEM-TV |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref> Marc Edwards spoke there two days later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc12.com/content/news/Dr-Marc-Edwards-speaks-on-the-current-state-of-the-Flint-Water-Crisis-415919093.html |title=Dr. Marc Edwards speaks on current state of the Flint Water Crisis |first=Dawn |last=Jones |date=March 10, 2017 |website=WJRT-TV |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

On April 20, 2017 Stephen Estes-Smargiassi, director of planning and sustainability at the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]], told a forum on lead water contamination at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard School of Public Health]] that a chain-reaction of failures, including those by the financial managers, allowed the water crisis to develop as long as it did. He stated "What happened in Flint? Well, a firestorm of things that went wrong. (Flint) changed (its) source water, didn't do a good job on corrosion control in their treatment", and added "They had, about half of the homes had lead service lines. Money was more important to the emergency manager than people were. That's pretty clear from the evidence," and later went on to say, "State regulators could have picked up on this, but fell down on the job, maybe worse than that. We'll see what happens to those who were indicted. And the federal regulators could have picked up the problem, but didn't until quite late. All of those things, that firestorm of events, resulted in really awful water quality."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/05/water_expert.html |title=Expert at Harvard forum says Flint EMs cared more about money than people |first=Ron |last=Fonger |date=May 5, 2017 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

==Prevention==
Failed infrastructure and economic decline resulted in the toxic levels of lead in the city's water supply.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michigandistilled.org/2015/10/08/flint-water-crisis-policy-changes-needed-to-restore-public-trust/ |title=Flint water crisis: Policy changes needed to restore public trust |website=Michigan Distilled |last1=McGlashen |first1=Andy |access-date=October 8, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206194731/http://michigandistilled.org/2015/10/08/flint-water-crisis-policy-changes-needed-to-restore-public-trust/ |archive-date=February 6, 2016}}</ref> A corrosive water source was introduced "into an aging water system without adequate corrosion control."<ref name="Hanna-AttishaSpatialAnalysis"/>

Per Larry Clark, Sustainable Performance Solutions LLC, consulting professionals such as "professional engineers, licensed plumbers, or water-treatment specialists" could have had a positive impact on the outcome.<ref name="Business Sector Media, LLC">{{cite web |url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2016/02/01/how-to-prevent-another-flint-water-crisis/ |title=How to Prevent Another Flint Water Crisis |website=Environmental Leader |publisher=Business Sector Media, LLC |last1=Lyons |first1=Jessica |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}</ref> In addition to professional consultation, EPA reform would help prevent another Flint water crisis. Current water-testing techniques can underestimate water lead levels because sampling is sometimes concentrated on neighborhoods with known low lead levels or lead-free pipes.<ref name="Business Sector Media, LLC"/> EPA reform could enforce rules that "ensure that all cities get an early warning when lead levels rise to the danger point.", said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER).<ref name="Business Sector Media, LLC"/>

Upholding the Clean Water Act passed in 1972 would have prevented an outbreak of lead poisoning in Flint. This act "established the basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into the waters of the United States".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/history-clean-water-act |title=History of the Clean Water Act |website=United States Environmental Protection Agency |language=en |access-date=July 17, 2020}}</ref> The EPA has also updated its standards and created six goals for improving the drinking water of the nation. This plan was created in November 2016 to decrease the amount of pollution in water.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-action-plan |title=Drinking Water Action Plan |website=United States Environmental Protection Agency |language=en |access-date=July 17, 2020}}</ref>

Using point-of-use (POU) devices could prevent lead exposure. A study at the University of Arizona, Tucson used the Flint, Michigan water crisis to illustrate the economic benefits of utilizing three specific POU devices, which included reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation.<ref name="POU device">{{cite journal |last1=Verhougstraete |first1=M.P. |last2=Gerald |first2=J.K. |last3=Gerba |first3=C.P. |last4=Reynolds |first4=K.A. |title=Cost-benefit of point-of-use devices for lead reduction |journal=[[Environmental Research]] |date=2019 |volume=171 |pages=260–265 |doi=10.1016/j.envres.2019.01.016 |pmid=30690272 |bibcode=2019ER....171..260V|s2cid=59340543 }}</ref> Many factors such as "POU device costs, lead absorption from water, and economic losses associated with reduced IQ" were taken into account to determine the cost-benefit of each device. The study found that the water lead level breakeven points for reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation were 7.31 µg/L, 3.73 µg/L, and 12.0 µg/L, respectively.<ref name="POU device"/> The cost-benefit was analyzed as a 70-year (lifetime) duration, which is much longer than the Flint water crisis, but these POU devices could still serve to be a valuable tool in preventing the consumption of water-soluble lead in the future.

Using predictive models could be another invaluable way to help prevent another crisis like the one in Flint. Many municipalities across the country have outdated or incomplete records on their water service line materials, and governments have finite resources to identify and fix the problem of lead lines. In Flint, it is clear that a data-driven approach allowed public money to be spent more efficiently in ways that directly align with public health protection. Because the public (utility-owned) portion of service lines is buried under roads and sidewalks, it is expensive to verify pipe materials. Depending on the verification method, it can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars per home. Flint spent more than $20 million on unnecessary excavations when it ignored model predictions in 2018, instead of targeting homes with the highest likelihood of having a lead service line.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://storage.googleapis.com/flint-storage-bucket/d4gx_2019%20(2).pdf |title=Getting the Lead Out: Data Science and Water Service Lines in Flint |last=Webb |first=Jared |display-authors=etal |work=Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange |date=2019 |location=New York, NY}}</ref> This could have been largely avoided with the continued use of the machine learning model developed in 2016.

==Indirect mental health impact==
As the water crisis unfolded, residents experienced considerable anxiety over the physical and mental health impacts of lead poisoning on both adults and children, stress, and anger and political leaders. Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns. The state government gave a $500,000 grant to the Genesee Health System for free counseling in addition to sending state mobile crisis teams and expanding Medicaid programs for affected residents. Volunteer social workers arrived from across the state, and the United States Public Health Service offered training.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/us/flint-michigan-water-crisis-mental-health.html |title=A Potent Side Effect to the Flint Water Crisis: Mental Health Problems |first1=Abby |last1=Goodnough |first2=Scott |last2=Atkinson |date=April 30, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>

A study from the University of Michigan provided evidence that demonstrated an association between the Flint water crisis and sleep conditions.<ref name="sleep health">{{cite journal |last1=Kruger |first1=D.J. |last2=Kodjebacheva |first2=G.D. |last3=Cupal |first3=S. |title=Poor tap water quality experiences and poor sleep quality during the Flint, Michigan Municipal Water Crisis |journal=Sleep Health |date=2017 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=241–243 |doi=10.1016/j.sleh.2017.05.007 |pmid=28709509|s2cid=45031973 }}</ref> Surveys were offered at every opportunity, including by mail, email, social media, and in-person events to as many Flint, Michigan residents as possible. 834 respondents from September 30, 2015 to September 28, 2016 were included in the analysis. In the survey, respondents had to rate the quality of their tap water (taste, smell, appearance), rate the quality of their sleep, list the duration of sleep in a typical night, and fill out basic demographics. The study found that a lower perceived quality of tap water was associated with lower sleep quality and a shorter duration of sleep.<ref name="sleep health"/>

==Donations of water and money==
As of September 8, 2017, the Ruth Mott Foundation and the Community Foundation of Greater Flint had directed a combined $33,480,494 to various programs to aid both children and adults affected by Flint's water crisis. This total reflects donations from many celebrities, groups and organizations. The money has gone to fund not only immediate aid for the Flint crisis (such as bottled water distribution), but also to build community organizations and infrastructure in Flint; however, it has not gone to repairing the Flint water system, which remains the responsibility of local and state governments. The Ruth Mott foundation says much of their work is going towards helping Flint's children, in the form of programs for health, nutrition, and education.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/09/see_how_334m_in_flint_water_cr.html |title=See how $33.4M in Flint water crisis grants, donations have been spent |first=Oona |last=Goodin-Smith |date=September 8, 2017 |newspaper=The Flint Journal |via=MLive.com |access-date=July 25, 2020}}</ref>
