== History ==
Historian Michael Bertram, writing in 1989, identified three distinct periods for the Institute of Public Affairs:<ref name=":14">{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Bertram|date=1989|title=A history of the Institute of Public Affairs|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/38363|pages=i-ii, 69–105}}</ref>

# the war years and "immediate post-war years" where Australia's economic future was in question, ending with the election of [[Robert Menzies]] in 1949;
# the "Keynesian consensus" of the 1950s and 1960s and 
# the "sea-shift to the right" of the 1970s and 1980s.

=== War and immediate post-war years (1943-1949) ===
The Institute of Public Affairs was founded in 1943 as the Institute of Public Affairs Victoria, with [[Charles Denton Kemp|Charles Denton ("CD") Kemp]] as its inaugural director and [[George Coles (entrepreneur)|George Coles]] as its inaugural chair. The founders were prominent businessmen,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=April–June 1968|title=About the IPA|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/1210645977_document_review1968_vol.22no.2.pdf|journal=IPA Review|volume=22|pages=33–40}}</ref> and current executive director John Roskam says of the occasion: "Big business created the IPA".<ref name="Financial Review">{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/lifestyle/arts-and-entertainment/art/john-roskamthe-man-out-of-right-field-20140627-j05q0|title=John Roskam: the man out of right field|date=2014-06-28|work=Financial Review|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref> The idea to form the Institute of Public Affairs was first floated in the [[Victorian Chamber of Manufactures]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://books.publishing.monash.edu/apps/bookworm/view/Orb+and+Sceptre:+Studies+on+British+Imperialism+and+its+Legacies,+in+Honour+of+Norman+Etherington/141/xhtml/chapter11.html#ich11en17|title=Monash University EPress|last=Limb|first=Peter|website=books.publishing.monash.edu|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref>

The IPA's formation was prompted by the collapse of Australia's main right-wing party, the United Australia Party.<ref name="IPA">{{cite web|url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2014/05/31/abbotts-faceless-men-the-ipa/1401458400#.VZGgBTiJhtQ|title=Abbott's faceless men of the IPA|last1=Seccombe|first1=Mike|publisher=The Saturday Paper|accessdate=29 June 2015|date=31 May 2014}}</ref> The IPA's initial purpose was to influence Australia's post-war reconstruction, with business interests concerned that popular sentiment supported a Labor-led, collectivist post-war construction, a "prevailing clamour for a new kind of society".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/2002hyde_dry.pdf|title=Dry|last=Hyde|first=John|year=2002|pages=110–113}}</ref>

Throughout 1943, branches were set up in NSW (May), SA (June) and Queensland (August),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soda.naa.gov.au/item/1108226|title=Institute of Public Affairs 1943 – 1953|website=[[National Archives of Australia]]|pages=86, 127, 180}}</ref> although the state branches remained administratively and ideologically distinct (the SA and Queensland branches closed in the 1950s).<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=http://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/files/3229956/Thackrah_Andrew_2012.pdf|title="The world is ruled by little else": Australian neo-liberal think tanks during the Howard years|last=Thackrah|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Western Australia|year=2012|pages=121–123}}</ref> There seems to have been a pre-existing body called the Institute of Public Affairs in WA, which operated between 1941 and 1942.<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=http://soda.naa.gov.au/item/1108226|title=Institute of Public Affairs 1943–1953|website=[[National Archives of Australia]]|pages=127, 146, 149, 163–165, 188}}</ref> The IPA NSW engaged in "party political activism",<ref name=":1" /> while at the IPA Victoria's first annual meeting in 1944 chair GJ Coles said that they "did not wish to be directly involved in politics".<ref name=":0" />

In March 1943, the head of the [[Commonwealth Police#Security Service of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch|Commonwealth Security Service]] (CSS), Brigadier [[William Simpson (judge)|William Simpson]] requested a report into whether the newly-formed IPA had sympathies with "fascism", "counter-revolution" or the powers that Australia was at war with, but his deputy director said that its committee and sponsors were "beyond reproach".<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/1210834705_document_60-1_berg_overland.pdf|title=What 'fascist mob'?

The CSS was restructured in late 1943 and it again investigated the IPA's state branches.<ref name=":17" /> The IPA Queensland's radio play The Harris Family was required to be submitted to and approved by the [[Censorship in Australia|Chief-Inspector (Wireless)]].<ref name=":16" /><ref name=":15" /> The second review was completed in 1944. The CSS reported that nothing could be found to suggest that the IPA was subversive, and the war record of its supporters was "very fine", although two of the IPA NSW's council members were members of the Japan-Australia Society and one was associated with the [[Old Guard (Australia)|Old Guard]].<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":15" /> The [[National Archives of Australia]] preserve the CSS' reports into each branch, as well as material collected in the course of their investigation.<ref name=":15" />

In October 1944, the IPA printed 50,000 copies of ''Looking Forward'', an 80-page booklet which set out the possibilities of post-war reconstruction.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> [[Robert Menzies]] described ''Looking Forward'' as "the finest statement of basic political and academic problems made in Australia for many years".<ref name=":1" />

The IPA had no formal association with the formation of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] by Menzies in 1945. Political scientist Marian Simms says that the IPA's role was to act as "an interim finance collector for non-Labor political interests", initiate "the unification of the non-Labor organizations in Victoria … and then [mediate] among them" and provide "much of the content of the federal platform of the LPA and propaganda for political campaigns".<ref name=":2" /> ''Looking Forward'' was influential in the Liberal Party's inaugural platform.<ref name=":1" />

[[Norman Abjorensen]] credits the IPA in this period with the collapse in ALP support, saying that the IPA was "the architect of a stream of propaganda that sought, successfully, to discredit Australia's very moderate Labor Party as a socialist tiger waiting to pounce once the war had ended."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://insidestory.org.au/the-wartime-origins-of-the-culture-wars/|title=The wartime origins of the culture wars {{!}} Inside Story|date=2017-03-07|work=Inside Story|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref>

=== Keynesian consensus (1949-1972) ===
During the 1950s and 1960s, the IPA "came to wholeheartedly support" [[Keynesian economics]], with director C.D. Kemp writing "we are all socialists now".<ref name=":14" /> Over this period, the Institute argued for Australia's migration rate to be halved, which drew criticism from the Australian Industries Development Association and The Age.<ref name=":14" /> The Institute also identified inflation as a major issue, and opposed the abolition of the [[means test]], called for lower taxes, criticised the introduction of the [[Trade Practices Act]], advocated for fewer restraints on foreign investment and celebrated Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]].<ref name=":14" />

In 1962, the IPA dropped "Victoria" from its name, an act that caused relations between it and the IPA NSW to "deteriorate further".<ref name=":2" />

=== "Sea-shift to the right" (1972-1995) ===
In the 1970s, the IPA and IPA NSW cooperated to establish [[Enterprise Australia]]. This organisation had as "an immediate target … the removal of the [[Whitlam Government|present Labor Government]] in Canberra", while the IPA ostensibly stayed at arm's length in an attempt to be perceived as above party politics.<ref name=":2" />

From its founding to the late 1970s, the IPA had been associated with anti-socialist [[Keynesian economics]] and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] industry.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite thesis|last=C|first=Cahill, Damien|title=The radical neo-liberal movement as a hegemonic force in Australia, 1976-1996|date=2004|publisher=University of Wollongong|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/193/}}, p 112-118, 196-200, 301</ref> The appointment of [[Rod Kemp]] (CD Kemp's son) as executive director in 1982, along with other administrative changes that had occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, marked a shift to neo-liberal ideology that continues to this day.<ref name=":3" />

In June 1987 the IPA was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/1274398003_document_ipa_2009_financials_-_adjusted.pdf|title=IPA Annual Report 2009}}</ref>

In 1989, the IPA NSW – which had always been administratively and ideologically distinct – changed name to the [[Sydney Institute]], and transitioned from neo-liberal think tank to discussion forum.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> The IPA NSW had a budget of $120,000 in 1985, compared to the IPA Victoria's $300,000.<ref name=":1" />

Rod Kemp left his position as executive director in 1989 as he had been elected to Parliament.

In 1991, the IPA amalgamated with the Perth-based Australian Institute of Public Policy and [[John Hyde (Australian federal politician)|John Hyde]] moved from executive director of the Australian Institute of Public Policy to executive director of the IPA.<ref name="IPA" /><ref name=":1" /> The AIPP had been founded by Hyde in 1983 as a neo-liberal think tank, and the merger brought its annual revenue of about $300,000 or $400,000 to the IPA. Hyde described the merger as "joining forces with old friends".<ref name=":3" />

The IPA cooperated with the [[Tasman Institute]] on Project Victoria, which provided a blueprint for the privatisation and deregulation of the Victorian economy when Jeff Kennett became premier in 1992.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=McIntosh, Peter|date=2010|title=Crisis management: the Kennett Government and the neo-Liberalising of Victoria|url=https://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/items/d193507f-9b9d-49de-b15c-3d2e7982c317/1/}}</ref> The research was done with the assistance of Westpac staff seconded to work on the project.<ref name=":3" />

=== Nahan and Roskam eras (1995- ) ===
John Roskam replaced [[Mike Nahan]] as executive director in 2005, although he had worked at the IPA for a number of years before that.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/free-radicals-20130824-2sik1.html|title=Free radicals|last=Schneiders|first=Royce Millar, Ben|date=2013-08-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref>

Between 2009 and 2013, the IPA's annual revenue doubled to $3.2 million a year, an increase attributed by Roskam to the IPA's campaign against parts of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975|Racial Discrimination Act]] and the [[Gillard Government]]'s media regulation proposals.<ref name="Financial Review"/>

In 2008, former executive director of the IPA Rod Kemp was appointed chair of the IPA.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/kemp-charles-denton-ref-18187|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Roskam|first=John|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra|chapter=Kemp, Charles Denton (Ref) (1911–1993)}}</ref>

In 2013 the IPA celebrated its 70th anniversary, [[Master of ceremonies|MCed]] by political commentator [[Andrew Bolt]]. Notable in attendance at the celebrations were:<ref name="ANDEV Home">{{cite web | title=Institute of Public Affairs 70th Anniversary Dinner | website=ANDEV Home | url=http://www.andev-project.org/resources/institute-of-public-affairs-70th-anniversary-dinner/ | access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2013/04/05/abbott-bolt-rinehart-fawn-in-the-ipa-court-of-king-murdoch/|title=Abbott, Bolt, Rinehart fawn in the IPA court of King Murdoch|date=2013-04-05|website=Crikey|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>

In August 2018, [[Australian Public Service Commission]]er John Lloyd resigned during an investigation into correspondence he had with his former colleagues at the Institute of Public Affairs. On the day he retired, the investigation concluded that he had breached the [[Australian Public Service]] code of conduct by corresponding with the Institute of Public Affairs, but the breach did not warrant sanction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/politics/federal/john-lloyd-breached-code-of-conduct-over-emails-to-think-tank-inquiry-finds-20180808-p4zwc2.html|title=John Lloyd breached code of conduct over email to think tank, inquiry finds|last=Dingwall|first=Doug|date=2018-08-08|website=Canberra Times|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> Lloyd subsequently returned to work at the IPA.<ref name="Hannan">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/industrial-relations/ir-warrior-john-lloyd-takes-up-cudgels-at-ipa/news-story/4c569596f45b620002596868f3c33fae|title=IR warrior John Lloyd takes up cudgels at IPA|last=Hannan|first=Ewin|date=2018-12-17|website=[[The Australian]]}}</ref>

In 2018, the IPA held two dinners to celebrate its 75th anniversary. The first was sponsored by [[Visy Industries]] and took place on 21 August, the night of the first [[2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills|2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill]]. Former prime minister [[John Howard]] was interviewed at the dinner by [[Janet Albrechtsen]] about the spill, but did not explicitly support either candidate. [[Gina Rinehart]] and [[Rupert Murdoch]] praised US President [[Donald Trump]] at the dinner.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|url=https://www.afr.com/brand/rear-window/howard-says-a-leaders-first-responsibility-is-to-their-party-20180821-h149er|title=Howard says a leader's first responsibility is to their party|date=2018-08-21|website=Australian Financial Review|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>

{{Block quote|text=The freedom of Australian business is today gravely threatened by forces whose unswerving and rigid purpose is the entire nationalisation of industry and the establishment of socialism as the permanent form of Australian society; this would mean the elimination of private capital and shareholding, profit, freedom of private enterprise and the transfer of the control of industry to civil servants and union leaders. These forces are centred politically in the Labor Party and industrially in the Trade Unions; they are supported by an extremely powerful and growing section of public opinion.|sign=[[Charles Denton Kemp]]|source=}}

The IPA Victoria was founded as an apolitical organisation, and rejected the IPA NSW's strategy of "direct short term political action to defeat the Labor Party with an emphasis on propaganda". However, the IPA Victoria acted as a finance committee for non-Labor parties in its first year, and the IPA Treasurer at the time reportedly said that much of the IPA Victoria's funding was conditional on it being spent to "fight socialism at the coming election" (the [[1943 Australian federal election]]).<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Bertram|date=1989|title=A history of the Institute of Public Affairs|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/38363|pages=23–27, 60–63, 87–88, 133}}</ref> Its Publicity and Research Bureau wrote political broadcasters, provided speakers' notes to all endorsed [[United Australia Party]] and [[United Country Party (Australia)|United Country Party]] candidates and producing advertisements.<ref name=":6" />

The IPA Victoria's direct involvement in federal politics was reappraised after the 1943 election, and the organisation handed over responsibility for fundraising to the extra-parliamentary wing of the [[United Australia Party]]. The IPA Victoria remained involved in non-Labor politics, including financing by-election candidates and participating in the foundation of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].<ref name=":6" />

The IPA Victoria was less involved in the [[1949 Australian federal election|1949 federal election]] than the 1943 election, but the ''IPA Review'' did publish articles arguing against socialism and with tactical advice for the Liberal Party.<ref name=":6" />

During Charles Kemp's time as Director, the IPA Victoria focused its political engagement on the non-Labor parties, and did not "seriously attempt" to influence Labor politicians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Bertram|date=1989|title=A history of the Institute of Public Affairs|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/38363|pages=42–43}}</ref> Academic and public servant [[Finlay Crisp]] described it as a "satellite" of the Liberal Party during this time, and the ''IPA Review'' had a policy of not approaching Labor figures for submissions and of muting criticism of the Liberal Government.<ref name=":6" />

In 1978, the IPA and the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] prepared a booklet on partnership in industry, but the ACTU baulked at the association and its name was not on the final publication.<ref name=":9">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2016/08/27/former-ipa-head-radicals-hijacked-think-tank/14722200003666|title=Former IPA head: radicals 'hijacked' think tank|last=Seccombe|first=Mike|date=2016-08-27|work=The Saturday Paper|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> By the 1980s, the IPA had changed its policy and made space in the ''IPA Review'' for Labor politicians and "others not of the free enterprise persuasion".<ref name=":6" />

Today, the Institute still has close ideological and political affinities with the Liberal Party in Australia. For example, IPA Executive Director John Roskam worked on the Liberal Party's election campaign during the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]]<ref name="Roskam2005">{{cite news|last1=Roskam|first1=John| url=http://www.afr.com/p/opinion/item_HsDaIHAl3CvCEyLJ1GJIkO|title=Sermons from the left|work=Financial Review|date=15 July 2005}}</ref> and has run for Liberal Party preselection.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Party-faces-choice-new-blood-or-not/2005/06/17/1118869094822.html | title=Party faces choice new blood or not | newspaper=The Age | date=17 June 2005 | location=Melbourne | first=Jason | last=Koutsoukis}}</ref> Tony Abbott delivered the 57th C D Kemp lecture in 2001 on the Coalition Government's [[Work for the Dole]] program<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/23/1050777301768.html|title=Is this the end of the liberal party?|website=www.theage.com.au|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> and Prime Minister [[John Howard]] delivered the 60th C D Kemp lecture in 2004, titled ''Iraq: The Importance of Seeing it Through''.<ref>John Howard, 19 May 2004, [http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/10052/20040521-0000/www.pm.gov.au/news/speeches/speech878.html ''Address to the Institute of Public Affairs''].</ref>

==Research focus==
Following the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]] of the Abbott Coalition Government, the IPA released a list of 75 policy initiatives (later adding another 25) to "transform Australia" which encapsulated the present direction of the IPA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2013/09/06/institute-of-liberal-party-policy-what-the-ipa-will-get-from-abbott/|title=Institute of Liberal Party policy?

=== Economics ===
The IPA Victoria's ideological position was initially "an amalgam of Keynesianism control and Hayekian regulation", with IPA President Eric Lampe in 1961 saying that the IPA considered government responsibility for full employment, social security, the speed of development, living standards and financial stability "all very necessary".<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Bertram|date=1989|title=A history of the Institute of Public Affairs|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/38363|pages=152–155}}</ref>

This changed during the late 1970s and 1980s,<ref name=":9" /> when the IPA adopted an [[Economic rationalism|economic rationalist]] or neo-liberal position, with the IPA saying in 1988 that:<ref name=":7" />

=== Tobacco ===
In the 1990s, the IPA was funded by the tobacco industry to conduct research that "attacked the science behind [[passive smoking]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/politics/federal/free-radicals-20130824-2sik1.html|title=Free radicals|last=Schneiders|first=Royce Millar, Ben|date=2013-08-24|website=Canberra Times|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref> The research included a study from 1996 by [[John Luik]] that found that the impact of passive smoking on non-smokers was "trivial",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ipa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/archive/1211162660_document_review1998_vol.50no.2.pdf|title=IPA Review Volume 50|website=ipa.org.au|page=5|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref> and that "bogus" or "corrupt" passive smoking "threatens the central democratic values of autonomy, respect and diversity".<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipa.org.au/library/.svn/text-base/Luik1996_Smokescreen.pdf.svn-base|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152315/http://www.ipa.org.au/library/.svn/text-base/Luik1996_Smokescreen.pdf.svn-base|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-09-27|title=Smokescreen: 'Passive Smoking' and Public Policy|last=Luik|first=John|date=July 2018|website=Institute of Public Affairs|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref>
In 2010, the IPA argued against the [[Gillard Government]]'s plans to introduce [[plain tobacco packaging]], criticising it on the grounds that plain packaging may not affect the consumption of those products<ref>Chris Berg, IPA Research Fellow, The Age, 17 April 2001, [http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/plain-packs-pointless-when-smoke-gets-in-our-eyes-20110416-1dirt.html].</ref> and that plain packaging may infringe intellectual property rights in tobacco trademarks and logos. If so, it would represent a breach of the constitutional requirement that [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia|acquisition be on just terms]].

Policy director [[Tim Wilson (Australian politician)|Tim Wilson]] predicted that the government could be liable for $3 billion in compensation, a claim that was criticised at the time by [[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]] in part because media covering Wilson's claims did not mention that the IPA receives donations from the tobacco industry.<ref>{{Citation|title=Smoking Out The Spin|date=2010-05-10|url=https://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/episodes/smoking-out-the-spin/9974570|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref> The High Court ultimately ruled that no compensation was required, in [[British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v.

=== Climate change ===
The IPA accepts climate change is real but rejects the carbon dioxide consensus on the grounds of insufficient scientific evidence. It advocates that research in climate science should be more wide ranging than overwhelmingly focused on attempting to 'prove' carbon dioxide is a dangerous climate-changing 'pollutant' entirely through the inferences of hypothetical climate models. The IPA has financed several Australians who are [[contrarian]]s or active in [[alternate climate change research]].<ref name=doubt>{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/the-benefit-of-the-doubt-20100507-ujof.html | title=The benefit of the doubt | newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=8 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="DryzekNorgaard2011">{{cite book|author1=John S.

In 2008, the institute facilitated a donation of $350,000 by Dr G. Bryant Macfie, a climate change denier, to the University of Queensland for environmental research. The money is to fund three environmental doctoral projects, with the IPA suggesting two of the three agreed topics.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The Australian | date=7 May 2008 | url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23657735-11949,00.html | title=Dispute over climate sceptic uni grant}}</ref>

In 2010, the IPA published a compilation of essays by prominent climate change sceptics titled ''Climate Change: The Facts'' and edited by [[John Roskam]] and Alan Moran.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first = John|editor1-last = Roskam|editor-link1 = John Roskam|editor2-first = Alan J.|editor2-last = Moran|title = Climate Change: The Facts|year = 2010|publisher = Institute of Public Affairs|isbn = 9780909536718}}</ref> An expanded version with 22 essays was published in 2015 through [[Stockade Books]]<ref>{{cite book|title = Climate Change: The Facts|editor-last = Moran|editor-first = Alan|asin = B00S5L5Y0W|year = 2015|publisher = [[Stockade Books]]|type = Kindle}}</ref> and a follow-up edited by [[Jennifer Marohasy]] was published in 2017,<ref>{{cite book|title = Climate Change: The Facts 2017|editor-last = Marohasy|editor-first = Jennifer|editor-link = Jennifer Marohasy|asin = B074PRC25D|year = 2017|publisher = Institute of Public Affairs|type = Kindle}}</ref> both in [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] format.

When the IPA Victoria was founded in 1943, it had a chairman (Sir [[George Coles (entrepreneur)|George Coles]]); a chairman of the Executive Committee was chosen in 1944 (G. H. Grimwade) and a director ([[Charles Denton Kemp]]) in 1948. The Executive Committee was also referred to as the Industrial Committee or the Executive & Editorial Committee, and the role of chairman was subsequently renamed to president. From July 1983, the roles of president and chairman of the Executive Committee were combined.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Michael|first=Bertram|date=1989|title=A history of the Institute of Public Affairs|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/38363|pages=199–200}}</ref>
