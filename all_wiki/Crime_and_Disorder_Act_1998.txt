The '''Crime and Disorder Act 1998''' (c.37) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Act was published on 2 December 1997 and received Royal Assent in July 1998. Its key areas were the introduction of [[Anti-Social Behaviour Order]]s, Sex Offender Orders, Parenting Orders, granting local authorities more responsibilities with regards to strategies for reducing crime and disorder, and the introduction of law specific to 'racially aggravated' offences. The Act also abolished [[rebuttable presumption]] that a child is ''[[doli incapax]]'' (the presumption that a person between ten and fourteen years of age is incapable of committing an offence) and formally abolished the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]] for the last offences carrying it, namely [[treason]] and [[Piracy Act 1837|piracy]].

The bill had also included changes to change the age of consent for homosexual acts from 18 to 16;<ref>{{cite web|title=Crime and Disorder Bill — Reduction of Age of Consent for Homosexual Acts to 16 — 22 Jun 1998|url=http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=1998-06-22&number=311|website=Public Whip|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> however, this was removed by the House of Lords and was eventually passed in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000|Sexual Offences Act]] two years later.

==Main provisions==

===Anti-Social Behaviour Orders===

The Act introduced a civil remedy called the [[anti-social behaviour order]] (or ASBO). These orders are made against people who have engaged in [[anti-social behaviour]] which in the United Kingdom is defined as "conduct which caused or was likely to cause alarm, [[harassment]], or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as him or herself and where an ASBO is seen as necessary to protect relevant persons from further anti-social acts by the [[Defendant]]".

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the orders are made by the [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' court]]s and in [[Scotland]] by the [[Sheriff court]]s. The provisions of the 1998 Act have since been modified by the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]].

===Sex Offender Orders===
In England and Wales, a Sex Offender Order is a similar concept to the Anti-Social Behaviour Order with the key difference being that it is specifically aimed at those people in society that are deemed "[[sex offender]]s". The Act allows a police officer to approach the Magistrates' Court and show that he has reasonable cause to believe that there is a need for an order to be made to protect the public from harm.  The conditions placed in such an order are those that are needed to prevent harm to the public. The order can be made for a minimum of 5 years unless the court upholds a complaint for the order to varied or discharged.

A breach of a Sex Offender Order renders the person to which the order applies, liable for imprisonment, on [[Summary offence|summary conviction]], for up to six months or on conviction on [[indictment]], up to five years and/or a fine.

The act only applies to those people that are defined as a 'sex offender' per Section 3(1) of the act or namely that the person has been convicted of an offence under Part I of the [[Sex Offenders Act 1997]], was found not guilty as a result of insanity, or has been cautioned for such an offence and at the time admitted it or has been convicted of a similar offence in any country outside of the United Kingdom and the offence would have been deemed a sexual offence under UK law.

===Parenting Orders===

In England and Wales, a Parenting Order is an order made against the parent(s) of a child which has been given an Anti-Social Behaviour Order, has been convicted of an offence, or the parent has been convicted of an offence under section 443 or 444 of the [[Education Act 1996]]. Its aim is that parents must adhere to the conditions to stop their child from behaving similarly, failure to do so will lead to their conviction. The order can be made for a period not exceeding 12 months. There are restrictions on orders being made that interfere with the parents' or child's religious beliefs or that interfere with the times which the parent normally attends work or an educational institution. If the parenting order is breached, the parent(s) could be liable to a fine, not exceeding level 3 on the [[standard scale]].<ref>For an analysis of the underlying ideology of this section of the Act which links "poor" parenting and crime see Fell, P. ''Blaming the Parents''. Unpublished MA dissertation, Manchester:Manchester Metropolitan University, 2001.</ref>

===Racially or religiously aggravated offences===

In England and Wales, Sections 28 to 32 of the Act create separate offences for crimes that were aggravated by the victim's race or religion or presumed race or religion. They did not originally apply to crimes that are aggravated by the offender's perception of the victim's membership of a religion but it was amended by [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001#Part 5 (Racial hatred)|section 39]] of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]].

==Case law==

On 28 February 2007, the House of Lords ruled<ref>R v Rogers [2007] UKHL 8</ref> that use of the expletive "bloody foreigner" amounted to racial abuse under the Act, and held that the legal definition of "racial group" went beyond colour, race or ethnic origin to include nationality, citizenship and national origin – even if they were not specified in the words used by the offender. [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Baroness Hale]] stated that such conduct was not only deeply hurtful, damaging and disrespectful to the victim, but also to the community as a whole "by denying acceptance to members of certain groups not for their own sake but for the sake of something they can do nothing about".<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1544050/Saying-bloody-foreigner-is-ruled-racist.html telegraph.co.uk: "Saying 'bloody foreigner' is ruled racist"], 28 Feb 2007</ref>
