==Etymology==
The word ''Taliban'' is [[Pashto]], {{lang|ps|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ps|ṭālibān}}'', meaning "students", the plural of ''[[Talibe|ṭālib]]''. This is a [[loanword]] from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|طالب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālib}}'',  using the [[Persian language|Persian]] plural ending ''-ān'' {{lang|ps|ان}}. In Arabic {{lang|ar|طالبان}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭālibān}}'' means not "students" but "two students", as it is a [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] form, the Arabic plural being {{lang|ar|طلاب}} ''{{transl|ar|ṭullāb}}''—occasionally causing some confusion to Arabic speakers. Since becoming a loanword in English, ''Taliban'', besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, [[John Walker Lindh]] has been referred to as "an American Taliban", rather than "an American Talib". In the English language newspapers of Pakistan, the word ''Talibans'' is often used when referring to more than one Taliban. The spelling ''Taliban'' has come to be predominant over ''Taleban'' in English.<ref name="Arabic Dictionary">{{cite web|url=http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&status=translate&lang1=23&lang2=ar&source_id=2248807 |title=English <-> Arabic Online Dictionary |publisher=Online.ectaco.co.uk |date=28 December 2006 |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Adam |last=Curtis |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/06/from_taleban_to_taliban.html |title=From 'Taleban' to 'Taliban' |publisher=BBC |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref>

==Background==

===Soviet intervention (1978–1992)===
[[File:Reagan sitting with people from the Afghanistan-Pakistan region in February 1983.jpg|thumb|President [[Ronald Reagan]] meeting with [[Afghan Mujahideen]] leaders in the Oval Office in 1983]]
After [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)#Soviet intervention and withdrawal|the Soviet Union intervened and occupied Afghanistan in 1979]], Islamic [[mujahideen]] fighters engaged in war with those Soviet forces.

[[Pakistan]]'s President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] feared that the Soviets were planning to invade also [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], Pakistan, so he sent [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] to [[Saudi Arabia]] to garner support for the Afghan resistance against Soviet occupation forces. A while later, the US [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and Saudi Arabian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) funnelled funding and equipment through the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Inter-Service Intelligence Agency]] (ISI) to the Afghan mujahideen.<ref name="Price">{{cite web |title=Pakistan: A Plethora of Problems |url=http://globalsecuritystudies.com/Price%20Pakistan.pdf |access-date=22 December 2012 |work=Global Security Studies, Winter 2012, Volume 3, Issue 1, by Colin Price, School of Graduate and Continuing Studies in Diplomacy |location=Norwich University, Northfield, VT.}}</ref>

About 90,000 Afghans, including [[Mohammed Omar]], were trained by Pakistan's ISI during the 1980s.<ref name="Price"/> British professor [[Carole Hillenbrand]] concluded that the Taliban have arisen from those US-Saudi-Pakistan-supported mujahideen: "The West helped the Taliban to fight the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hillenbrand|2015|p=284}}</ref>

===Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)===
{{See also|Afghan Civil War (1992–1996)}}
After the fall of the Soviet-backed regime of [[Mohammad Najibullah]] in 1992, many Afghan political parties, but not [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]], [[Hizb-e Wahdat]], and [[Ittihad-i Islami]], in April agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement, the [[Peshawar Accord]], which created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an interim government for a transitional period; but that Islamic State and its government were paralysed right from the start, due to rivalling groups contending for total power over Kabul and Afghanistan.<ref name="photius, peshawar">[https://photius.com/countries/afghanistan/government/afghanistan_government_the_peshawar_accord~72.html 'The Peshawar Accord, 25 April 1992'].

====Education====

[[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Mohammad Omar]] in September 1994 in his hometown of [[Kandahar]] with 50 students founded the group.<ref name=Stanford/><ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25">Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994–1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25–26</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=25}}</ref>
Omar had since 1992 been studying in the [[Singesar|Sang-i-Hisar]] [[madrasa|madrassa]] in [[Maiwand]] (northern [[Kandahar Province]]). He was unhappy that [[Islam]]ic law had not been installed in Afghanistan after the ousting of communist rule, and now with his group pledged to rid Afghanistan of warlords and criminals.<ref name=Stanford>[http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/367 'The Taliban']. ''Mapping Militant Organizations.'' Stanford University. Updated 15 July 2016. Retrieved 24 September 2017.</ref>

Within months, 15,000 students, often Afghan refugees, from religious schools or [[madrasa]]s – one source calls them [[Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F)#Madrassas|Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-run madrasas]]<ref name="Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25"/> – in [[Pakistan]] joined the group.

The US government covertly provided violent schoolbooks filled with militant Islamic teachings and jihad and images of weapons and soldiers in an effort to inculcate in children anti-Soviet insurgency and hate for foreigners. The Taliban used the American textbooks but scratched out human faces in keeping with strict fundamentalist interpretation. The [[United States Agency for International Development]] gave millions of dollars to the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]] in the 1980s to develop and publish the textbooks in local languages.<ref>Washington Post, 23 March 2002, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/03/23/from-us-the-abcs-of-jihad/d079075a-3ed3-4030-9a96-0d48f6355e54/?noredirect=on From U.S., the ABC's of Jihad]"</ref>

====Motivation====

The ISI and Pakistan aimed to exert control, while the Taliban leadership manoeuvred between keeping its independence and sustaining support." The main supporters in Pakistan were General [[Naseerullah Babar]], who mainly thought in terms of geopolitics (opening trade routes to Central Asia), and [[Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman]] of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F)]], as "the group represented Deobandism and aimed to counter the influence of the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jama’at-e Islami]] and growing [[Wahhabism]]."<ref>Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn, ''An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan'', Oxford University Press (2012), pp. 121–122</ref>

On 3 November 1994, the Taliban in a surprise attack conquered [[Kandahar|Kandahar City]].<ref name=Stanford/> Before 4 January 1995, they controlled 12 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|Afghan provinces]].<ref name=Stanford/>

[[File:Afghanistan politisch 1996.png|thumb|Map showing political control in Afghanistan in late 1996, following the capture of Kabul by the Taliban]]
In a bid to establish their rule over all Afghanistan, the Taliban expanded from their Kandahar base sweeping large territories. In early 1995 the movement moved towards [[Kabul]], but they suffered a devastating defeat against government forces of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] under the command of Ahmad Shah Massoud. While retreating from Kabul, Taliban fighters started shelling the city,<ref name="amnesty.org">Amnesty International.

The media reported in March 1995 that, following the Taliban's shelling, they lost much respect from Afghans and were seen as just another "power-hungry" militia.<ref>https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ad3ac.html</ref>

After a series of setbacks, the Taliban managed to take control of the western city of [[Herat]] on 5 September 1995.

On 26 September 1996, as the Taliban prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul to continue anti-Taliban resistance in the northeastern [[Hindu Kush]] mountains instead of engaging in street battles in Kabul.

====Afghanistan during Taliban rule====
{{Main|Talibanization}}
When the Taliban took power in 1996, [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|twenty years of continuous warfare]] had devastated Afghanistan's [[infrastructure]] and economy. There was no running water, little electricity, few telephones, functioning roads or regular energy supplies. Basic necessities like water, food, housing and others were in desperately short supply. In addition, the [[clan]] and family structure that provided Afghans with a social/economic safety net was also badly damaged.  Afghanistan's infant mortality was the highest in the world. A full quarter of all children died before they reached their fifth birthday, a rate several times higher than most other developing countries.<ref name="rashid 107"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=126}}.</ref><ref>
UNCP Country Development Indicators, 1995.</ref>

International charitable and/or development organisations ([[non-governmental organisation]]s or NGOs) were extremely important to the supply of food, employment, reconstruction, and other services, but the Taliban proved highly suspicious towards the 'help' those organisations offered (see [[#United Nations and NGOs|§ United Nations and NGOs]]). With one million plus deaths during the years of war, the number of families headed by widows had reached 98,000 by 1998. In Kabul, where vast portions of the city had been devastated by rocket attacks, more than half of its 1.2&nbsp;million people benefited in some way from NGO activities, even for drinking water.  The [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|civil war]] and its never-ending refugee stream continued throughout the Taliban's reign. The Mazar, Herat, and [[Shomali Plain|Shomali]] valley offensives displaced more than three-quarters of a million civilians, using "[[scorched earth]]" tactics to prevent them from supplying the enemy with aid.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Quoting the ICRC |journal=History Compass |volume=3 |pages = **|publisher=Blackwell-synergy.com |date=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00141.x |last1=Nichols |first1=Robert }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=72}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=64, 78}}.</ref>

Taliban decision-makers, particularly Mullah Omar, seldom if ever talked directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers had to deal with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed.<ref name="rashid 101-102"/> Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female [[lawyer|attorney]] for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=65}}.</ref>

When the UN increased the number of Muslim women staff to satisfy Taliban demands, the Taliban then required all female Muslim UN staff travelling to Afghanistan to be chaperoned by a [[mahram]] or a blood relative.<ref name=taliban71>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=71}}.</ref> In July 1998, the Taliban closed "all NGO offices" in Kabul by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.<ref name=bmj>

The few organisations active in Kandahar were not subjected to the same demands and continued their operations. 

====Role of the Pakistani military====
The Taliban were largely founded by Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] beginning in 1994; the I.S.I. used the Taliban to establish a regime in Afghanistan which would be favourable to Pakistan, as they were trying to gain [[strategic depth]]. Since the creation of the Taliban, the ISI and the Pakistani military have given financial, logistical and military support.<ref name="Giraldo"/><ref name=Shaffer2>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Brenda|title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69321-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/limitsofculturei0000unse/page/267 267]|quote=Pakistani involvement in creating the movement is seen as central|url=https://archive.org/details/limitsofculturei0000unse/page/267}}</ref><ref name="Forsythe3">{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of human rights|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533402-9|page=2|edition=Volume 1|quote=In 1994 the Taliban was created, funded and inspired by Pakistan}}</ref><ref name="[[Hall Gardner]]">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Hall|title=American global strategy and the 'war on terrorism'|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7094-0|page=59}}</ref><ref name=Jones>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan: eye of the storm|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10147-8|page =240|quote=The ISI's undemocratic tendencies are not restricted to its interference in the electoral process.

According to Pakistani Afghanistan expert [[Ahmed Rashid]], "between 1994 and 1999, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Pakistanis trained and fought in Afghanistan" on the side of the Taliban. [[Peter Tomsen]] stated that up until 9/11 Pakistani military and ISI officers along with thousands of regular Pakistani armed forces personnel had been involved in the fighting in Afghanistan.<ref name=Maley>{{cite book|last=Maley|first=William|title=The Afghanistan wars|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-21313-5|page=288}}</ref><ref name=Tomsen-322>{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|page=322}}</ref>

During 2001, according to several international sources, 28,000–30,000 Pakistani nationals, 14,000–15,000 Afghan Taliban and 2,000–3,000 [[Al-Qaeda]] militants were fighting against anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan as a roughly 45,000 strong military force.  Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] – then as Chief of Army Staff – was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and Bin Laden against the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud. Of the estimated 28,000 Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan, 8,000 were militants recruited in [[madrassa]]s filling regular Taliban ranks. The document further states that the parents of those Pakistani nationals "know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan". A 1998 document by the [[US State Department]] confirms that "20–40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani."  According to the State Department report and reports by Human Rights Watch, the other Pakistani nationals fighting in Afghanistan were regular Pakistani soldiers, especially from the [[Frontier Corps]] but also from the army providing direct combat support.<ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /><ref name="Webster University Press Book"/><ref name="George Washington University"/><ref name="Human Rights Watch-PST-no-quote">{{cite news | url =https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghan2/Afghan0701-02.htm | title = Pakistan's support of the Taliban | publisher = Human Rights Watch | year=2000}}</ref><ref name="Edward Girardet">{{cite book | last = Edward Girardet| title =Killing the Cranes: A Reporter's Journey Through Three Decades of War in Afghanistan |edition=3 August 2011 |page=416 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing}}</ref><ref name="Rashid 2000 91">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=91}}</ref><ref name = "National Geographic">{{cite web | year = 2007 |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY |title = Inside the Taliban| publisher = [[National Geographic Society]]}}</ref>

Human Rights Watch wrote in 2000:

{{quote|Of all the foreign powers involved in efforts to sustain and manipulate the ongoing fighting [in Afghanistan], Pakistan is distinguished both by the sweep of its objectives and the scale of its efforts, which include soliciting funding for the Taliban, bankrolling Taliban operations, providing diplomatic support as the Taliban's virtual emissaries abroad, arranging training for Taliban fighters, recruiting skilled and unskilled manpower to serve in Taliban armies, planning and directing offensives, providing and facilitating shipments of ammunition and fuel, and ... directly providing combat support.<ref name="Human Rights Watch-PST"/>}}

On 1 August 1997, the Taliban launched an attack on Sheberghan, the main military base of Abdul Rashid Dostum. Dostum has said the reason the attack was successful was due to 1500 Pakistani commandos taking part and that the Pakistani air force also gave support.<ref name=Clements2>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=54}}</ref>

In 1998, Iran accused Pakistan of sending its air force to bomb [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in support of Taliban forces and directly accused Pakistani troops for "war crimes at [[Bamiyan]]". The same year, Russia said Pakistan was responsible for the "military expansion" of the Taliban in northern Afghanistan by sending large numbers of Pakistani troops, some of whom had subsequently been taken as prisoners by the anti-Taliban United Front.<ref name="Washington Post (2)">{{cite news | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/34079877.html?dids=34079877:34079877&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+16%2C+1998&author=Pamela+Constable&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Afghanistan%3A+Arena+for+a+New+Rivalry&pqatl=google| title = Afghanistan: Arena for a New Rivalry | last =Constable| first = Pamela| work = The Washington Post| date=16 September 1998}}</ref><ref name="Press Trust of India">{{cite news | url = http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980812/22450054.html | title = Pak involved in Taliban offensive – Russia | newspaper = Express India | year = 1998 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050128030041/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980812/22450054.html | archive-date = 28 January 2005 }}</ref>

During 2000, the UN Security Council imposed an arms embargo against military support to the Taliban, with UN officials explicitly singling out Pakistan. The UN secretary-general implicitly criticised Pakistan for its military support and the Security Council stated it was "deeply distress[ed] over reports of involvement in the fighting, on the Taliban side, of thousands of non-Afghan nationals". In July 2001, several countries, including the United States, accused Pakistan of being "in violation of U.N. sanctions because of its military aid to the Taliban". The Taliban also obtained financial resources from Pakistan. In 1997 alone, after the [[Battle of Kabul (1992–1996)|capture of Kabul]] by the Taliban, Pakistan gave $30&nbsp;million in aid and a further $10&nbsp;million for government wages.<ref name="UN">{{cite news | url =https://www.un.org/News/dh/latest/afghan/un-afghan-history.shtml | title = Afghanistan & the United Nations | publisher = [[United Nations]] | year=2012}}</ref><ref name="Washington Times (2)">{{cite news | url =http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED02FA7F968789D&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM| title = U.S. presses for bin Laden's ejection | work = [[The Washington Times]] | year=2001}}</ref><ref name=Byman>{{cite book|last=Byman|first=Daniel|title=Deadly connections: states that sponsor terrorism|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83973-0|page=195}}</ref>

The role of the Pakistani military has been described by international observers as well as by the anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud as a "creeping invasion".<ref name="Maley"/>

====Anti-Taliban resistance under Massoud====

[[File:Afghanistan politisch 2000.png|thumb|The [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] and the [[Northern Alliance]] in early 2000, when the Taliban was at the height of its power]]

In late 1996 [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], former enemies, created the United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. The United Front included beside the dominantly [[Tajiks|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, [[Hazaras|Hazara]] troops led by [[Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq]] and [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] and [[Haji Abdul Qadir]]. Notable politicians and diplomats of the United Front included [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]], [[Abdullah Abdullah]] and [[Massoud Khalili]]. From the Taliban conquest of Kabul in September 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[Ghor Province|Ghōr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

After longstanding battles, especially for the northern city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish forces were defeated by the Taliban and their allies in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile. Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only major anti-Taliban leader inside Afghanistan who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban.

In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.  In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. They were allowed to work and to go to school. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.

{{quote|It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights.

{{quote|Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that "the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression." His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women – they would have the same rights as men.<ref name="Webster University Press Book"/>|Pepe Escobar|Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman}}

Afghan traditions would need a generation or more to overcome and could only be challenged by education, he said. Humayun Tandar, who took part as an Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan, Bonn (2001)|International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that "strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day." This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-José Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a Christian friend Jean-José Puig or the Jewish [[Princeton University]] Professor Michael Barry: "Jean-José, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language."<ref name="Webster University Press Book"/>

Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. 400,000 to one million Afghans fled from the Taliban to the area of Massoud.<ref name="National Geographic" /><ref name="Human Rights Watch-backgrounder-2001">{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/afghan-bck1005.htm#uf |title = Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, October 2001| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |title=Inside the Taliban |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813110219/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview |archive-date=13 August 2011 }}</ref> [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] concluded in its documentary ''Inside the Taliban'': "The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud."<ref name="National Geographic"/>

The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview:

{{quote|The Taliban say: "Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us", and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But at what cost?!

The United Front in its [https://web.archive.org/web/20120310123118/http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposals for Peace] demanded the Taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections. In early 2001, Massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals. Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society, including the Pashtun areas. Massoud publicised their cause of "popular consensus, general elections and democracy" worldwide. At the same time he was very wary not to revive the failed Kabul government of the early 1990s. Already in 1999, he started the training of police forces which he trained specifically in order to keep order and protect the civilian population in case the United Front would be successful.<ref name="Webster University Press Book" /><ref name="Interview"/><ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars"/> Massoud stated:

{{quote|The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past.

From 1999 onwards, a renewed process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks as well as some Pashtun commanders under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]] received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king [[Zahir Shah]]. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner [[Steve Coll]] referred to as the "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert [[Peter Tomsen]] wrote: "The 'Lion of Kabul' [Abdul Haq] and the 'Lion of Panjshir' [Ahmad Shah Massoud] ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan's three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun–non-Pashtun, north–south divide." The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan".  That part of the Pashtun–Tajik–Hazara–Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialise. An account of the meeting by author and journalist [[Sebastian Junger]] says: "In 2000, when I was there ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly. One was Hamid Karzai; I did not have any idea who he would end up being".<ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars">{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| author-link = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=23 February 2004 |page=558| publisher =Penguin Press HC }}</ref><ref name=Tomsen-565>{{cite book|last=Tomsen|first=Peter|title=Wars of Afghanistan|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-763-8|page=565}}</ref><ref name="The New Statesman">{{cite magazine |year=2011|url = http://www.newstatesman.com/international-politics/2011/11/haq-afghanistan-taliban-kabul|title = The lost lion of Kabul| magazine = The New Statesman}}</ref><ref name="Corbis">{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.corbisimages.com/stock-photo/rights-managed/AAEC001272/council-of-afghan-opposition?popup=1 |title = Council of Afghan opposition| publisher = Corbis}}</ref><ref name="Webster University Press Book 2">{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=1 March 2009 |page=65 | publisher = Webster University Press}}</ref>

In early 2001, Ahmad Shah Massoud with ethnic leaders from all of Afghanistan addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan. He stated that the Taliban and [[Al-Qaeda]] had introduced "a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]" and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year. On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on US soil being imminent. The president of the European Parliament, [[Nicole Fontaine]], called him the "pole of liberty in Afghanistan".<ref name="EU Parliament (2)">{{cite web|year=2001 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title=Massoud in the European Parliament 2001 |publisher=EU media |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610222028/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |archive-date=10 June 2015 }}</ref><ref name="EU Parliament">{{cite web |year=2001|url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher =EU media}}</ref><ref name="gwu.edu">Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf GWU.edu]</ref><ref>{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title=see video |publisher=YouTube |date=5 March 2001 |access-date=31 October 2010}}</ref>

On 9 September 2001, Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] by two Arabs posing as journalists at Khwaja Bahauddin, in the [[Takhar Province]] of Afghanistan. Massoud, who had survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years, died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital. The first attempt on Massoud's life had been carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975, when Massoud was only 22 years old. In early 2001, Al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.<ref name="Roy Gutman"/><ref name="Steve Coll: Ghost Wars" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html |title=Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb |location=Afghanistan |work=The New York Times |date=10 September 2001 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html |title=Threats and responses: assassination; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost |location=Afghanistan |work=The New York Times |date=9 September 2002 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref> The funeral, though in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people.

The assassination of Massoud is believed to have a connection to the [[September 11 attacks]] on US soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. [[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the [[FBI]] until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On 10 September 2001, O'Neill told two of his friends, "We're due. And we're due for something big. ... Some things have happened in Afghanistan. [referring to the assassination of Massoud] I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan. ... I sense a shift, and I think things are going to happen ... soon." O'Neill died on 11 September 2001, when the [[Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] collapsed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first=Mike|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html |title=How much did Afghan leader know?|publisher=CNN|date=6 November 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820231434/http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/11/06/massoud.cable/index.html|archive-date=20 August 2008}}</ref><ref name="PBS">{{cite web |year=2002 |url =https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html|title=The Man Who Knew |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}</ref>

After [[9/11]], Massoud's United Front troops and United Front troops of Abdul Rashid Dostum (who returned from exile) ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul with American air support in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]. From October to December 2001, the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government under Hamid Karzai.

===US-led overthrow of Taliban Government and further battle against Taliban===

====Prelude====
[[File:Taliban-Torkham-2001.jpg|thumb|Taliban border guard in 2001]]

On 20 September 2001, US president [[George W. Bush]], speaking to a joint session of Congress, tentatively blamed Al-Qaeda for the 11 September attacks, stating that the "leadership of Al Qaeda ha[d] great influence in Afghanistan and support[ed] the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country". Bush said, "We condemn the Taliban regime", and went on to state, "Tonight the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban", which he said were "not open to negotiation or discussion":<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date=21 September 2001 |access-date=27 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819021954/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |archive-date=19 August 2010 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/bushaddress_092001.html Text: President Bush Addresses the Nation] Washington Post, 20 September 2017.</ref>

The US petitioned the international community to back a military campaign to overthrow the Taliban. The UN issued two resolutions on terrorism after the 11 September attacks. The resolutions called on all states to "[increase] cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism" and specified consensus recommendations for all countries.<ref>[[:en:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368|United Nations S.C.

The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Abdul Salem Zaeef, responded to the ultimatum by demanding "convincing evidence" that Bin Laden was involved in the attacks, stating "our position is that if America has evidence and proof, they should produce it".  Additionally, the Taliban insisted that any trial of Bin Laden be held in an Afghan court. Zaeef also claimed that "4,000 Jews working in the Trade Center had prior knowledge of the suicide missions, and 'were absent on that day'."  This response was generally dismissed as a delaying tactic, rather than a sincere attempt to cooperate with the ultimatum.<ref name="ReferenceA">Burns, John F.

On 22 September, the [[United Arab Emirates]], and later [[Saudi Arabia]], withdrew recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan's legal government, leaving neighbouring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties. On 4 October, the Taliban agreed to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international [[tribunal]]  that operated according to Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, but Pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety.  On 7 October, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan offered to detain bin Laden and try him under Islamic law if the US made a formal request and presented the Taliban with evidence. A Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Taliban offer, and stated that the US would not negotiate their demands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j-n-v.org/AW_briefings/ARROW_briefing005.htm |title=Briefing 05: The Smoking Gun |publisher=J-n-v.org |date=8 October 2001 |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>

On 7 October 2001, less than one month after the 11 September attacks, the US, aided by the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries including several from the NATO alliance, initiated [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|military action]], bombing Taliban and Al-Qaeda-related camps.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ |title=Afghanistan wakes after night of intense bombings.

The CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) units were the first US forces to enter Afghanistan (many different countries' intelligence agencies were on the ground or operating within theatre before SAD, and SAD are not technically military forces, but civilian paramilitaries). They joined with the Afghan United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) to prepare for the subsequent arrival of US Special Operations forces. The United Front (Northern Alliance) and SAD and [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] combined to overthrow the Taliban with minimal coalition casualties, and without the use of international conventional ground forces. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated in an editorial by John Lehman in 2006:

{{quote|What made the Afghan campaign a landmark in the US Military's history is that it was prosecuted by Special Operations forces from all the services, along with [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] tactical power, operations by the Afghan Northern Alliance and the CIA were equally important and fully integrated.

On 14 October, the Taliban offered to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a neutral country in return for a bombing halt, but only if the Taliban were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/waronterror/story/0,1361,573975,00.html |title=Taliban offers to hand bin Laden to a neutral nation for trial |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 September 2012 |location=London |date=14 October 2001}}</ref> The US rejected this offer, and continued military operations. [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] fell to United Front troops of [[Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor]] and Abdul Rashid Dostum on 9 November, triggering a cascade of provinces falling with minimal resistance.

In November 2001, before the [[Siege of Kunduz|capture of Kunduz]] by United Front troops under the command of [[Mohammad Daud Daud]], thousands of top commanders and regular fighters of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence agents and military personnel, and other volunteers and sympathizers in the [[Kunduz airlift]], dubbed the [[Airlift of Evil]] by US military forces around Kunduz and subsequently used as a term in media reports, were evacuated and airlifted out of [[Kunduz]] by Pakistan Army cargo aircraft to Pakistan Air Force air bases in [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] in Pakistan's [[Northern Areas]].<ref name="www_newyorker_com10"/><ref name=cnn>{{cite news |first=Romesh |last=Ratnescar |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/10/timep.afghanistan.year.later.tm/index.html |title=Afghanistan: One year on |date=10 October 2002 |access-date=5 November 2011 |work=Time}}</ref><ref name="www_msnbc_com11">{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Moran |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3340165 |title=The 'airlift of evil' |date=29 November 2001 |access-date=15 February 2008 |publisher=[[NBC News]]}}</ref><ref name=express>{{cite web |last=[[Press Trust of India]] |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=6813 |title=India protests airlift of Pakistani fighters from Kunduz |date=24 January 2002 |access-date=5 November 2011 |work=[[The Indian Express]]}}</ref><ref name="news_bbc_co_uk12">{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=George |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1677157.stm |title=Kunduz celebrates end of siege |date=26 November 2001 |access-date=15 February 2008 |work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name=descent>{{cite book |title=Descent into Chaos: The United States and the Failure of Nation Building in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia |last=Rashid |first=Ahmed |year=2008 |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[United States]] |isbn=978-0-670-01970-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/descentintochaos00rash }}</ref>

On the night of 12 November, the Taliban retreated south from Kabul. On 15 November, they released eight Western [[aid worker]]s after [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|three months in captivity]]. By 13 November, the Taliban had withdrawn from both Kabul and [[Jalalabad]]. Finally, in early December, the Taliban gave up [[Kandahar]], their last stronghold, dispersing without surrendering.

====Targeted killings====
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
The United States has conducted [[targeted killings]] against Taliban leaders, mainly using [[Special Forces]], and sometimes [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s. British forces also used similar tactics, mostly in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan. During [[Operation Herrick]], British special forces carried out targeted killings against at least fifty high and local Taliban commanders in Helmand Province.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

The Taliban have also used targeted killings. In 2011 alone, they killed notable anti-Taliban leaders, such as former [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], the police chief in northern Afghanistan, the commander of the elite anti-Taliban 303 Pamir Corps, [[Mohammad Daud Daud]], and the police chief of Kunduz, Abdul Rahman Saidkhaili. All of them belonged to the Massoud faction of the United Front. According to Guantanamo Bay charge sheets, the [[United States Department of Defense]] believes the Taliban may maintain a 40-man undercover unit called "Jihad Kandahar", which is used for [[undercover operation]]s, including targeted killings.<ref>[[OARDEC]] (2008).

After the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 11 September 2001 on the United States]], Pakistan has been accused of continuing to support the Taliban, an allegation Pakistan denies.<ref name=Barnes/><ref name="CQ Researcher">{{cite book|last=Researcher|first=CQ|title=Issues in Terrorism and Homeland Security: Selections From CQ Researcher|year=2010|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-9201-5|page=196}}</ref>

With the fall of Kabul to anti-Taliban forces in November 2001, ISI forces worked with and helped Taliban militias who were in full retreat.  In November 2001, Taliban, Al-Qaeda combatants and ISI operatives were safely evacuated from Kunduz on [[Pakistan Army]] cargo aircraft to [[Pakistan Air Force]] bases in [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit]] in Pakistan's [[Northern Areas]] (see [[Kunduz airlift]]). Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf wrote in his memoirs that [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], the former US deputy secretary of state, said Pakistan would be "bombed back to the stone-age" if it continued to support the Taliban, although Armitage has since denied using the "stone age" phrase.<ref name=Lansford-37>{{cite book|last=Lansford|first=Tom|title=9/11 and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: A Chronology and Reference Guide|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-419-1|page=37}}</ref><ref name=Lall>{{cite book|last=Lall|first=Marie|title=International security and the United States: an encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-99254-5|page=10|edition=Volume 1|editor-first=Karl R.|editor-last=DeRouen}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Zahid | last = Hussain | title = Frontline Pakistan: The Struggle With Militant Islam | year = 2007 | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 978-0-85368-769-6 | page = [https://archive.org/details/warindistantcoun0000isby/page/49 49] | quote = However, Pakistani intelligence agencies maintained some degree of cooperation with the Taliban elements fleeing the fighting. | url = https://archive.org/details/warindistantcoun0000isby/page/49 }}</ref><ref name="www_newyorker_com10">{{cite web |first=Seymour M. |last=Hersh |url=http://www.NewYorker.com/fact/content/articles/020128fa_FACT |title=The Getaway |date=28 January 2002 |access-date=15 February 2008 |work=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref><ref name=Morgan>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Matthew J.|title=A Democracy Is Born: An Insider's Account of the Battle Against Terrorism in Afghanistan|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyisborni0000morg|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-275-99999-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/democracyisborni0000morg/page/166 166]}}</ref><ref name=Musharraf>{{cite book|last=Musharraf|first=Pervez|title=In the line of fire: a memoir|year=2006|publisher=The Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-8344-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush/page/201 201]|url=https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush/page/201}}</ref><ref name=Gartenstein-Ross>{{cite book|last=Gartenstein-Ross|first=Daveed|title=Bin Laden's Legacy: Why We're Still Losing the War on Terror|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-15095-5|page=189}}</ref><ref name=Hansen>{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Stig Jarle|title=The Borders of Islam: Exploring Huntington's Faultlines, from Al-Andalus to the Virtual Ummah|year=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15422-2|page=77}}</ref><ref name=Riedel-65>{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce O.|title=Deadly embrace: Pakistan, America, and the future of the global jihad|year=2011|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8157-0557-4|page=65}}</ref>

On 29 May 2006, while according to American website ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' Afghanistan faced "a mounting threat from armed Taliban fighters in the countryside", a US military truck of a convoy in Kabul lost control and plowed into twelve civilian vehicles, killing one and injuring six people. The surrounding crowd got angry and a riot arose, lasting all day ending with 20 dead and 160 injured. When stone-throwing and gunfire had come from a crowd of some 400 men, the US troops had used their weapons "to defend themselves" while leaving the scene, a US military spokesman said. A correspondent for the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in Kabul suggested that this was the outbreak of "a ground swell of resentment" and "growing hostility to foreigners" that had been growing and building since 2004, and may also have been triggered by a US air strike a week earlier in southern Afghanistan killing 30 civilians, where she assumed that "the Taliban had been sheltering in civilian houses".<ref>

The continued support from tribal and other groups in Pakistan, the drug trade, and the small number of NATO forces, combined with the long history of resistance and isolation, indicated that Taliban forces and leaders were surviving. [[Suicide attack]]s and other terrorist methods not used in 2001 became more common. Observers suggested that [[poppy]] eradication, which hurts the livelihoods of those Afghans who have resorted to their production, and civilian deaths caused by airstrikes abetted the resurgence. These observers maintained that policy should focus on "hearts and minds" and on [[economic reconstruction]], which could profit from switching from interdicting to diverting poppy production—to make medicine.<ref>{{cite web

==Condemned Taliban practices==

===Massacre campaigns===
According to a 55-page report by the [[United Nations]], the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic [[massacre]]s against civilians.  UN officials stated that there had been "15 massacres" between 1996 and 2001. They also said, that "[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] himself."  "These are the same type of war crimes as were committed in Bosnia and should be prosecuted in international courts", one UN official was quoted as saying. The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings. Bin Laden's so-called [[055 Brigade]] was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.  The report by the [[United Nations]] quotes "eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people". The Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, in late 2011 stated that cruel behaviour under and by the Taliban had been "necessary".<ref name="Newsday 2001"/><ref name="papillonsartpalace.com"/><ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tolonews.com/en/purso-pal/4847-cruel-behaviour-was-necessary-during-taliban-rule-zaeef-says |title=Taliban spokesman: Cruel behavior was necessary |publisher=Tolonews.com |date=31 December 2011 |access-date=1 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423154739/http://www.tolonews.com/en/purso-pal/4847-cruel-behaviour-was-necessary-during-taliban-rule-zaeef-says |archive-date=23 April 2012 }}</ref>

In 1998, the United Nations accused the Taliban of denying emergency food by the UN's [[World Food Programme]] to 160,000 hungry and starving people "for political and military reasons".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F8B4F98500EA0F8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Associated Press: U.N. says Taliban starving hungry people for military agenda |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=7 January 1998 |access-date=1 September 2012}}</ref> The UN said the Taliban were starving people for their military agenda and using humanitarian assistance as a weapon of war.

On 8 August 1998 the Taliban launched an attack on [[Mazar-i Sharif]]. Of 1500 defenders only 100 survived the engagement. Once in control the Taliban began to kill people indiscriminately. At first shooting people in the street, they soon began to target Hazaras. Women were raped, and thousands of people were locked in containers and left to suffocate. This [[ethnic cleansing]] left an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 dead. At this time [[1998 Iranian diplomats assassination in Afghanistan|ten Iranian diplomats]] and a journalist were killed. Iran assumed the Taliban had murdered them, and mobilised its army, deploying men along the border with Afghanistan. By the middle of September there were 250,000 Iranian personnel stationed on the border. Pakistan mediated and the bodies were returned to Tehran towards the end of the month. The killings of the diplomats had been carried out by [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan|Sipah-e-Sahaba]], a Pakistani Sunni group with close ties to the ISI.  They burned orchards, crops and destroyed irrigation systems, and forced more than 100,000 people from their homes with hundreds of men, women and children still unaccounted for.<ref name=Armajani-207>{{cite book|last=Armajani|first=Jon|title=Modern Islamist Movements: History, Religion, and Politics|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-1742-5|page=207}}</ref><ref name=Riedel-66-7>{{cite book|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=The Search for Al Qaeda: Its Leadership, Ideology, and Future|year=2010|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0451-5|pages=66–67|edition=2nd Revised}}</ref><ref name=Clements3>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=106}}</ref><ref name=Gutman>{{cite book|last=Gutman|first=Roy|title=How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Hijacking of Afghanistan|year=2008|publisher=Institute of Peace Press|isbn=978-1-60127-024-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwemissedstory00gutm/page/142 142]|url=https://archive.org/details/howwemissedstory00gutm/page/142}}</ref><ref name=Tripathi>{{cite book|last=Tripathi|first=Deepak|title=Breeding Ground: Afghanistan and the Origins of Islamist Terrorism|year=2011|publisher=Potomac|isbn=978-1-59797-530-8|page=116}}</ref>

In a major effort to retake the [[Shomali Plains]] to the north of Kabul from the United Front, the Taliban indiscriminately killed civilians, while uprooting and expelling the population. Among others, Kamal Hossein, a special reporter for the UN, reported on these and other [[war crimes]]. In [[Istalif]], a town famous for handmade potteries and which was home to more than 45,000 people, the Taliban gave 24 hours' notice to the population to leave, then completely razed the town leaving the people destitute.<ref name="NPR"/><ref name=Coburn>{{cite book|last=Coburn|first=Noah|title=Bazaar Politics: Power and Pottery in an Afghan Market Town|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0804776721|page=13}}</ref>

In 1999 the town of [[Bamian]] was taken, hundreds of men, women and children were executed. Houses were razed and some were used for forced labour. There was a further massacre at the town of [[Yakaolang]] in January 2001. An estimated 300 people were murdered, along with two delegations of Hazara elders who had tried to intercede.<ref name=Maley2-240>{{cite book|last=Maley|first=William|title=The Afghanistan wars|year=2002|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-80290-8|page=240}}</ref><ref name=Clements4>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=112}}</ref>

By 1999, the Taliban had forced hundreds of thousands of people from the Shomali Plains and other regions conducting a policy of scorched earth burning homes, farm land and gardens.<ref name="NPR"/>

===Human trafficking===
Several Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking, abducting women and selling them into [[sex slavery]] in Afghanistan and Pakistan.<ref name="Time Magazine">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,201892,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Lifting The Veil On Taliban Sex Slavery|date=10 February 2002}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine writes: "The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of revering and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim."<ref name="Time Magazine"/>

The targets for human trafficking were especially women from the Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara and other ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide over slavery, killing themselves. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped.<ref name="Time Magazine"/> Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants, with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses.<ref name="Time Magazine"/> ''Time'' magazine writes: "The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps." Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.<ref name="Time Magazine"/>

Not all Taliban commanders engaged in human trafficking. Many Taliban were opposed to the human trafficking operations conducted by al-Qaeda and other Taliban commanders. Nuruludah, a Taliban commander, is quoted as saying that in the Shomali Plains, he and 10 of his men freed some women who were being abducted by Pakistani members of al-Qaeda. In Jalalabad, local Taliban commanders freed women that were being held by Arab members of al-Qaeda in a camp.<ref name="Time Magazine"/>

===Violence against Afghan civilians===
According to the [[United Nations]], the Taliban and its allies were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009, 75% in 2010 and 80% in 2011.<ref name="UNAMA"/><ref name=Kegley>{{cite book|last=Kegley|first=Charles W.|title=World Politics: Trend and Transformation|year=2011|publisher=Cengage|isbn=978-0-495-90655-1|page=230|author2=Shannon L Blanton }}</ref>

According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Taliban's bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties "sharply escalated in 2006" when "at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants."<ref name=hrw-cbceia>{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/04/16/afghan15688.htm |title=Human Rights News, Afghanistan: Civilians Bear Cost of Escalating Insurgent Attacks |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=17 April 2007 |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/afghanistan0407/ |title=The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan, April 2007, Volume 19, No. 6(C) |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=16 April 2007 |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref>

The United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009.  The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), "for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls' schools" by the Taliban.<ref name="Arnoldy">{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0731/p06s15-wosc.html |title=In Afghanistan, Taliban kills more civilians than US |date= 31 July 2009 |first=Ben |last=Arnoldy }}</ref>

In 2009, Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of [[Hamas]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote:

{{quote|Like Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in southern Afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection. Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence, and ferry arms and ammunition between battles. Female suicide bombers are increasingly common.

===Violence against aid workers and Christians===
Taliban between 2008 and 2012 several times claimed to have assassinated Western and Afghani medical or aid workers in Afghanistan, either for fear of the vaccination of children against [[polio]], or for suspicion that the 'medical workers' were in truth spies, or for suspecting them to be proselytising Christianity.

In August 2008, three Western women (British, Canadian, US) working for [[Humanitarian aid|aid group]] 'International Rescue Committee' were murdered in [[Kabul]]. Taliban claimed to have killed them because they were foreign spies.<ref name="BBC, Oct008">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7679212.stm |title=UK charity worker killed in Kabul|work=BBC News |date=20 October 2008 |access-date=7 October 2017}}</ref> In October 2008, the British woman [[Gayle Williams]] working for Christian UK charity '[[SERVE Afghanistan|Serve Afghanistan]]' – focusing on training and education for disabled persons – was murdered near Kabul.

In August 2010, the Taliban claimed to have murdered 10 medical aid workers passing through [[Badakhshan Province]] on the way from Kabul to [[Nuristan Province]] — but also Afghan Islamic party/militia [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] has claimed those killings. The victims were six Americans, one Briton, one German and two Afghanis, working for self-proclaimed "non-profit, Christian organization" called 'International Assistance Mission'. Taliban said they murdered them because of proselytising Christianity, having Bibles translated in [[Dari language]] in their possession when they were encountered. IAM contended afterwards that they "were not missionaries".<ref>[https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/08/hizbiislam_taliban_b.php 'Hizb-i-Islami, Taliban both claim killing 10 medical workers in northern Afghanistan'].

===Ban on entertainment and recreational activities===
During the Taliban rule of 1996–2001, they banned many recreational activities and games, such as football, kite flying, and chess. General entertainment such as televisions, cinemas, music, VCRs and satellite dishes were also banned.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dld2wJ2Z__4C&pg=PA50|title=Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia|isbn=9780300164848|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|date=20 April 2010}}</ref> It has been reported that when children were caught kiting, a highly popular activity among Afghan children, they would have gotten beaten.<ref name="rferl.org"/>

==Ideology==
{{Islamism sidebar}}
{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

The Taliban's ideology has been described as an "innovative form of ''[[sharia]]'' combining Pashtun tribal codes,"<ref name="Muslim World 2004">''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World,'' (2004).</ref> or [[Pashtunwali]], with radical [[Deobandi]] interpretations of Islam favoured by JUI and its splinter groups. Also contributing to the mix was the [[militant Islamism]] and [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] [[jihadism]] of Osama bin Laden.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=132, 139}}.</ref> Their ideology was a departure from the [[Islamism]] of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} they replaced who tended to be mystical [[Sufism|Sufis]], traditionalists,{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} or radical Islamists{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2017}} inspired by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Ikhwan).<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=87}}.</ref>

According to journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]], at least in the first years of their rule, the Taliban adopted Deobandi and [[Islamist]] anti-nationalist beliefs, and opposed "tribal and feudal structures," eliminating traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=92}}.</ref>

The Taliban strictly enforced their ideology in major cities like [[Herat]], [[Kabul]], and [[Kandahar]]. But in rural areas the Taliban had little direct control, and promoted village [[jirga]]s, so it did not enforce its ideology as stringently in rural areas.<ref>Griffiths 227.</ref>

===(Deobandi) Islamic rules===

The Taliban were averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims. "The Taliban did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the [[Qur'an]]."<ref name="rashid 107">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=107}}.</ref>

===Pashtun cultural influences===
The Taliban frequently used the pre-Islamic Pashtun tribal code, [[Pashtunwali]], in deciding certain social matters. Such is the case with the Pashtun practice of dividing inheritances equally among sons, even though the Qur'an clearly states that women are to receive one-half a man's share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uwf.edu/atcdev/afghanistan/people/Lesson6Pastunwali.html|title=Peoples and Ethnic Groups – Pashtunwali: The Code|work=uwf.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lubnaa.com/article.php?id=301|title=<?php echo $header ?>|website=www.Lubnaa.com|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref>

According to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban "received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/990306-taliban.htm |title=Foreign Military Studies Office, "Whither the Taliban?" by Mr. Ali A.

===Bamyan Buddhas===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|right|Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction]]
In 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree protecting the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]], two 6th-century monumental statues of standing [[buddha]]s carved into the side of a cliff in the [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] valley in the [[Hazarajat]] region of central Afghanistan. But in March 2001, the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar, following a decree stating: "all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed."<ref>{{cite news|first=Luke |last=Harding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html |title=How the Buddha got his wounds|date=3 March 2001|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 August 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

Yahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:

{{quote|It was the spring of 2001. I was in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, together with my brother [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], the leader of the Afghan resistance against the Taliban, and Bismillah Khan, who currently serves as Afghanistan's interior minister. One of our commanders, Commandant Momin, wanted us to see 30 Taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle. My brother agreed to meet them.

I remember that his first question concerned the centuries-old Buddha statues that were dynamited by the Taliban in March of that year, shortly before our encounter. Two Taliban combatants from Kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of Islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed. My brother looked at them and said, this time in Pashto, 'There are still many sun- worshippers in this country. Will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the Earth?'<ref>{{cite news|first=Yahya |last=Massoud |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war |title=Afghans Can Win This War |date=July 2010 |work=Foreign Policy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110042810/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war |archive-date=January 10, 2011 }}</ref>}}

===Consistency===
The Taliban ideology was not static. Before its capture of Kabul, members of the Taliban talked about stepping aside once a government of "good Muslims" took power and law and order were restored. The decision making process of the Taliban in Kandahar was modelled on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what was believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the believers.<ref name="Rashid 2000 95">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=95}}.</ref>

As the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without Omar's visits to other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power.  Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

<blockquote>Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.<ref name="ReferenceD">Interview with Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil in Arabic magazine ''Al-Majallah'', 1996-10-23.</ref></blockquote>

Another evolution of Taliban ideology was Mullah Omar 1999 decree calling for the protection of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]] and the March 2001 destruction of them.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html "How the Buddha got his wounds," ''Guardian'', 2001-03-03.]</ref>

===Explanation of ideology===
The author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology.<ref name="rashid 32">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=32}}.</ref> It is said that the Taliban did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, [[herding]], or [[handicraft]]-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan [[Kinship|lineages]].<ref name="rashid 32"/> In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but also of political survival. Taliban leaders "repeatedly told" Rashid that "if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file."<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=111}}.</ref>

===Criticisms===
The Taliban have been criticised for their strictness toward those who disobeyed their imposed rules, and [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]'s taking of the title of [[Amir al-Mu'minin]].

[[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] was criticised for calling himself [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the [[Prophet Mohammed|Prophet's]] family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country's [[ulema]], whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared Omar the Amir. According to Ahmed Rashid, "no Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] assumed the title before he declared jihad against the [[Sikh]] kingdom in [[Peshawar]]. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans."<ref name="rashid 41-42"/>

Another criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium "[[zakat]]", which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers' disposable income (or wealth).<ref name="rashid 41-42">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=41–42}}.</ref>

Taliban have been compared to the 7th-century [[Kharijites]] for developing extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819100539/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 August 2013|date=19 August 2013|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}</ref>

In particular the Taliban have been accused of takfir towards Shia. After the August 1998 slaughter of 8000 mostly Shia Hazaras non-combatants at Mazar-i-Sharif,  Mullah Niazi, the Taliban commander of the attack and the new governor of Mazar, declared from Mazar's central mosque:
<blockquote>Last year you rebelled against us and killed us. From all your homes you shot at us. Now we are here to deal with you. The Hazaras are not Muslims and now have to kill Hazaras. You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. Wherever you go we will catch you. If you go up we will pull you down by your feet; if you hide below, we will pull you up by your hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364|title=THE MASSACRE IN MAZAR-I SHARIF|website=www.HRW.org|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

===Overview===

The Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords' corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.<ref>Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004</ref>
This popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.

In 2001, the Taliban, ''[[de jure]]'', controlled 85% of Afghanistan. ''[[De facto]]'' the areas under its direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal [[Khan (title)|khans]] and warlords had ''de facto'' direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas.<ref>Griffiths 226.</ref>
[[File:Taliban-herat-2001 retouched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Taliban police patrolling the streets of [[Herat]] in a pick-up truck]]

Rashid described the Taliban government as "a secret society run by [[Kandahar]]is ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial."<ref name="Rashid 2000 98"/> They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:

{{quote|The ''[[Sharia]]'' does not allow politics or political parties. That is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers, just food, clothes, shoes, and weapons. We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1400 years ago, and jihad is our right. We want to recreate the time of the Prophet, and we are only carrying out what the Afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=43}} Interview with Mullah Wakil, March 1996</ref>}}

They modelled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the "believers".<ref name="Rashid 2000 95"/> Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of "good Muslims" took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader's legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance ("[[Bay'ah]]"), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four [[Caliph]]s. On 4 April 1996, Mullah Omar had "the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed" taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun [[mullah]]s below shouted "[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]!" (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

{{quote|Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the ''Sharia''. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority, and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with ''Sharia'' and therefore we reject them.<ref name="ReferenceD"/>}}

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council<ref name="Rashid 2000 98">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=98}}.</ref> or Herat,<ref name="rashid 39-40">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=39–40}}.</ref> Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke [[Dari language|Dari]] or other non-Pashtun tongues.<ref name="rashid 39-40"/> Critics complained that this "lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force."<ref name="rashid 101-102"/>

===Organization===
Consistent with the governance of early Muslims was the absence of state institutions or "a methodology for command and control" that is standard today even among non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases, policy statements, or hold regular press conferences. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, since photography was banned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=5}}.</ref> The "regular army" resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal [[militia]] force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 were non-Afghans).

[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] ministers and deputies were mullahs with a "[[madrasah]] education." Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts to fight when needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=100}}.</ref> At the national level, "all senior [[Tājik people|Tajik]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] bureaucrats" were replaced "with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not." Consequently, the ministries "by and large ceased to function."<ref name="rashid 101-102">{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=101–102}}.</ref>

The Ministry of Finance had neither a budget nor "qualified economist or banker." Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without bookkeeping.

===Conscription===
{{Main|Taliban conscription}}
According to the testimony of [[Guantanamo captive]]s before their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its [[civil service]].<ref name="Flee Taliban">{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Robyn|title=Afghans in Kabul Flee Taliban, Not U.S. Raids|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/13/news/mn-56835|access-date=11 December 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 October 2001}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Afghanistan}}

The Kabul money markets responded positively during the first weeks of the Taliban occupation (1996). But the [[Afghan afghani|Afghani]] soon fell in value.  They imposed a 50% tax on any company operating in the country, and those who failed to pay were attacked.  They also imposed a 6% import tax on anything brought into the country,  and by 1998 had control of the major airports and border crossings which allowed them to establish a monopoly on all trade.  By 2001 the per capita income of the 25&nbsp;million population was under $200,  and the country was close to total economic collapse.  As of 2007 the economy had begun to recover, with estimated foreign reserves of three billion dollars and a 13% increase in economic growth.<ref name="Skaine1"/><ref name=Lansford-147>{{cite book|last=Lansford|first=Tom|title=9/11 and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: A Chronology and Reference Guide|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-419-1|page=147}}</ref><ref name=Marsden>{{cite book|last=Marsden|first=Peter|title=The Taliban: war, religion and the new order in Afghanistan|year=1998|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-522-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/talibanwarreligi0000mars/page/51 51]|url=https://archive.org/details/talibanwarreligi0000mars/page/51}}</ref><ref name=Pugh1>{{cite book|last=Pugh|first=Michael C.|title=War Economies in a Regional Context: Challenges of Transformation|year=2004|publisher=Lynne Rienner|isbn=978-1-58826-211-0|page=48|author2=Neil Cooper Jonathan Goodhand }}</ref><ref name=Castillo>{{cite book|last=Castillo|first=Graciana del|title=Rebuilding War-Torn States: The Challenge of Post-Conflict Economic Reconstruction|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923773-9|page=167}}</ref><ref name=Skaine2>{{cite book|last=Skaine|first=Rosemarie|title=Women of Afghanistan in the Post-Taliban Era: How Lives Have Changed and Where They Stand Today|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3792-4|page=58}}</ref>

Under the Transit treaty between Afghanistan and Pakistan a massive network for smuggling developed. It had an estimated turnover of 2.5&nbsp;billion dollars with the Taliban receiving between $100 and $130&nbsp;million per year. These operations along with the trade from the [[Golden Crescent]] financed the war in Afghanistan and also had the side effect of destroying start up industries in Pakistan. [[Ahmed Rashid]] also explained that the Afghan Transit Trade agreed on by Pakistan was "the largest official source of revenue for the Taliban."<ref name=Nojum1>{{cite book|last=Nojum|first=Neamatollah|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War and the Future of the Region|year=2002|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-29584-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/riseoftalibani00neam/page/178 178]|url=https://archive.org/details/riseoftalibani00neam/page/178}}</ref><ref name=Nojum2>{{cite book|last=Nojum|first=Neamatollah|title=The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War and the Future of the Region|year=2002|publisher=St Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-29584-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/riseoftalibani00neam/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/riseoftalibani00neam/page/186}}</ref><ref name=Chouvy1>{{cite book|last=Chouvy|first=Pierre-Arnaud|title=Opium: uncovering the politics of the poppy|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=52ff}}</ref>

Between 1996 and 1999 Mullah Omar reversed his opinions on the drug trade, apparently as it only harmed [[kafirs]]. The Taliban controlled 96% of Afghanistan's poppy fields and made opium its largest source of taxation. Taxes on opium exports became one of the mainstays of Taliban income and their war economy. According to Rashid, "drug money funded the weapons, ammunition and fuel for the war." In ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Finance Minister of the United Front, Wahidullah Sabawoon, declared the Taliban had no annual budget but that they "appeared to spend US$300 million a year, nearly all of it on war." He added that the Taliban had come to increasingly rely on three sources of money: "poppy, the Pakistanis and bin Laden."<ref name="Chouvy1"/>

In an economic sense it seems he had little choice, as the war of attrition continued with the Northern Alliance the income from continued opium production was all that prevented the country from starvation. By 2000 Afghanistan accounted for an estimated 75% of the world's supply and in 2000 grew an estimated 3276 tonnes of opium from poppy cultivation on 82,171 hectares.  At this juncture Omar passed a decree banning the cultivation of opium, and production dropped to an estimated 74 metric tonnes from poppy cultivation on 1,685 hectares.  Many observers say the ban – which came in a bid for international recognition at the United Nations – was only issued in order to raise opium prices and increase profit from the sale of large existing stockpiles.  1999 had yielded a record crop and had been followed by a lower but still large 2000 harvest. The trafficking of accumulated stocks by the Taliban continued in 2000 and 2001. In 2002, the UN mentioned the "existence of significant stocks of opiates accumulated during previous years of bumper harvests." In September 2001 – before the 11 September attacks against the United States – the Taliban allegedly authorised Afghan peasants to sow opium again.<ref name="Chouvy1"/><ref name=Shaffer3>{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=Brenda|title=The limits of culture: Islam and foreign policy|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69321-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/limitsofculturei0000unse/page/283 283]|url=https://archive.org/details/limitsofculturei0000unse/page/283}}</ref><ref name=Thourni>{{cite book|last=Thourni|first=Francisco E.|title=The Organized Crime Community: Essays in Honor of Alan A.

There was also an environmental toll to the country, heavy deforestation from the illegal trade in timber with hundreds of acres of pine and cedar forests in [[Kunar Province]] and [[Loya Paktia|Paktya]] being cleared. Throughout the country millions of acres were denuded to supply timber to the Pakistani markets, with no attempt made at reforestation, which has led to significant environmental damage. By 2001, when the [[Afghan Interim Administration]] took power the country's infrastructure was in ruins, Telecommunications had failed, the road network was destroyed and Ministry of Finance buildings were in such a state of disrepair some were on the verge of collapse.  On 6 July 1999 then president [[Bill Clinton]] signed into effect executive order 13129. This order implemented a complete ban on any trade between America and the Taliban regime and on 10 August they froze £5000,000 in Ariana assets. On 19 December 2000 UN resolution 1333 was passed. It called for all assets to be frozen and for all states to close any offices belonging to the Taliban.  This included the offices of [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]].  In 1999 the UN had passed resolution 1267 which had banned all international flights by Ariana apart from preapproved humanitarian missions.<ref name=Griffin>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Michael|title=Reaping the whirlwind: the Taliban movement in Afghanistan|url=https://archive.org/details/reapingwhirlwind00grif|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1274-3|page=[https://archive.org/details/reapingwhirlwind00grif/page/147 147]}}</ref><ref name=Wehr>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first=Kevin|title=Green Culture: An A-to-Z Guide|year=2011|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-9693-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/greencultureatoz0000unse/page/223 223]|url=https://archive.org/details/greencultureatoz0000unse/page/223}}</ref><ref name=Rashid>{{cite book|last=Rashid|first=Ahmed|title=Taliban: Islam, oil and the new great game in central Asia|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-830-4|page=187}}</ref><ref name=Clements>{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Frank|title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a historical encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-402-8|page=148}}</ref><ref name=Bennett>{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Adam|title=Reconstructing Afghanistan|year=2005|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-1-58906-324-2|page=29|edition=illustrated}}</ref><ref name=Farah>{{cite book|last1=Farah|first1=Douglas|title=Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-26196-5|page=146|first2=Stephen |last2=Braun }}</ref><ref name=Askari>{{cite book|last=Askari|first=Hossein|title=Economic sanctions: examining their philosophy and efficacy|year=2003|publisher=Potomac|isbn=978-1-56720-542-8|page=56}}</ref><ref name=Pillar>{{cite book|last=Pillar|first=Paul R.|title=Terrorism and U.S. foreign policy|year=2003|publisher=Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-7077-0|page=77}}</ref>

==International relations==
During its time in power (1996–2001), at its height ruling 90% of Afghanistan, the Taliban regime, or "[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]", gained [[diplomatic recognition]] from only three states: the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], all of which provided substantial aid. The other nations, including the [[United Nations]], recognised the government of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] (1992–2002) (parts of whom were part of the [[Northern Alliance|United Front, also called Northern Alliance]]) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Regarding its relations with the rest of the world, the Taliban's Emirate of Afghanistan held a [[Foreign policy|policy]] of [[isolationism]]: "The Taliban believe in non-interference in the affairs of other countries and similarly desire no outside interference in their country's internal affairs".{{sfn|Matinuddin|1999|page=42}}

In December 1999, [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] en route from [[Kathmandu]] to [[Delhi]] was hijacked and taken to [[Kandahar]]. The Taliban moved its militias near the hijacked aircraft, supposedly to prevent [[Special Forces of India|Indian special forces]] from storming the aircraft, and stalled the negotiations between India and the hijackers for days. ''[[The New York Times]]'' later reported that there were credible links between the hijackers and the Taliban. As a part of the deal to free the plane, India released three militants. The Taliban gave a safe passage to the hijackers and the released militants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/07ter.htm |title=Bombay terrorist reveals links with IC 814 hijackers |publisher=Rediff.com |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GH30Df01.html |title=India reaches out to Afghanistan |work=Asia Times |date=30 August 2005 |access-date=2 September 2012}}</ref>

Following the hijacking, India drastically increased its efforts to help Massoud, providing an arms depot in [[Dushanbe]], [[Tajikistan]].  India also provided a wide range of high-altitude warfare equipment, helicopter technicians, medical services, and tactical advice.  According to one report, Indian military support to anti-Taliban forces totalled US$70&nbsp;million, including five [[Mil Mi-17]] helicopters, and US$8&nbsp;million worth of high-altitude equipment in 2001.  India extensively supported the new administration in Afghanistan,  leading several reconstruction projects and by 2001 had emerged as the country's largest regional donor.<ref>

In the wake of [[Terrorism in India|terrorist attacks in India]], there have been growing concerns about fundamentalist organisations such as the Taliban seeking to expand their activities into India. During the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] which was co-hosted in India, Pakistani Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] and Interpol chief [[Ronald Noble]] revealed that a terrorist bid to disrupt the tournament had been foiled; following a conference with Noble, Malik said that the Taliban had begun to base their activities in India with reports from neighbouring countries exposing their activities in the country and a Sri Lankan terrorist planning to target cricketers was arrested in Colombo.

Afghan officials implied the Pakistani ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy. Numerous US officials have accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a "strategic hedge" to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once US troops exit the region.

From 2010, a report by a leading British institution also claimed that Pakistan's intelligence service still today has a strong link with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Published by the [[London School of Economics]], the report said that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has an "official policy" of support for the Taliban. It said the ISI provides funding and training for the Taliban, and that the agency has representatives on the so-called [[Quetta Shura]], the Taliban's leadership council. It is alleged that the [[Quetta Shura]] is exiled in [[Quetta]].

"Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude," the report said. The report also linked high-level members of the Pakistani government with the Taliban. It said [[Asif Ali Zardari]], the Pakistani president, met with senior Taliban prisoners in 2010 and promised to release them. Zardari reportedly told the detainees they were only arrested because of American pressure. "The Pakistan government's apparent duplicity – and awareness of it among the American public and political establishment – could have enormous geopolitical implications," Waldman said. "Without a change in Pakistani behaviour it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency." Afghan officials have long been suspicious of the ISI's role. [[Amrullah Saleh]], the former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, told Reuters that the ISI was "part of a landscape of destruction in this country".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6571VE20100608 | title=Afghan ex-intel chief opposed Karzai peace plan | date=8 June 2010 | work=Reuters}}</ref>

During 2008 the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides or lay down their arms; the proceeding year they signalled their support of opening negotiations with the Taliban.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/2529278/British-cash-to-buy-off-Taliban-goes-to-farmers.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=British cash to buy off Taliban 'goes to farmers' |first=Nick |last=Meo |date=9 August 2008 |access-date=9 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/8628150 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 January 2008 |access-date=9 April 2010 |title=UK news}}</ref>

The United States never recognised the Taliban government in Afghanistan. Ahmed Rashid states that the US indirectly supported the Taliban through its ally in [[Pakistan]] between 1994 and 1996 because Washington viewed the Taliban as anti-[[Iran–United States relations|Iranian]], [[Anti-Shi'ism|anti-Shia]] and potentially pro-Western.  Washington furthermore hoped that the Taliban would support development planned by the US-based oil company ''[[Unocal]]''. For example, it made no comment when the Taliban captured Herat in 1995, and expelled thousands of girls from schools. In late 1997, American Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] began to distance the US from the Taliban, and the American-based oil company [[Unocal]] withdrew from negotiations on pipeline construction from Central Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=176}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=175–8}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=177}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/38115.stm |work=BBC News |title=US pledges support for Afghan oil pipeline if Taliban makes peace |date=10 December 1997 |access-date=9 April 2010}}</ref>

One day before the August 1998 capture of Mazar, bin Laden affiliates [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombed two US embassies]] in Africa, killing 224 and wounding 4,500, mostly Africans. The US responded by launching cruise missiles on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing over 20 though failing to kill bin Laden or even many Al-Qaeda. Mullah Omar condemned the missile attack and American President [[Bill Clinton]]. Saudi Arabia expelled the Taliban envoy in protest over the refusal to turn over bin Laden, and after Mullah Omar allegedly insulted the Saudi royal family. In mid-October the UN [[Security Council]] voted unanimously to ban commercial aircraft flights to and from Afghanistan, and freeze its bank accounts worldwide.<ref>Reuters, "Taliban blame Clinton scam for attacks", 21 August 1998.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=138, 231}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=78}}.</ref>

Adjusting its [[counterinsurgency]] strategy, in October 2009, the US announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/28/afghanistan.taliban.pay/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=U.S. set to pay Taliban members to switch sides |access-date=9 April 2010 |date=29 October 2009}}</ref><!--here-->

On 26 November 2009, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]], President [[Hamid Karzai]] said there is an "urgent need" for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |title=IPS Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |access-date=27 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611055814/http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |archive-date=11 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/06/right-after-interviewing-karzai/ |publisher=CNN |access-date=9 April 2010 |title=Right after interviewing&nbsp;Karzai |date=6 December 2009}}</ref>

In December 2009, Asian Times Online reported that the Taliban had offered to give the US "legal guarantees" that they would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries, and that there had been no formal American response.<ref name="×.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KL17Df02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan |work=Asia Times |date=17 December 2009 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

On 6 December, US officials indicated that they have not ruled out talks with the Taliban. Several days later it was reported that Gates saw potential for reconciliation with the Taliban, but not with Al-Qaeda. Furthermore, he said that reconciliation would politically end the insurgency and the war. But he said reconciliation must be on the Afghan government's terms, and that the Taliban must be subject to the sovereignty of the government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Homan |first=Timothy R. |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aUO6eLdxBxqo&pos=9 |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=6 December 2009 |access-date=27 August 2010 |title=Talks With Taliban Not Ruled Out, U.S. Officials Say (Update1) |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613163056/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087 |archive-date=13 June 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/666993 |title=Pentagon sees reconciliation with Taliban |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=11 September 2001 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

In an interview with [[Palgrave Macmillan]] about relations between the US and the Taliban, American academic Dr. [[Jonathan Cristol]] argued that Taliban leaders "have been willing to negotiate, but from a position of relative strength and their goal is no longer a warm relationship with the US—that ship sailed long ago."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/blogs/perspectives-in-politics-international-studies/jonathan-cristol|title=Jonathan Cristol {{!}} Palgrave|website=www.palgrave.com|language=en|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> In March 2020, the USA began a gradual withdrawal of its troops, to which they have agreed in a peace accord with the Taliban.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/09/us-begins-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-official-says-124368|title=U.S. begins troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, official says|agency=Associated Press|website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref>

===United Nations and NGOs===
Despite the aid of [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) given (see [[#Afghanistan during Taliban rule|§ Afghanistan during Taliban rule]]), the Taliban's attitude in 1996–2001 toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion. The UN did not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, most foreign donors and aid workers were non-Muslims, and the Taliban vented fundamental objections to the sort of 'help' the UN offered. As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it in 1997:

{{quote|Let us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to [[adultery]] and herald the destruction of Islam. In any Islamic country where adultery becomes common, that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves. Anyone who talks to us should do so within Islam's framework. The Holy Koran cannot adjust itself to other people's requirements, people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the Holy Koran.<ref>Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada, June 1997 interview with Ahmed Rashid; {{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=111–112}}.</ref>}}

In July 1998, the Taliban closed "all NGO offices" by force after those organisations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.<ref name=bmj /> One month later the UN offices were also shut down.<ref name=rashid,71 />

Around 2000, the UN drew up sanctions against officials and leaders of Taliban, because of their harbouring [[Osama bin Laden]]. Several of the Taliban leaders have subsequently been killed.<ref name=telegraphJan2010 />

In 2009, [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Ed Miliband]] and US Secretary [[Hillary Clinton]] had called for talks with 'regular Taliban fighters' while bypassing their top leaders who supposedly were 'committed to global jihad'. [[Kai Eide]], the top UN official in Afghanistan, called for talks with Taliban at the highest level, suggesting [[Mullah Omar]]—even though Omar had recently dismissed such overtures as long as foreign troops were in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/un-official-calls-for-talks-with-taliban-leaders-news-international-jicuarhgaeb.html |title=UN official calls for talks with taliban leaders |publisher=sify.com |date=2 August 2009|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref>

In 2010, the UN lifted sanctions on the Taliban, and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists. In 2010 the US and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.<ref name=telegraphJan2010>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7067537/UN-lift-sanctions-on-Taliban-to-build-peace-in-Afghanistan.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=UN: lift sanctions on Taliban to build peace in Afghanistan |first=Ben |last=Farmer |date=25 January 2010 |access-date=9 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/25/UN-Reduce-Taliban-names-on-terror-list/UPI-69591264400185/ |title=UN Reduce Taliban names on terror list |agency=United Press International |date=25 January 2010 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/01/2010125185642602982.html |title=Asia News |publisher=english.aljazeera.net |date=26 January 2010 |access-date=27 August 2010}}</ref>

===Militant outfits===
====Al-Qaeda====
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, November 2001.]]
In 1996, bin Laden moved to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]]. He came without invitation, and sometimes irritated Mullah Omar with his declaration of war and fatwas against citizens of third-party countries,  but relations between the two groups improved over time, to the point that Mullah Omar rebuffed his group's patron Saudi Arabia, insulting Saudi minister [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud|Prince Turki]] while reneging on an earlier promise to turn bin Laden over to the Saudis.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=246–247, 287–288}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=288–289}}.</ref>

Bin Laden was able to forge an [[military alliance|alliance]] between the Taliban and [[al-Qaeda]]. The al-Qaeda-trained [[055 Brigade]] integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001. Several hundred Arab and Afghan fighters sent by bin Laden assisted the Taliban in the [[Mazar-i-Sharif#1997–1998 civil unrest|Mazar-e-Sharif slaughter in 1998]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=139}}.</ref> From 1996 to 2001, the organisation of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become a virtual state within the Taliban state. The British newspaper [[Telegraph Media Group|''The Telegraph'']] stated in September 2001 that 2,500 Arabs under command of Bin Laden fought for the Taliban.<ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph">{{cite news|url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1340244/Afghanistan-resistance-leader-feared-dead-in-blast.html |title =Afghanistan resistance leader feared dead in blast| publisher = Ahmed Rashid in the Telegraph| location= London| date= 11 September 2001}}</ref>

Taliban-al-Qaeda connections were also strengthened by the reported marriage of one of bin Laden's sons to Omar's daughter. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden may have helped finance the Taliban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=1328# |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311034029/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=1328%23 |archive-date=11 March 2007 }}, archived from [http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=1328 the original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818155310/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=1328 |date=18 August 2006 }} on 11 March 2011.</ref><ref>[[Lawrence Wright]] claims bin Laden was almost completely broke at this time, cut off from his family income, and fleeced by the Sudanese.{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=222–223}}.</ref>

After the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 US embassy bombings]] in Africa, [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists#Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] and several al-Qaeda members were indicted in U.S. criminal court.  The Taliban rejected [[extradition]] requests by the US, variously claiming that bin Laden had "gone missing",  or that Washington "cannot provide any evidence or any proof" that bin Laden is involved in terrorist activities and that "without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin... he is a free man."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/binladen/usbinladen1.pdf |title=Indictments |access-date=2 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324205702/http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/binladen/usbinladen1.pdf |archive-date=24 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>

Evidence against bin Laden included courtroom testimony and [[satellite phone]] records.

At the end of 2008, the Taliban was in talks to sever all ties with al-Qaeda.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview | publisher=CNN | title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805103333/http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/14/embassy.bombing.02/index.html|archive-date=5 August 2004}}</ref>

In 2011, Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn at New York University's Center on International Cooperation claimed that the two groups did not get along at times before the 11 September attacks, and they have continued to fight since on account of their differences.<ref>{{cite web|first=Noel |last=Brinkerhoff |url=http://www.allgov.com/US_and_the_World/ViewNews/Surprise_Taliban_and_Al_Qaeda_are_Worlds_Apart_110209 |title=Surprise!

In July 2012, an anonymous senior-ranking Taliban commander stated that "Our people consider al-Qaeda to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens. Some even concluded that al-Qaeda are actually the spies of America. Originally, the Taliban were naive and ignorant of politics and welcomed al-Qaeda into their homes. But al-Qaeda abused our hospitality."

====Malakand Taliban====
Malakand Taliban is a militant outfit led by Sufi Muhammad and his son in law Molvi Fazalullah.  Sufi Muhammad is in Pakistani government custody; Molvi Fazalullah is believed to be in Afghanistan.  In the last week of May 2011, eight security personnel and civilians fell victim to four hundred armed Taliban who attacked Shaltalo check post in Dir, a frontier District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, located a few kilometres away from the Afghan border. Although they have been linked with Waziristan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the connection between these two groups was of a symbolic nature.<ref name="bare_url_a">{{cite web|first=Akbar |last=Mayo |url=http://outlookafghanistan.net/topics.php?post_id=828 |title=Rise of Malakand Taliban |publisher=The Daily Outlook Afghanistan |date=8 June 2011 |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

====Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (Pakistani Taliban)====
{{Main|Islamic Emirate of Waziristan|War in North-West Pakistan|Battle of Wana|Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan}}

Before the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban (Pakistan), some of their leaders and fighters were part of the 8,000 Pakistani militants fighting in the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|War in Afghanistan (1996–2001)]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] against the [[United Islamic Front]] and [[NATO]] forces.<ref name="Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph" /> Most of them hail from the Pakistani side of the Af-Pak border regions. After the fall of the Afghan Taliban in late 2001 most Pakistani militants including members of today's TTP fled home to Pakistan.

After the creation of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in 2007, headed by [[Baitullah Mehsud]],  its members have officially defined goals to establish their rule over Pakistan's [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]. They engage the Pakistani army in heavy combat operations. Some intelligence analysts believe that the TTP's attacks on the Pakistani government, police and army strained the TTP's relations with the Afghan Taliban.<ref name=Tighe-Katz>{{cite news|last1=Tighe|first1=Paul|last2=Katz|first2=Ian|name-list-style=amp|title=Pakistan Challenges Taliban to Show Leader Mehsud Still Alive|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=akFq_Knl5Gd0|publisher=Bloomberg|date=10 August 2009|access-date=9 August 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720134650/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=akFq_Knl5Gd0|archive-date=20 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=scott/><ref name=sanctionsunc/>

The Afghan Taliban and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan differ greatly in their history, leadership and goals although they share a common interpretation of Islam and are both predominantly Pashtun.<ref name=scott>{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Shane |title=Insurgents Share a Name, but Pursue Different Goals |date=22 October 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/world/asia/23taliban.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=26 January 2011}}</ref> The Afghan Taliban have no affiliation with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and routinely deny any connection to the TTP. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban stating that:

{{quote|We don't like to be involved with them, as we have rejected all affiliation with Pakistani Taliban fighters ...

It is alleged that Afghan Taliban relied on support by the Pakistani army in the past and are still supported by them today in their campaign to control Afghanistan. Regular Pakistani army troops fought alongside the Afghan Taliban in the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)|War in Afghanistan (1996–2001)]]. Major leaders of the Afghan Taliban including [[Mullah Omar]], [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] and [[Siraj Haqqani]] are believed to enjoy or have enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan. In 2006 [[Jalaluddin Haqqani]] was allegedly called a 'Pakistani asset' by a senior official of Inter-Services Intelligence. Pakistan denies any links with Haqqani or other terrorist groups. Haqqani himself has denied any links with Pakistan as well.<ref name="Webster University Press Book" /><ref name="nytimes 2008-09-09" /><ref name="George Washington University"/><ref name=autogenerated4>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/world/asia/09iht-09pstan.15996896.html U.S. attack on Taliban kills 23 in Pakistan], [[The New York Times]], 9 September 2008</ref><ref name="newser1">{{cite web |last=Spak |first=Kevin |url=http://www.newser.com/story/130046/haqqani-denies-link-with-pakistan.html |title=Haqqani Denies Link With Pakistan – And insists it didn't assassinate peace envoy Burhanuddin Rabbani |publisher=Newser.com |date=3 October 2011 |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="armytimes1">{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/10/ap-haqqani-denies-links-pakistani-government-100311/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117093139/http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/10/ap-haqqani-denies-links-pakistani-government-100311/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 January 2013 |title=Haqqani denies links to Pakistani government |work=Army Times |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref><ref name="windsorstar1">{{cite news |last=Mullen |first=Mike |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=3d2d9649-7d20-47c9-9aaf-0330abc741a4 |title=Pakistan denies links to Haqqani network |publisher=Windsorstar.com|agency=Reuters |date=30 September 2011 |access-date=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002215555/http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=3d2d9649-7d20-47c9-9aaf-0330abc741a4 |archive-date=2 October 2013}}</ref><ref name="tribune1">{{cite news |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/265783/haqqanis-deny-killing-afghan-peace-envoy-bbc/ |agency=Agence France-Presse |title=Haqqani network denies links to ISI: BBC |work=The Express Tribune |access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] asked the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in late 2008 and early 2009 to stop attacks inside Pakistan, to change their focus as an organisation and to fight the [[Afghan National Army]] and [[ISAF]] forces in [[Afghanistan]] instead.  In late December 2008 and early January 2009 he sent a delegation, led by former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] [[Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul|Mullah Abdullah Zakir]], to persuade leading members of the TTP to put aside differences with Pakistan.<ref name=gall2009327/>

Some regional experts state the common name "Taliban" may be more misleading than illuminating.<ref name=scott/>
Gilles Dorronsoro, a scholar of [[South Asia]] currently at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Washington says:

{{quote|The fact that they have the same name causes all kinds of confusion.<ref name=scott/>}}

As the Pakistani Army began offensives against the Pakistani Taliban, many unfamiliar with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar which was not the case.<ref name=scott/>

The Pakistani Taliban were put under sanctions by [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] for terrorist attacks in Pakistan and the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]].<ref name=sanctionsunc>[http://www.rediff.com/news/report/unsc-slaps-sanctions-on-pakistani-taliban/20110730.htm UNSC slaps sanctions on Pakistani Taliban], 30 July 2011, rediff.com</ref>
