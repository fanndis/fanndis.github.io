'''Capital One Arena''' is an [[indoor arena]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Located in the [[Penn Quarter]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., the arena sits atop the [[Gallery Place (WMATA station)|Gallery Place]] [[rapid transit]] station of the [[Washington Metro]]. It has been largely considered to be a commercial success and is regarded as one of the driving catalysts of the revitalization of Washington, D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood.<ref name="espn">{{cite web |title=Name Change: MCI Center to be Verizon Center|agency=Associated Press|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2283463|work=[[ESPN]]|date=January 7, 2006|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

Owned and operated by [[Monumental Sports & Entertainment]], it is the home arena of the [[Washington Capitals]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], the [[Washington Wizards]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and the [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University men's basketball team]]. It was also home to the [[Washington Mystics]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] from 1998 to 2018 until they moved to the [[St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena]] in [[Southeast (Washington, D.C.)|southeast Washington]] for the 2019 season.

==History==
The arena was built in the mid-1990s solely with private financing by [[Abe Pollin]], and is situated on top of land leased from the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. It opened on December 2, 1997, as the '''[[MCI Inc.|MCI]] Center'''. Nearly a decade later, in January 2006, [[Verizon Communications]] purchased MCI and the arena's name was changed accordingly to '''Verizon Center'''.<ref name="espn"/> The following year, in 2007, the "first true indoor high-definition [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[scoreboard]]" was installed in the arena.<ref>{{cite web|title=Verizon Center Shows off "First True Indoor HD LED Scoreboard"|url=http://hdtv.engadget.com/2007/09/28/verizon-center-shows-off-first-true-indoor-hd-led-scoreboard/|work=Engadget|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723192558/http://hdtv.engadget.com/2007/09/28/verizon-center-shows-off-first-true-indoor-hd-led-scoreboard/#|archive-date=2011-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Verizon Center Marks 10th Anniversary|first=David|last=Nakamura|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/01/AR2007120101486.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 2, 2007|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

On June 10, 2010, following Pollin's death in November 2009, the Pollin family sold the arena, along with the Washington Wizards and the Washington-Baltimore area [[Ticketmaster]] franchise, to [[Ted Leonsis]], who already owned the arena's other tenant, the Washington Capitals. Leonsis subsequently formed a new management company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/10/AR2010061002827.html</ref>

In the professional fighting world, the arena was home to [[Mike Tyson]]'s final fight ([[Mike Tyson vs. Kevin McBride]]) on June 11, 2005<ref>[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2005-06-11-tyson-mcbride_x.htm Tyson Announces Retirement After Quitting vs. McBride], ''USA Today'', 2005-06-12, Retrieved on 2013-09-01</ref> and on October 1, 2011, [[UFC Live: Cruz vs. Johnson]] was held at the arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/25493/ufc-on-versus-6-sets-event-series-attendance-and-live-gate-records.mma|title=UFC on Versus 6 sets event series' attendance and live-gate records|work=[[MMAjunkie.com]]|date=October 2, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510195055/http://mmajunkie.com/news/25493/ufc-on-versus-6-sets-event-series-attendance-and-live-gate-records.mma|archive-date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

The arena has hosted [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] rounds several times, with first and second round events in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2011 and hosted the regional finals in 2006, 2013 and 2019.<ref>https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/Georgetown-University-Verizon-Center-to-Host-2019-NCAA-March-Madness-Games-419781573.html</ref> Most notably the [[2005–06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team]] advanced to the Final Four in the arena. The arena hosted the 2009 "Frozen Four," the final round of the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]].

The arena has hosted two all star games: the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]] and the [[2007 WNBA All-Star Game]].

The venue also hosted both the [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals]] and the [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals]], the latter of which saw the Capitals win the first [[Stanley Cup]] championship in team history, and the first major sports championship to Washington, D.C. since the 1992 [[Washington Redskins]].

On October 2, 2019, the Capital One Arena hosted ''[[AEW Dynamite]]'', the first televised professional wrestling event by [[All Elite Wrestling]].

== Criticism ==
=== Gentrification ===
When the arena opened, there was concern that it would lead to the displacement of Chinese businesses and culture in the area that is the city's [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Chinatown]].<ref name="wapo20090129">{{cite news |title=The Shrinking of Chinatown|first=Stephen|last=Lowman|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/28/AR2009012801315.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 28, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}</ref> The surrounding area has indeed been dramatically [[Gentrification|gentrified]], and most of the Chinese residents and businesses who lived and operated in the neighborhood when the arena first opened have been displaced because of the spike in real estate prices.<ref name="wapo20110710">{{cite news |title=Wah Luck House Maintains Culture of Dying D.C.

=== Ice quality issues===
In December 2007, then-Capitals captain [[Chris Clark (ice hockey)|Chris Clark]] gained a bit of press by stating that he believed the arena had the worst ice in the NHL. "There's a lot of ruts in the ice. It's soft. It's wet half the time. I could see a lot of injuries coming from the ice there. It could cost [players] their jobs... Even guys on other teams say the same thing. When we're facing off, they say, 'How do you guys play on this?'" Capitals owner [[Ted Leonsis]] addressed this criticism directly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Toughness|first=Ted|last=Leonsis|url=http://www.tedstake.com/?p=1395|work=Ted's Take|date=December 6, 2007|accessdate=December 6, 2007}}</ref> The ice quality issue has been persistent both since the opening of the facility and with the Capitals franchise in general.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Caps and Bad Ice: A History|first=Dan|last=Steinberg|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2009/02/the_caps_and_bad_ice_a_history.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 10, 2009|accessdate=February 10, 2009}}</ref>  Since Leonsis' acquisition of the facility, the quality of the ice has gotten better{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} and number of complaints has noticeably decreased. During playoff games, the arena installs a system to help remove hot air and humidity to maintain the ice conditions during warmer times of the year.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
