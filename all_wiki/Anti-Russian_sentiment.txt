There is the question of whether or not negative attitudes towards Russia and frequent criticism of the Russian government in western media contributes to negative attitudes towards Russian people and culture.

On 19 October 1797 the [[French Directory]] received a document from a Polish general, [[Michał Sokolnicki]], entitled "Aperçu sur la Russie". This became known as the so-called "[[Testament of Peter the Great]]" and was first published in October 1812, during the Napoleonic wars, in Charles Louis-Lesur's much-read ''Des progrès de la puissance russe'': this was at the behest of [[Napoleon I]], who ordered a series of articles to be published showing that "Europe is inevitably in the process of becoming booty for Russia".<ref>{{cite book |last=Neumann |first=Iver B. |title=Europe's post-Cold War memory of Russia: cui bono? |work=Memory and power in post-war Europe: studies in the presence of the past |editor-first=Jan-Werner |editor-last=Müller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |page=132 |isbn=978-0-5210-0070-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wOsSG0K8hCYC&pg=PA132 }}</ref><ref name=mcnally>{{cite journal|last=McNally|first=Raymond T.|title=The Origins of Russophobia in France: 1812-1830|journal=American Slavic and East European Review|volume=17|issue=2|pages=173–189|date=April 1958|doi=10.2307/3004165|jstor=3004165}}</ref> Subsequent to the Napoleonic wars, propaganda against Russia was continued by Napoleon's former confessor, Dominique Georges-Frédéric de Pradt, who in a series of books portrayed Russia as a "despotic" and "Asiatic" power hungry to conquer Europe.{{sfnp|Neumann|2002|p=133}} With reference to Russia's new constitutional laws in 1811 the [[Savoy]]ard philosopher [[Joseph de Maistre]] wrote the now famous statement: "Every nation gets the government it deserves" ("Toute nation a le gouvernement qu'elle mérite").<ref name="Latham1906">{{cite book|last=Latham|first=Edward|title=Famous Sayings and Their Authors: A Collection of Historical Sayings in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Latin|url=https://archive.org/details/famoussayingsan00lathgoog|year=1906|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein|page=[https://archive.org/details/famoussayingsan00lathgoog/page/n200 181]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D8yVAC8CtO4C|publisher=Little Brown & Company|isbn=9780316735872}}</ref>

In the 1815-1840 period, British commentators began complaining about the extreme conservatism of Russia and its efforts to stop or reverse reforms.<ref>John Howes  Gleason, ''The Genesis Of Russophobia In Great Britain'' (1950) pp 16-56.</ref>  Fears grew that Russia had plans to cut off communications between Britain and India and was looking to conquer Afghanistan to pursue that goal.  This led to the British policies known as the "[[Great Game]]" to stop Russian expansion in [[Central Asia]].

In 1867, [[Fyodor Tyutchev]], a Russian poet, diplomat and member of [[His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery]], introduced the actual term of "russophobia" in a letter to his daughter Anna Aksakova on 20 September 1867, where he applied it to a number of pro-Western [[Liberalism in Russia|Russian liberals]] who, pretending that they were merely following their [[liberalism|liberal]] principles, developed a negative attitude towards their own country and always stood on a pro-Western and anti-Russian position, regardless of any changes in the Russian society and having a blind eye on any violations of these principles in the West, "violations in the sphere of justice, morality, and even civilization". He put the emphasis on the [[irrationality]] of this sentiment.<ref name=Shirinyants>Ширинянц А.А., Мырикова А.В. «Внутренняя» русофобия и «польский вопрос» в России XIX в.

In 1843 the [[Marquis de Custine]] published his hugely successful 1800-page, four-volume travelogue ''[[La Russie en 1839]]''. Custine's scathing narrative reran what were by now clichés which presented Russia as a place where "the veneer of European civilization was too thin to be credible". Such was its huge success that several official and pirated editions quickly followed, as well as condensed versions and translations in German, Dutch, and English. By 1846 approximately 200 thousand copies had been sold.<ref>Fisher, David C. "Russia and the Crystal Palace 1851" in ''Britain, the Empire, and the World at the Great Exhibition of 1851'' ed.

The influential British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] wrote controversially on Russia, that the oppression in the country, rooted in the [[Russian Revolution|Red Revolution]], perhaps was "the fruit of some beastliness in the Russian nature", also attributing "cruelty and stupidity" to tyranny in both the "Old Russia" (tsarist) and "New Russia" (Soviet).<ref>''[https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Essays_in_Persuasion/A_Short_View_of_Russia A Short View of Russia, Essays in Persuasion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125030854/https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Essays_in_Persuasion/A_Short_View_of_Russia |date=2018-11-25 }}'', (London 1932) John Maynard Keynes, 297-312</ref>

In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi party]] viewed the Soviet Union as populated by Slavs ruled by "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]]" masters.<ref>[[Rolf-Dieter Müller|Müller, Rolf-Dieter]], [[Gerd R.

Hitler stated in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' his belief that the Russian state was the work of German elements in the country and not of the Slavs:

{{quote|Here, Fate itself seems desirous of giving us a sign. By handing Russia to Bolshevism, it robbed the Russian nation of that intelligentsia which previously brought about and guaranteed its existence as a state. For the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia, but only an excellent example of the state-forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race.<ref>Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Volume One - A Reckoning, Chapter XIV: Eastern Orientation or Eastern Policy</ref>}}

A secret Nazi plan, the [[Generalplan Ost]] called for the enslavement, expulsion or extermination of most Slavic peoples in Europe. Approximately 2.8 million [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]] died of starvation, mistreatment, or executions in just eight months of 1941–42.<ref>[[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]] (2010), ''Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction'' (2nd ed.), p.271. – {{" ' "}} Next to the Jews in Europe," wrote [[Alexander Werth]],' "the biggest single German crime was undoubtedly the extermination by hunger, exposure and in other ways of . . . Russian war prisoners." The murder of at least 3.3 million Soviet POWs is one of the least-known of modern genocides; there is still no full-length book on the subject in English. It also stands as one of the most intensive genocides of all time: "a holocaust that devoured millions," as [[Catherine Merridale]] acknowledges. The large majority of POWs, some 2.8 million, were killed in just eight months of 1941–42, a rate of slaughter matched (to my knowledge) only by the 1994 Rwanda genocide."</ref>

On July 13, 1941, three weeks after the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], Nazi SS leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] told the group of Waffen SS men:

{{quote |
This is an ideological battle and a struggle of races. Here in this struggle stands National Socialism: an ideology based on the value of our Germanic, Nordic blood. ... On the other side stands a population of 180 million, a mixture of races, whose very names are unpronounceable, and whose physique is such that one can shoot them down without pity and compassion. These animals, that torture and ill-treat every prisoner from our side, every wounded man that they come across and do not treat them the way decent soldiers would, you will see for yourself. These people have been welded by the Jews into one religion, one ideology, that is called Bolshevism... When you, my men, fight over there in the East, you are carrying on the same struggle, against the same sub-humanity, the same inferior races, that at one time appeared under the name of Huns, another time— 1000 years ago at the time of King Henry and Otto I— under the name of Magyars, another time under the name of Tartars, and still another time under the name of Genghis Khan and the Mongols.

Heinrich Himmler's speech at [[Poznań|Posen]] on October 4, 1943:

{{quote |
What happens to a Russian, to a Czech, does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall from exhaustion while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished.

The editors of the journal [[Kritika (journal)|Kritika]] argue that an extreme interpretation of [[George F. Kennan]]’s “[[X article]]” was exploited by American politicians in the Cold War to advance aggressive “containment” policy towards Russia (in spite of Kennan later denouncing this interpretation).

Although not widespread, anti-Russian sentiment has been expressed in Armenia on several occasions, particularly in response to real or perceived [[anti-Armenian]] actions by Russia. In June 1903, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] issued a decree ordering the confiscation of all [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]] properties (including church-run schools) and its transfer to the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Russian Interior Ministry]]. The decision was perceived by Armenians to be an effort of [[Russification]], and it met widespread popular resistance by the Russian Armenian population and led by the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] and [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hunchak]] parties. This included attacks on Russian authorities in attempts to prevent the confiscation.

Earlier that week, Gavrilov had voted in favor of [[International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia|the independence of Abkhazia]]. Gavrilov's speech was done in Russian from the Speaker's chair and was seen as an attack on Georgian sovereignty. The President of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili called Russia "[[Occupied territories of Georgia|occupier]]" and blamed it for stirring up a "fifth column" in the country that is loyal to Moscow.

Kaplinski states the imposition of Soviet rule under [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1940 and subsequent [[Soviet deportations from Estonia|actions by Soviet authorities]] led to the replacement of anti-German sentiment with anti-Russian sentiment within just one year, and characterized it as "one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet authorities".<ref name="Subrenat2004">{{cite book|editor=Subrenat, Jean-Jacques|title=Estonia: Identity and Independence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBZlHdp7tdcC&pg=PA273|access-date=November 12, 2016|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-0890-8|page=273}}</ref> Kaplinski supposes that anti-Russian sentiment could disappear as quickly as anti-German sentiment did in 1940, however he believes the prevailing sentiment in Estonia is sustained by Estonia's politicians who employ "the use of anti-Russian sentiments in political combat," together with the "tendentious attitude of the [Estonian] media."<ref name="Subrenat2004"/> Kaplinski says that a "rigid East-West attitude is to be found to some degree in Estonia when it comes to Russia, in the form that everything good comes from the West and everything bad from the East";<ref name="Subrenat2004"/> this attitude, in Kaplinski's view, "probably does not date back further than 1940 and presumably originates from Nazi propaganda."<ref name="Subrenat2004"/>

In April 2015 an online petition "To Stop the Russian Fifth Column in Our Motherland" was posted at a Latvian online petition website, calling to establish a ghetto for [[non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] and Russian nationals named "the [[fifth column]]". Articles about the ghetto began to circulate on Russian media, including [[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] and [[Moskovsky Komsomolets]]. There is considerable evidence that it was a fake petition with fake signatories aimed at fomenting an opinion about the degree of Russophobia in Latvia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stopfake.org/en/fake-latvians-want-to-establish-ghetto-for-russians/|title=Fake: Latvians Want to Establish "Ghetto" for Russians|date=April 28, 2015|publisher=Stop Fake|access-date=July 8, 2018}}</ref>

In a 2004 research titled "Ethnic tolerance and integration of the Latvian society" conducted by the [[Baltic Institute of Social Sciences]] Latvian respondents on average rated their relations with Russians 7.8 out of 10, whereas non-Latvian respondents rated their relationships with Latvians 8.4 out of 10. Both respondent groups believed the ties between them were satisfactory, had not changed in the last five years and were to either remain the same or improve in the next five years. Respondents did mention some [[ethnic conflict|conflicts on an ethnic basis]], but all of them were classified as psycholinguistic, i.e., verbal confrontations. Most or 66% of non-Russian respondents would also support their son or daughter marrying a person of Russian ethnicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biss.soc.lv/downloads/resources/tolerance/tolerance_engl.pdf|title=Ethnic tolerance and integration of the Latvian society|year=2004|publisher=Baltic Institute of Social Sciences|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, in a 2012 poll, only 2% of the [[Russians in Latvia|Russian minority in Latvia]] reported that they had experienced a 'racially' motivated [[hate crime]] (as compared to an average of 10% among immigrants and minorities in EU).<ref name=hatecrime/>

On the other hand, results of a yearly poll carried out by the research agency "SKDS" showed that the population of Latvia was more split on its attitude towards the [[Russian Federation]]. In 2008 47% percent of respondents had a positive view of Russia, while 33% had a negative one, but the rest (20%) found hard to define their opinion. It reached a high in 2010 when 64% percent of respondents felt positive towards Russia, in comparison with the 25 percent that felt negative. In 2015, following the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]], however, it dropped to the lowest level since 2008 and for the first time the people with a negative attitude towards Russia (46%) surpassed people with a positive attitude (41%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/latvians-negativity-toward-russia-reaches-7-year-high-50339|title=Latvians' Negativity Toward Russia Reaches 7-Year High|date=October 19, 2015|publisher=[[The Moscow Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> In 2017 the respondents having a positive view of Russia slightly increased and reached 47%, but the respondents having a negative view of Russia decreased to 38%. The data wasn't differentiated between the respondent nationalities, so it has to be noted that between 2008 and 2017, ethnic Russians made up more than a quarter of the population of Latvia.

According to [[The Moscow Times]], Latvia's fears of Russia are rooted in history, including conflicting views on whether Latvia and other [[Baltic States]] were [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied by the USSR]] or joined it voluntary, as well as the [[June deportation|1940–1941 June]] and [[March deportation|1949 March deportations]] that followed and most recently the annexation of Crimea that fueled a fear that Latvia could also be annexed by Russia.<ref name="The Moscow Times">{{cite web|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/latvias-russia-fears-rooted-in-history-47372|title=Latvia's Russia Fears Rooted in History|date=June 14, 2015|publisher=[[The Moscow Times]]|access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref> While [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]] journalist and broadcaster [[Vladimir Pozner Jr.|Vladimir Posner]] also believed the fact that many Russians in the [[Latvian SSR]] did not learn [[Latvian language|Latvian]] also contributed to accumulation of an "anti-Russian sentiment".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theqpost.com/posner-explained-the-anti-russian-sentiment-in-latvia/56936|title=Posner explained the anti-Russian sentiment in Latvia|date=July 8, 2018|publisher=The Quebec Post|access-date=July 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709010144/https://theqpost.com/posner-explained-the-anti-russian-sentiment-in-latvia/56936|archive-date=July 9, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Former [[President of Lithuania]], [[Dalia Grybauskaitė]] was well known for her strongly anti-Russian statements she has made publicly while in office, oftentimes accusing Russia, and [[Vladimir Putin]] in particular, of aggression, violence, terrorism, and meddling in the affairs of other nations, particularly in [[Ukraine]], and also called the dependence on Russian gas an "existential threat" to Lithuania.

Following her reelection in May 2014, she said "Dignity, self-respect and mutual benefit, these are the principles that should set the basis for relations between countries". She went on to say "No doubt, knowing that this is our neighbor (Russia), we wish this country (referring to Russia) to democratize and cope with the arising economic challenges".

In June 2014, Grybauskaitė told the German news magazine Focus: "[Putin] uses nationality as a pretext to conquer territory with military means. That's exactly what Stalin and Hitler did." She also claimed that Russia and Putin were "characterised by aggressiveness, violence, and a willingness to overstep boundaries."

On 20 November 2014, Grybauskaitė, commenting on the conflict in Ukraine, characterized Russia as "a terrorist state which carries out an open aggression against its neighbors".

In June 2018, Grybauskaitė said that Lithuania should be ready for Russian invasion. She also said that Western states will "wake up" only "when they have been attacked" by Russia.

In December 2018, Grybauskaitė told Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that Lithuania would increase military assistance to Ukraine: "We will additionally supply more ammunition, send more military instructors and cyber security experts to help repel hybrid attacks, especially during the elections."

According to the statistics released on October 21, 2010 by the Institute of Sociology of [[National Academy of Science of Ukraine]], positive attitude towards Russians have been decreasing since 1994. In response to a question gauging tolerance of Russians, 15% of Western Ukrainians responded positively. In Central Ukraine, 30% responded positively (from 60% in 1994); 60% responded positively in Southern Ukraine (from 70% in 1994); and 64% responded positively in Eastern Ukraine (from 75% in 1994).

Anti-Russian sentiment dates back to the conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires in the 18th and early 19th centuries and the ceding of part of the [[Bessarabia|Moldavian principality]] to Russia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1812 after its ''de facto'' annexation, and to the annexations during World War II and after by the Soviet Union of [[Northern Bukovina]] and [[Bessarabia]] and the policies of ethnic cleansing, [[Russification]] and deportations that have taken place in those territories against ethnic Romanians. Following WWII, Romania, a former ally of [[Nazi Germany]], was occupied by Soviet forces.

The emergence of anti-Russian sentiment in the [[Danubian Principalities]], the precursors to unified Romania which became independent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] concluding the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|1828-1829 Russo-Turkish War]], arose from the post-1829 relationship of the [[Danubian Principalities]] of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] to Russia, and was caused by mutually economic and political grievances of two influential classes that were often odds also with each other. As per the 1829 treaty, Russia was named the protector of the two principalities, allowed to occupy them, and also drafted a quasi-constitution known as the [[Organic Regulations]] which formed a powerful assembly of 800 [[boyar]]s (the local landowning economic elite) nominally under the authority of the less nominal prince, the document crafted with strong support from the boyars. The boyars, a "reactionary oligarchy" as described by Misha Glenny, stopped short any hint of liberal reform, and the growing urban elite began to associate Russia with the slow progress of reform and the obstacles they faced in building an industrial base. On the other hand, the boyars themselves began to sour on Russia during the 1830s and 1840s due to their economic conflict of interest with Russia. After the Ottomans withdrew from the three forts along the Danube basin, the boyars exploited the highly fertile land to drastically increase Romanian wheat production, such that eventually future Romania consisting of Wallachia unified with Moldavia would become the fourth-largest wheat producer in the world. Whereas before 1829 Wallachian and Moldavian wheat had been limited to Ottoman markets, Russia increasingly felt threatened by growing competition in its jurisdiction that it feared could drive down the price of Russian wheat. Accordingly, Russia exploited its role as protector of the Principalities to let the Danube silt up, sabotaging the possible market competitor. As a result of this as well as "Russian foot-dragging on the economy", the boyars too became increasingly resentful of Russian domination. The rapid erosion of public relations with Russia led to a revolution in 1848, in which the newly emerging Romanian intellectual and political class sought the help of the Ottomans, their old hegemon, to drive out Russian influence—although, after pressure applied by Russia, the Russian and Ottoman armies joined forces to squash the movement.<ref>Glenny, Misha (1999).

Both events are signs that hostile naval missions across the [[Baltic Sea]] go a long way back, temporarily ending with the [[Treaty of Nöteborg|peace treaty of Nöteborg]] 1323 between Sweden and the [[Novgorod Republic]] (which later became Russia), soon to be broken by another [[Swedish–Novgorodian Wars|Catholic Swedish crusade into Greek-orthodox Novgorod]]. Russia has been described as Sweden's "[[archenemy]]" (a title also given to Denmark). The two countries have often been at war, most intensively during the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) and the [[Finnish War]] (1808–1809), when Sweden lost that third of its territory to Russia that now is [[Finland]]. Sweden defeated a Russian army in the [[Battle of Narva (1700)]], but was defeated by Russia in the [[Battle of Poltava]] 1709. In 1719 Russian troops burnt most Swedish cities and industrial communities along the Baltic sea coast to the ground (from Norrköping up to Piteå in the north) in what came to be called "Rysshärjningarna" (the Russian ravages, a term first recorded in 1730<ref name=Saob/>). "The Russians are coming" (''ryssen kommer'') is a traditional Swedish warning call.<ref>{{runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/allaharatt/0111.html|chapter=Alla ha rätt|title='Alla ha rätt samt andra uppsatser med anledning av världskriget|authorlink=Carl G. Laurin|date=1917}}</ref> After the death of king [[Charles XII]] in 1718 and the peace in 1721, Swedish politics was dominated by a peace-minded parliament, with a more aggressive opposition ([[Age of Liberty#Hats and Caps|Hats and Caps]]). When Swedish officer [[Malcolm Sinclair (Swedish nobleman)|Malcolm Sinclair]] was murdered in 1739 by two Russian officers, the anti-Russian ballad ''Sinclairsvisan'' by Anders Odel became very popular.<ref>{{runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/bemsamlade/1/0340.html|chapter=Carelius och Odel|author=Bernhard Elis Malmström|title=Bernhard Elis Malmströms samlade skrifter|date=1866–1869|volume=1}}</ref><ref>{{runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/blm/1943/0687.html|chapter=Sjuttonhundratal|title=[[Bonniers litterära magasin]]|date=1943}}</ref>

After 1809, there have been no more wars between Russia and Sweden, partly due to [[Swedish neutrality]] and nonalignment foreign policy since then. Peaceful relationships and the Russian capital being [[Saint Petersburg]], many Swedish companies ran large businesses in Imperial Russia, including [[Branobel]] and [[Ericsson]]. Many poets still grieved the loss of Finland and called for a military revenge,<ref>{{runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/sfubon/8/0331.html|chapter=Esaias Tegnér|first=Carl|last=Grimberg|authorlink=Carl Grimberg|title=Svenska folkets underbara öden|volume=VIII|date=1913–1939|quote=1809 års män, Karl Johans och Oskar I:s tid samt Vårt näringsliv och kommunikationsväsen under teknikens tidevarv 1809-1859}}</ref> ideas that were refueled by the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s.<ref>{{runeberg|url=http://runeberg.org/sfubon/8/0616.html|chapter=Oskar I|first=Carl|last=Grimberg|authorlink=Carl Grimberg|title=Svenska folkets underbara öden|volume=VIII|date=1913–1939|quote=1809 års män, Karl Johans och Oskar I:s tid samt Vårt näringsliv och kommunikationsväsen under teknikens tidevarv 1809-1859}}</ref> With the increasing cultural exchange between neighboring countries ([[Scandinavism]]) and the nationalist revival in Finland (through [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] and [[Elias Lönnrot]]), contempt with the attempts of [[Russification of Finland]] spread to Sweden. Before [[World War I]], traveling Russian saw filers were suspected of espionage by Swedish proponents of increased military spending. After the [[Russian Revolution]] in the spring of 1917 and the abdication of the Tsar, great hope was vested in the new [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]], only to be replaced with despair after the so-called [[October Revolution]]. Old anti-Russian sentiments were compounded by a new element of [[anti-communism]], to last for the duration of the existence of the [[Soviet Union]]. Many Swedes voluntarily joined the Finnish side in the [[Winter War]] between Finland and the Soviet Union 1939–1940. When the [[Sino-Soviet split]] erupted in the 1960s, the pro-Chinese far left concentrated on anti-Russian rhetoric. evoking fears of a threatening, imperialistic power next-door.<ref>{{cite book|author1=M.

In June 2014, political scientist [[Sergey Alexandrovich Markov|Sergey Markov]] complained about Russophobia in Sweden and Finland, comparing it to [[antisemitism]].

Norway is also a [[NATO]] member, an organization which has historically been in opposition with Russia and its now-defunct [[Warsaw Pact]]. Norway and NATO were allied with Finland and Sweden during the [[Cold War]] against the [[Soviet Union]], and Norway's diplomatic and cultural ties with the West have complicated continuing relations with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jJpAAAAMAAJ|title=Between "russophobia" and "bridge-building": the Norwegian government and the Soviet Union, 1940-1945|first1=Sven G.|last1=Holtsmark|first2=Institutt for forsvarsstudier|last2=(Norway)|date=September 22, 1988|publisher=Institutt for forsvarsstudier|via=Google Books}}</ref> A 2017 poll of Norwegians found that 58% believe that Vladimir Putin and Russia pose a security threat.<ref name="The Nordic Page 2017">{{cite web | title=Norwegians Believe Vladimir Putin Is Threat to World Peace | website=The Nordic Page | date=2017-07-18 | url=https://www.tnp.no/norway/politics/norway-norwegians-believe-russia-vladimir-putin-threat-world-peace | access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>

In 2017, when the Russian Embassy in Oslo had accused Norwegian officials and intelligence of using “false and disconnected anti-Russian rhetoric” and “scaring Norway’s population” about a "mythical Russian threat," Prime Minister Solberg said in response, by dismissing the accusations, that “this is an example of Russian propaganda that often comes when there’s a focus on security policy. There is nothing in this that’s new to us.”

=====Finland=====
{{See also|Russians in Finland#Manifestations of intolerance|Finland–Russia relations}}
In Finland, anti-Russian sentiment has been studied since the 1970s. The history of anti-Russian sentiment has two main theories. One of them claims that Finns and Russians have been archenemies throughout history. The position is considered to have been dominated at least the 1700s since the days of the [[Greater Wrath]] when the Russians occupied Finland and raped it. This view largely assumes that through the centuries, "Russia is a violent slayer and Finland is an innocent, virginal victim".<ref>{{cite web |editor=Osmo Kuusi |editor2=Hanna Smith |editor3=Paula Tiihonen |title=Venäjä 2017: Kolme skenaariota |url=http://web.eduskunta.fi/dman/Document.phx?documentId=fc13607155759048&cmd=download |publisher=Eduskunnan tulevaisuusvaliokunta |access-date=2008-02-15 |language=fi |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520190413/http://web.eduskunta.fi/dman/Document.phx?documentId=fc13607155759048&cmd=download |archive-date=2013-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> During the atrocities 20,000 were killed and 30,000 taken slaves. During the Greater Wrath Finland had a population of 400,000 making the atrocities relatively harsh.

Much anti-Russian sentiment was created at the time of [[Finnish Civil War]] 1917–1918. The anti-Russian battle was led by [[White Finland]]. The bitterly fought  civil War in 1918 between the Reds and the Whites—won by the Whites—left behind a popular wave of anti-Russian and anti-Communist feelings in Finland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jussi M.

[[Winter_War|The 1939-1940 Soviet invasion of Finland known as the Winter War]]  was started by [[Shelling of Mainila]], an incident in which Soviet Union claimed Finnish aggression but has later admitted the incident forged by Soviet Union. The hatred against Russians greatly stems from [[Soviet partisans|partisan]] [[Soviet partisans in Finland|attacks against the civilian population]].

According to polls in 2004, 62% of Finnish citizens had a negative view of Russia.<ref name="HelsSan"/> [[Deportations of the Ingrian Finns|Deportation]] of [[Ingrian Finns]], indigenous to [[St. Petersburg]], [[Ingria]], and other Soviet repressions against its Finnish minorities have contributed to negative views of Russia.

=====France=====
{{See also|France–Russia relations}}
France has a longstanding historical relation with Russia dating back from Middle Ages even though both countries started to establish stronger diplomatic ties not before the [[Westernizer|westward expansion of Russia]] under the [[Romanov Dynasty]] from the 18th century. Relations between France and Russia varied depending the periods but anti-Russian sentiment was common in France after the French defeat by the Russians in the [[French invasion of Russia|1812 War]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McNally |first1=T. |year=1958 |title=The Origins of Russophobia in France: 1812 - 1830 |journal=American Slavic and East European Review |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=173–189 |doi= 10.2307/3004165|jstor=3004165 }}</ref> After 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], France tried to increase political ties with other European nation fearing to be isolated and started military alliance with Russia, and Great Britain, leading to the Triple Entente from 1894. However many French scholars - particularly [[French Third Republic|Republicans]] - showed reluctance, considering the Russian Empire as a backward, authoritarian, bigoted and antisemitic nation.

If both countries were allies during [[World War I]], the uprising of Soviet Russians changed French-Russian relations. In December 1917 France broke relations and supported the anti-Bolshevik cause. France supported the White Guard in the Civil War, and supported [[Polish–Soviet War|Poland in the war of 1920]], even if the rise of Nazi power in Germany forced France and Soviet Russia to form a military alliance. Although not being a part of Eastern Block, French communist party had a strong political influence in France in the aftermath of WW2. Despite the beginning of the Cold War and Marshall Plan led by the US, France still did not display an anti-USSR sentiment as strong as observed in other Western European countries.<ref>Martin Evans and Emmanuel Godin. "The great fear of 1947: could France have gone communist?." History Today 55.1 (2005): 21.</ref> On the other hand [[decolonization]] of the French colonial empire gave Moscow the opportunity to provide propaganda support for the anti-colonial fighters, as well as weapons, especially in Algeria and Vietnam. In May 1960, de Gaulle hosted a summit in Paris between Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and NATO leaders.

After the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]], France-Russia relations went warmer, with economic and politic cooperations. However surveys express French skepticism about Russian political, social and military choices such as the [[Russian-Ukrainian War 2014|Russian-Ukraine war]], [[Vladimir Putin]]'s anti-democratic positions or [[LGBT rights in Russia|anti-LGBT sentiment in Russia]]. According to a 2017 [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] survey, 36% of French people have a favorable view of Russia, with 62% expressing an unfavorable view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/08/16/publics-worldwide-unfavorable-toward-putin-russia/|title=Publics Worldwide Unfavorable Toward Putin, Russia|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> In return numerous French scholars and politics argue that France had a longstanding positive opinion about Russia and regret that France from the late 2000s tends to follow American positions against Russia blindly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tdg.ch/monde/chevenement-denonce-russophobie-ambiante/story/23200714|title=Chevènement dénonce la "russophobie" ambiante|first=Alain|last=Jourdan|date=September 11, 2016|via=www.tdg.ch}}</ref>

After the [[invasion of the Soviet Union]], Hitler expressed his plans for the Slavs:

{{quote|As for the ridiculous hundred million Slavs, we will mold the best of them as we see fit, and we will isolate the rest of them in their pig-styes; and anyone who talks about cherishing the local inhabitants and civilizing them, goes straight off into a concentration camp!<ref>{{cite book|author1=H.

Plans to eliminate Russians and other Slavs from Soviet territory to allow German settlement included starvation. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] maintains that there were 4.2 million victims of the German [[Hunger Plan]] in the Soviet Union, "largely Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians," including 3.1 million [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]] and 1.0 million civilian deaths in the [[Siege of Leningrad]].<ref>Snyder (2010), ''Bloodlands,''p. 411.

Influenced by the guidelines, in a directive sent out to the troops under his command, General [[Erich Hoepner]] of the [[4th Panzer Army]] stated:
{{quote|The war against Russia is an important chapter in the German nation's struggle for existence. It is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people, of the defense of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation and the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism.

In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.|Statement (8 August 1945) of [[George S. Patton]], as quoted in ''General Patton: A Soldier's Life'' (2002) by Stanley P. Hirshson, p. 650

=====Linguistic issues=====
According to Russian philosopher Oleg Ryabov, “the otherness of the USSR” as a whole was the main ideological goal of American cinema on this topic, but not the only one: "To sum up, gender discourse was a weapon of the Cold war, performing an important function in the process of the USSR's otherness: social deviation was also presented as gender deviation. Hollywood representations of the Soviet gender system were an element of the construction of the "red threat". At the same time, they served as a way to maintain and correct not only political but also gender relations in American society itself, as a significant component of the discourse of "mysticism of femininity" described in the bestseller by [[Betty Friedan]]. Finally, I would like to emphasize that many plots and images of American cinema were used in the anti-communist discourse of the [[perestroika]] with its "return to normalcy" slogans, including the "natural relations between men and women."<ref>{{Cite web |lang=ru |url=https://www.kino-teatr.ru/kino/art/kino/4188/ |title="Советский враг" в американском кинематографе Холодной войны: гендерное измерение |trans-title="Soviet Enemy" in American Cold War Cinema: Gender Dimension (Published in the magazine "Woman in Russian Society" (2011.

Neutral and even peaceful. What is in the reciprocal letters of the readers?

=====Recent erosion of relations=====
Polling has charted that at the end of the Cold War, American views of Russia warmed considerably, with 62% of Americans expressing a positive view of Russia in 1989 and 66% at the turn of the century, as opposed 29% and 27% retaining negative views in those years.<ref name="Saad">{{cite web|last=Saad|first=Lydia|date=February 27, 2019|title=Majority of Americans Now Consider Russia a Critical Threat|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/247100/majority-americans-consider-russia-critical-threat.aspx|website=GALLUP News|
publisher=Gallup Inc.}}</ref> Although Russia recovered from brief spikes in negative views in 1999, 2003 and 2008, in 2013 the formerly majority positive view of Russia among American respondents critically declined was replaced by a majority negative view of 60% by 2014. This time, instead of recovery, Russia's public image experienced progressively more severe deterioration. By 2019, a record 73% of Americans had a negative opinion of Russia as a country, and formerly dominant positive opinions had been cut from 66% down to 24%. In 2019, the share of Americans considering Russia to be a "critical" threat to national security reached a majority of 52% for the first time. Whereas in 2006 only 1% of Americans listed Russia as "America's worst enemy" by 2019 32% of Americans, including a plurality of 44% of Democrats, shared this view,<ref name="Saad" /> with a partisan split having emerged in 2017. The sharper distaste among the Democrat population stands in contrast to the prior history of American public opinion on Russia, as Republicans were formerly more likely to view Russia as a greater threat.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 30, 2019|title=Climate Change and Russia Are Partisan Flashpoints in Public's Views of Global Threats|url=https://www.people-press.org/2019/07/30/climate-change-and-russia-are-partisan-flashpoints-in-publics-views-of-global-threats/#changing-views-of-global-threats|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref>

====New Zealand====
The history of early anti-Russian sentiment in New Zealand was analyzed in Glynn Barratt's book ''Russophobia in New Zealand, 1838-1908'',<ref name=barrat>{{cite book |title=Russophobia in New Zealand, 1838-1908 |last=Barratt |first=Glynn |year=1981 |publisher=Dunmore Press |isbn= 978-0-908564-75-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3OwmAQAAMAAJ }}</ref> expanded to cover the period up to 1939 in an article by Tony Wilson.<ref name=wilson>TONY WILSON, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40922035 Russophobia and New Zealand-Russian Relations, 1900s to 1939], New Zealand Slavonic Journal, (1999), pp. 273-296</ref> 
 
According to Wilson, negative attitude towards the [[Russian Empire]] had no roots in the country itself but was fueled by the attitude of the [[British Empire]], at a time when New Zealand was still a British colony. It was aggravated by lack of information about Russia and contacts with it due to the mutual remoteness. Various wars involving the Russian Empire fueled the [[Coastal fortifications of New Zealand#The "Russian-scare" forts of 1885|"Russian scare"]]. The new negative attitude was brought by Jewish immigration after [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]. That immigration was halted as a combined result of Russophobia and anti-Semitism. As of 1916, there were 1242 settlers of Russian origin in the country, including 169 Jews. During [[World War I]] anti-Russian sentiment was temporarily supplanted by [[anti-German sentiment]] for evident reasons; however, soon after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the fear of [[Marxism]] and [[Bolshevism]] revived Russophobia in the form of "[[Red Scare]]". Notably, local Russians had no issues with Russophobia. By late 1920s pragmatism moderated anti-Russian sentiment in official circles, especially during the [[Great Depression]]. Sympathetic views were propagated by visitors to the [[Soviet Union]], such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], impressed by [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]].<ref name=wilson/>

[[Rudolph P. Matthee]] (Munroe Chaired Professor of History at the [[University of Delaware]]) noted in his book ''The Politics of Trade in Safavid Iran: Silk for Silver, 1600-1730'', dealing with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] period (1501–1736), that the Iranians "had long despised Russians for their uncouthness".{{sfn|Matthee|1999|page=221}}

In the first half of the 19th century, Russia annexed large parts of [[Iran]]ian territory in the [[Caucasus]]; by the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] (1813) and [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] (1828), Iran was forced to cede what is present-day [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]], eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and southern [[Dagestan]] to Russia. These territories had made part of the concept of Iran for centuries.{{sfn|Kazemzadeh|1991|pages=328–330}} As a result of the subsequent rampant anti-Russian sentiment, on 11 February 1829, an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy in [[Tehran]] and slaughtered almost everyone inside. Among those killed in the massacre was the newly appointed Russian ambassador to Iran, [[Aleksander Griboyedov]], a celebrated playwright. Griboyedov had previously played an active role in negotiating the terms of the treaty of 1828.<ref>See [[Peter Hopkirk|Hopkirk, Peter]].

====China====
{{see also|History of Sino-Russian relations}}
While modern relations between China and Russia are described as friendly and close, both face problems over their historical legacies and distrusts from smaller neighbors, because previous historical relations between two were tense.

Conflicts between Russia and China started from the [[Tsardom of Russia]], with the [[Sino-Russian border conflicts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1600s/yr50/sinorussianborder.htm|title=Sino-Russian border conflicts|website=www.onwar.com|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225224033/https://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1600s/yr50/sinorussianborder.htm|archive-date=2019-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the end of the conflict at 1689, China, then under [[Qing dynasty]], gained the upper hand and the border of Russia and Qing China remained quiet until the [[Opium Wars]] launched by Britain in the 19th century. At this point, with the Qing dynasty plagued by its own civil wars, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] expanded and asserted their hegemony by conquering [[Outer Manchuria]] which is the heartland of [[Manchu people]] whom founded the Qing dynasty following the [[Treaty of Aigun]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carnegie.ru/commentary/60357|title=Aigun, Russia, and China's "Century of Humiliation"|first=Igor|last=Denisov|website=Carnegie Moscow Center}}</ref> Russia would continue to meddle and interfere on Chinese political affairs, sponsoring various groups, both pro- and anti-Chinese, and destabilized China, began with the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan rebellion]], [[Kashgaria]] and Russian occupation of [[Yining|Ili]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-13|title=Xinjiang Under the Qing|first=Kwangmin|last=Kim|date=28 March 2018|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Asian History|volume=1|via=oxfordre.com|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.013.13|isbn=9780190277727}}</ref> Toward the collapse of Qing dynasty, Russia [[Russian invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]] and was among a major participant that crushed [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Russia in the Boxer Rebellion|first=Alena N.

With the collapse of the Tsarist Empire in Russia, the [[Soviet Union]] was founded. Nonetheless, tensions between Russia under USSR and [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] remained high, with a strong anti-Russian sentiment arose between Chinese population.

The level of violence of Russian armies toward Chinese citizens was recorded by British and US reports{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) looted and terrorized the people of [[Mukden]], and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from "three days of rape and pillage"{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}.

Historically, Russia and Turkey fought several wars and had caused great devastation for each nation. During the old [[Tsardom of Russia]], the Ottomans often raided and attacked Russian villagers. With the transformation into [[Russian Empire]], Russia started to expand and clashed heavily with the Turks; which Russia often won more than lost, and reduced the Ottoman Empire heavily. The series of wars had manifested the ideas among the Turks that Russia wanted to turn Turkey into a vassal state, leading to a high level of Russophobia in Turkey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Russo-Turkish-wars|title=Russo-Turkish wars &#124; Russo-Turkish history|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> In the 20th century, anti-Russian sentiment in Turkey was so great that the Russians refused to allow a Turkish military attache to accompany their armies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Towle |first1=Philip | author-link1 = Philip Towle |year=1980 |title=British Assistance to the Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 |journal=The Great Circle: Journal of the Australian Association for Maritime History |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=44–54 |publisher=Australian Association for Maritime History }}</ref> After the [[World War I]], both Ottoman and Russian Empires collapsed, and two nations went on plagued by their civil wars; during that time [[Soviet Russia]] (who would later become [[Soviet Union]]) supported [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish Independence Movement]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], leading to a warmer relations between two states, as newly established Turkish Republic maintained a formal tie with the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historum.com/asian-history/56728-soviet-financial-aid-turkey-during-independence-war.html |title=Soviet Financial Aid to Turkey during Independence War &#124; History Forum |publisher=Historum.com |date=2013-05-15 |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref> But their warm relations didn't last long; after the [[World War II]], the [[Turkish Straits crisis|Bosphorus crisis]] occurred at 1946 due to [[Joseph Stalin]]'s demand for a complete Soviet control of the straits led to resurgence of Russophobia in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/7-august-1946-turkish-straits-crisis-reaches-its-climax/|title=7 August 1946: Turkish Straits crisis reaches its climax - MoneyWeek|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref>

[[California]]-based [[international relations]] scholar [[Andrei Tsygankov]] has remarked that anti-Russian political rhetoric coming from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] circles has received wide echo in American mainstream media, asserting that "Russophobia's revival is indicative of the fear shared by some U.S. and European politicians that their grand plans to control the world's most precious resources and geostrategic sites may not succeed if Russia's economic and political recovery continues."<ref name = "Tsygankov&nbsp;— May 2008">Tsygankov, Andrei.

In practice, anti-Russian political rhetoric usually puts emphasis on highlighting policies and practices of the Russian government that are criticised internally - [[Corruption in Russia|corruption]], abuse of law, [[Freedom of the press in Russia|censorship]], violence and [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|intervention in Ukraine]]. Western criticism in this aspect goes in line with Russian independent anti-government media such as ([[TV Rain]], [[Novaya Gazeta]], [[Ekho Moskvy]], [[The Moscow Times]]) and opposition human rights activists ([[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]). In defence of this rhetoric, some sources critical of the Russian government claim that it is Russian state-owned media and administration who attempt to discredit the "neutral" criticism by generalizing it into indiscriminate accusations of the whole Russian population - or Russophobia.<ref name="jdpz"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Kremlin's Campaign against Russophobia Threatens both Russia and the West, Polish Experts Say|url = http://www.interpretermag.com/kremlins-campaign-against-russophobia-threatens-both-russia-and-the-west-polish-experts-say/|website = www.interpretermag.com|access-date = 2015-11-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspeninstitute.cz/en/article/4-2015-four-types-of-russian-propaganda/|title=Four Types of Russian Propaganda|publisher=[[Aspen Institute]]|access-date=2016-03-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310112956/http://www.aspeninstitute.cz/en/article/4-2015-four-types-of-russian-propaganda/|archive-date=2016-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some have argued, however, that the Western media doesn't make enough distinction between Putin's government and Russia and the Russians, thus effectively vilifying the whole nation.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.com/2017/06/russophobia-hurts-trump-helps-putin/ | work=[[New York Observer|Observer]] | first=Diana | last=Bruk | title=Russophobia Isn't Just Hurting Donald Trump—It's Helping Vladimir Putin | date=19 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://medium.com/the-anti-nihilist-institute/american-russophobia-is-real-and-its-helping-putin-a48ad884f149 | work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] | first=Anna | last=Lind-Guzik | title=American Russophobia is real—and it's helping Putin | date=7 June 2017}}</ref>
