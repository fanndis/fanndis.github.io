"FourFiveSeconds" was written by West, McCartney, [[Kirby Lauryen]], [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]], Sign, [[David Longstreth|Dave Longstreth]], [[Dallas Austin]], Elon Rutberg, Noah Goldstein and Rihanna.

On February 8, during his Grammy Awards red carpet interview, West explained how the collaboration came to fruition: "I'm executive producer of Rihanna's album, and I said I'd done a few songs with Paul McCartney and she couldn't get past this record. She had to have it on her album... So now we at the Grammys doing it".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|last2=Spanos|first2=Brittany|title=Kanye West, Rihanna, Paul McCartney Debut 'FourFiveSeconds' Live at Grammys|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-rihanna-and-paul-mccartney-debut-fourfiveseconds-live-at-grammys-20150208|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 8, 2015|date=February 8, 2015}}</ref> West further compared Rihanna's vocals on the song to that of Scottish singer [[Annie Lennox]]: "I feel like she has this type of energy in her vocals. And she even brought it to another level of like soul and heart and artistry".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-gets-deep-with-ryan-seacrest-11-things-we-learned-20150211?page=2|title=Kanye West Gets Deep With Ryan Seacrest: 11 Things We Learned|work=Rolling Stone|first=Kory|last=Grow|date=February 11, 2015|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[V (American magazine)|V]]'' magazine, Rihanna revealed, "The thing that made me fall in love with ['FourFiveSeconds'] is the juxtaposition of the music and the lyrics. When you read the lyrics it's a completely different song than what you are hearing. The music is easygoing, but the lyrical content is very loud and in your face."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/21/rihanna-v-magazine-cover_n_7105022.html|title=Rihanna Doesn't 'Give A D-ck' About Privacy Anymore|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|last=Goodman|first=Jessica|date=April 21, 2015|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref> Although it is a first collaboration by the trio, they have collaborated separately. West and McCartney collaborated on the 2014 single "[[Only One (Kanye West song)|Only One]]", a track dedicated to West's daughter [[Kanye West#Relationships and family|North]]. Rihanna and West previously collaborated on [[Jay-Z]]'s 2009 single "[[Run This Town]]" — which became a commercial success and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart — and West's 2011 single "[[All of the Lights]]", a track featuring backup vocals by [[John Legend]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], and [[Elton John]] among others.<ref name="forbes" />

After the first [[Refrain|chorus]] West sings, "Woke up an optimist/ Sun was shining, I'm positive/ Then I heard you was talking trash/ Hold me back/ I'm about to spazz."

McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later sped up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone. McCartney's lyrics were improvised mid-performance and are for the most part drowned out by West's vocals except for the lines "We can run around" and "How 'bout a mystery."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ6_Va8plY|title=BBC Mastertapes |work=[[BBC Radio]]}}</ref>
