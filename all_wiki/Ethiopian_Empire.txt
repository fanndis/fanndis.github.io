It began with the establishment of the [[Solomonic dynasty]] by [[Yekuno Amlak]] from approximately 1270 and lasted until 1974, when Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] was [[Ethiopian Revolution|overthrown]] in a [[coup d'état]] by the [[Communism|communist]] [[Derg]].

Founded in 1270 by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] nobleman Yekuno Amlak, who claimed to descend from the last [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] king and ultimately the [[Biblical times|Biblical]] [[Menelik I]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]], it replaced the [[Agaw people|Agaw]] kingdom of the [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe]]. While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity, the Empire managed to expand significantly under the [[crusades]] of [[Amda Seyon I]] (1314–1344) and [[Yeshaq I]] (1414–1429), temporarily becoming the dominant force of the African Horn. Yeshaq's reign was however challenged by Sultan [[Jamal ad-Din II]] which led to Yeshaq's death.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burton |first1=Richard |title=Ethiopian Borderlands |page=58}}</ref> Under the rule of [[Zara Yaqob]] (1434–1468), the [[Hadiya Sultanate]] was invaded by Ethiopia and the captured Hadiya princess [[Eleni of Ethiopia|Eleni]] converted to Christianity leading to her marriage to Zara Yacob.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hassen |first1=Mohammed |title=Oromo of Ethiopia with special emphasis on the Gibe region |publisher=University of London |page=22 |url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/29226/1/10731321.pdf}}</ref> Muslims in the region as well as [[Adal Sultanate]] rejected the marriage alliance and began launching several invasion attempts into Ethiopia finally succeeding under Imam [[Mahfuz]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3 |year=1975 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=167 |isbn=9780521209816 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&q=relative+ease+with+which+mahfuz+and+his+followers&pg=PA167}}</ref> Mahfuz's ambush and defeat by Emperor [[Lebna Dengel]] brought about the early 16th century [[Abyssinian–Adal war|Jihad]] of the [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]]ese [[Imam]] [[Ahmed Gran]], who was only [[Battle of Wayna Daga|defeated in 1543]] with the help of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Adal |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Adal |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> Greatly weakened, much of the Empire's southern territory and vassals were lost due to the [[Oromo migrations]]. In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.

Reacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as "Gondarine period". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|"Era of the Princes"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.

Emperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855–1868) put an end to that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].

Later, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.

By 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the English title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa|Bokassa I]].

==History==
===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===
{{Main|Dʿmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]
Ethiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}. It is believed that the [[ancient Egypt]]ians claimed that [[Land of Punt|Punt]], known as gold country, was in Ethiopia in 980{{nbsp}}BC. According to the [[Kebra Nagast]], [[Menelik I]] founded the Ethiopian empire in the 10th{{nbsp}}century BC,. In the 4th{{nbsp}}century, under King [[Ezana of Axum]], the kingdom adopted [[Christianity]] as the state religion that evolved into the [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] ([[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean Orthodox]]) denominational Church. It was thus one of the first Christian states.<ref name="A10">{{Harvp|Adekumobi|2007|p=10}}</ref>

After the conquest of Aksum by Queen [[Gudit]] or Yodit, a period began which some scholars refer to as the Ethiopian Dark Ages.<ref name="A10" /> According to Ethiopian tradition, she ruled over the remains of the Aksumite Empire for 40 years before transmitting the crown to her descendants.<ref name=A10 /> In 1063{{nbsp}}AD the [[Sultanate of Showa]] describes the passing of their overlord Badit daughter of Maya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Roland |title=The Cambridge History of Africa, Volume 3 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWjxR61xAe0C&q=death+of+a+local+ruler+badit+ethiopia&pg=PA106|isbn=9780521209816 |year=1975 }}</ref>

===Adal Sultanate invasion===
{{further|Abyssinian–Adal war}}

In 1529, the [[Adal Sultanate]]'s forces led by [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] invaded the Ethiopian Empire in what is known as the [[Abyssinian–Adal war]]. The Adal occupation lasted fourteen years. During the conflict, the Adal Sultanate employed cannons provided by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the aftermath of the war, Adal annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with territories in what is now [[Somalia]]. In 1543, with the help of the [[Portuguese Empire]], the Solomonic dynasty was restored.

In 1543, [[Gelawdewos|Emperor Gelawdewos]] beat [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] armies and Ahmad himself was killed at the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], close to [[Wegera]]. This victory allowed the empire to reconquer progressively the [[Ethiopian Highlands]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 241f.</ref> In 1559 Gelawdewos was killed attempting to invade [[Adal Sultanate]], and his severed head was paraded in Adal's capital [[Harar]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akyeampong |first1=Emmanuel |title=Dictionary of African Biography |journal=Oup USA |volume=1-6 |page=451 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&q=gelawdewos+killed+harar&pg=RA1-PA451|isbn=9780195382075 |date=2 February 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Ottoman Empire]] made another attempt at conquering Ethiopia, from 1557, establishing [[Habesh Eyalet]], the province of Abyssinia, by conquering [[Massawa]], the Empire's main port and seizing [[Suakin]] from the allied [[Funj Sultanate]] in what is now [[Sudan]]. In 1573 [[Sultanate of Harar]] attempted to invade Ethiopia again however Sarsa Dengel successfully defended the Ethiopian frontier.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pankhurst|first1=Richard|title=The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to the End of the 18th Century|date=1997|publisher=The Red Sea Press|page=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC&q=harar+sarsa+dengel&pg=PA375|isbn=9780932415196}}</ref>

The Ottomans were checked by [[Sarsa Dengel|Emperor Sarsa Dengel's]] victory and sacking of [[Arqiqo]] in 1589, thus containing them on a narrow coast line strip. The Afar Sultanate maintained the remaining Ethiopian port on the Red Sea, at [[Beilul|Baylul]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to The End of the 18th Century Asmara: Red Sea Press, Inc., 1997. p. 390</ref>

[[Oromo migrations]] through the same period, occurred with the movement of a large pastoral population from the southeastern provinces of the Empire. A contemporary account was recorded by the monk [[Bahrey|Abba Bahrey]], from the Gamo region. Subsequently, the empire organization changed progressively, with faraway provinces taking more independence. A remote province such as [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]] is last recorded paying tribute to the imperial throne during [[Yaqob]] reign (1590-1607).<ref>''Braukämper'', Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays (Hamburg: Lit Verlag, 2002), p. 82</ref>

By 1607, Oromos were also major players in the imperial politics, when [[Susenyos I]], raised by a clan through ''gudifacha'' (or adoption), took power. He was helped by fellow Luba age-group generals [[Mecha]], [[Yilmana Densa|Yilma and Densa]], who were rewarded by ''Rist'' [[Feudalism|feudal]] lands, in the present-day [[Gojjam|Gojjam districts]] of the same name.<ref>Solomon GETAHUN, A History of Ethiopia's Newest Immigrants to the United States: Orphans, https://journals.openedition.org/africanistes/4104</ref> Susenyos reign was also marked by his short-lived [[Susenyos I#Susenyos and Catholicism|conversion to Catholicism]], which ignited a major [[civil war]]. His son [[Fasilides I]] reverted the move.

The reign of [[Iyasu I |Iyasu I the Great]] (1682-1706) was a major period of consolidation. It also saw the dispatching of embassies to [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV's France]] and to [[Dutch India]]. During the reign of [[Iyasu II]] (1730-1755), the Empire was strong enough to undertake a war on the [[Sennar Sultanate]], where the emperor [[Battle of the Dindar River|leading its army to Sennar itself]], was afterwards forced to retreat upon defeat along the [[Tekezé River|Setit river]]. [[Iyasu II]] also conferred the dignity of [[Kantiba]]i of the Habab (northern [[Eritrea]]) after homage by a new dynasty.<ref>Anthony d'AVRAY, Lords of the Red Sea: The History of a Red Sea Society from the Sixteenth to Nineteenth century, Harrasowitz Verlag, p.50 https://books.google.com/books?id=9GGgy_wGE0sC&lpg=PA28&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>

The ''Wallo'' and ''Yejju'' clans rise to power culminated in 1755, when [[Iyoas I|Emperor Iyoas I]] ascended to the imperial throne in [[Gondar]]. They would be one of the major factions contending for imperial power during the ensuing [[Zemene Mesafint]], starting from 1769, when [[Mikael Sehul]], [[Ras (title)|Ras]] of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] killed [[Iyoas I]] and replaced him with [[Yohannes II]].

The Early Modern period was one of intense cultural and artistic creation. Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]]. The city of Gondar became the capital in 1636, with several [[Fortification|fortified castles]] built in the town and in its surrounding areas.

===Princes' Era===
{{Main|Zemene Mesafint}}
[[File:Téwodros II.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Tewodros II]]'s rise to the throne marked the end of the ''[[Zemene Mesafint]]''.]]
From 1769 to 1855, the Ethiopian empire passed through a period known as the ''Princes Era'' (in Amharic ''Zemene Mesafint''). This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]]. Both the development of society and culture stagnated in this period. Religious conflict, both within the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and between them and the Muslims were often used as a pretext for mutual strife. The Princes Era ended with the reign of the Emperor [[Tewodros II]].

===Reign of Emperor Tewodros II and Scramble for Africa===
In 1868, following the imprisonment of several [[Missionary|missionaries]] and representatives of the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, the British engaged in the punitive [[British Expedition to Abyssinia|Expedition to Abyssinia]]. This campaign was a success for Britain and the Ethiopian emperor committed suicide.

From 1874 to 1876, the Empire, under [[Yohannes IV]], won the [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War]], decisively beating the invading forces at the [[Battle of Gundet]], in [[Hamasien]] province. In 1887 Menelik king of [[Shewa]] invaded the [[Emirate of Harar]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Chelenqo]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=CAULK |first1=RICHARD |title=The Occupation of Harar: January 1887 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |year=1971 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |jstor=41967469 }}</ref>

The 1880s were marked by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Italy, seeking a [[Colonialism|colonial presence]] in Africa, invaded Ethiopia and following a [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887–1889|successful conquest]] of some coastal regions, forced the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] upon [[Shewa]] (an autonomous kingdom within the empire), creating the colony of [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]].

Due to significant differences between the Italian and [[Amharic]] translations of the treaty, Italy believed they had subsumed Ethiopia as a [[client state]]. Ethiopia repudiated the treaty in 1893. Insulted, Italy declared war on Ethiopia in 1895. The [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]] resulted in the 1896 [[Battle of Adwa]], in which Italy was decisively defeated, as the Ethiopians were numerically superior, better equipped and supported by Russia and France. As a result, the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]] was signed in October, which strictly delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the independence of Ethiopia.

Beginning in the 1890s, under the reign of the [[Menelik II|Emperor Menelik II]], the empire's forces set off from the central province of [[Shoa, Ethiopia|Shoa]] to incorporate through conquest inhabited lands to the west, east and south of its realm.<ref>{{cite journal |author=John Young |title=Regionalism and Democracy in Ethiopia |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=19 |issue=2 |year=1998 |page=192 |jstor=3993156 |doi=10.1080/01436599814415}}</ref> The territories that were annexed included those of the western Oromo (non Shoan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta,<ref>International Crisis Group, "Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents".

===Italian invasion and World War II===
{{further|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|East African Campaign (World War II)}}
[[File:ETH-BIB-Kaiserpalast, "der grosse Gibi" aus der Luft-Abessinienflug 1934-LBS MH02-22-0222.tif|thumb|The Emperor's palace, 1934]]
In 1935 Italian soldiers, commanded by [[Marshal of Italy|Marshal]] [[Emilio De Bono]], invaded Ethiopia in what is known as the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. The war lasted seven months before an Italian victory was declared. The Ethiopian Empire was incorporated into the Italian colony of [[Italian East Africa]]. The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], though not much was done to end the hostility.

During the conflict, both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes. Ethiopian troops are known to have made use of [[Expanding bullet|Dum-Dum bullets]] (in violation of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]]) and mutilated captured soldiers (often with castration).{{sfn|Antonicelli|1975|p=79}} Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title "Emperor of Abyssinia".

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.

===Fall of monarchy===
[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]
In 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the "[[Derg]]", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]]. Haile Selassie was imprisoned and died in unclear circumstances, a rumor being that he was suffocated with an ether-soaked pillow.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pr0XWQAzeNIC|title=Necessary Journeys|last=Jack|first=Ian|publisher=Granta|year=2001|isbn=978-1-929001-03-3|pages=124|ref=harv|authorlink=Ian Jack}}</ref>

==Society==
According to [[Bahrey]],<ref>Bahrey. (1954). History of the Galla. In C.F. Beckingham and G.B.W. Huntingford</ref> there were ten social groups in the feudal Ethiopia of his time, i.e. at the end of the 16th century. These social groups consisted of the monks; the debtera; lay officials (including judges); men at arms giving personal protection to the wives of dignitaries and to princesses; the shimaglle, who were the lords and hereditary landowners; their farm labourers or serfs; traders; artisans; wandering singers; and the soldiers, who were called chewa. According to modern thinking, some of these categories are not true classes. But at least the shimaglle, the serfs, the chewa, the artisans and the traders constitute definite classes. Power was vested in the Emperor and those aristocrats he appointed to execute his power, and the power enforcing instrument consisted of a class of soldiers, the chewa.<ref>Transitional government of Ethiopia, National Conservation Strategy, 1994, http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/720181468749078939/pdf/multi-page.pdf</ref>

==Military==
From the reign of [[Amde Tseyon]], [[Chewa people|Chewa]] regiments, or legions, formed the backbone of the Empire military forces. The Ge’ez term for these regiments is ṣewa (ጼዋ) while the Amharic term is č̣äwa (ጨዋ). The normal size of a regiment was several thousand men.<ref>Mordechai ABIR, Ethiopia and the Red Sea, p.51 https://books.google.com/books?id=7fArBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA153&dq=chewa%20ehiopia&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> Each regiment was allocated a fief (Gult), to ensure its upkeep ensured by the land revenue.<ref>Mordechai ABIR, Ethiopia and the Red Sea, p.49 https://books.google.com/books?id=7fArBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA153&dq=chewa%20ehiopia&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>

In 1445, following the [[Battle of Gomit]], the chronicles record that Emperor Zara Yacoq started garrisoning the provinces with Chewa regiments.

Major divisions of the military were :
* Regiments at the court, under high court officials
* Regiments in the provinces, under regional Rases or other officials
* Regiments in border regions, or more autonomous provinces, such as [[Hadiya Sultanate|Hadiya]], [[Medri Bahri|Bahir Negash]], [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]], under azmač who were military officials appointed by the king.<ref>Deresse Ayenachew, Evolution and Organisation of the Ç̌äwa Military Regiments in Medieval Ethiopia, Annales d'Ethiopie, p.88, https://www.persee.fr/docAsPDF/ethio_0066-2127_2014_num_29_1_1559.pdf</ref>

One of the Chewa regiments, known as the ''Abe Lahm'' in Geez, or the ''Weregenu'', in Oromo, lasted, and participated to the [[Battle of Adwa]], only to be phased out in the 1920s.<ref>Tsehai Berhane-Selassie, Ethiopian Warriorhood, Boydell & Brewer, p.104)</ref>

The modern army was created under Ras Tafari Makonnen, in 1917, with the formation of the [[Kebur Zabagna]], the imperial guard.
