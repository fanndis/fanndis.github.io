Why don't we use their names - the names of the heroes that today unite Ukraine?"<ref name="/7212672/ Zelensky" />

In response to suggestions to the contrary, he stated in April 2019 that he regarded Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] "as an enemy".<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukraine-poll-leader-volodymyr-zelensky-sees-putin-as-an-enemy-79lp8f0dd |title=Ukraine poll leader Volodymyr Zelensky sees Putin as an enemy|last=Kyiv|first=Tom Parfitt|date=19 April 2019 |work=The Times |access-date=22 April 2019|issn=0140-0460|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190421110128/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukraine-poll-leader-volodymyr-zelensky-sees-putin-as-an-enemy-79lp8f0dd|archive-date=21 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 2 May 2019 Zelensky wrote on Facebook that "the border is the only thing Russia and Ukraine have in common".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unian.info/politics/10536390-zelensky-border-only-common-thing-between-ukraine-russia.html|title=Zelensky: Border only "common" thing between Ukraine, Russia|website=www.unian.info|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504143937/https://www.unian.info/politics/10536390-zelensky-border-only-common-thing-between-ukraine-russia.html|archive-date=4 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although Zelensky prefers elections with [[open list]] election ballots, after he called the snap [[2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election]] his draft law "On amendments to some laws of Ukraine in connection with the change of the electoral system for the election of people's deputies" proposed to hold the election with [[closed list]] because the 60-day term to the snap election didn't "leave any chances for the introduction of this system".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2019/05/22/7215799/|title=Опублікували виборчий закон Зеленського, у нардепів є альтернатива|website=Українська правда|access-date=22 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522130350/https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2019/05/22/7215799/|archive-date=22 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Accusation of abusing power ===
Despite his image as a Ukrainian patriot and nationalist, critics have accused him of abusing power and attempting to build a totalitarian Ukraine.<ref>https://www.stalkerzone.org/duda-and-zelensky-collusion-between-two-totalitarian-regimes/</ref> During the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]], Zelensky was accused of a link to the Russian government, something he had denied.<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/russia-disinformation-ukraine-election/587179/</ref>

During his speech when he was first elected as President of Ukraine, he was accused of not addressing tensions with Russia with regard to Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk; and his lack of interests about rampant corruption within the country.<ref>https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/zelensky_unchained_what_ukraines_new_political_order_means_for_its_future</ref> This issue has remained unaddressed as of 2020, with speculation that Zelensky might be hiding his corruption himself.<ref>https://eurasianet.org/a-brief-history-of-corruption-in-ukraine-the-dawn-of-the-zelensky-era</ref>

A number of [[No to capitulation!|anti-Zelensky protests]] occurred in 2019 when it emerged that Zelensky had sought to seek peace in Eastern Ukraine without addressing the public demand of majority Ukrainians.<ref>[https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-zelenskyi-bryfing/30193653.html Zelensky unexpectedly called a briefing - broadcast] </ref><ref>[https://24tv.ua/yakshho_tam_budut_bud_yaki_viyska__viboriv_ne_bude_zelenskiy_pro_formulu_shtaynmayera_n1213295 Якщо там будуть будь-які війська&nbsp;— виборів не буде,&nbsp;— Зеленський про формулу Штайнмаєра]</ref><ref name="51543463Ukrainentc">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51543463 Ukraine conflict: Deadly flare-up on eastern front line], [[BBC News]] (18 February 2020)</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-49903996</ref>

In 2020, Zelensky himself proposed a new law which would lead to increasing media censorship in Ukraine, causing criticism that he was looking to establish a totalitarian state and that he was abusing power for himself.<ref>https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/voice-of-america-journalists-see-censorship-in-ukraines-proposed-media-laws.html?cn-reloaded=1</ref> Critics complained that this law would lead to state censorship because its clause of criminal responsibility for the distribution of disinformation could be abused.<ref>https://www.voanews.com/press-freedom/journalists-see-specter-censorship-ukraines-proposed-media-laws</ref>
