==Early life==
Earl Simmons was born in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]<!-- His own bio says Mount Vernon. Do not change it unless you can prove otherwise --> on December 18, 1970, the son of 19 year old Arnett Simmons and 18 year old Joe Barker, and was raised in [[Yonkers, New York]]. He has no middle name, and was simply named Earl at birth. Earl was the second child of Arnett, who had given birth to a daughter, Bonita, two years prior, as well as one daughter, Shayla, and two stillborn sons after Earl. Barker did not want Simmons to keep her son, and cut off almost all contact with the family as soon as Earl was born. As a child, Simmons suffered greatly from [[bronchial asthma]], being taken to the emergency room almost nightly due to him waking up unable to breathe.<ref name=autobiographyp7>{{Cite book|title=E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nUFO9VOaOcC|first1=Earl|last1=Simmons|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|page=7|first2=Smokey D.|last2=Fontaine|author-link2=Smokey Fontaine|mode=cs2|name-list-style=amp|isbn=9780060934033}}</ref><ref name="allmusic"/> He was brought up in the [[Jehovah's Witness]] faith. At some point in his childhood, Simmons was hit by a drunk driver while crossing the street and suffered minor injuries. He claims his family could have received as much as $10,000 in a legal settlement, but his mother refused to open a case as she claimed it went against her faith.<ref name=autobiographyp10>{{Cite book|title=E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nUFO9VOaOcC|first1=Earl|last1=Simmons|year=2003|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|page=8|first2=Smokey D.|last2=Fontaine|author-link2=Smokey Fontaine|mode=cs2|name-list-style=amp|isbn=9780060934033}}</ref>

Simmons went through a disjointing childhood that included being [[Physical_abuse|beaten]] by his mother and her various boyfriends so badly that he lost teeth, and sustained numerous bruises and cuts on his face. When Simmons was 5 years old, his family settled in Yonkers, New York. At the end of the fifth grade, Simmons was kicked out of school and sent to the Julia Dyckman Andrus Children's Home for 18 months. When he was 14, Simmons began wandering the streets of Yonkers to escape his mother's abuse, and eventually found comfort in befriending stray dogs that walked the streets at night. Shortly after he began doing this, his mother once again sent him to a [[group home|boys' home]]. During his stay at the boys' home, Simmons bonded with other students from New York over their shared love of [[hip-hop music]], and after performing for his friends, they encouraged Simmons to continue writing music to the behest of his teacher. When he returned home, Simmons met Ready Ron, a local rapper, who, impressed with Simmons' beatboxing skills, asked him to become his partner. Simmons chose the name "DMX", which came from an instrument he had used at the boys' home, the [[Oberheim DMX]] [[drum machine]]; it later was also interpreted as "Dark Man X".<ref name= allmusic /><ref name=autobiographyp10/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/slippin-played-court-rapper-dmx-gets-year-prison-tax-evasion-n861121|title=DMX song played in court before rapper gets a year in prison for tax evasion|work=NBC News|access-date=June 7, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Musical career==

===1991–1995: Career beginning===
DMX got his start in the music industry in 1984, when he would beatbox for a local rapper named Ready Ron. After serving time in prison, he began writing his own lyrics and would perform at the local rec center for younger children. After going to prison again in 1988, he began taking rapping more seriously, dedicating almost all of his free time to writing lyrics and also meeting and rapping with [[K-Solo]] while incarcerated. When he was released that summer, he began producing and selling his own mixtapes where he would rap over instrumentals from other songs and sell them on street corners, which helped him build a local fan base all over New York.<ref name=autobiographyp7/> In 1991, Gabriel Grevenstuk from ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine praised DMX in his ''Unsigned Hype'' column that highlighted unsigned hip-hop artists. The same year, he recorded his first demos, ''Unstoppable Force'' and ''Three Little Pigs''.

In 1992, [[Columbia Records]] signed DMX to their subsidiary label Ruffhouse, which released his debut single "Born Loser". The single did not receive much airplay,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the label eventually agreed to release DMX from their contract.

He released his second single, "Make a Move" in 1994, and made a guest appearance alongside [[Jay Z]], [[Ja Rule]], and [[Mic Geronimo]] on the classic underground track "Time To Build" on Mic Geronimo's debut album in 1995. He also appeared on [[LL Cool J]]'s single "[[4, 3, 2, 1 (LL Cool J song)|4, 3, 2, 1]]" in 1997. Additional guest spots on [[Mase]] singles "[[24 Hrs. to Live]]" and "Take What's Yours", and [[D-Block (hip hop)|The LOX]]'s single "[[Money, Power & Respect (song)|Money, Power & Respect]]" created a strong buzz for the then-unsigned rapper.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=DMX Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p68246|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=June 12, 2007|accessdate=May 18, 2008}} Note: Source gives birthplace as Baltimore, Maryland.</ref> DMX also made a cameo appearance in the [[Sum 41]] music video for "[[Makes No Difference]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/s/sum41_01_7q/index.jhtml |title=7 Questions With Sum41 |publisher=[[MTV]]|date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224020529/http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/s/sum41_01_7q/index.jhtml |archive-date=December 24, 2010 }}</ref>

===Feud with Ja Rule===
During the 1990s, DMX had formed a close bond with fellow up-and-coming rappers [[Jay Z]] and [[Ja Rule]], with the three collaborating with each other many times and forming a group known as [[Murder Inc.

After the breakup of Murder Inc., DMX went on to disparage Ja Rule in interviews, accusing him of being a copycat, drawing comparisons between himself and what he saw as Ja stealing his signature "gruff" style of delivery. DMX would later release a diss track, ''They Want War'' on a 2002 [[DJ Kay Slay]] mixtape; Ja Rule would never directly respond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dmx-they-want-war-ja-rule-diss-lyrics|title=DMX – They Want War (Ja Rule Diss)|website=Genius.com}}</ref> As time passed and the feud faded into obscurity, DMX said that he wanted to officially bring it to an end when he was released from prison in 2005: "[[Irv Gotti|Gotti]] came to me in jail and said I want to make peace with you and him.
