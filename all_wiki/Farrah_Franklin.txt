She started singing at age two, inspired by Bohanon, who played bass guitar in local bands. She also had a passion for acting and dance. When Franklin was eight, she began performing in plays at the [[Fresno Memorial Auditorium]]. She was in the concert choir at [[Central High School (Fresno, California)|Central High School]], where she was bullied. At fifteen, Franklin became motivated to leave Fresno to pursue a career in entertainment, after her aunt moved to [[Los Angeles]]. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fQpVKSBR-k</ref> She went by the name, Destiny Franklin, before her stint in Destiny's Child. <ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BUiPwoYlgP1/</ref> She is of African-American and Italian descent, and the oldest of nineteen children, including a younger sister named Karrie.

==1999–2000: Destiny's Child==
In 1999, while living in [[Los Angeles]], Franklin was hired to be an extra in the music video for [[Destiny's Child]]'s "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]". It was there that she met with group members [[Beyoncé Knowles]], [[Kelly Rowland]], [[LeToya Luckett]], and [[LaTavia Roberson]]. At the time, she was in a fledgling singing group called Jane Doe, which was in the process of disbanding. In January 2000, [[Mathew Knowles]] invited Franklin and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] to join [[Destiny's Child]], replacing previous group members LaTavia and LeToya without notice. The two were introduced to fans in February 2000 via the music video for "[[Say My Name]]". <ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/1504044/destinys-childs-long-road-to-fame-the-song-isnt-called-survivor-for-nothing/</ref> Franklin toured and performed with the group, also appearing in the music video for "[[Jumpin', Jumpin']]".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjw92oUduEM</ref> She contributed vocals to various Destiny Child songs, including "Jumpin', Jumpin'" (Remixes), "Upside Down" (Live at [[VH1 Divas]]), and "Dot", as well as a few tracks on ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', released after her departure, like "[[Independent Women]]" and "Dance with Me”. <ref>https://genius.com/artists/Destinys-child</ref>

On July 20, 2000, after five months with Destiny's Child, Franklin exited the group. A day later, group member Beyoncé claimed in an interview that Franklin had missed three major promotional dates and expressed a lack of interest in continuing with the group, leaving them with no other choice but to dismiss her.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428043/destinys-child-talks-split-with-farrah.jhtml |title=Destiny's Child Talks Split with Farrah |publisher=MTV.com |date=July 21, 2000 |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref> In a later interview, Franklin denied Beyoncé's allegation, stating that she had suffered from dehydration and a stomach virus but was recovering as she traveled with the group to do shows in Seattle and Europe. Farrah contended that after being verbally attacked by management (Mathew), due to her not showing up because she was ill, she stormed out of the room and left the group. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFVfhfAdcOI</ref>
