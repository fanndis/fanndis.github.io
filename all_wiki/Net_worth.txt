{{other uses|Net Worth (disambiguation)}}
'''Net worth''' is the value of all the non-financial and financial [[asset]]s owned by an individual or institution minus the value of all its outstanding liabilities.<ref>''System of National Accounts 2008'', published by the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, and the World Bank, p. 49, section 3.109.</ref> Since financial assets minus outstanding liabilities equal net financial assets, net worth can also be conveniently expressed as non-financial assets plus net financial assets. It can apply to companies, individuals, governments or economic sectors such as the sector of financial corporations or to entire countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/magazine/16Worth-t.html |title=Net-Worth Obsession |author=Ron Lieber |date=May 12, 2010 |work=The New York Times}}</ref>  

==By entity==
===Companies===
Net worth in business is also referred to as [[Equity (finance)|equity]]. It is generally based on the value of all assets and liabilities at the [[market value|carrying value]] which is the value as expressed on the [[financial statements]]. To the extent items on the [[balance sheet]] do not express their true (market) value, the net worth will also be inaccurate.  On reading the balance sheet, if the accumulated losses exceed the shareholder's equity, net worth becomes negative.

Net worth in this formulation does ''not'' express the [[market value]] of a firm; a firm may be worth more (or less) if sold with a [[going concern]].

Net worth vs. debt is a significant aspect of business loans. Business owners are required to "trade on equity" in order to further increase their net worth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=C.O.|title=The Ration of Net Worth to Debt|journal=The University Journal of Business|year=1925|volume=4|issue=1|pages=38–46|doi=10.1086/506818|jstor=2354605}}</ref>  

===Individuals===
For individuals, net worth or wealth refers to an individual's net economic position: the value of the individual's assets minus liabilities. Examples of assets that an individual would factor into their net worth include retirement accounts, other investments, home(s), and vehicles. Liabilities include both secured debt (such as a home mortgage) and unsecured debt (such as consumer debt or personal loans). Typically intangible assets such as educational degrees are not factored into net worth, even though such assets positively contribute to one's overall financial position.

For a deceased individual, net worth can be used for the value of their [[Estate (law)|estate]] when in [[probate]]. 

Individuals with considerable net worth are described in the financial services industry as [[high-net-worth individual]]s and [[ultra high-net-worth individual]]s.<ref name="HuttonTimes5nov2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/article40905.ece|title=Rich spurn ultra-luxury cars|publisher=The Sunday Times|location=UK|date=5 November 2006|author=Ray Hutton|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

In [[personal finance]], knowing an individual's net worth can be important to understand their current financial standing and give a reference point for measuring future financial progress.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwabmoneywise.com/public/moneywise/essentials/personal_net_worth|title=Your Personal Net Worth|date=2020|website=schwabmoneywise.com|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

===Governments===
Balance sheets that include all assets and liabilities can also be constructed for governments. Compared with government debt, a government's net worth is an alternative measure of the government's financial strength. Most governments utilize an accrual-based accounting system in order to provide a transparent picture of government operational costs. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shead|first=Bob|date=1999|title=Measuring Governments' Net Worth|journal=Agenda: A Journal of Policy Analysis and Reform|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–350|jstor=43199050}}</ref> Other governments may utilize cash accounting in order to better foresee future fiscal events. The accrual-based system is more effective, however, when dealing with the overall transparency of a government's spending. Massive governmental organizations rely on consistent and effective accounting in order to identify total net worth. 

===Countries===
A country's net worth is calculated as the sum of the net worth of all companies and individuals resident in this country, plus the government's net worth. As for the United States, this measure is referred to as the [[Financial position of the United States|financial position]], and totaled $123.8 trillion as of 2014.<ref>Federal Reserve (2014-06-05).
