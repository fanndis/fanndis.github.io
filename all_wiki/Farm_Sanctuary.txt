'''Farm Sanctuary''' is an American animal protection organization, founded in 1986 as an advocate for [[Livestock|farmed animals]].

The original version of the documentary film ''[[Peaceable Kingdom (documentary)|Peaceable Kingdom]]'' featured Farm Sanctuary and people that work or visit there. The most recent version of the film no longer includes Farm Sanctuary footage. The documentary ''[[The Ghosts in Our Machine]]'' (2014) has a scene in which [[Jo-Anne McArthur]] visits the farm in order to escape the stresses of her work photographing factory farms.

==History==
Farm Sanctuary was founded in 1986 by [[Gene Baur]] and [[Lorri Houston]] (then known as Gene and Lorri Bauston). It was originally funded by sales of [[vegetarian hot dog]]s at [[Grateful Dead]] concerts.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McNeil|first=Donald G., Jr.|author-link=Donald McNeil Jr.|date=January 2, 2004|title=Where the Cows Come Home; Sanctuary Farm Applauds Ban on Butchering of Sick Animals|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/nyregion/where-cows-come-home-sanctuary-farm-applauds-ban-butchering-sick-animals.html|url-status=live|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817003848/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/02/nyregion/where-cows-come-home-sanctuary-farm-applauds-ban-butchering-sick-animals.html|archive-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The first animal rescued was a sheep named Hilda, who was rescued from a pile of dead animals behind a [[Meat packing industry|stockyard]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Hilda: The First Animal Rescued by Farm Sanctuary|url=https://www.farmsanctuary.org/the-sanctuaries/rescued-animals/featured-past-rescues/hilda/|publisher=Farm Sanctuary|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109174300/https://www.farmsanctuary.org/the-sanctuaries/rescued-animals/featured-past-rescues/hilda/|archive-date=November 9, 2019|access-date=May 10, 2020}}</ref>

===Confinement systems===
{{Close paraphrasing|section|source=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2008-11-02-california-proposition-2-hens_N.htm|date=May 2020}}
Farm Sanctuary has successfully banned various confinement systems of [[farm animals]] by supporting voter referendums. In 2002, Farm Sanctuary was part of a coalition of groups that comprised Floridians for Humane Farms, which sponsored the initiative that amended the [[Florida Constitution]] to limit the "cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy." The measure, which passed with 55 percent approval, outlaws caging pigs in [[gestation]] stalls, which are metal enclosures that measure two feet across and prevent sows from turning around freely.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In 2006, [[Arizona]] residents voted on [[Proposition 204]], which requires that pregnant pigs and calves raised for [[veal]] be kept in enclosures large enough that they can turn around and fully extend their limbs by December 31, 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Crawford|first=Amanda J.|date=October 28, 2006|title=Hog industry realities color Prop. 204 debate|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|url=http://cals.arizona.edu/media/archives/18.8.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612111419/http://cals.arizona.edu/media/archives/18.8.html|archive-date=June 12, 2011|via=the [[University of Arizona]]}}</ref> A majority of voters, 62 percent, approved the measure, known as the Humane Treatment of Farm Animals Act, which received funding from Farm Sanctuary.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lovley|first=Erika|date=November 10, 2006|title=Pigs Win Bigger Pens in Arizona Ballot Fight|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2006/11/10/pigs-win-bigger-pens-in-arizona-ballot-fight/|url-status=live|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200511031822/https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2006/11/10/pigs-win-bigger-pens-in-arizona-ballot-fight/|archive-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

In 2008, Californians voted on [[California Proposition 2 (2008)|Proposition 2]], which requires California farmers to provide egg-laying hens, veal calves, and pregnant pigs with housing that gives them enough room to move around beginning January 1, 2015. The law would mostly impact the state's 18 million egg-laying hens.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rojas|first=Aurelio|date=September 27, 2008|title=2008 Ballot Watch: Proposition 2: Standards for confining farm animals|page=A3|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]}}</ref> Current{{When|date=May 2020}} industry standards call for caged hens to get at least 67 square inches of space each, a little less than a regular-size sheet of paper (a sheet of paper is 93.5 square inches), and hens are typically caged in groups of two to eight.

===Foie gras===

Farm Sanctuary achieved a legislative victory in California when, in September 2004, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed into law [[California foie gras law|Senate Bill 1520]], sponsored in part by Farm Sanctuary, which bans the force-feeding of ducks and geese in the production of [[foie gras]] and the sale of the product when made from force-fed birds. Both provisions took effect in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Milionis|first=Allison|date=January 20, 2005|title=Protests target Wolfgang Puck's Spago in effort to reform farm animal conditions|work=[[LA CityBeat]]}}</ref>

===Cloning===

Farm Sanctuary has been active in the opposition against the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval of [[cloning|cloned animals]] for food. Their opposition is based on health problems in the cloned animals and problems that the maternal carrier has while pregnant with the cloned animal. Farm Sanctuary claims increased rates of [[hydrops fetalis]], [[Large Offspring Syndrome]], and other systemic abnormalities.<ref>

==Litigation==
Farm Sanctuary member Michael Baur, a professor at the [[Fordham University School of Law]], filed an unsuccessful petition in 1998 with the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) claiming the consumption of [[Downer (animal)|downed animals]] created a serious risk of transmission of some progressive neurological diseases, including [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), or mad cow disease. The subsequent lawsuit, ''Baur v. Veneman'', claimed then-current USDA regulations on downed livestock violated the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]]. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]] dismissed the case for lack of [[Standing (law)|standing]] in 2002, but the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit]] reversed Buchwald's decision on December 16, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Challenge to U.S. Meat Inspections Moves Forward|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1071719763576|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040103190628/http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1071719763576|archive-date=January 3, 2004|last=Hamblett|first=Mark|date=December 30, 2003|work=[[New York Law Journal]]|url-access=subscription|url-status=live}}</ref> The 2nd Circuit found it significant that: "the USDA itself as well as other government agencies have recognized that downed [[cattle]] are especially susceptible to BSE infection."<ref>United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Baur v.

Farm Sanctuary was part of a coalition of groups that challenged the [[New Jersey Department of Agriculture]]'s standards governing the raising, keeping, and marketing of domestic livestock. The case went to the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]], which in its July 30, 2008, ruling unanimously said the Department of Agriculture failed, in part, to carry out its mandate in setting humane standards. The Court further rejected agency regulations that certain mutilations of farmed animals such as [[castration]], [[debeaking]], and toe-trimming are "humane" as long as they are carried out by a "knowledgeable individual" "in a way to minimize pain."<ref>[http://lawlibrary.rutgers.edu/decisions/supreme/a-27-07.doc.html New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, et al. v.

==Influence on business==
Farm Sanctuary prompted [[Burger King]] franchise owner David Kessler to bring a [[veggie burger]] to customers in western New York in 1993. Mr. Kessler said that getting corporate approval for his request to test market the Griller "was like turning the {{RMS|Queen Mary}} around in a bathtub", but that he was able to prove that the veggie burger was very popular.<ref>{{Cite news|date=May 15, 1994|title=Burger King Says No to Soy Patties in Berkeley|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/us/burger-king-says-no-to-soy-patties-in-berkeley.html|url-status=live|url-access=limited|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216215952/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/15/us/burger-king-says-no-to-soy-patties-in-berkeley.html|archive-date=February 16, 2018}}</ref> In March 2002, Burger King announced it was adding a veggie burger nationwide to its permanent menu, with [[Morningstar Farms]] as its sole supplier.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zunitch|first=Victoria|date=May 14, 2002|title=Burger King serves up veggie burger|publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/03/14/news/companies/burgerking_veggie/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330133323/https://money.cnn.com/2002/03/14/news/companies/burgerking_veggie/|archive-date=March 30, 2016}}</ref>

In March 2007, [[Wolfgang Puck]] Companies announced that, with "advice from Farm Sanctuary" they were rolling out a nine-point program aimed at "stopping the worst practices associated with [[factory farming]]" at all their ventures, including 14 full-service restaurants and 80 fast casual units. This included only using eggs from [[cage-free]] hens not confined to [[battery cages]], and serving all-natural or organic crate-free [[pork]] and [[veal]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Going All-Natural One Better|url=https://www.restaurant-hospitality.com/observer/rh_imp_16619/|last=Krummert|first=Bob|date=March 30, 2007|website=Restaurant Hospitality|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200511052116/https://www.restaurant-hospitality.com/observer/rh_imp_16619|archive-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

==Rescue, rehabilitation, and shelter==
Farm Sanctuary was one of four animal welfare groups that responded to the [[Secretary of Agriculture of Iowa|Iowa Department of Agriculture]]'s call to help pigs after severe flooding hit the state in the summer of 2008. Iowa is the leading pork-producing state in the U.S. More than 60 pigs ended up at Farm Sanctuary's Watkins Glen, New York shelter.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Short|first=Alice|date=September 9, 2008|title=Pigging out at Farm Sanctuary|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2008/09/the-trip-from-o.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930121748/https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2008/09/the-trip-from-o.html|archive-date=September 30, 2012}}</ref> Farm Sanctuary documented the relief efforts in a [[blog]] entitled "2008 Midwest Flood Pig Rescue."<ref>[http://floodrescue2008.blogspot.com/ 2008 Midwest Flood Pig Rescue]</ref>

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Farm Sanctuary rescued more than 700 chickens from a [[broiler]] factory in [[Mississippi]] that had been hit by a tornado. Susie Coston, the shelter director in Watkins Glen, New York, said: "The animals at these facilities are raised in warehouses and many farms have over 500,000 birds at one time. When they were hit by storms, the majority of the birds were bulldozed, some alive, into mass graves." In addition to [[factory farms]], the Watkins Glen sanctuary receives animals from neglect cases, starvation cases, and New York City markets.<ref>"Coston '87 Enjoys Labor of Love on the Farm", ''West Virginia Wesleyan College Campus News'', August 2, 2007</ref> The facility holds tours May through October, and there are three vegan [[Bed and breakfast|bed-and-breakfast]] cabins for overnight visitors.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sachs|first=Andrea|date=June 15, 2008|title=I Love Moo: Tales From A N.Y.

On January 26, 2009, Farm Sanctuary launched "Sanctuary Tails", a blog authored by national shelter director Susie Coston and California shelter director Leanne Cronquist, about the organization's efforts to rescue, rehabilitate, and provide daily care for farm animals.<ref>[http://farmsanctuary.typepad.com/sanctuary_tails/ Sanctuary Tails]</ref>

Since 1993, Farm Sanctuary had maintained a shelter in Orland, California, where it housed farm animals and provided tours, but the Orland shelter closed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Leila|date=April 23, 2018|title=More room to roam: Orland Farm Sanctuary bids farewell|work=[[Chico Enterprise-Record]]|url=https://www.chicoer.com/2018/04/23/more-room-to-roam-orland-farm-sanctuary-bids-farewell/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106002602/https://www.chicoer.com/2018/04/23/more-room-to-roam-orland-farm-sanctuary-bids-farewell/|archive-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref> On September 14, 2011, Farm Sanctuary took over administration of the Animal Acres farm animal shelter in Acton, California. Animal Acres, which had been founded by Farm Sanctuary co-founder Lorri Houston, had come under financial pressures caused by the soft economy and consequent reduced donations. Farm Sanctuary had been providing volunteers to assist at Animal Acres since April 2011.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Farm Sanctuary Adds Animal Acres' Southern California Shelter to Its National Program|date=September 14, 2011|publisher=Animal Acres|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925030151/http://www.animalacres.org/library/enewsletters/2011/FS_AA|archive-date=September 25, 2011|url-status=dead|url=http://www.animalacres.org/library/enewsletters/2011/FS_AA}}</ref> Bufflehead Farm, a {{convert|12|acre|adj=on}} sanctuary farm in [[Middletown, New Jersey]], owned by [[Jon Stewart]], is affiliated with Farm Sanctuary.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Greenwood|first=Arin|date=October 26, 2015|title=Jon Stewart Makes His Post-'Daily Show' Plans Official|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jon-stewart-post-daily-show-plans_n_562e28bce4b0443bb5646ad5|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030133427/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jon-stewart-post-daily-show-plans_562e28bce4b0443bb5646ad5|archive-date=October 30, 2015}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 1993, Farm Sanctuary was listed as an organization that has "claimed to have perpetrated acts of [[extremism]] in the United States" in the Report to Congress on the Extent and Effects of Domestic and International Terrorism on Animal Enterprises.<ref>United States Department of Justice, Report to Congress on the Extent and Effects of Domestic and International Terrorism on Animal Enterprises, Appendix 1</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] later retracted the inclusion of Farm Sanctuary in this list. Future editions of the report were printed with a cover letter identifying this mistake, and a letter of apology was sent to Farm Sanctuary.<ref>{{Cite web|title=DOJ Letter|url=http://www.farmsanctuary.org/pdf/FS_letter.pdf|last=Anthony|first=Sheila F.|date=November 10, 1993|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs|Office of Legislative Affairs]]|via=Farm Sanctuary|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722233115/http://www.farmsanctuary.org/pdf/FS_letter.pdf|archive-date=July 22, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2008}}</ref>
