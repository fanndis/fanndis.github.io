The '''National Equality March''' was a national [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] that occurred October 11, 2009 in Washington, D.C. It called for equal protection for lesbian, gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people in all matters governed by civil law in all [[50 states]] and the District of Columbia.<ref name="NEMmainpage">{{cite web   | title = National Equality March – Our Single Demand   | publisher = Equality Across America  | url = http://equalityacrossamerica.org/blog/?page_id=19  | accessdate =October 11, 2009 }}</ref> The march was called for by activist [[David Mixner]] and implemented by [[Cleve Jones]],<ref>[http://equalityacrossamerica.org/blog/?p=298 Cleve Jones Joins Call for National LGBT March on Washington D.C.]</ref> and organized by '''Equality Across America''' and the [[Courage Campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=4270|title=National Equality March draws 100,000 to DC| last=Roehr |first=Bob |date=October 15, 2009 |publisher=Bay Area Reporter| accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Kip Williams and Robin McGehee served as co-directors.  Leaders like actress [[Michelle Clunie]], [[Courage Campaign]] marketing director, [[Billy Pollina]] and New York gubernatorial aide Peter Yacobellis hosted the first fundraiser in the spring of 2009. This was the first national march in Washington, D.C. for [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] since the 2000 [[Millennium March on Washington|Millennium March]].<ref>{{cite web | title = New group wants march on DC | publisher = Bay Area Reporter | url = http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=3603 | accessdate =October 11, 2009 }}</ref>

Many groups joined by also organizing other events for the weekend, which coincided with [[National Coming Out Day]] on October 11 and marked eleven years since the beating and murder of gay [[University of Wyoming]] student [[Matthew Shepard]], which prompted national attention and action to expand [[Hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime laws]].

Equality Across America, which is fiscally sponsored by the non-profit [[Tides Center]], states it intends to develop a network of decentralized organizers from each of the [[List of United States congressional districts|435 U.S. Congressional districts]].<ref name="NEMmainpage"/>

==History==
Hundreds of thousands of LGBT rights activists marched on Sunday, October 11, 2009 from the [[White House]] to the [[US Capitol|Capitol]], demanding that President [[Barack Obama]] keep his promises to allow gays to serve [[closeted|openly]] in the military and work to end discrimination against LGBT people.<ref name="Time"/> Many organizers were outraged after the passage of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which overturned the right of gays to get married in that state, and over perceived slights by the Obama administration.<ref name="FOX">{{cite news
