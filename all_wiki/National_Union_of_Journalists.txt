The '''National Union of Journalists''' ('''NUJ''') is a [[trade union]] for journalists in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It was founded in 1907<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tim Holmes|author2=Liz Nice|title=Magazine Journalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3JEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA53|accessdate=26 November 2015|date=10 November 2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-9203-7|page=53}}</ref> and has 38,000 members. It is a member of the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ).

==Structure==
[[File:NUJ HQ London.jpg|thumb|right|NUJ Headquarters, [[Gray's Inn Road]], London]]
There is a range of national councils below the NEC, covering different sections and areas of activity. There is an industrial council for each of the NUJ's "industrial" sectors – [[Newspapers]] and [[News agency|Agencies]], [[Freelance]], [[Magazine]] and [[Book]], [[Broadcast journalism|Broadcasting]], [[New Media]] and [[News media|Press]] and [[Public relations|PR]].

There are also national Executive Councils, covering all sectors, for Ireland and Scotland. The Irish Executive Council, which has a higher degree of autonomy, covers [[Northern Ireland]] as well as the Republic.<ref name="urlNUJ - About Us">{{cite web |url=http://www.nuj.org.uk/innerPagenuj.html?docid=27 |title=NUJ - About Us |format= |accessdate=}}</ref>

The union's structure is democratic and its supreme decision-making body is its Delegate Meeting, a gathering of elected delegates from all branches across the UK, Ireland and Europe.

Between meetings, decisions lie with the NUJ's National Executive Council, a committee of 27 people, elected annually by members. The NEC is chaired by a President, elected, along with a Vice-President and Treasurer, at the Annual Delegate Meeting.

The General Secretary (GS) is elected every five years by a national ballot of all members. The current GS is [[Michelle Stanistreet]].

The General Secretary is responsible for the day-to-day running of the union and directing its staff. However, important decisions such as authorising industrial action must be taken by the NEC.
