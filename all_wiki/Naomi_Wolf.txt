==Childhood and education==
Wolf was born in San Francisco, to a [[Jewish]] family.<ref>Wolf, in an interview on ''The Alex Jones Show'' podcast October 22, 08 @ 2:40:38 into the program: "Well, you know, I'm Jewish and so, you know, I think there's this very deep reaction in people with my ancestry because my dad's family was largely wiped out by the Holocaust, a sensitivity to travel restrictions because for people of my ethnicity there's a giant divide between people who got out before the border hardened during the National Nazi Socialist regime and those who waited a little too long.

In an interview with Melinda Henneberger in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wolf said she had been appointed in January 1999 and denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe. Wolf said she had mentioned the term "alpha male" only once in passing and that "[it] was just a truism, something the pundits had been saying for months, that the vice president is in a supportive role and the President is in an initiatory role ...

===''The Beauty Myth'' (1991)===
[[File:NLN Naomi Wolf.jpg|thumb|Naomi Wolf speaking at [[Brooklyn Law School]], January 29, 2009]]
In 1991, Wolf gained international attention as a spokeswoman of [[third-wave feminism]]<ref>''Project Syndicate'' [http://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/naomi-wolf "The Next Wave."]</ref><ref>Wolf, Naomi. ''The Beauty Myth''. New York: Bantham Doubleday Dell Publishing, 1991; p. 281: "The beauty myth can be defeated only through an electric resurgence of the woman-centered political activism of the seventies—a feminist third wave—updated to take on the new issues of the nineties ... I've become convinced that here are thousands of young women ready and eager to join forces with a peer-driven feminist third wave that would take on, along with the classic feminist agenda, the new problems that have arisen with the shift in Zeitgeist and beauty backlash."</ref> from the publication of her first book ''[[The Beauty Myth]]'', an international bestseller. It was named "one of the seventy most influential books of the twentieth century" by ''The New York Times''.<ref name="huffpo-blog"/><ref name=NYToneof70mostinfluential>{{cite book|last1=Deborah|first1=Felder|title=A Bookshelf of Our Own: Works that Changed Women's Lives|date=February 28, 2006|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corporation|isbn=9780806527420|pages=274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=swpp_Eayg4UC&q=New+York+Times%2C+Naomi+Wolf%2CBeauty+Myth%2C+one+of+the+most+important+books+of+the+twentieth+century&pg=PA274|access-date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> She argues that "beauty" as a normative value is entirely [[Social construction|socially constructed]], and that the [[patriarchy]] determines the content of that construction with the objective of maintaining women's subjugation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Diane|authorlink=Diane Johnson

Wolf posits the idea of an "iron-maiden", an intrinsically unattainable standard that is then used to punish women physically and psychologically for their failure to achieve and conform to it. Wolf criticized the fashion and beauty industries as exploitative of women, but added that the beauty myth extended into all areas of human functioning. Wolf writes that women should have "the choice to do whatever we want with our faces and bodies without being punished by an ideology that is using attitudes, economic pressure, and even legal judgments regarding women's appearance to undermine us psychologically and politically". Wolf argues that women were under assault by the "beauty myth" in five areas: work, religion, sex, violence, and hunger. Ultimately, Wolf argues for a relaxation of normative standards of beauty.<ref>''The Beauty Myth'', pp. 17–18, 20, 86, 131, 179, 218.</ref> In her introduction, Wolf positioned her argument against the concerns of second-wave feminists and offered the following analysis:

{{quote|The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through, the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us ... [D]uring the past decade, women breached the power structure; meanwhile, [[eating disorder]]s rose exponentially and cosmetic surgery became the fastest-growing specialty ... [P]ornography became the main media category, ahead of legitimate films and records combined, and thirty-three thousand American women told researchers that they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal ... More women have more money and power and scope and legal recognition than we have ever had before; but in terms of how we feel about ourselves physically, we may actually be worse off than our unliberated grandmothers.<ref>''The Beauty Myth.'' p. 10</ref>}}

====Accuracy====
[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] criticized Wolf for publishing the estimate that 150,000 women were dying every year from [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]. Sommers states that she tracked down the source to the American Anorexia and Bulimia Association who stated that they were misquoted; the figure refers to sufferers, not fatalities. Wolf's citation for the incorrect figure came from a book by Brumberg, who referred to an American Anorexia and Bulimia Association newsletter and misquoted the newsletter. Wolf accepted the error and changed it in future editions. Sommers gave an estimate for the number of fatalities in 1990 as 100–400.<ref name="Sommers1995">{{cite book|author=Christina Hoff Sommers|title=Who Stole Feminism?: How Women Have Betrayed Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIUtJziqIqAC&pg=PA12|date=May 1, 1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-80156-8|pages=12–13}}</ref><ref name="ScienceOfEatingDisorders2012">{{cite web|last=Pekars|first=Tetanya|title=Naomi Wolf Got Her Facts Wrong.

Caspar Schoemaker of the Netherlands Trimbos Institute published a paper in the academic journal ''Eating disorders'' demonstrating that of the 23 statistics cited by Wolf in ''Beauth Myth'', 18 were incorrect, with Wolf citing numbers that average out to 8 times the number in the source she was citing.<ref name="LieFactor">{{cite journal |last1=Schoemaker |first1=Casper |title=A Critical Appraisal of the Anorexia Statistics in The Beauty Myth: Introducing Wolf's Overdo and Lie Factor |journal=Eating Disorders |date=August 17, 210 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=97–102 |doi=10.1080/10640260490444619 |pmid=16864310 |s2cid=8704509 }}</ref>  For example, Wolf wrote that 7.5% of girls and women have anexoria, the accurate figure is 0.065%.<ref name="Murti">{{cite news |last1=Murti |first1=Atidi |title=Revisiting 'The Beauty Myth': What Are the Ethics of Applying Bad Facts to a Good Cause? |url=https://theswaddle.com/revisiting-the-beauty-myth-what-are-the-ethics-of-applying-bad-facts-to-a-good-cause/ |access-date=June 25, 2019 |publisher=The Swaddle |date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>

====Reception====
Although ''The Beauty Myth'' was a bestseller,<ref name="Smith" /> it received mixed responses from feminists and the media. [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist]] [[Germaine Greer]] wrote that ''The Beauty Myth'' was "the most important feminist publication since ''[[The Female Eunuch]]''", and [[Gloria Steinem]] wrote, "''The Beauty Myth'' is a smart, angry, insightful book, and a clarion call to freedom. Every woman should read it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Abbott |first=Carl |url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780385423977-7 |title=Reviews |publisher=Powells.com |access-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref> British novelist [[Fay Weldon]] called the book "essential reading for the New Woman".<ref name=peopleMagazine>Kim Hubbard, [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115393,00.html The Tyranny of Beauty, To Naomi Wolf, Pressure to Look Good Equals Oppression], ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'', June 24, 1991.</ref> [[Betty Friedan]] wrote in ''Allure'' magazine that "''The Beauty Myth'' and the controversy it is eliciting could be a hopeful sign of a new surge of feminist consciousness."

However, [[Camille Paglia]], whose ''[[Sexual Personae]]'' was published in the same year as ''The Beauty Myth'', derided Wolf as unable to perform "historical analysis", and called her education "completely removed from reality."<ref>Paglia, Camille.

Revisiting ''Beauty Myth'' in 2019 for ''The New Republic'', literary critic [[Maris Kreizman]] recalls that reading it as an undergraduate made her "world burst open." It "remains one of the most formative books in (Kreizman's) life." However, as she matured, Kreizman saw Wolf's books as "poorly argued tracts" that made "wilder and wilder assertions" even, in 2014, spreading a [[conspiracy theory]]  that the beheadings of American journalists [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]] and [[Steven Sotloff]] by [[ISIS]] were "faked and staged." Kreizman "began to write (Wolf) off as a fringe character" despite the fact that she had "once informed my own feminism so deeply."<ref name="KreizmanWolf">{{cite news |last1=Kreizman |first1=Maris |title=A Journey With Naomi Wolf |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/154208/journey-naomi-wolf |access-date=June 25, 2019 |publisher=[[The New Republic]] |date=June 14, 2019}}</ref>

===''Fire with Fire'' (1993)===
In ''Fire with Fire'' (1993), Wolf writes on politics, female [[empowerment]] and women's sexual liberation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Fire with Fire |url=https://archive.org/details/firewithfirenewf00wolf |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-679-42718-6}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' assailed the work for its "dubious oversimplifications and highly debatable assertions" and its "disconcerting penchant for inflationary prose," nonetheless approving of Wolf's "efforts to articulate an accessible, pragmatic feminism, ... helping to replace strident dogma with common sense."<ref>{{cite news|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DB1E39F930A35751C1A965958260&scp=1&sq=naomi%20wolf%20fire%20with%20fire&st=cse |title=Books of The Times; Helpful Hints for an Era of Practical Feminism|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 3, 1993}}</ref> The ''Time'' magazine reviewer Martha Duffy dismissed the book as "flawed," although she commented that Wolf was "an engaging raconteur" who was also "savvy about the role of TV – especially the Thomas-Hill hearings and daytime talk shows – in radicalizing women, including homemakers." She characterized the book as advocating an inclusive strain of feminism that welcomed abortion opponents.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Martha|title=Tremors of Genderquake|journal=Time|date=December 27, 1993|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979918,00.html|access-date=December 16, 2010}}</ref> In the UK, feminist author [[Natasha Walter]] writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' said that the book "has its faults, but compared with ''The Beauty Myth'' it has energy and spirit, and generosity too." Walter, however, criticized it for having a "narrow agenda" where "you will look in vain for much discussion of older women, of black women, of women with low incomes, of mothers." Characterizing Wolf as a "media star", Walter wrote: "She is particularly good, naturally, on the role of women in the media."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Natasha|title=How to change the world and be sexy: Fire with fire|journal=The Independent|date=November 18, 1993|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/book-review-how-to-change-the-world-and-be-sexy-fire-with-fire-naomi-wolf-chatto-windus-pounds-1199-1505274.html|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref>

===''Promiscuities'' (1997)===
''Promiscuities'' (1997) reports on and analyzes the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature is rife with examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by [[D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence]], [[Tobias Wolff]], [[J.&nbsp;D. Salinger]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], and covered misogynistically by [[Henry Miller]], [[Philip Roth]] and [[Norman Mailer]]. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that women must reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between [[Madonna–whore complex|virgin and whore]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Promiscuities |location=New York |publisher=Balantine Publishing Group |year=1997 |oclc=473694368}}</ref>

''Promiscuities'' generally received negative reviews. In ''The New York Times'', [[Michiko Kakutani]] called Wolf a "frustratingly inept messenger: a sloppy thinker and incompetent writer. She tries in vain to pass off tired observations as radical ''aperçus'', subjective musings as generational truths, sappy suggestions as useful ideas".<ref>{{cite news |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E3DB133CF933A25755C0A961958260 |title=Feminism Lite: She Is Woman, Hear Her Roar |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 10, 1997}}</ref> However, two days earlier in the ''Times'' Sunday edition, Weaver Courtney praised the book: "Anyone—particularly anyone who, like Ms. Wolf, was born in the 1960s—will have a very hard time putting down ''Promiscuities''. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire."<ref>{{cite news |first=Courtney |last=Weaver |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404EEDD133AF93BA35755C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 |title=Growing Up Sexual |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 8, 1997}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[The Library Journal]]'' excoriated the work, writing, "Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation. ... There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument."<ref>''The Library Journal'', June 1997.</ref>

===''Misconceptions'' (2001)===
''Misconceptions'' (2001) examines pregnancy and childbirth. Most of the book is told through the prism of Wolf's personal experience of her first pregnancy.<ref name="Dederer">{{cite news|last=Dederer|first=Claire|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/books/what-to-expect.html|title=What to Expect|work=The New York Times|date=October 7, 2001|access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> She describes the "vacuous impassivity" of the [[ultrasound]] technician who gives her the first glimpse of her new baby. Wolf laments her [[Caesarean section|C-section]] and examines why the procedure is commonplace in the United States, advocating a return to [[midwifery]]. The second half of the book is  anecdotal, focusing on inequalities between parents to child care.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |title=Misconceptions: Truth, Lies, and the Unexpected on the Journey to Motherhood |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-385-49302-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/misconceptionstr00wolf }}</ref>

In her ''New York Times'' review, [[Claire Dederer]] suggested it was inappropriate to consider "Wolf as a political theorist, and instead call her a memoirist. She does her best writing when she's observing her own life." Her capability as a memoirist is not "self-indulgent. It seems vital, and in a sense radical, in the tradition of 1970's feminists who sought to speak to every aspect of women's lives."<ref name="Dederer" />

===''The Treehouse'' (2005)===
Wolf's ''The Treehouse: Eccentric Wisdom from My Father on How to Live, Love, and See'' (2005) is an account of her [[midlife crisis]] attempt to reclaim her creative and poetic vision and revalue her father's love, and her father's force as an artist and a teacher.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===''The End of America'' (2007)===

Published in 2012 on the topic of the [[vagina]], ''Vagina: A New Biography'' was much criticized, especially by feminist authors.

In response to the criticism, Wolf stated in a television interview:
<blockquote>[A]nything that shows documentation of the brain and vagina connection is going to alarm some feminists... . ..also feminism has kind of retreated into the academy and sort of embraced the idea that all gender is socially constructed and so here is a book that is actually looking at science ... though there has been some criticisms of the book from some feminists ... who say, well you can't look at the science because that means we have to grapple with the science ... to me the feminist task of creating a just world isn't changed at all by this fascinating neuroscience that shows some differences between men and women.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130416014911/http://allangregg.tvo.org/episode/186847/feminist-author-naomi-wolf-%22vagina:-a-new-biography.%22 Allen Gregg TV interview] "Naomi Wolf on her new book, Vagina: A New Biography", January 18, 2013.

Wolf thought the term meant execution.

==Feminist issues==
===Abortion===

In an October 1995 article for ''[[The New Republic]]'' Wolf was critical of contemporary pro-choice positions, arguing that the movement had "developed a lexicon of [[dehumanization]]" and urged feminists to accept abortion as a form of homicide and defend the procedure within the ambiguity of this moral conundrum. She continued, "Abortion should be legal; it is sometimes even necessary. Sometimes the mother must be able to decide that the fetus, in its full humanity, must die."<ref name="Wolf-TNR">{{cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |journal=The New Republic |title=Our Bodies, Our Souls |volume=213 |issue=16 |pages=26–35 |date=October 16, 1995}} reprinted here [http://www.priestsforlife.org/prochoice/ourbodiesoursouls.htm].</ref>

Wolf concluded by speculating that in a world of "real gender equality," passionate feminists "might well hold candlelight vigils at abortion clinics, standing shoulder to shoulder with the doctors who work there, commemorating and saying goodbye to the dead."<ref name="Wolf-TNR"/> In an article for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine on the subtle manipulation of [[George W. Bush]]'s image among women, Wolf wrote in 2005: "Abortion is an issue not of ''Ms.'' Magazine-style fanaticism or suicidal Republican religious reaction, but a complex issue."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/columns/thesexes/9911/ |title=Female Trouble |date=May 21, 2005 |journal=New York}}</ref>

===Pornography===
Wolf suggested in a 2003 article for ''New York'' magazine that the ubiquity of internet pornography tends to enervate the sexual attraction of men toward typical real women. She writes, "The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male [[libido]] in relation to real women, and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as 'porn-worthy.' Far from having to fend off porn-crazed young men, according to Wolf, young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood, they can scarcely get, let alone hold, their attention." Wolf advocated abstaining from porn not on moral grounds, but because "greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity."<ref name="nymag.com">{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|title=The Porn Myth|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/trends/n_9437/|work=New York|date=October 9, 2003|access-date=November 17, 2019}}</ref>

===Women in Islamic countries===
Wolf has commented about the dress required of women living in Muslim countries. In ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' in August 2008, she wrote:
{{quote|The West interprets veiling as repression of women and suppression of their sexuality. But when I traveled in Muslim countries and was invited to join a discussion in women-only settings within Muslim homes, I learned that Muslim attitudes toward women's appearance and sexuality are not rooted in repression, but in a strong sense of public versus private, of what is due to God and what is due to one's husband. It is not that Islam suppresses sexuality, but that it embodies a strongly developed sense of its appropriate channeling – toward marriage, the bonds that sustain family life, and the attachment that secures a home.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wolf |first=Naomi |date=August 30, 2008 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Behind the veil lives a thriving Muslim sexuality |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/behind-the-veil-lives-a-thriving-muslim-sexuality/2008/08/29/1219516734637.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1}}</ref>}}

==Public interventions and accusations==
In the January 2013 issue of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', law and business professor [[Mark Nuckols]] wrote: "In her various books, articles, and public speeches, Wolf has demonstrated recurring disregard for the historical record and consistently mutilated the truth with selective and ultimately deceptive use of her sources." He further stated: "[W]hen she distorts facts to advance her political agenda, she dishonors the victims of history and poisons present-day public discourse about issues of vital importance to a free society." Nuckols argued that Wolf "has for many years now been claiming that a fascist coup in America is imminent. ... [I]n ''[[The Guardian]]'' she alleged, with no substantiation, that the U.S. government and big American banks are conspiring to impose a 'totally integrated corporate-state repression of dissent'."<ref name="Nuckols"/>

''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' journalist Max Fisher urged Wolf's readers "to understand the distinction between her earlier work, which rose on its merits, and her newer conspiracy theories, which are unhinged, damaging, and dangerous."<ref name="Fisher2014">{{cite news |first=Max |last=Fisher |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/10/5/6909837/naomi-wolf-isis-ebola-scotland-conspiracy-theories |title=The insane conspiracy theories of Naomi Wolf |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 5, 2014 |access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

[[Charles C. W. Cooke]], writing for ''[[National Review#National Review Online|National Review Online]]'', commented:
<blockquote>Over the last eight years, Naomi Wolf has written hysterically about coups and about vaginas and about little else besides. She has repeatedly insisted that the country is on the verge of martial law, and transmogrified every threat—both pronounced and overhyped—into a government-led plot to establish a dictatorship. She has made prediction after prediction that has simply not come to pass. Hers are not sober and sensible forecasts of runaway human nature, institutional atrophy, and constitutional decline, but psychedelic fever-dreams that are more typically suited to the ''[[InfoWars]]'' crowd.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Charles C.

Under the headline "Naomi Wolf Went Off the Deep End Long Ago", Aaron Goldstein in ''[[The American Spectator]]'' advised, "Her words must be taken not just with a grain of salt, but a full shaker's worth."<ref>{{cite news |first1=Aaron |last1=Goldstein |url=http://spectator.org/blog/60579/naomi-wolf-went-deep-end-long-ago |title=Naomi Wolf Went Off the Deep End Long Ago |work=The American Spectator |date=October 6, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Defense of Julian Assange===
Shortly after the [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] was arrested in 2010, she wrote in an article for ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'' that the allegations made against him by his two reputed victims amounted to no more than bad manners from a boyfriend.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/interpol-the-worlds-datin_b_793033?guccounter=1|title=Julian Assange Captured by World's Dating Police|work=The Huffington Post|date=December 7, 2010|access-date=November 17, 2019}}</ref> His accusers, she later wrote in several contexts, were working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and Assange had been falsely incriminated.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ditum|first=Sarah|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/sarah-ditum/2014/10/naomi-wolf-not-feminist-who-became-conspiracy-theorist-she-s-conspiracist-who|title=Naomi Wolf is not a feminist who became conspiracy theorist – she's a conspiracist who was once right|work=New Statesman|date=October 7, 2014|access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref>

On December 20, 2010, ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' featured a debate between Wolf and [[Jaclyn Friedman]] on the Assange case. According to Wolf, the alleged victims should have said no, asserted that they consented to having sex with him, and said the claims were politically motivated and demeaned the cause of legitimate rape victims.<ref>{{cite web | last = Goodman | first = Amy | authorlink = Amy Goodman | title = Naomi Wolf vs. Jaclyn Friedman: Feminists Debate the Sexual Allegations Against Julian Assange | work=Democracy Now! | date = December 20, 2010 | url = http://www.democracynow.org/2010/12/20/naomi_wolf_vs_jaclyn_friedman_a | access-date=December 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 2011 ''Guardian'' article she objected to Assange's two accusers having their anonymity preserved.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/05/julian-assange-sex-crimes-anonymity|title=Julian Assange's sex-crime accusers deserve to be named|work=The Guardian|date=January 5, 2011|access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref> In response, [[Katha Pollitt]] wrote in ''The Nation'' that the "point is a little bizarre: doesn’t Wolf realize that anonymity applies only to the media?

===Occupy Wall Street===
On October 18, 2011, Wolf was arrested and detained in New York during the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests, having ignored a police warnings not to remain on the street in front of a building. Wolf spent about 30 minutes in a cell.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wells|first=Matt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/19/naomi-wolf-occupy-wall-street-arrested |title=Naomi Wolf arrested at Occupy Wall Street protest in New York|work=The Guardian |location=London |date= October 19, 2011|access-date=October 20, 2011 }}</ref> She disputed the NYPD's interpretation of applicable laws: "I was taken into custody for disobeying an unlawful order.

A month later, Wolf argued in ''The Guardian'', citing leaked documents, that attacks on the [[Occupy movement]] were a coordinated plot, orchestrated by federal law enforcement agencies. Those leaks, she alleged, showed that the FBI was privately treating OWS as a terrorist threat, rather than the public assertions acknowledging it is a peaceful organization.<ref name="Crackdown">{{cite news|last=Wolf|first=Naomi | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/25/shocking-truth-about-crackdown-occupy |title=The shocking truth about the crackdown on Occupy |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= November 25, 2011|access-date=February 29, 2012 }}</ref> The response to this article ranged from praise to criticism of Wolf for being overly speculative and creating a "[[conspiracy theory]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Seaton|first=Matt|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/28/naomi-wolf-reception-responses-critics |title=Naomi Wolf: reception, responses, critics |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=November 28, 2011|access-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref> Wolf responded that there is ample evidence for her argument, and proceeded to review the information available to her at the time of the article, and what she alleged was new evidence since that time.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wolf, Naomi | url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/02/crackdown-occupy-controversy-rebuttal-naomi-wolf |title=The crackdown on Occupy controversy: a rebuttal |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= December 2, 2011|access-date=February 29, 2012 }}</ref>

Imani Gandy of Balloon Juice, wrote that "nothing substantiates Wolf's claims", that "Wolf's article has no factual basis whatsoever and is, therefore, a journalistic failure of the highest order" and that "it was incumbent upon (Wolf) to fully research her claims and to provide facts to back them up."<ref>{{cite news|author=Gandy, Imani | url= http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/11/27/naomi-wolfs-shocking-truths-about-ows-crackdowns-are-truthless/#more-86898 |title=Naomi Wolf's 'Shocking Truths' on #OWS Crackdowns Are False|work=Balloon Juice |date= November 27, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2015}}</ref> [[Corey Robin]], a political theorist, journalist, and associate professor of political science at [[Brooklyn College]] and the [[Graduate Center]] of the [[City University of New York]], stated on his [[blog]]: "The reason Wolf gets her facts wrong is that she's got her theory wrong."<ref>{{cite news|author=Robin, Corey| url  =http://coreyrobin.com/2011/11/27/the-occupy-crackdowns-why-naomi-wolf-got-it-wrong/ |title=The Occupy Crackdowns: Why Naomi Wolf Got It Wrong|date= November 27, 2011|access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref>

In early 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing the [[Global Intelligence Files]], a trove of e-mails [[Stratfor#2011 hacking incident|obtained via a hack]] by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] and [[Jeremy Hammond]]. Among them was an email with an official [[Department of Homeland Security]] document from October 2011 attached. It indicated that DHS was closely watching Occupy, and concluded, "While the peaceful nature of the protests has served so far to mitigate their impact, larger numbers and support from groups such as Anonymous substantially increase the risk for potential incidents and enhance the potential security risk to critical infrastructure." In late December 2012, [[FBI]] documents released following an [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request from the [[Partnership for Civil Justice Fund]] revealed that the FBI used counterterrorism agents and other resources to extensively monitor the national Occupy movement.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Dominique |last1=Debucquoy-Dodley |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/26/us/fbi-occupy/index.html |title=FBI considered Occupy movement potential threat, documents say |publisher=CNN.com |date=December 26, 2012 |access-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> The documents contained no references to agency personnel covertly infiltrating Occupy branches, but did indicate that the FBI gathered information from police departments and other law enforcement agencies relating to planned protests.<ref name="nyt2012-12-25">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/nyregion/occupy-movement-was-investigated-by-fbi-counterterrorism-agents-records-show.html | title=F.B.I.

In a December 2012 article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wolf wrote:
{{quote|It was more sophisticated than we had imagined: new documents show that the violent crackdown on Occupy last fall [2011]—so mystifying at the time—was not just coordinated at the level of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and local police. The crackdown, which involved, as you may recall, violent arrests, group disruption, canister missiles to the skulls of protesters, people held in handcuffs so tight they were injured, people held in bondage till they were forced to wet or soil themselves—was coordinated with the big banks themselves.

How simple ... just to label an entity a 'terrorist organization' and choke off, disrupt or indict its sources of financing.

[The FBI crackdown on Occupy] was never really about 'the terrorists'. It was not even about civil unrest. It was always about this moment, when vast crimes might be uncovered by citizens—it was always, that is to say, meant to be about you.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/29/fbi-coordinated-crackdown-occupy |title=Revealed: how the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occupy |first=Naomi |last=Wolf  |work=The Guardian |date=December 29, 2012 |access-date= April 19, 2013}}</ref>}}

''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' claimed that none of the documents revealed efforts by federal law enforcement agencies to disband the Occupy camps, and that the documents did not provide much evidence that federal officials attempted to suppress protesters' free speech rights. It was, said ''Mother Jones'', "a far cry from Wolf's contention."<ref>{{cite news |first1= Gavin |last1= Aronsen |url= https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/01/occupy-fbi-documents-naomi-wolf |title= What the FBI's Occupy Docs Do—and Don't—Reveal |work= Mother Jones |date=January 7, 2013 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Edward Snowden===
In June 2013, ''New York'' magazine reported Wolf, in a recent [[Facebook]] post, had expressed her "creeping concern" that [[NSA]] leaker [[Edward Snowden]] "is not who he purports to be, and that the motivations involved in the story may be more complex than they appear to be."<ref name="Coscarelli">{{cite news |first1=Joe |last1=Coscarelli |url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/06/naomi-wolf-edward-snowden-false-flag-conspiracy.html |title=Naomi Wolf Thinks Edward Snowden and His Sexy Girlfriend Might Be Government Plants |work=New York |date=June 14, 2013 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Wolf was similarly skeptical of Snowden's "very pretty pole-dancing Facebooking girlfriend who appeared for, well, no reason in the media coverage ... and who keeps leaking commentary, so her picture can be recycled in the press."<ref name="Coscarelli" /> She pondered whether he was planted by "the Police State".<ref name="Seitz-Wald">{{cite news|last=Seitz-Wald|first=Alex|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/19/here_come_the_edward_snowden_truthers/|title=Here come the Edward Snowden truthers|work=Salon|date=June 19, 2013|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

Wolf responded on her website: "I do find a great deal of media/blog discussion about serious questions such as those I raised, questions that relate to querying some sources of news stories, and their potential relationship to intelligence agencies or to other agendas that may not coincide with the overt narrative, to be extraordinarily ill-informed and naive." Specifically regarding Snowden, she wrote, "Why should it be seen as bizarre to wonder, if there are some potential red flags—the key term is 'wonder'—if a former NSA spy turned apparent whistleblower might possibly still be—working for the same people he was working for before?"<ref>{{cite news |first1=Naomi |last1=Wolf |url=http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/some-aspects-of-snowdens-presentation-that-i-find-worth-further-inquiry-an-update/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630205614/http://naomiwolf.org/2013/06/some-aspects-of-snowdens-presentation-that-i-find-worth-further-inquiry-an-update/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 30, 2013 |title=Some aspects of Snowden's presentation that I find worth further inquiry – an update |publisher=naomiwolf.org |date=June 15, 2013 |access-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref>

She was accused by the ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' website of making factual errors and misreadings.<ref name="Seitz-Wald" />

===Islamic State executions and other assertions===
In a series of Facebook postings in October 2014, Wolf questioned the authenticity of videos purporting to show [[ISIL beheading incidents|beheadings of two American journalists and two Britons]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] implying that they had been staged by the US government and that the victims and their parents were actors.<ref name="Fisher2014" /><ref name="Moynihan2014" /> Wolf also charged that the US was dispatching military troops not to assist in treating the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]], but to carry the disease back home to justify a military takeover of America. She further said that the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], in which Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom, was faked.<ref name="Fisher2014" /> Speaking about this at a demonstration in Glasgow on October 12, Wolf said, "I truly believe it was rigged."<ref>Peter Geoghegan [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/glasgow-rally-shows-independence-aspiration-intact-1.1961072 "Glasgow rally shows independence aspiration intact"], ''Irish Times'', October 13, 2014</ref>

Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, "All the people who are attacking me right now for 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what they are talking about ... people who assume the dominant narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, "I stand by what I wrote."<ref>{{cite news|last=Berry|first=Sarah|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/naomi-wolf-slammed-for-unhinged-conspiracy-theories-20141006-10qq5z.html |title=Naomi Wolf slammed for 'unhinged conspiracy theories' |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 6, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> However, in a later Facebook post, Wolf retracted her statement: "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged", she wrote.
<blockquote>I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, [[SITE Intelligence Group|SITE]], which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Naomi |last1=Wolf |url=https://www.facebook.com/naomi.wolf.author/posts/10152727754274476 |title=My letter to some news outlets |publisher=Facebook |date=October 6, 2014 |access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref></blockquote> Max Fisher commented that "the videos were widely distributed on open-source jihadist online outlets" while the "Maryland-based nonprofit SITE monitors extremist social media." Wolf deleted her original Facebook posts.<ref name="Fisher2014" />

==Private life==
Wolf's first marriage was to journalist [[David Shipley]], then an editor at ''[[The New York Times]]''. The couple had two children, a son and daughter.<ref name="Baxter" /> Wolf and Shipley divorced in 2005.<ref name="Cooke" />

On November 23, 2018, Wolf married Brian William O'Shea, a disabled US Army veteran, private detective, and owner of Striker Pierce Investigations. According to a ''New York Times'' article published in November 2018, Wolf and O'Shea met in 2014 due to threats against Wolf after reporting on human rights violations in the Middle East.<ref name="Mallozzi" /> The  couple live in New York City.

===Alleged "sexual encroachment" incident at Yale===
In 2004, in an article for ''New York'' magazine, Wolf accused literary scholar [[Harold Bloom]] of a "sexual encroachment" in late Fall 1983 by touching her inner thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote,

<blockquote>I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge.<ref name="WolfNYM2004">{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Naomi|title=The Silent Treatment|journal=New York |date=March 1, 2004|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/n_9932/ |access-date=May 19, 2010}}</ref>  Sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission.<ref name="WolfNYM2004" /></blockquote>

In ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine around the time the allegations against Bloom first surfaced, [[Meghan O'Rourke]] wrote that Wolf generalized about sexual assault at Yale on the basis of her alleged personal experience. Moreover, O'Rourke commented, that despite Wolf's assertion sexual assault existed at Yale, she did not interview any Yale students for her story. In addition, O'Rourke wrote, "She jumps through verbal hoops to make it clear she was not 'personally traumatized,' yet she spends paragraphs describing the incident in precisely those terms." O'Rourke wrote that, despite Wolf's claim that her educational experience was corrupted, "(s)he neglects to mention that she later was awarded a [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]] (scholarship)." O'Rourke concluded Wolf's "gaps and imprecision" in the ''New York'' article "give fodder to skeptics who think sexual harassment charges are often just a form of hysteria."<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Rourke|first=Meghan|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/02/crying_wolf.html|title=Crying Wolf|work=Slate|date=February 25, 2004|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

Separately, a formal complaint was filed with the [[US Department of Education]] [[Office for Civil Rights]] on March 15, 2011, by 16 current and former Yale students—12 female and 4 male—describing a sexually hostile environment at Yale. A [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] investigation of Yale University began in March 2011 in response to the complaints.<ref>Gassó, Jordi, [http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/apr/01/yale-under-investigation/ "Yale under federal investigation for possible Title IX violations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224180146/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/apr/01/yale-under-investigation/ |date=December 24, 2011}}, ''Yale Daily News'', April 1–2, 2011. Retrieved September 21, 2012.</ref> Wolf stated on CBS's ''[[The Early Show]]'' in April: "Yale has been systematically covering up much more serious crimes than the ones that can be easily identified." More specifically, she alleged "they use the sexual harassment grievance procedure in a very cynical way, purporting to be supporting victims, but actually using a process to stonewall victims, to isolate them, and to protect the university."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hostile-sexual-environment-at-yale/|title='Hostile sexual environment' at Yale?|work=CBS News|date=April 4, 2011|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref> Yale settled the federal complaint in June 2012, acknowledging "inadequacies" but not facing "disciplinary action with the understanding that it keeps in place policy changes instituted after the complaint was filed. The school (was) required to report on its progress to the Office of Civil Rights until May, 2014."<ref>Ariosto, David; Remizowski, Leigh. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120617181706/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-15/justice/justice_connecticut-yale-settlement_1_sexual-harassment-sexual-misconduct-sexually-hostile-environment?_s=PM:JUSTICE "Yale settles sexual harassment complaint"], CNN, June 15, 2012. Retrieved September 21, 2012.</ref>

In January 2018, Wolf accused Yale officials of blocking her from filing a formal grievance against Bloom. She told ''The New York Times'' that she had attempted to file the complaint in 2015 with Yale's University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, but that the university had refused to accept it.<ref name="Taylor20180116">{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Kate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/nyregion/naomi-wolf-harold-bloom-harassment-yale.html|title=''Beauty Myth'' Writer Says Yale Blocked Harassment Claim|work=The New York Times|date=January 16, 2018|access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> On January 16, 2018, Wolf said, she determined to see Yale's provost, [[Ben Polak]], in another attempt to present her case. "As she documented on [[Twitter]]," the newspaper reported, "she brought a suitcase and a sleeping bag, because she said she did not know how long she would have to stay. When she arrived at the provost's office, she said, security guards prevented her from entering any elevators. Eventually, she said, Aley Menon, the secretary of the sexual misconduct committee, appeared and they met in the committee's offices for an hour, during which she gave Ms. Menon a copy of her complaint."<ref name="Taylor20180116" /> This was reported and confirmed by Norman Vanamee who apparently met Wolf at Yale on this morning. In ''[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]'' magazine in January 2018, Vanamee returned to the story and wrote, "Yale University has a 93-person police department, and, after the guard called for backup, three of its armed and uniformed officers appeared and stationed themselves between Wolf and the elevator bank."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vanamee|first=Norman|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/a15844647/naomi-wolf-yale-harold-bloom/|title=Will Yale Finally Listen to Naomi Wolf?|work=Town & Country|date=January 23, 2018|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>

During an interview for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in spring 2015, Bloom denied ever being indoors with "this person" whom he referred to as "Dracula's daughter."<ref>{{cite news|last=D’Addario|first=Daniel|url=https://time.com/3841452/10-questions-with-harold-bloom/|title=10 Questions with Harold Bloom|work=Time|date=April 30, 2015|access-date=January 4, 2020}}</ref>
