== Plot ==
In 1966, [[George W. Bush]] endures an initiation by his fellow [[Yale University]] students as a [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] pledge. During the [[hazing]], Bush successfully recalls the names and nicknames of many of the fraternity members, and states that [[Bush family|his family]]'s political legacy is one in which he has no interest. After Bush is jailed in [[New Jersey]] for rowdiness following a football game, his father, [[George H. W. Bush]] states that he will help him, but for the last time. Following his graduation from Yale, Bush takes a job at an [[oil patch]] back in Texas, but he quits after a few weeks. In 1971, "Junior" reveals his real aspirations in a father-son talk: working in professional baseball. Bush is accepted into [[Harvard Business School]] with the help of his father.  After a night of heavy drinking, Bush crashes his car into [[Bush compound|his family estate]] and challenges his father to a fistfight. His younger brother, [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]], stops the fight.

In 1977, Bush announces he will run for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] to represent [[Texas's 19th congressional district|Texas's 19th district]]. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, [[Laura Bush|Laura Lane Welch]]. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, [[Kent Hance]], who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage [[Texas Tech University]] students. Bush does poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with the highest number of votes for a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate in the state's history.

In 1986, Bush becomes a [[born-again Christian]], gives up alcohol, and mends his relationship with his father. The elder Bush invites him to assist with what becomes his [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 presidential campaign]], although Bush himself suspects that he only was asked because Jeb was busy. Bush's political advisor, [[Karl Rove]], tells him that he has the potential to make a name for himself, but that he has not yet done anything with his life. Bush becomes a front office executive of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team, while his father oversees the victory of the [[Gulf War]]. Although Allied forces win the war within 100 hours, the elder Bush decides not to invade [[Iraq]] to depose [[Saddam Hussein]]. After his father loses the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]] to [[Bill Clinton]], Bush blames the loss on his decision not to depose Saddam.

In 1994, Bush runs for [[Governor of Texas]]. Despite his parents' objection to him entering the race, he wins, becoming the 46th governor of Texas on January 17, 1995. In 2000, he makes a [[2000 United States presidential election|successful bid to become President]]. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Bush labels [[Iran]], Iraq, and [[North Korea]] as the "[[axis of evil]]". In 2002, Bush searches for evidence that Saddam was creating [[nuclear weapon]]s, and has the army prepared. All of Bush's [[White House]] staff supports him except Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], who states that invading Iraq would [[destabilization|destabilize]] the country. Powell is generally overruled by [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] and [[U.S. Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who insist that the war would secure the United States' status as sole global superpower while spreading democracy throughout the Middle East.

In March 2003, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invades Iraq]] and the war appears to be a success, and Bush gives his "[[2003 Mission Accomplished speech|Mission Accomplished]]" speech on an aircraft carrier. When it becomes clear that there are no [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction within Iraq]], Bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command. Bush discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing. Bush is asked in a White House press conference what mistakes he made as President, a question that leaves him flustered and speechless. That night, Bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his family's legacy, which the elder Bush claims was intended for Jeb. Bush dreams of himself  playing center field at a baseball game. Bush attempts to catch a [[pop fly]], but it disappears.

== Cast ==
{{Div col}}
* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[George W. Bush]]: Stone's original idea for the main role was to propose it to [[Harrison Ford]], who he said had "a pretty similar face as of George Bush". Stone then cast [[Christian Bale]], who spent months researching for the role, but dropped out after he was not satisfied with the [[prosthetic makeup]] tests. Stone remarked, "Christian's a very [[Method acting|methodical actor]] and he has to have the makeup thing work for him."<ref name=MTV>{{cite news | author = Larry Carroll | title = What Do Batman And George W.

Brolin, cast at the "last minute",<ref name=MTV/> spent months working on Bush's distinctive vocal style, calling hotels in Texas and talking to the people at the front desk, listening to their accents. The actor also watched videos of Bush walking. Brolin said, "It changes over the years, how he walks in his 30s, how he walks in foreign lands, before [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] and afterward. People hold their emotions in their bodies. They can't fake it. Especially him."<ref name=Svetkey/>

Dreyfuss also told film critic Nathan Rabin in an interview that he did empathize with the former Vice President, calling him "true to himself", and saying that the real villain of ''W.'' was the American public, because it never responded with outrage to the Bush Administration's actions.

''W.'' was Oliver Stone's third film in a trilogy he made about the Presidency, set in the time from the 1960s to today: the set began with ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' and continued with ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''. Originally, he was attached to direct ''Pinkville'', a film about the [[United States Army|Army]]'s investigation of the [[My Lai Massacre]], but development was canceled due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] and actor [[Bruce Willis]] pulling out of the film three weeks before shooting was set to start.<ref name=Svetkey>{{cite news | author = Benjamin Svetkey | title = First Look: ''W.'', Oliver Stone's Bush Biopic |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = May 7, 2008 | url = https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20198476,00.html | accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref> As a result, [[United Artists]] shut the production down. Stone moved on to direct a film about the life of George W. Bush, shopping a script that had been written before the strike by Stanley Weiser, who had co-written ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' with Stone.

Though Stone has criticized Bush for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the director said that he was not looking to make an "anti-Bush [[polemic]]." Stone compared his goal of the film to that of ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'', wanting to trace "seminal events in Bush's life." According to the director, "It's a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', to give a sense of what it's like to be in his skin. But if ''Nixon'' was a [[symphony]], this is more like a [[chamber music|chamber piece]], and not as dark in tone."<ref name=votes/> He described the structure of ''W.'' as a three-act film starting with Bush as a young man "with a missed life", followed by his transformation and "an assertion of will which was amazingly powerful" as he came out from his father's shadow, and finally his invasion of Iraq.<ref name=Goodridge>{{cite news | author = Mike Goodridge | title = Interview: Oliver Stone | work = Screen Daily | date = May 30, 2008 | url = http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39249&Category= | accessdate=June 2, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080628025118/http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39249&Category= <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 28, 2008}}</ref>

=== Critical response ===

<!-- Please note that when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores, the accessdate in each citation should also be updated to the date on which you are making the change -->
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 222 reviews, with an average rating of 6.01/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of the 43rd American president, ''W.'' is fascinating in spots, but merely rudimentary as a whole."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/w_2008/ | title=W. (2008) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher= [[Fandango Media]] | accessdate=November 9, 2020}}</ref>  At [[Metacritic]], the film has an average weighted score of 56 out of 100, based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/w | title=W. Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=July 15, 2019}}</ref>

In his review, [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that it was "fascinating" and praised all the actors, noting that Richard Dreyfuss was "not so much a double as an embodiment" of Dick Cheney.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081015/REVIEWS/810150285|title=W.|author=Roger Ebert|date=October 15, 2008|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref> In contrast, Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film "a rushed, wildly uneven, tonally jumbled caricature."<ref name=not>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/10/16/ST2008101601746.html?sid=ST2008101601746 | title='W': Mission Not Accomplished | author=Ann Hornaday |work=Washington Post | date=October 17, 2008 | accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref>
Film critic [[James Berardinelli]] negatively compared the film with ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' skits, saying of the actors that "None of them are as dead-on as [[Tina Fey]] as [[Sarah Palin]]."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/w | title=W | author=James Berardinelli |work=ReelViews | accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>

The Bush administration never officially commented on the film. Former [[List of Governors of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]], who is portrayed in the film, called the [[sibling rivalry]] portrayed in the film "high-grade, unadulterated hooey" and said that Stone's exploration of the family dynamic could have benefited from actual conversations with the [[Bush family]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Jeb Bush calls 'W' movie 'Hooey' |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/17/jeb-bush-on-w-movie-high-grade-hooey/ |work= Washington Times |date= October 17, 2008 |accessdate= October 20, 2008 }}</ref> ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine's [[Timothy Noah]], however, noted that "most [of] the film's more ludicrous details" are actually directly taken from non-fiction sources, and argued that the film was too kind to Bush in omitting certain historically recorded dramatic events, most notably Bush's alleged mocking of murderer [[Karla Faye Tucker]], a woman put to death during his tenure of the Texan governorship.<ref>{{cite news|first= Timothy |last= Noah |title= Dubya, Stoned. |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2202341/ |work= [[Slate Magazine]] |date= October 17, 2008 |accessdate= October 20, 2008 }}</ref> However, the incident is disputed by Bush himself, and as such is also unconfirmed. In a March 2010 "Screen Test" interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} Lynne Hirschberg, Josh Brolin claims Bush did in fact watch the film.  Brolin said Oliver Stone met with [[Bill Clinton]] in China and Clinton told Stone he'd lent his copy of ''W.'' to Bush.  Reportedly, Bush himself "liked it very much" and "thought there were sad moments."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://video.nytimes.com/video/2010/03/10/t-magazine/1247467309813/screen-test-josh-brolin.html |work= The New York Times |title= Screen Test - Josh Brolin |accessdate= October 16, 2013 }}</ref>

The film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Joe Neumaier of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' named it the eighth best film of 2008,<ref name=mctop08/> and Roger Ebert of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' named it on his top 20 list (he did not assign rankings).<ref name=mctop08>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2008/toptens.shtml |title=Metacritic: 2008 Film Critic Top Ten Lists |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=January 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224083805/http://www.metacritic.com/film/awards/2008/toptens.shtml |archive-date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref>

=== Box office ===

The film opened No. 4 behind ''[[The Secret Life of Bees (film)|The Secret Life of Bees]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', and ''[[Max Payne (film)|Max Payne]]'', respectively with $10,505,668 from 2,030 theaters with a $5,175 average.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2008&wknd=42&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results from 10/17 to 10/19 | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref> The film had a budget of $25.1 million and grossed $25.5 million in North America, and $3.4 million internationally.<ref name=BOM/>
