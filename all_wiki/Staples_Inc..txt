'''Staples Inc.''' is an American office retail company. It is primarily involved in the sale of office supplies and related products, via retail channels and [[business-to-business]] (B2B)-oriented delivery operations.

The company opened its first store in [[Brighton, Massachusetts]] on May 1, 1986.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/staples-sold-for-69b-in-bid-for-turnaround/ |title=Staples sold for $6.9B in bid for turnaround|author=Matt Townsend|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=June 28, 2017}}</ref> By 1996, it had reached the [[Fortune 500]], and it later acquired the office supplies company [[Quill Corporation]].  In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire [[Office Depot]] and [[OfficeMax]]. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.

After the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its [[brick-and-mortar]] outlets, and place more prominence on its B2B supply business. In 2017, after its sale to [[Sycamore Partners]], the company was effectively split into three "independently managed and capitalized" entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. retail operations, and [[Staples Canada|Canadian]] retail operations, from the B2B business.

==History==
Staples was founded by [[Leo Kahn (entrepreneur)|Leo Kahn]] and [[Thomas G.

The idea for Staples originated in 1985, while Stemberg was working on a proposal for a different business. He needed a ribbon for his printer, but was unable to obtain one because his local dealer was closed for the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] holiday. A frustration with the reliance on small stores for critical supplies combined with Stemberg's background in the grocery business led to a vision for an office supply [[superstore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.hbs.edu/bulletin/1996/december/entre.html#stemberg|title=Supplies and Demand|date=December 1, 1996|work=Bulletin Online|publisher=Harvard Business School|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991010024412/http://www.alumni.hbs.edu/bulletin/1996/december/entre.html|archive-date=10 October 1999|access-date=January 10, 2007}}</ref>

The first store was opened in the Brighton neighborhood of [[Boston]] in 1986. Staples started with backing from private equity firms including [[Bain Capital]]; Bain co-founder [[Mitt Romney]] served on the company's board of directors for the next 15 years, helping shape their business model.<ref name="herald2012">{{cite web| url= http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20220830stemberg_preps_for_stem-winder_praising_romney/| archive-url= https://archive.today/20130118102527/http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20220830stemberg_preps_for_stem-winder_praising_romney/| url-status=dead| archive-date= January 18, 2013|title= Thomas Stemberg preps for Stem-winder praising Mitt Romney | date= August 30, 2012 | first= Donna |last=Goodison |work=[[Boston Herald]]| access-date=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Vancouver Motors 2011.jpg|thumb|right|A Staples Business Depot located in a [[List of heritage buildings in Vancouver#Mercantile|heritage building in Vancouver, British Columbia]], in September 2011]]
In 1991, Staples founded its Canadian subsidiary, [[Staples (Canada)|The Business Depot]], and began opening stores under that name,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Staples, Inc. – Company History |url=http://www.company-histories.com/Staples-Inc-Company-History.html |website=company-histories.com |access-date=February 5, 2016 }}</ref> though over a decade later, all stores were renamed as "Staples". The first store opened in [[Vaughan]], [[Ontario]], north of Toronto. The following year, Staples began expanding into Europe, and opened its first British store in [[Swansea]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

During its tenth anniversary in 1996, Staples became a member of the [[Fortune 500]] companies as sales surpassed $3&nbsp;billion.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} On September 4, 1996, Staples and [[Office Depot]] announced plans to merge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6131|title=Antitrust and the Staples-Office Depot Merger|publisher=Legal Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419120811/http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6131|archive-date=19 April 2006|access-date=November 29, 2009}}</ref> The [[Federal Trade Commission]] decided that the merged company would unfairly increase office supply prices despite competition from [[OfficeMax]], because OfficeMax did not have stores in many of the local markets that the merger would affect.<ref>{{cite web |title=FTC Will Seek to Block Staples/Office Depot Merger |publisher=Federal Trade Commission |date=March 10, 1997 |url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/03/staples.htm |access-date=January 10, 2007 }}</ref> Staples argued that chains such as [[Walmart]] and [[Circuit City]] represented significant competition, but this argument did little to sway the FTC.

Staples acquired the naming rights for the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles shortly before construction began in 1998.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/10/magazine/tm-20653|title=Hard Hat Area: How It Came Together|date=1999-10-10|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Staples also acquired [[Quill Corporation]], an online and catalog retailer of office supplies, for about $685 million in cash and stock.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-apr-08-fi-37095-story.html|title=Staples to Buy Quill in $685-Million Stock Deal|date=1998-04-08|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-05-29|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Between 1999 and 2001, unsuccessful attempts to enter the telecommunications business were made as Staples created Staples Communications after the purchase of Canada-based company, Claricom, from an investment group.

In 2002, Staples acquired Medical Arts Press, which became a subsidiary of Quill.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/stories/2008/03/10/daily6.html |title=Nashville charity gets $14K from Staples|publisher=[[Nashville Business Journal]]|date=March 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150302006191/en/Medical-Arts-Press-Part-Quill-Healthcare |title=Medical Arts Press Now Part of Quill Healthcare|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref> By 2004, Staples expanded to Austria and Denmark and in 2007, Staples opened its first store in India.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Attempted merger with Office Depot, sale of UK division ===
On March 6, 2014, Staples announced it would close up to 225 stores in North America by the end of 2015, in order to cut $500 million in costs annually, and focus more on e-commerce.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/03/06/staples-shutter-stores-sales-move-online/JCTB1l9HC6jieoumLcm9dM/story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306211145/http://boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2014/03/06/staples-shutter-stores-sales-move-online/JCTB1l9HC6jieoumLcm9dM/story.html|archive-date=March 6, 2014|title=Staples to shutter 225 stores as sales move online|date=March 6, 2014|url-status=live|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

On February 4, 2015, Staples announced a plan to once again acquire [[Office Depot]], which itself had recently acquired [[OfficeMax]] in a bid to compete against Staples. CEO Ron Sargent stated that this purchase would "[enable] Staples to provide more value to customers, and more effectively compete in a rapidly evolving competitive environment", and would result in at least $1 billion in "cost synergies" within three years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7976231/staples-is-buying-office-depot|title=Staples is buying Office Depot in a $6.3 billion deal|last=Vincent|first=James|date=2015-02-04|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>

It was reported that the deal could face [[antitrust]] scrutiny for its monopolization of the office supply market, unless growing competition against online retailers is considered a factor as well.<ref name=bloomberg-staplesofficedepot>{{cite web|title=Staples Agrees to Buy Office Depot for About $6.3 Billion|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-04/staples-to-buy-office-depot-in-deal-valued-at-6-3-billion|website=Bloomberg|access-date=February 4, 2015}}</ref> In December, the FTC filed a lawsuit to halt the merger, arguing that it would harm competition in the commercial office supply market.<ref name=bloombergnews-odftclawsuit>{{cite news|title=Staples Drops After U.S. Moves to Challenge Office Depot Deal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-07/staples-sued-by-u-s-in-bid-to-block-office-depot-takeover|access-date=December 7, 2015|work=Bloomberg}}</ref> and as of January 2016, the FTC has not changed its stance.<ref name=NYPost>{{cite web|last1=Kosman|first1=Josh|title=FTC has no interest in allowing Staples acquisition of Office Depot|url=https://nypost.com/2016/01/11/ftc-has-no-interest-in-allowing-staples-acquisition-of-office-depot/|website=New York Post|publisher=New York Post|access-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref>

At the end of January 2016, it was announced to employees that Staples would be [[Layoff|laying off]] hundreds of workers at their headquarters location. The layoffs were seen by some analysts as a preemptive tactic in case the merger did not receive regulatory approval from the Federal Trade Commission.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woolhouse |first=Megan |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/26/staples-lays-off-hundreds-reports/W5vIIa2Urw9NyDSpiUxFhO/story.html |title=Staples reportedly laying off hundreds, but stays mum |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=January 28, 2016 |access-date=January 28, 2016 }}</ref> On May 10, 2016, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]] granted the FTC a preliminary injunction against the merger.

In November 2016, it was announced that Staples had sold its 106 British stores to [[Hilco Capital]] for a "nominal" amount, as part of an effort to streamline its international operations following the failed merger. Hilco stated that it would discontinue the Staples brand in the region; the stores were rebranded as "Office Outlet", a new brand retaining the Staples chain's red and white color scheme. In August 2018, the chain closed some of its stores under a [[company voluntary arrangement]], and underwent a [[management buyout]] the following month. In March 2019, Office Outlet went into [[Administration (law)|administration]], citing that it had "recently experienced a reduction in credit from key suppliers, given the economic outlook which has severely impacted the financial position of the company."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retail-week.com/staples-rebranded-office-outlet-by-hmv-owner-hilco/7018907.article|title=Staples rebranded Office Outlet by HMV-owner Hilco|last=Hardy|first=Emily|last2=Tugby|first2=Luke|website=Retail Week|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38013806|title=Staples brand to disappear from UK High Streets|website=BBC News|date=November 17, 2016|access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47626280 |title=Former Staples chain Office Outlet in administration |date=March 19, 2019 |website=BBC News |access-date=March 19, 2019 }}</ref>

=== Pivot to B2B, sale to Sycamore Partners ===
Following the aborted acquisition, Staples began to reposition its operations by promoting itself as a "solutions partner" for the business market, and placing a stronger focus on its B2B-oriented delivery and e-commerce businesses. In May 2017, the chain began a new advertising campaign with the slogan "It's Pro Time", which largely downplayed its retail operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/staples-revamps-marketing-bid-shed-retail-industry-baggage/308902|title=Staples Revamps Marketing to Shed Retail Baggage, Makes Ads With No Stores to Be Seen|date=2017-05-03|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Sycamore Partners]] acquired Staples for $6.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion was funded as equity, with the remaining deal value raised as debt.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-11/sycamore-pockets-1-billion-from-deal-that-amazed-wall-street|title=Sycamore Pockets $1 Billion From Deal That Amazed Wall Street|last=Eliza Ronalds-Hannon|first=Davide Scigliuzzo|date=2019-04-11|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> As part of the purchase, Sycamore implemented a major restructuring of the company, under which the chain's B2B business (Staples North American Delivery, also known as simply "Staples"), retail locations (Staples U.S. Retail), and Staples Canada would be split into three "independently managed and capitalized" entities under Sycamore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2017/08/14/break-plan-staples-b2b-unit-stands/|title=Break-up plan for Staples: B2B unit stands out|first=Paul|last=Demery|date=2017-08-14|website=Digital Commerce 360|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retaildive.com/news/staples-spinning-off-retail-business/449556/|title=Staples spinning off retail business|website=Retail Dive|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/business/dealbook/staples-buyout.html|title=Staples to Sell for $6.9 Billion, and Its New Owner Has an Uphill Battle|last=Gelles|first=David|date=2017-06-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-29|last2=Merced|first2=Michael J. de la|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On April 9, 2019, Sycamore Partners refinanced $5.4 billion in debt against its ownership of Staples, producing a one-time $1 billion dividend for the private equity firm. A Bloomberg report on this refinancing noted that the deal allowed Sycamore to recover roughly 80% of its equity investment in Staples in less than two years, compared to the typical profit-taking exit timeframe of five to eight years for most private equity buyouts.<ref name=":0" /> That month, Staples also unveiled a new logo, which features an icon representing both an unused staple and an office desk. The company also announced that it would introduce a new line of [[store brand]]s, including Tru Red, Coastwide Professional (facility supplies),  NXT Technologies (technology accessories), Perk (office break room supplies), and Union & Scale (furniture), as well as a new catalog known as ''The Loop''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/staples-pins-a-logo/317224|title=Staples' new logo cuts right to the chase|date=2019-04-03|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> With the rebranding, CEO Sandy Douglas (who joined the company in 2018) stated that Staples was now being marketed as a "worklife fulfillment" company, which he explained was "about helping businesses of all sizes as they create the most dynamic and productive work environments for their teams."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retailwire.com/discussion/will-rebranding-deliver-the-results-that-staples-needs/|title=Will rebranding deliver the results that Staples needs?|website=RetailWire|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

The following month, CEO Mike Motz (who joined the company in 2019 to head Staples U.S. Retail) unveiled a new store concept known as "Staples Connect": it is aligned with a similar store concept being trialed by Staples Canada, featuring "Staples Studio" [[Coworking|co-working]] areas and an auditorium-style "Spotlight" theater (which can be rented for sessions and events). The new concept will be trialed in the Boston area, while elements of the concept will be implemented chain-wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opi.net/uncategorized/staples-unveils-new-store-concept-confirms-us-retail-ceo/|title=Staples unveils new store concept, confirms US Retail CEO|first=Andy |last=Braithwaite|date=2019-05-16|website=OPI|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-29}}{{subscription required}}</ref> As part of a partnership with radio broadcaster [[iHeartMedia]], Staples also added recording studios intended for [[podcasting]] to six of these stores, with access to recording engineers and a partnership with Spreaker to offer discounted hosting and distribution services to its customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143803/staples-connect-spreaker-podcast-studio-rental-boston|title=Some Staples stores in Boston are getting podcast studios|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=2020-02-19|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>

|title=Staples - "That was easy"
|description=2 seconds}}

Throughout most of the company's history, Staples employed, in its American commercials and advertising promotions, the slogan "Yeah, we've got that.", signifying their wide selection of products. This slogan was retired in 2003, to be replaced with "That was easy". Expanding on that theme, 2005 adverts featured a large red [[push-button]] marked "easy". In the United Kingdom, Staples had used the slogan "You want it. We've got it"; this changed to "That was Easy".

Originally, the "Easy Button" was only intended to be a fictitious button with 'magical' properties, featured in their television advertisement campaign. However, when the adverts appeared, customers began contacting the company to inquire how they could buy one.<ref>{{cite news|last=Myser|first=Michael|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/06/01/8378513/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060612000237/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/06/01/8378513/index.htm|archive-date=June 12, 2006|title=Marketing Made Easy|date=May 18, 2006|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=July 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The company responded by making the "Easy Button" a real product (available in English "easy", French "simple", Spanish "fácil" and German "einfach easy").

These buttons were shipped to stores in the United States, Canada and Germany starting in the fall of 2005. Sales of the buttons reached 1.5 million by the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ad Play |first=Rob |last=Walker |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 2006 |access-date=July 25, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/magazine/17wwln_consumed.t.html?_r=0}}</ref> The button has been referred to as a "Marketer's Dream", effectively turning millions of Staples customers into advertisers, resulting in greatly increased brand recognition.

The Staples Sno-Bot was an advertising character that appeared in the United States, in [[television]] and print advertising during the [[Christmas]] seasons from 1995 until 2001.

The Sno-Bot was a [[robot]] shaped like a [[snowman]] who refuses to let go of the [[inkjet printer]] he has fallen in love with. After the printer is wrestled from his grasp, the robot utters a monotone "Weeping. Weeping." He is consoled by a Staples employee who offers him a [[surge protector]] or a [[computer mouse]] (depending on the ad) instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOO9tAsHcT4|title=Tom Shillue and AD Miles in Staples "SnoBot "|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The robot's "Weeping. Weeping." [[catchphrase]] briefly became a popular [[meme]] on the [[Internet]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, and the ad itself was [[parody|parodied]] in a 2002 Christmas advertisement for [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]] Computers, in which a robot hassles a shopper (including striking him with a [[candy cane]]) when he attempts to purchase a [[personal computer|PC]] at an unnamed office supplies retailer.

Another advertisement style is used during its annual [[Back to school (marketing)|back-to-school]] campaign, in which the [[Christmas song]] "[[It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year]]" is played while parents joyously shop for school supplies for their children, used for several years from 1995 until 2005.<ref name="NYT Ramirez">{{cite news |title=A wacky campaign pushes the envelope for abrasive humor |first=Anthony |last=Ramirez |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 26, 1995 |access-date=January 18, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/26/business/media-business-advertising-wacky-campaign-pushes-envelope-for-abrasive-humor.html |quote=Perhaps the most daring Staples spot was the back-to-school commercial broadcast in August.

Later, [[Alice Cooper]] appeared in a back-to-school campaign from August 2004. Within the ad, a hand is seen selecting various supplies while a girl looks on unhappily. She finally says, "I thought you said, 'School's out forever.'" Alice is shown behind the cart, saying, "The song goes 'School's out for summer'. Nice try, though." The hit song then plays as supplies are shown. The tagline, "That was easy", is heard playing over the company logo, formed to resemble a [[stapler]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&p=irol-newsArticle_print&ID=588721 |access-date=December 3, 2015 |title=Staples Unveils Back-to-School Commercial Starring Alice Cooper |publisher=Staples |date=July 8, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003134413/http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&p=irol-newsArticle_print&ID=588721 |archive-date=2016-10-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyfqvrx9Jx0|title=Alice Cooper Staples commercial|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

During the 2008 holiday season, Staples advertising for the first time engaged [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], and other social media platforms. The company created a character named "Coach Tom" to promote its "Gift it for Free" sweepstakes, in which 10,000 Staples customers won up to $5,000 in merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/nov/23/fyi-nov-24-2008/?partner=RSS|title=Naples Daily News|website=Naples Daily News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701000215/http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/nov/23/fyi-nov-24-2008/?partner=RSS|archive-date=1 July 2009|access-date=7 June 2018}}</ref>

==Community relations==
In August 2002, the company started the Staples Foundation for Learning, which supports youth groups and [[education]]. It also is a partner of [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America]], Ashoka, Earth Force, Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, [[Hispanic Heritage Foundation]] and through Staples, ReadBoston.

In August 2005, Staples introduced the "Easy Button", a novelty item for offices which is advertised as a fun way of relieving stress. The button does nothing other than say "That was easy" when pressed. The first US$1&nbsp;million of profits each year from the Easy Button are donated to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. As of December 2006, it was sold for US$4.99 to $6.99 in all US and Canadian stores (where profits go to [[Special Olympics]] in Canada) and on the company's website. Donations also went to the Children's Fund. Staples has reportedly sold more than $7.5&nbsp;million worth of Easy Buttons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2006/db20061207_030398_page_2.htm|title=Staples Makes Selling Look Easy|last=Gogoi|first=Pallavi|date=December 7, 2006|publisher=Business Week|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031034918/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/dec2006/db20061207_030398_page_2.htm|archive-date=31 October 2007|access-date=January 10, 2007}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
Staples is ranked in the top 25 of EPA's Green Power Partner list.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a883dc3da7094f97852572a00065d7d8/4199018af7e69d61852572cd004fc7b1!OpenDocument |url-status=dead |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |date=30 April 2007 |title=EPA Recognizes Largest-Ever Corporate Green Power Purchase |archive-date=3 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503035447/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a883dc3da7094f97852572a00065d7d8/4199018af7e69d61852572cd004fc7b1!OpenDocument }}</ref> In 2006, Staples offered more than 2,900 different office products incorporating recycled content.

Staples is currently trying to pursue developing Staples brand products with green raw materials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staples.com/sbd/content/about/soul/environment.html |title=Environment |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504062709/http://staplesadvantage.com/about-us/staples-soul/environment.html |website=Staples |date=5 May 2006 |access-date=7 June 2018 |archive-date=4 May 2012 }}</ref> In response to a two-year campaign targeting the company, Staples adopted an environmentally friendly paper policy, in hopes of increasing the amount of post-consumer recycled paper made available for sale, phasing out products originating from endangered forests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestethics.org/article.php?id=800|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929013412/http://www.forestethics.org/article.php?id=800|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2006|title=Forest Ethics : Staples' Environmental Progress Report Fuels Further Criticism of Office Depot|date=29 September 2006|access-date=7 June 2018}}</ref>

The Hanover, Maryland fulfillment center is powered by a 1.01 megawatt solar installation covering nearly {{convert|175000|sqft|m2}} of roof space.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/01/07/staples_facility_unveils_solar_rooftop/|title=Staples facility unveils solar rooftop|date=7 January 2010|access-date=7 June 2018|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> Its Savi Ranch store in Yorba Linda, California also has a sizeable rooftop solar installation. Staples has also recently implemented power reduction strategies in all of their Copy & Print Centers, where the copiers enter sleep mode in as little as 15 minutes after use.

This technique will save Staples nearly $1 million a year in reduced energy costs and prevent over 11 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. In November 2014, Staples partnered with EnergySage to give Staples giftcards to homeowners and businesses that installed solar panels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/11/13/install-solar-get-staples-gift-card/i5OUu9sC3DIaj54WES5EEI/story.html|title=Install solar, get a Staples gift card|date=November 13, 2014|publisher=Boston Globe|access-date=August 21, 2015}}</ref>

===Recycling===
Staples accepts all used ink and toner cartridges for recycling. Prior to 2008, the only cartridge brands that could be recycled were HP, Kodak, and Dell, and customers were given a $3 coupon for the store, with the maximum number of coupons to be given, or redeemed, at any one time being 25. Since 2009, ink recycling has been a part of the Staples Rewards program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/01/25/staples-reward-customers-recycling-ink-and-toner-cartridges|title=Staples to Reward Customers for Recycling Ink and Toner Cartridges|last=Schwartz|first=Ariel|date=January 25, 2009|website=GreenBiz|language=en|access-date=March 29, 2019}}</ref>

Staples now gives back two dollars (Staples.com) on all ink cartridges and toners as of July 2010. Ink recycling credit comes to Rewards members as a separate coupon, monthly, instead of the normal quarterly rewards check. Most customers are able to trade in ten per month for credit, whilst Staples Plus and Premier Rewards members are able to trade in twenty per month.

As of February 28, 2013, Staples announced that in order to receive $2 per ink cartridge recycled, customers would be required to spend at least $30 at Staples in ink purchases within 180 days of recycling.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090805104545/http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/products/perm/merch024658_gold_welcome/index.html] </ref>

==Price discrimination==
A 2012 study by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' found that Staples displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices), based on proximity to competitors like [[OfficeMax]] and [[Office Depot]]. This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534 |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |first1=Jennifer |last1=Valentino-DeVries |first2=Jeremy |last2=Singer-Vine |first3=Ashkan |last3=Soltani |date=December 24, 2012 |title=Websites Vary Prices, Deals Based on Users' Information |access-date=May 26, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/12/24/staples-online-stores-price-changes/ |title=Staples, Home Depot, and other online stores change prices based on your location |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=December 24, 2012 |access-date=May 26, 2017 |first=Devindra |last=Hardawar }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://econsultancy.com/blog/62699-online-price-discrimination-a-surprising-reality-in-ecommerce |title=Online price discrimination: a surprising reality in ecommerce |website=econsultancy.com |date=May 13, 2014 |first=Ari |last=Shpanya |access-date=May 26, 2017 }}</ref>

==Store layout==
===Print and marketing services===
[[File:StaplesPrintMarketingServicesNorthAmerica.jpg|thumb|Staples copy and print center]]
In addition to selling office supplies, business machines, and tech services, Staples also offers a copy and print center for [[photocopying|photocopies]], [[digital printing]], [[fax]]ing, [[Business card|custom business cards]], [[rubber stamp|custom rubber stamps]], [[promotional products]], binding, [[Heated roll laminators|lamination]], folding, cutting and engraved products. While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.

Most locations have a limited service [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] shipping center offering air and ground services, [[DHL Express|DHL]] in the United Kingdom stores, and three providers ([[Canada Post]], [[FedEx]], and [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]]) in Canadian stores, which is open during store hours. Canada and the UK offer international shipping, whereas in US stores, this service is limited to Canada and Mexico. UPS services in US-based stores are not capable of handling AT&T or Dish Network returns with a label, or QR codes from Amazon returns.

In Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy & Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print & Marketing Stores (currently there are four [[New York City]] locations, and one in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]) where Print & Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.

===Tech services===
Some stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for [[Computer repair technician|PC repair]], PC upgrades, home and office [[computer network|networking]] setup, and PC tutorials.

Starting in November 2005, Staples began a test called "Heavy Up" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as "Double Up" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with [[Best Buy]]'s [[Geek Squad]] and [[Circuit City]]'s Fire dog.

Beginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the "Easy Resident Tech" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.

On January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the "Easy Mobile Tech" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray "Easy Tech" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.

Beginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as "EasyTechs". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green "EasyTech" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main "EasyTech" who performs most of the more complex tasks.

Beginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as "Tech Advisors" and "Solutions Advisors". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.

These concept stores are mainly based in [[New Hampshire]], with stores in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]], [[West Lebanon, New Hampshire|West Lebanon]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Some stores with this new concept also opened in [[Massachusetts]], including the [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]] store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the [[Newington, Connecticut]], and [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] store.
