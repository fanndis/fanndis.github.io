O'Malley was elected mayor of Baltimore [[1999 Baltimore mayoral election|in 1999]] after a surprise win in the Democratic primary. As mayor, O'Malley prioritized reducing crime within the city. He was [[2003-04 Baltimore mayoral election|reelected in 2004]]. O'Malley won the [[2006 Maryland gubernatorial election|2006 gubernatorial election]], defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governor [[Bob Ehrlich]].

O'Malley won [[2010 Maryland gubernatorial election|reelection in 2010]]. In 2011, he signed a law that would make [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] brought to the United States as children eligible for in-state [[college tuition]]. In 2012, he signed a law to legalize [[same-sex marriage in Maryland]]. Both laws were approved in referenda in the [[2012 United States elections#State and territory initiatives and referenda|2012 general election]]. O'Malley served as the chair of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] from 2011 to 2013. After leaving office in 2015, O'Malley was appointed to [[Johns Hopkins University|The Johns Hopkins University]]'s [[Carey Business School]] as a visiting professor focusing on government, business and urban issues.

One of six major candidates, O'Malley struggled to gain support, and he suspended his campaign on February 1, 2016, after finishing third in the [[2016 Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses|Iowa caucuses]]. He endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] four months later.

In 2019, O'Malley's first book ''Smarter Government: How to Govern for Results in the Information Age'' was published. The companion ''Smarter Government Workbook: A 14-Week Implementation Guide to Governing for Results'' was published in 2020.

==Early political career==
In December 1982, while still in college, O'Malley joined the [[Gary Hart]] presidential campaign for the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]]. In late 1983, he volunteered to go to [[Iowa]] where he phone-banked, organized volunteers, played [[guitar]] and sang at small [[fundraiser]]s and other events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omalleysmarch.com/anfyguest/shannonTide.htm|title=The Original Shannon Tide|accessdate=August 29, 2007|publisher=O'Malley's March}}</ref> In 1986, while in law school, O'Malley was named by [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] (Congresswoman) in the Third Congressional District, [[Barbara Mikulski]] as state field director for her successful primary and general election campaigns for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

Later that year, he was hired as an assistant [[State's Attorney]] for the [[Baltimore|City of Baltimore]], holding that position until 1990.<ref name="msa"/>

In 1990, O'Malley ran for the [[Maryland State Senate]] in the 43rd State Senate District in northeast Baltimore. He challenged one-term incumbent John A.

===Tenure===
During his first mayoral campaign, O'Malley focused on a message of reducing crime. In his first year in office, he adopted a statistics-based tracking system called "CitiStat", modeled after [[Compstat]], a crime-management program first employed in the mid-1990s in [[New York City]]. The system logged every call for service into a database for analysis. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote in 2006 that Baltimore's "homicide rate remains stubbornly high and its public school test scores disappointingly low. But CitiStat has saved an estimated $350 million and helped generate the city's first budget surplus in years."<ref name="washingtonpost2006">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/02/AR2006080201818.html |title=For Guidance, Fenty Turns to a Neighbor |work=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2015-04-16 |first=Lori |last=Montgomery}}</ref> In 2004, the CitiStat accountability tool won Harvard University's "Innovations in American Government" award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/awards.html?id=3638|title=Government Innovators Network: CitiStat|accessdate=August 29, 2007|year=2004|publisher=[[John F.

His record as mayor of Baltimore has drawn criticism. O'Malley has been accused by many of establishing a zero-tolerance policing strategy, aimed at reducing the city's high murder rate but that instead led to the targeting and abuse of black communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/as-mayor-of-baltimore-omalleys-policing-strategy-sowed-mistrust/2015/04/25/af81178a-ea9d-11e4-9767-6276fc9b0ada_story.html|title=As Baltimore mayor, critics say, O'Malley's police tactics sowed distrust|last1=Schwartzman|first1=Paul|date=2015-04-25|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-06|last2=Wagner|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/01/15/where-the-democratic-presidential-candidates-stand-on-criminal-justice|title=Where the Democratic Presidential Candidates Stand on Criminal Justice|work=The Marshall Project|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>

O'Malley spoke at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]], arguing that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry]] was a better choice for homeland security than President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21843-2004Jul28.html |title=Text of Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley's Address to the Democratic National Convention |work=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-07-28 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

While running for governor in 2006, O'Malley said violent crime in Baltimore declined 37% while he was mayor. That statistic came from an audit of crime that used questionable methodology and became the subject of controversy; he was accused by both his Democratic primary opponent [[Doug Duncan]] and his Republican opponent, incumbent Governor [[Bob Ehrlich]], of manipulating statistics to make false claims. The ''Washington Post'' wrote at the time that "no evidence has surfaced of a systemic manipulation of crime statistics," but that "there is no quick or definitive way for O'Malley to prove his numbers are right."<ref>Wagner, John. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/02/AR2006030201812.html O'Malley Finds Issue Can Cut Both Ways]". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. March 3, 2006. Page B05. '' Retrieved March 23, 2007''.</ref>

In early 2005, Governor [[Robert Ehrlich]] fired aide Joseph Steffen for spreading rumors of marital infidelity about O'Malley on the Internet. O'Malley and his wife had previously held a highly publicized press conference to deny the rumors and accuse Republicans of partisan politics, although discussions in which Steffen posted the rumors were initiated by an anonymous user under the pseudonym "MD4Bush" who was later found to be [[Maryland Democratic Party]] official Ryan O'Doherty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/politics/bal-omalleyrumors,0,2224139.storygallery?coll=bal-mdpolitics-storyutil |title=O'Malley rumor controversy |publisher=baltimoresun.com |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

During a 2005 conference at the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]], where mayors from across the U.S.A. gathered to denounce President [[George W. Bush]]'s proposed budget, O'Malley compared the budget to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]], declaring, "Back on September 11, terrorists attacked our metropolitan cores, two of America's great cities. They did that because they knew that was where they could do the most damage and weaken us the most. Years later, we are given a budget proposal by our commander in chief. ... And with a budget ax, he is attacking America's cities. He is attacking our metropolitan core." For this he was criticized by not only Republicans but fellow Democrats, and in a subsequent interview said he "in no way intended to equate these budget cuts, however bad, to a terrorist attack."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9117-2005Feb8.html|title=O'Malley Likens Bush's Proposed Cuts to Sept. 11 Attacks|author=Lori Montgomery|work=The Washington Post|date=February 9, 2005|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Media attention===
In 2002, at the age of 39, O'Malley was named "The Best Young Mayor in the Country" by ''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]''; and in 2005, ''[[Time Magazine|TIME]]'' magazine named him one of America's "Top 5 Big City Mayors".<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Mark |url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1050272,00.html |title=Wonk 'n' Roller |publisher=TIME |date=April 18, 2005 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref> In August 2005, ''[[Business Week]]'' Magazine Online called him one of five "new stars" in the Democratic Party, along with [[United States Senator|Senator]] and future [[US President|President]] [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], future [[US Senator|Senator]] [[Mark Warner]] of [[Virginia]], future [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Interior Secretary]] [[Ken Salazar]] and future chief of staff for President Obama and [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Rahm Emanuel]].

Major land developer Edward St. John was fined $55,000 by the Maryland Office of the State Prosecutor for making illegal contributions to the 2006 O'Malley gubernatorial campaign. The ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times]]'' reported later that the Governor's administration had issued a press release touting a new $28-million highway interchange leading from [[Interstate 795 (Maryland)|Interstate 795]] to one of St. John's properties. Governor O'Malley's spokesman said there was no "[[quid pro quo]]," and a spokesman for the County Executive said the project had been a county transportation priority since before both O'Malley and the executive were elected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/19/omalley-donor-gains-highway-access/ |title=O'Malley donor gains highway access |newspaper=The Washington Times |date=June 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, O'Malley announced his intention to run for re-election while Ehrlich announced he would also run, setting up a rematch of 2006.  His future rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, [[Hillary Clinton]], said in a private email at the time that "he should be reelected by acclamation for steering the ship of state so well."<ref name=inside>{{cite news | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/09/01/inside-clinton-latest-mail-dump/ukf27yEIPUHqy3jZurpiHP/story.html | title = Inside Hillary Clinton's latest e-mail dump | first = Annie | last = Linskey | date = September 1, 2015 | accessdate = September 1, 2015 | publisher = The Boston Globe }}</ref>  Despite major losses for Democrats nationwide, O'Malley defeated Ehrlich 56%–42%, receiving just over a million votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2010/results/General/StateResults_office_003.html|title=2010 General Election Official Results|work=Maryland State Board of Elections|date=December 1, 2010| accessdate=September 24, 2012}}</ref> Due to [[term limits in the United States|term limits]], he was unable to run for a third term in 2014.

====Maryland StateStat====
One of O'Malley's first actions as governor was to implement the same CitiStat system he used to manage the city Baltimore as mayor on a statewide level.  [[Maryland StateStat]] was first tried in 2007 by a few public safety and human services agencies.  By 2014, over 20 agencies were engaged in the StateStat process through monthly individual agency meetings and quarterly cross-agency Stats including [[Maryland BayStat|BayStat]], StudentStat, VetStat and ReEntryStat.  (The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] would later base its ChesapeakeStat program on O'Malley's innovative BayStat program.)  In 2012, he launched Maryland's [[Open Data]] Portal- StateStat, which used the data in the Portal to track progress towards his 16 strategic goals. As one of the few states at the time linking progress directly to open data, Maryland led the nation in government transparency and accountability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/about.html |title=About Maryland's StateStat Program |publisher=Statestat.maryland.gov |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> O'Malley has said that President Obama has looked at StateStat as a potential model for tracking stimulus funding.<ref name="govtechvid">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/video/?fr_story=f53299fb8709627ee731cd94ae22168b7141955a&rf=bm|title=Citizen CEO: Gov.

O'Malley was elected as the vice chairman of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] for 2009–2010, and on December 1, 2010, he was elected chairman for 2010–2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=O'Malley to chair party's governors group|first=John|last=Wagner|page=B1|date=December 2, 2010}}</ref>

====Crime====
Soon after entering office, O'Malley closed the [[Maryland House of Correction]] in [[Jessup, Maryland|Jessup]], a notoriously violent [[prisons in the United States|maximum-security prison]].<ref>{{cite news |title=O'Malley relieved prison is closed |url=http://www.herald-mail.com/?module=displaystory&story_id=161292&format=html |publisher=[[Herald Mail|The Herald-Mail Company]] |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 }}</ref>

====National Popular Vote====
In April 2007, O'Malley became the first governor to sign legislation entering a state into the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/articles/wjz_20070410.php |title=Maryland Makes History With Electoral College Decision|accessdate=2015-07-27}}</ref> Designed to reform how states allocate their electoral votes, the National Popular Vote plan has since been enacted in nine additional states and the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalpopularvote.com  |title=Maryland Makes History With Electoral College Decision |accessdate=2015-07-24}}</ref>

In a debate during the 2010 campaign, O'Malley referred to undocumented immigrants as "new Americans" while endorsing stricter enforcement against undocumented immigration by the federal government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/annapolis/2010/10/ehrlich_turns_his_attention_to.html|title=Ehrlich turns his attention to illegal immigration|last=Vander Veen|first=Chad|date=October 26, 2010|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref> In May 2011, he signed a law making the children of undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition under certain conditions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/politics/gov-martin-omalley-signs-immigrant-tuition-bill-into-law-in-maryland/2011/05/10/AFNNz8jG_story.html|title=Gov.

During the 2014 crisis involving undocumented immigrant children from Central America crossing the border, O'Malley refused to open a facility in Westminster, Maryland, to house them. The White House criticized his decision as hypocritical given his prior comments that he thought deporting all these children was wrong, but he protested that his remarks had been mischaracterized.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Topaz|first1=Jonathan|title=Martin O'Malley slams White House 'spin'|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/martin-omalley-white-house-immigration-109757.html?hp=t3_3|publisher=Politico|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>

====Same-sex marriage====

O'Malley supported a bill considered by the General Assembly to legalize [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] in Maryland, even though [[Archbishop of Baltimore]] [[Edwin O'Brien]] had urged him as a Catholic not to support the bill in a private letter sent two days before O'Malley voiced his support.<ref name="O'Brien"/> "I am well aware that the recent events in New York have intensified pressure on you to lend your active support to legislation to redefine marriage," O'Brien wrote. "As advocates for the truths we are compelled to uphold, we speak with equal intensity and urgency in opposition to your promoting a goal that so deeply conflicts with your faith, not to mention the best interests of our society."<ref name="O'Brien"/> O'Malley responded, "I do not presume, nor would I ever presume as Governor, to question or infringe upon your freedom to define, to preach about, and to administer the sacraments of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. But on the public issue of granting equal civil marital rights to same-sex couples, you and I disagree."<ref name="O'Brien">{{cite news|last=Wagner |first=John |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/omalley-archbishop-at-odds-over-same-sex-marriage-letters-show/2011/08/08/gIQA4vR02I_story.html |title=O'Malley, archbishop at odds over same-sex marriage, letters show |publisher=The Washingtonpost.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref>

[[File:State of the State Address Maryland.jpg|thumb|O'Malley giving the State of the State Address in 2013.]]
In 2013, O'Malley signed a bill to ban the practice of [[shark finning]] in Maryland, making it the sixth U.S. state to enact this regulation. The signature of this bill made Maryland the first East Coast state to make it illegal to possess, sell, trade or distribute shark fins.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanderson|first1=Kaitlin|title=Maryland Becomes First State on East Coast to Ban Shark Fin Trade|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2013/05/maryland-bans-shark-fin-trade-050213.html?credit=web_id448985267?referrer=https://www.google.com/|publisher=The Humane Society of the United States}}</ref>

====Environment====

Also in 2014, O'Malley approved the practice of [[hydraulic fracturing]], or "fracking," in western Maryland but only on condition of tight regulations. He had previously blocked the technique from the region for three years, awaiting the report from the Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission on the risks and benefits of this controversial procedure.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheeler|first1=Timothy|title=O'Malley administration sets out path to fracking in Md.|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/green/blog/bs-md-fracking-regulation-20141125-story.html|publisher=The Baltimore Sun}}</ref>

====Abortion====
O'Malley is pro-choice and believes abortion should be legal without government interference until the time in pregnancy when the fetus might survive outside the womb. In Maryland fetus viability is defined as when, in a doctor's best medical judgment, there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus' sustained survival outside the womb, which on average is 22-24 weeks.<ref>https://www.ontheissues.org/2016/Martin_O%60Malley_Abortion.htm</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdIBAlDpWyg</ref><ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/readers-respond/bs-ed-rr-abortion-maryland-letter-20190528-story.html</ref><ref>https://statelaws.findlaw.com/maryland-law/maryland-abortion-laws.html</ref>

==Political ambitions==
After O'Malley stood in for 2008 Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] at a Democratic campaign event on June 2, 2007 in [[New Hampshire]], delegate [[Tony O'Donnell (politician)|Tony O'Donnell]] said in response, "It's the worst-kept secret in Maryland that the governor has national ambitions."<ref name="WP06022007"/> State Senate President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.|Thomas V.

Speculation about O'Malley's plans was further fueled by his high profile at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], where he was given a prime-time speaking slot on the second night and spoke to delegations from several states including [[Iowa Democratic Party|Iowa]], where the first presidential caucuses are held in election years, and [[Ohio Democratic Party|Ohio]], a key swing state in recent presidential elections.<ref name="Sun09042012">{{cite web|author=John Fritze |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-09-04/news/bs-md-dnc-omalley-20120904_1_martin-o-malley-mitt-romney-paul-ryan |title=O'Malley offers sharp criticism of Republicans at convention - tribunedigital-baltimoresun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> O'Malley's prominence at the convention generated both support for, and criticism of, his record.

After months of consideration, O'Malley indicated on [[Twitter]] that he would announce his candidacy on May 30, 2015, at Baltimore's historic [[Federal Hill Park]], overlooking the city's picturesque downtown skyline and the [[Inner Harbor]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/martin-omalley-2016-presidential-launch-details-118090.html | title=O'Malley announces 2016 launch details | work=[[Politico]] | date=May 19, 2015 | accessdate=May 30, 2015 | author=Topaz, Jonathan}}</ref>  On that date, he formally announced his candidacy for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 presidential nomination]].<ref name="jumps">{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/30/martin-omalley-president-announcement/27330857/| title=Martin O'Malley jumps into presidential race| newspaper=  [[USA Today]] | date=May 30, 2015 | accessdate=May 30, 2015|author1=Jackson, David |author2=Cooper, Allen }}</ref>

On February 1, 2016, after performing poorly in the [[Iowa caucuses]], however, he suspended his campaign, receiving only 0.6% of state delegate equivalents awarded in the Iowa caucuses while both former First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and formerly independent Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]] received over 49% each. After suspending his campaign, the former Maryland governor gave a speech, saying:

<blockquote>Tonight, I have to tell you that I am suspending this Presidential bid. But I am not ending this fight. Our country is worth saving, the American dream is worth saving, and this planet is worth saving. So as we march forward to the fall, let us all resolve together that the love, the generosity, the compassion and the commitment of this campaign will continue to point our country forward.</blockquote>

Four months later, on June 9, 2016, O'Malley officially endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Malley|first1=Martin|title=Martin O'Malley Endorses Hillary Clinton for President|url=https://martinomalley.com/martin-omalley-endorses-hillary-clinton/|website=martionomalley.com|accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
On May 5, 2016, O'Malley joined the MetroLab Network, a group focusing on city–university partnerships and based at [[Heinz College]] (the public policy school of [[Carnegie Mellon University]]) in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He was appointed chairman of the advisory committee and made a senior fellow.<ref name="GovTech">{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Ben|title=Martin O'Malley Joins MetroLab Network as National Advisor|url=http://www.govtech.com/Martin-OMalley-Joins-MetroLab-Network-as-National-Advisor.html|website=GovTech|accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref> O'Malley was subsequently made a fellow of the [[Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service|Institute of Politics and Public Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/gu-politics-announces-2016-fall-fellows/|title=GU Politics Announces 2016 Fall Fellows|last=Burgoa|first=Lisa|date=August 30, 2016|work=[[The Hoya]]|access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> After the Democratic primaries, O'Malley explored a potential run for chair of the Democratic National Committee. He later withdrew interest after Minnesota representative [[Keith Ellison]] received the endorsements of several major Democratic figures.

In June 2016, [[Boston College Law School]]'s Rappaport Center for Public Policy announced that O'Malley would be the inaugural Jerome Lyle Rappaport Visiting Professor and teach at the law school during the Spring 2017 semester.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawmagazine.bc.edu/2016/06/this-just-in/|title=This Just In - Boston College Law School Magazine|website=lawmagazine.bc.edu}}</ref>

==In other media==
According to [[David Simon]], the creator of the [[HBO]] drama ''[[The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', the show's fictional mayor of Baltimore [[Tommy Carcetti]] is "not O'Malley," but O'Malley was one of several inspirations.<ref name = "DS">{{cite web|year=2006|title=Five Minutes With: David Simon|publisher=campusprogress.org|accessdate=November 6, 2006|url=http://campusprogress.org/features/1273/five-minutes-with-david-simon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ben|title=Martin O'Malley, Tommy Carcetti and 2016|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/09/martin-o-malley-tommy-carcetti-and-2016.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}</ref>  Writing in ''[[Baltimore Magazine]]'' several years after the show had closed, Simon did disclose a private phone conversation with O'Malley as production of the show's second season was beginning, in which the mayor urged that the show's contents be changed to put Baltimore and his own administration in a better light, and threatened the show's continuation in Baltimore unless such changes were made.<ref name = "DS2">{{cite web|year=2008|title=Down To the Wire|publisher=davidsimon.com|accessdate=March 12, 2015|url=http://davidsimon.com/down-to-the-wire}}</ref>

O'Malley appeared in the film ''[[Ladder 49]]'' as himself.

O'Malley is a [[War of 1812]] buff. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s 2004 documentary ''[[First Invasion: The War of 1812]]'' featured him in a segment regarding the British attack on Baltimore in 1814. He also appeared in the 2014 [[Travel Channel]] documentary ''The War of 1812 Trail''.

In 2019, O'Malley appeared on Ireland's [[The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)|The Late Late Show]] to discuss his love of [[Shane MacGowan]]'s music.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-12|title=Shane MacGowan to perform 'Fairytale of New York' on this week's Late Late Show|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/shane-macgowan-fairytale-of-new-york-late-late-show|access-date=2020-11-09|website=IrishCentral.com|language=en}}</ref>
