'''Surveillance capitalism''' is an [[economic system]] centred around the [[commodification]] of [[personal data]] with the core purpose of [[Profit (economics)|profit-making]]. Since [[personal data]] can be commodified it has become one of the most valuable resources on earth.<ref name=":1" /> The concept of surveillance capitalism, as described by [[Shoshana Zuboff]], arose as advertising companies, led by Google's AdWords, saw the possibilities of using personal data to target consumers more precisely.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|s2cid=159380755|date=January 2019|title=Surveillance Capitalism and the Challenge of Collective Action|journal=New Labor Forum|volume=28|issue=1|pages=10–29|doi=10.1177/1095796018819461|issn=1095-7960}}</ref>

Increased data collection may have various advantages for individuals and society such as [[self-optimization]] ([[Quantified Self]]),<ref name="theconversation1" /> societal optimizations (such as by [[smart cities]]) and optimized services (including various [[web application]]s). However, collecting and processing data in the context of capitalism's core [[Profit motive|profit-making motive]] might present a danger to human liberty, [[autonomy]] and wellbeing. [[Capitalism]] has become focused on expanding the proportion of social life that is open to [[data collection]] and [[data processing]].<ref name="theconversation1" /> This may come with significant implications for vulnerability and control of society as well as for [[privacy]].

Economic pressures of capitalism are driving the intensification of connection and [[Surveillance|monitoring]] online with spaces of social life becoming open to saturation by corporate actors, directed at the making of profit and/or the regulation of action. Therefore, personal data points increased in value after the possibilities of [[targeted advertising]] were known.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|last=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|title=Data analytics and big data: chapter 5: Data analytics process:there's great work behind the scenes|date=1 June 2018|pages=77–99|doi=10.1002/9781119528043.ch5|isbn=978-1-119-52804-3}}</ref> Consequently, the increasing price of data has limited accessibility to the purchase of personal [[data points]] to the richest in society.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=The Great Hack|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/20/the-great-hack-cambridge-analytica-scandal-facebook-netflix|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=20 June 2019|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Background ==
Shoshana Zuboff writes that "analysing massive data sets began as a way to reduce uncertainty by discovering the probabilities of future patterns in the behavior of people and systems".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|last2=Möllers|first2=Norma|last3=Murakami Wood|first3=David|last4=Lyon|first4=David|date=2019-03-31|title=Surveillance Capitalism: An Interview with Shoshana Zuboff|journal=Surveillance & Society|volume=17|issue=1/2|pages=257–266|doi=10.24908/ss.v17i1/2.13238|issn=1477-7487|doi-access=free}}</ref> In 2014 Vincent Mosco referred to the marketing of information about customers and subscribers to advertisers as ''surveillance capitalism'' and makes note of the [[surveillance state]] alongside it.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mosco|first1=Vincent|title=To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317250388|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwbvCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|date=2015-11-17}}</ref> [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] found that the surveillance state fuses with surveillance capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fuchs|first1=Christian|title=Social Media: A Critical Introduction|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473987494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3oEDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA204|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|date=2017-02-20}}</ref> Similarly, Zuboff informs that the issue is further complicated by highly invisible collaborative arrangements with state security apparatuses. According to Trebor Scholz, companies recruit people as informants for this type of capitalism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scholz|first1=Trebor|title=Uberworked and Underpaid: How Workers Are Disrupting the Digital Economy|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781509508181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiDNDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT128|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|date=2016-12-27}}</ref> Zuboff contrasts [[mass production]] of [[industrial capitalism]] with surveillance capitalism with the former being interdependent with its populations who were its consumers and employees and the latter preying on dependent populations who are neither its consumers nor its employees and largely ignorant of its procedures.<ref name="faz1" /> Their research is demonstrating that the capitalist addition to analysing massive data sets has given its beginning purpose an unexpected turn.<ref name=":3"/> [[Surveillance]] has been changing power structures in the information economy, potentially shifting the balance of power further from nation-states and towards large corporations employing the surveillance capitalist logic<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Galič|first1=Maša|last2=Timan|first2=Tjerk|last3=Koops|first3=Bert-Jaap|date=13 May 2016|title=Bentham, Deleuze and Beyond: An Overview of Surveillance Theories from the Panopticon to Participation|journal=Philosophy & Technology|volume=30|pages=9–37|doi=10.1007/s13347-016-0219-1|accessdate=|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Zuboff notes that surveillance capitalism reaches beyond the conventional institutional terrain of the private firm and accumulates not only surveillance assets and capital, but also rights and operates without meaningful mechanisms of consent.<ref name="faz1" /> In other words, analysing massive data sets was at some point not only executed by the state apparatuses but also companies. In Zuboff's research she claims that the two companies; [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] invented and transferred surveillance capitalism into "a new logic of accumulation".<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|title=Shoshana Zuboff: A Digital Declaration|language=de|work=FAZ.NET|url=https://www.faz.net/1.3152525|access-date=2020-05-18|issn=0174-4909}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Shoshana Zuboff On surveillance capitalism|url=https://www.contagious.com/news-and-views/shoshana-zuboff-on-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism|website=Contagious|language=en|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref> This mutation entailed both companies gathering very large numbers of data points about their users, with the core purpose of making profit. By selling these data points to external users (particularly advertisers) it has become an economic mechanism. The combination of the analysis of massive data sets and using those data sets as a market mechanism, has shaped the concept of surveillance capitalism. Surveillance capitalism has been heralded the successor to [[neoliberalism]]. <ref>Zuboff, Shoshana (2019).

[[Oliver Stone]], creator of the film ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'', pointed to the [[location-based game]] ''[[Pokémon Go]]'' as the "latest sign of the emerging phenomenon and demonstration of surveillance capitalism". Stone criticised the game on the grounds that the location of its users was used not only for game purposes, but also to retrieve more information about its players. By tracking users' locations, the game collected far more information than just users' names and locations: "it can access the contents of your USB storage, your accounts, photographs, network connections, and phone activities, and can even activate your phone, when it is in standby mode". This data can then be analysed and commodified by companies such as Google (who significantly invested in the game's development) to improve the effectiveness of targeted advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comic-Con 2016: Marvel turns focus away from the Avengers, 'Game of Thrones' cosplay proposals, and more|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-hc-comic-con-updates-oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-1469130980-htmlstory.html|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone Calls Pokémon Go "Totalitarian"|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/23/oliver-stone-calls-pokemon-go-totalitarian/|publisher=Fortune|date=23 July 2016}}</ref>

Another aspect of surveillance capitalism relates to the influence it has had on [[political campaign]]ing. Personal data retrieved by [[Data mining|data miners]] can enable various companies (most notoriously, [[Cambridge Analytica]]) to improve the targeting of ''political'' advertising, a step beyond the commercial ends of previous Surveillance Capitalist operations. In this way, it is possible that political parties will be able to produce far more finely targeted political advertising, to maximise its impact on the electorate. However, Doctorow writes that misuse of these data sets "will lead us towards totalitarianism".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Unchecked Surveillance Technology Is Leading Us Towards Totalitarianism {{!}} Opinion|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/unchecked-surveillance-technology-leading-us-towards-totalitarianism-opinion-2535230|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|date=2017-05-05|website=International Business Times|access-date=2020-05-19}}</ref> This may resemble a [[corporatocracy]], and Turow writes that "centrality of [[corporate capitalism|corporate power]] is a direct reality at the very heart of the [[digital age]]".<ref name="theconversation1" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Turow|first1=Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9_DyhPGhEMC&pg=PA17|title=The Daily You: How the New Advertising Industry Is Defining Your Identity and Your Worth|date=10 January 2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300165012|pages=256|language=en|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>{{rp|17}}

== Theory ==
=== Shoshana Zuboff ===
{{main|Shoshana Zuboff}}
In Zuboff's theory, surveillance capitalism is a novel market form and a specific logic of [[capitalism|capitalist]] accumulation. In her 2014 essay ''A Digital Declaration: Big Data as Surveillance Capitalism'', she characterized it as a "radically disembedded and extractive variant of information capitalism" based on the [[commodification]] of "reality" and its transformation into behavioral data for analysis and sales.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/1.3152525|title=A Digital Declaration: Big Data as Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=15 September 2014|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Powles|first1=Julia|title=Google and Microsoft have made a pact to protect surveillance capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/google-microsoft-pact-antitrust-surveillance-capitalism|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sterling|first1=Bruce|title=Shoshanna Zuboff condemning Google "surveillance capitalism"|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond-the-beyond/2016/03/shoshanna-zuboff-condemning-google-surveillance-capitalism/|journal=WIRED|date=March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/magazine/facebook-google-privacy-data.html|title=The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley — and Won|last=|first=|date=14 August 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref>

In a subsequent 2015 article, Zuboff analyzed the societal implications of this [[Creative destruction|mutation]] of capitalism. She differentiated "surveillance assets", "surveillance capital", and "surveillance capitalism" and their dependence on a global architecture of computer mediation that she calls "Big Other", a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power which constitutes hidden mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that threatens core values such as [[Free will|freedom]], [[democracy]], and [[privacy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|s2cid=15329793|date=4 April 2015|title=Big other: surveillance capitalism and the prospects of an information civilization|journal=Journal of Information Technology|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=75–89|doi=10.1057/jit.2015.5|issn=0268-3962|ssrn=2594754}}</ref><ref name="theconversation1">{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-price-of-connection-surveillance-capitalism-64124|title=The price of connection: 'surveillance capitalism'|last1=Couldry|first1=Nick|date=23 September 2016|publisher=The Conversation|language=en}}</ref>

According to Zuboff, surveillance capitalism was pioneered at [[Google]] and later [[Facebook]], in much the same way that [[mass-production]] and managerial capitalism were pioneered at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]] a century earlier, and has now become the dominant form of information capitalism.<ref name="faz1">{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|newspaper=Faz.net}}</ref>

In her [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] lecture published in 2016, Zuboff identified surveillance capitalism's mechanisms and practices, including the manufacture of "prediction products" for sale in new "behavioral futures markets." She introduced the concept "dispossession by [[surveillance]]" and argued that it challenges the psychological and political bases of [[Self-determination theory|self-determination]] as it concentrates rights in the surveillance regime. This is described as a "coup from above."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/1.4103616|title=Google as a Fortune Teller: The Secrets of Surveillance Capitalism|last=Zuboff|first=Shoshana|date=5 March 2016|work=FAZ.NET|access-date=2018-08-28|language=de|issn=0174-4909}}</ref>

==== Analysis ====
Zuboff compares demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the Internet to asking [[Henry Ford]] to make each [[Ford Model T|Model T]] by hand and states that such demands are existential threats that violate the basic mechanisms of the entity's survival.<ref name=faz1/>

Zuboff warns that principles of self-determination might be forfeited due to "ignorance, learned helplessness, inattention, inconvenience, habituation, or drift" and states that "we tend to rely on mental models, vocabularies, and tools distilled from past catastrophes," referring to the twentieth century's [[totalitarian]] nightmares or the [[monopolistic]] predations of [[Gilded Age]] capitalism, with countermeasures that have been developed to fight those earlier threats not being sufficient or even appropriate to meet the novel challenges.<ref name=faz1/>

She also poses the question: "will we be the masters of information, or will we be its slaves?" and states that "if the digital future is to be our home, then it is we who must make it so".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zuboff|first1=Shoshana|title=Shoshana Zuboff: A Digital Declaration|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html|publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=15 September 2014|newspaper=Faz.net}}</ref>

In her book, Zuboff discusses the differences between industrial capitalism and surveillance capitalism. Zuboff writes industrial capitalism exploited the nature, surveillance capitalism exploits human nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contagious.com/news-and-views/shoshana-zuboff-on-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism|title=Shoshana Zuboff On surveillance capitalism|website=Contagious|language=en|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>

=== John Bellamy Foster and Robert W. McChesney ===
The term "surveillance capitalism" has also been used by [[political economists]] [[John Bellamy Foster]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]], although with a different meaning. In an article published in ''[[Monthly Review]]'' in 2014, they apply it to describe the manifestation of the "insatiable need for data" of [[financialization]], which they explain is "the long-term growth speculation on financial assets relative to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]" introduced in the United States by industry and government in the 1980s that evolved out of the [[Military–industrial complex|military-industrial complex]] and the [[advertising]] industry.<ref name=foster>{{Cite news|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/07/01/surveillance-capitalism/|title=Surveillance Capitalism {{!}} John Bellamy Foster {{!}} Monthly Review|date=2014-07-01|work=Monthly Review|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}</ref>
