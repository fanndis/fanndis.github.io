'''Scottish Americans''' or '''Scots Americans''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Ameireaganaich Albannach''; {{lang-sco|Scots-American}}) are [[Americans]] whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in [[Scotland]]. [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Americans are closely related to [[Scotch-Irish Americans]], descendants of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], and communities emphasize and celebrate a common heritage.<ref name="Ref_a">Celeste Ray, 'Introduction', p. 6, id., 'Scottish Immigration and  Ethnic Organization in the United States', pp. 48-9, 62, 81, in id. (ed.), ''The Transatlantic Scots'' (Tuscaloosa, AL:[[University of Alabama Press]], 2005).</ref> The majority of Scotch-Irish Americans originally came from Lowland Scotland and Northern England before migrating to the province of [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]] (see ''[[Plantation of Ulster]]'')  and thence, beginning about five [[generation]]s later, to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.

Large-scale emigration from Scotland to America began in the 1700s, accelerating after the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], the resulting breakup of the clan structures, and the [[Highland Clearances]]. Displaced Scots went in search of a better life and settled in the thirteen colonies, initially around [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]], and then further in successive generations.

==Number of Scottish Americans==
The table shows the ethnic Scottish population in the British colonies from 1700 to 1775. In 1700 the total population of the colonies was 250,888, of whom 223,071 (89%) were white and 3.0% were ethnically Scottish.<ref name="books.google.es">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf4FAAAAQBAJ&q=the+european+ancestry+of+the+united+states+population+thomas+l+purvis+80%25+english+and+welsh&pg=PA96|title=The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People|first1=Paul S.|last1=Boyer|first2=Clifford E.|last2=Clark|first3=Karen|last3=Halttunen|first4=Joseph F.|last4=Kett|first5=Neal|last5=Salisbury|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|via=Google Books|isbn=9781111786090}}</ref><ref name="Colonial America To 1763">[https://books.google.com/books?id=BZRJSx3uMYEC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=united+states+1700+223,071&source=bl&ots=afB35FaHOv&sig=tGL9u-SAvrR8gB3Dh_5gFl2roPo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBGoVChMIq43C-ZK4xwIVZBfbCh1HXgs9#v=onepage&q=united%20states%201700%20223%2C071&f=false Colonial America To 1763] By Thomas L.

The number of Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated to be 20 to 25 million<ref name="McCarthy"/><ref name="Scotlandnow"/><ref name="SPOR"/><ref name="SPEERCA"/> (up to 8.3% of the total US population), and Scotch-Irish 27 to 30 million<ref name="BFFF"/><ref name="Secret"/> (up to 10% of the total US population), the subgroups overlapping and not always distinguishable because of their shared ancestral [[surname]]s.

The majority of Scotch-Irish Americans originally came from Lowland Scotland and Northern England before migrating to the province of [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]] (see ''[[Plantation of Ulster]]'')  and thence, beginning about five [[Generation|generations]] later, to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.

In the 2000 census, 4.8 million Americans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-_sse=on|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|access-date=2005-08-09|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212041824/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-_sse=on|archive-date=2020-02-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> self-reported Scottish ancestry, 1.7% of the total US population.
Over 4.3 million self-reported [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] ancestry, for a total of 9.2 million Americans self-reporting some kind of Scottish descent.
Self-reported numbers are regarded by demographers as massive under-counts, because Scottish ancestry is known to be disproportionately under-reported among the majority of mixed ancestry,<ref name="Ref_y">Mary C. Walters, ''Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990), pp. 31-6.</ref> and because areas where people reported "American" ancestry were the places where, historically, Scottish and Scotch-Irish [[Protestants]] settled in [[North America|America]] (that is: along the North American coast, [[Appalachia]], and the Southeastern [[United States]]). Scottish Americans descended from nineteenth-century Scottish emigrants tend to be concentrated in the West, while many in [[New England]] are the descendants of emigrants, often Gaelic-speaking, from the [[Maritime Provinces]] of [[Canada]], from the 1880s onward.
Americans of Scottish descent outnumber the population of Scotland, where 4,459,071 or 88.09% of people identified as ethnic Scottish in the 2001 Census.<ref name="Ref_z">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP13&-geo_id=01000US&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-redoLog=false&-_sse=on |title=QT-P13.

==Historical contributions==

===Explorers===
The first Scots in [[North America]] came with the [[Viking]]s. A Christian [[bard]] from the [[Hebrides]] accompanied [[Bjarni Herjolfsson]] on his voyage around [[Greenland]] in 985/6 which sighted the mainland to the west.<ref>''Grænlendinga Saga'' (c. 1190), 2, tr. Magnus Magnusson and Hermann Pálsson, in ''The Vinland Sagas'' (Penguin: Harmondsworth, Middx, 1965), pp. 51-2, 107.</ref><ref name="Ref_c">Michael Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'' (New York: Thomas Dunne, 2005), p. 7.</ref>

The first Scots recorded as having set foot in the [[New World]] were a man named Haki and a woman named Hekja, slaves owned by [[Leif Eiriksson]]. The Scottish couple were runners who scouted for [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]]'s expedition in c. 1010, gathering [[wheat]] and the [[grapes]] for which [[Vinland]] was named.<ref>''Eirik's Saga'' (c. 1260), 8, tr. Magnusson and Palsson, in ''Vinland Sagas'', pp. 95, 109.</ref><ref name="Ref_d">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 8-9.</ref>

The controversial [[Zeno brothers|Zeno letters]] have been cited in support of a claim that [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair, earl of Orkney]], visited [[Nova Scotia]] in 1398.<ref name="Ref_e">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 10.</ref>

In the early years of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], a Scot named Tam Blake spent 20 years in [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. He took part in the conquest of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]] in 1532 with [[Pedro de Heredia#Inland Expeditions and Trials of Residence|Alonso de Heredia]]. He arrived in Mexico in 1534–5, and joined [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado|Coronado]]'s 1540 expedition to the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].<ref name="Hewitson">Jim Hewitson, ''Tam Blake & Co.: The Story of the Scots in America'' (Edinburgh: Orion, 1993), pp. 12-13.</ref><ref name="Ref_f">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 11.</ref>

Scottish-American naturalist [[John Muir]] is perhaps best known for his exploration of California's Sierra Nevada mountains during the 19th century.

After the [[Union of the Crowns]] of [[Scotland]] and [[England]] in 1603, [[James VI and I|King James VI]], a Scot, promoted joint expeditions overseas, and became the founder of [[British America|English America]].<ref name="Ref_g">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 12.</ref> The first permanent English settlement in the Americas, [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], was thus named for a Scot.

The earliest Scottish communities in America were formed by traders and [[Plantation economy|planters]] rather than farmer settlers.<ref name="Fry, p. 19">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 19.</ref> The hub of Scottish commercial activity in the colonial period was [[Virginia]]. Regular contacts began with the [[Penal transportation|transportation]] of [[indentured servants]] to the colony from Scotland, including prisoners taken in the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].<ref name=USA>Alex Murdoch, "USA", Michael Lynch (ed), ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), pp. 629-633.</ref>

By the 1670s [[Glasgow]] was the main outlet for Virginian [[tobacco]], in open defiance of English [[Navigation Acts|restrictions on colonial trade]]; in return the colony received Scottish manufactured goods, emigrants and ideas.<ref name=USA/><ref name="Ref_h">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 18, 19.</ref> In the 1670s and 1680s [[Presbyterian]] [[Dissenter]]s fled persecution by the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[Privy Council of Scotland|privy council]] in [[Edinburgh]] to settle in [[South Carolina]] and [[New Jersey]], where they maintained their distinctive religious culture.<ref name=USA/>

Trade between Scotland and the American colonies was finally regularized by the parliamentary [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of Scotland and England in 1707. [[Demography of Scotland|Population growth]] and the [[Highland Clearances|commercialization of agriculture]] in Scotland encouraged mass emigration to America after the [[French and Indian War]],<ref name="Fry, p. 20">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 20.</ref> a conflict which had also seen the first use of [[Scottish regiment|Scottish Highland regiments]] as Indian fighters.<ref name=USA/>

===Settlers===

Scottish settlement in colonial America has often been divided by historians into three separate streams--Lowlanders, Highlanders, and Ulster Scots.

Lowland Scots began to migrate to North America in the eighteenth century after the union of England and Scotland. They tended to settle in low-lying coastal areas and cities such as New York and New Jersey. As they were usually well-educated, lowland Scots found work easily, frequently as doctors, schoolmasters, or private tutors for the children of wealthy colonial citizens. Many others were merchants, particularly in the South. Because they were active participants in the British empire (to the point of considering themselves to be "North British" rather than "Scottish"), lowland Scots tended to stay loyal in the Revolution.

Highland Scots started arriving in North America in the 1730s. Unlike their lowland and Ulster counterparts, the Highlanders tended to cluster together in self-contained communities, where they maintained their distinctive cultural features such as the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language and [[piobaireachd]] music. Groups of Highlanders existed in coastal Georgia (mainly immigrants from Inverness-shire) and the Mohawk Valley in New York (from the West Highlands). By far the largest Highland community was centered on the [[Cape Fear River]], which saw a stream of immigrants from Argyllshire, and, later, other regions such as the [[Isle of Skye]]. Highland Scots were overwhelmingly loyalist in the Revolution. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=Duane|title=The Highland Scots of North Carolina|url=https://archive.org/details/highlandscotsofn1963meye}}</ref> Distinctly Highland cultural traits persisted in the region until the 19th century, at which point they were assimilated into Anglo-American culture.

The [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]], known as the Scots-Irish (or Scotch-Irish) in North America, were descended from people originally from the Scottish lowlands, as well as the north of England and other regions, who colonized the province of Ulster in Ireland in the seventeenth century. After several generations, their descendants left for America, and struck out for the frontier, in particular the Appalachian mountains, providing an effective "buffer" for attacks from American Indians. In the colonial era, they were usually simply referred to as "Irish," with the "Scots-" or "Scotch-" prefixes becoming popular when the descendants of the Ulster emigrants wanted to differentiate themselves from the Catholic Irish who were flocking to many American cities in the nineteenth century. Unlike the Highlanders and Lowlanders, the Scots-Irish were usually patriots in the Revolution. They have been noted for their tenacity and their cultural contributions to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leyburn|first1=James|title=The Scotch-Irish|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/scotch-irish}}</ref>

===Folk and gospel music===
{{Main article|Celtic music in the United States|}}

American [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]] styles have some of their roots in the Appalachian ballad culture of Scotch-Irish Americans (predominantly originating from the "Border Ballad" tradition of southern Scotland and northern England). Fiddle tunes from the Scottish repertoire, as they developed in the eighteenth century, spread rapidly into British colonies. However, in many cases, this occurred through the medium of print rather than aurally, explaining the presence of Highland-origin tunes in regions like Appalachia where there was essentially no Highland settlement. Outside of Gaelic-speaking communities, however, characteristic Highland musical idioms, such as the “Scotch-snap,”<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://journals.ed.ac.uk/ScottishStudies/article/view/1797/2375 |journal=Scottish Studies |first=William |last=Lamb |title=Grafting Culture: On the Development and Diffusion of the Strathspey in Scottish Music}}</ref> were flattened out and assimilated into anglophone musical styles.

Some African American communities were influenced musically by the Scottish American communities in which they were embedded. Psalm-singing and gospel music have become central musical experiences for African American churchgoers and it has been posited that some elements of these styles were introduced, in these communities, by Scots. Psalm-singing, or "[[precenting the line]]" as it is technically known, in which the psalms are called out and the congregation sings a response, was a form of musical worship initially developed for non-literate congregations and Africans in America were exposed to this by Scottish Gaelic settlers as well as immigrants of other origins. However, the theory that the African-American practice was influenced mainly by the Gaels has been criticized by ethnomusicologist Terry Miller, who notes that the practice of "[[lining out]]" hymns and psalms was common all over Protestant Britain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and that it is far more likely that Gospel music originated with English psalm singing. <ref>{{cite journal |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=243–259 |title=A Myth in the Making: Willie Ruff, Black Gospel and an Imagined Gaelic Scottish Origin |first=Terry |last=Miller |date=2009|doi=10.1080/17411910903141908 |s2cid=161731960 }}</ref>

The first foreign tongue spoken by some slaves in America was [[Scottish Gaelic]] picked up from Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Did you hear about the Gaelic-speaking African?': Scottish Gaelic Folklore about Identity in North America |first=Michael |last=Newton |journal=Comparative American Studies |volume = 8|issue=2 |pages=88–106 |date=2013|doi = 10.1179/147757010X12677983681316|s2cid=161671797 }}</ref> There are accounts of African Americans singing Gaelic songs and playing Scottish Gaelic music on bagpipes and fiddle.

===Patriots and Loyalists===
The civic tradition of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] contributed to the intellectual ferment of the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=USA/> In 1740, the Glasgow philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued for a right of colonial resistance to tyranny.<ref name="Ref_j">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 28-29.</ref> Scotland's leading thinkers of the revolutionary age, [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], opposed the use of force against the rebellious colonies.<ref name="Ref_k">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 29-32.</ref> According to the historian [[Arthur L. Herman]]: "Americans built their world around the principles of Adam Smith and [[Thomas Reid]], of individual interest governed by common sense and a limited need for government."<ref name="Ref_l">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 154.</ref>

While [[John Witherspoon]] was the only Scot to sign the Declaration of Independence, several other signers had ancestors there. Other [[founding fathers]] like [[James Madison]] had no ancestral connection but were imbued with ideas drawn from Scottish moral philosophy.<ref name="Ref_n">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 38-40.</ref> Scottish Americans who made major contributions to the revolutionary war included Commodore [[John Paul Jones]], the "Father of the American Navy", and Generals [[Henry Knox]] and [[William Alexander (American general)|William Alexander]]. Another person of note was a personal friend of George Washington, General [[Hugh Mercer]], who fought for [[Charles Edward Stuart]] at the [[Battle of Culloden]].

The Scotch-Irish, who had already begun to settle beyond the [[Proclamation Line]] in the [[Ohio Valley|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee Valley]]s, were drawn into rebellion as war spread to the frontier.<ref name="Ref_o">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 13, 23.</ref> Tobacco plantations and independent farms in the backcountry of Virginia, [[Maryland]] and the [[Carolinas]] had been financed with Scottish credit, and indebtedness was an additional incentive for separation.<ref name="Fry, p. 19"/>

Most Scottish Americans had commercial ties with the old country or [[Scottish clan|clan]] allegiances and stayed true to [[the Crown]].<ref name="Ref_p">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 13, 24-26.</ref> The Scottish Highland communities of [[upstate New York]] and the [[Cape Fear (region)|Cape Fear]] valley of North Carolina were centers of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] resistance.<ref name=USA/> A small force of Loyalist [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] fell at the [[Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge]] in 1776. Scotch-Irish [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] defeated Scottish American Loyalists in the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in 1780.<ref name="Ref_q">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 28.</ref> Many Scottish American Loyalists, particularly Highlanders, emigrated to Canada after the war.<ref name=USA/>

===Uncle Sam===
[[File:Unclesamwantyou.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Uncle Sam|"Uncle Sam" Wilson]] was based on  [[Samuel Wilson]].]]
[[Uncle Sam]] is the [[national personification]] of the [[United States]], and sometimes more specifically of the [[American government]], with the first usage of the term dating from the [[War of 1812]].
The American icon Uncle Sam, who embodies the American spirit more than any other figure, was in fact based on a real man. A businessman from [[Troy, New York]], [[Samuel Wilson]], whose parents sailed to America from [[Greenock]], [[Scotland]], has been officially recognized as the original Uncle Sam. He provided the army with beef and pork in barrels during the War of 1812. The barrels were prominently labeled "U.S." for the United States, but it was jokingly said that the letters stood for "Uncle Sam." Soon, Uncle Sam was used as shorthand for the federal government.

===Emigrants and free traders===
Trade with Scotland continued to flourish after independence. The tobacco trade was overtaken in the nineteenth century by the [[cotton]] trade, with Glasgow factories exporting the finished textiles back to the United States on an industrial scale.<ref name="Ref_r">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', pp. 19, 41.</ref>

Emigration from Scotland peaked in the nineteenth century, when more than a million Scots left for the United States,<ref name="Ref_s">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 193.</ref> taking advantage of the regular Atlantic steam-age shipping industry which was itself largely a Scottish creation,<ref name="Ref_t">Fry, ''How the Scots Made America'', p. 194.</ref> contributing to a revolution in transatlantic communication.<ref name=USA/>

Scottish emigration to the United States followed, to a lesser extent, during the twentieth century, when  Scottish heavy industry declined.<ref name="Ref_u">Evans, Nicholas J., 'The Emigration of Skilled Male Workers from Clydeside during the Interwar Period', ''International Journal of Maritime History'', Volume XVIII, Number 1 (2006), pp. 255-280.</ref> This new wave peaked in the first decade of the twentieth century, contributing to a hard life for many who remained behind. Many qualified workers emigrated overseas, a part of which, established in Canada, later went on to the United States.<ref name=everyculture>[http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Scottish-and-Scots-Irish-Americans.html Everyculture:Scottish American]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Writers===
In the nineteenth century, American authors and educators adopted Scotland as a model for cultural independence.<ref name=USA/> In the world of letters, Scottish literary icons [[James Macpherson]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Walter Scott]], and [[Thomas Carlyle]] had a mass following in the United States, and Scottish [[Romanticism]] exerted a seminal influence on the development of American literature.<ref name=USA/> The works of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] bear its powerful impression. Among the most notable Scottish American writers of the nineteenth century were [[Washington Irving]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Herman Melville]].  Poet [[James Mackintosh Kennedy]] was called to Scotland to deliver the official poem for the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1914.

In the twentieth century, [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' exemplified popular literature. [[William Faulkner]] won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1949.

===Tartan Day===
{{Main article|Tartan Day|}}
[[File:MHPB New York.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tartan Day]] parade in New York City]]
[[Tartan Day|National Tartan Day]], held each year on April 6 in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], celebrates the historical links between Scotland and [[North America]] and the contributions [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Americans and Canadians have made to US and Canadian [[democracy]], industry and society. The date of April 6 was chosen as "the anniversary of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320—the inspirational document, according to [[U.S. Senate]] Resolution 155, 1999, upon which the [[American Declaration of Independence]] was modeled".<ref name="Ref_an">Edward J. Cowan, "Tartan Day in America", in Celeste Ray (ed.), ''The Transatlantic Scots'' (Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 318.</ref>

The Annual Tartan Week celebrations come to life every April with the largest celebration taking place in New York City. Thousands descend onto the streets of the Big Apple to celebrate their heritage, culture and the impact of the [[Scottish people|Scottish Americans]] in America today.

Hundreds of pipers, drummers, Highland dancers, Scottie Dogs and celebrities march down the streets drowned in their family tartans and Saltire flags whilst interacting with the thousands of onlookers.

NYC is not the only large city to celebrate Tartan Day. Large events also take place in Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, California, Chicago, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Québec, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Australia, and New Zealand.

Scottish Heritage Month is also promoted by community groups around the United States and Canada.<ref name="Ref_ao">[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/ncscotsmonth.htm National Scots, Scots-Irish Heritage Month in the USA], ElectricScotland.com</ref>

Scottish culture, food, and athletics are celebrated at [[Highland Games]] and Scottish festivals throughout [[North America]]. The largest of these occurs yearly at [[Pleasanton, California]], [[Grandfather Mountain]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Estes Park, Colorado]]. There are also other notable Scottish Festivals in cities like [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [Ventura, California] at the Seaside Highland Games, [[Atlanta, Georgia]] (at [[Stone Mountain Park]]), [[San Antonio, Texas]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. In addition to traditional Scottish sports such as [[caber toss|tossing the caber]] and the [[hammer throw]], there are [[whisky]] tastings, traditional foods such as [[haggis]], [[Bagpipes]] and [[Drums]] competitions, [[Celtic rock]] musical acts and traditional Scottish dance.

===Scottish Gaelic language in the United States===

Although [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]] had been spoken in most of Scotland at one time or another, by the time of large-scale migrations to North America – the eighteenth century – it had only managed to survive in the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland. Unlike other ethnic groups in Scotland, Scottish Highlanders preferred to migrate in communities, and remaining in larger, denser concentrations aided in the maintenance of their language and culture. The first communities of Scottish Gaels began migrating in the 1730s to Georgia, New York and the Carolinas. Only in the Carolinas were these settlements enduring. Although their numbers were small, the immigrants formed a beach-head for later migrations, which accelerated in the 1760s.<ref>Newton, ''‘We’re Indians Sure Enough’'', pp. 69-83.</ref>

The American Revolutionary War effectively stopped direct migration to the newly formed United States, most people going instead to British North America (now Canada). The Canadian Maritimes were a favored destination from the 1770s to the 1840s. Sizable concentrations of Gaelic communities existed in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, with smaller clusters in Newfoundland, Quebec, and New Brunswick. Those who left these communities for opportunities in the United States, especially in New England, were usually fluent Gaelic speakers into the mid-twentieth century.<ref>Newton, ''‘We’re Indians Sure Enough’'', pp. 163-175.</ref>

Of the many communities founded by Scottish Highland immigrants, the language and culture only survives at a community level in the Canadian province of [[Nova Scotia]]. According to the 2000 census, 1,199 people speak Scottish Gaelic at home.<ref>{{Cite book

The direct descendants of Scottish Highlanders were not the only people in the United States to speak the language, however. Gaelic was one of the languages spoken by fur traders in many parts of North America. In some parts of the Carolinas and [[Alabama]], African-American communities spoke Scottish Gaelic, particularly (but not solely) due to the influence of Gaelic-speaking slave-owners.<ref>{{cite journal |title='Did you hear about the Gaelic-speaking African?': Scottish Gaelic Folklore about Identity in North America |first=Michael |last=Newton |journal=Comparative American Studies |volume = 8|issue=2 |pages=88–106 |date=2013|doi = 10.1179/147757010X12677983681316|s2cid=161671797 }}</ref> According to musicologist [[Willie Ruff]], jazz musician [[Dizzy Gillespie]] spoke often of the Gaelic speaking African-Americans.<ref>{{Cite web
