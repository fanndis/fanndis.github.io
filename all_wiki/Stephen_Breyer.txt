'''Stephen Gerald Breyer'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|.|ər}} {{respell|BRY|ər}}; born August 15, 1938) is an American lawyer, jurist, and legal scholar who serves as an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. He was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] on May 17, 1994 and has served since August 3, 1994.

After attending [[Stanford University]], Breyer attended the [[University of Oxford]] as a [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall Scholar]] and then studied law at [[Harvard Law School]]. After a [[Law clerk|clerkship]] with Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] in 1964, Breyer became well known as a law professor and lecturer at [[Harvard Law School]], starting in 1967. There he specialized in [[administrative law]], writing a number of influential textbooks that remain in use today. He held other prominent positions before being nominated for the Supreme Court, including special assistant to the [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] for [[Competition law|Antitrust]] and assistant special prosecutor on the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate Special Prosecution Force]] in 1973. He also served on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]] from 1980 to 1994.

In his 2005 book ''[[Active Liberty]]'', Breyer made his first attempt to systematically communicate his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary should seek to resolve issues in a manner that encourages popular participation in governmental decisions. He is generally associated with the Supreme Court's more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] side.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kersch |first=Ken |year=2006 |title=Justice Breyer's Mandarin Liberty |url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&httpsredir=1&article=5339&context=uclrev |journal=[[University of Chicago Law Review]] |volume=73 |pages=759–822 |quote=As his decision to characterize both the New Deal and Warren Courts as centrally committed to democracy and 'active liberty' makes clear, Justice Breyer identifies his own constitutional agenda with that of these earlier courts, and positions himself, in significant respects, as a partisan of midcentury constitutional liberalism. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226033939/https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&httpsredir=1&article=5339&context=uclrev |archive-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref>

Breyer served as a [[law clerk]] to Associate Justice [[Arthur Goldberg]] during the 1964 term ([[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 2)|list]]), and served briefly as a fact-checker for the [[Warren Commission]]. He worked in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] as a special assistant to its [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] from 1965 to 1967, and an assistant [[special prosecutor]] on the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] Special Prosecution Force in 1973.

In the last days of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration, on November 13, 1980, Carter nominated Breyer to the First Circuit, to a new seat established by {{USStat|92|1629}}, and the [[United States Senate]] confirmed him on December 9, 1980, by an 80–10 vote.<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/96-1980/s1021</ref> He received his commission on December 10, 1980. From 1980 to 1994, Breyer was a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]; he was the court's [[Chief Judge]] from 1990 to 1994.<ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /> One of his duties as chief judge was to oversee the design and construction of a new [[John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse|federal courthouse for Boston]], beginning an avocational interest in architecture and the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Pedersen |first=Martin  |url=https://www.archdaily.com/899827/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-to-understand-a-building-go-there-open-your-eyes-and-look |title=Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer: "To Understand a Building, Go There, Open your Eyes, and Look!" |date=2018-08-08 |work=Arch Daily |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>

Breyer served as a member of the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]] between 1990 and 1994 and the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] between 1985 and 1989.<ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /> On the sentencing commission he played a key role in reforming federal criminal sentencing procedures, producing the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]], which were formulated to increase uniformity in sentencing.<ref>{{cite news |title=Justice Breyer Should Recuse Himself from Ruling on Constitutionality of Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Duke Law Professor Says |url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2004/09/breyertip_0904.html |work=Duke University News |date=September 28, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731163145/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2004/09/breyertip_0904.html |archive-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

Breyer's service on the First Circuit terminated on August 2, 1994, upon his elevation to the Supreme Court.

===Supreme Court (1994–present)===
In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] considered him for the seat vacated by [[Byron White]] that ultimately went to Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Berke |title=The Overview; Clinton Names Ruth Ginsburg, Advocate for Women, to Court |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DB163EF936A25755C0A965958260 |work=The New York Times |date=June 15, 1993}}</ref> Breyer's appointment came shortly thereafter, however, following the retirement of [[Harry Blackmun]] in 1994, when Clinton nominated Breyer as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court on May 17, 1994. Breyer was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1994, by an 87 to 9 vote, and received his commission on August 3.<ref name="Supreme Court Bio" /> He was the second-longest-serving junior justice in the history of the Court, close to surpassing the record set by Justice [[Joseph Story]] of 4,228 days (from February 3, 1812, to September 1, 1823); Breyer fell 29 days short of tying this record, which he would have reached on March 1, 2006, had Justice [[Samuel Alito]] not joined the Court on January 31, 2006. Since Ginsburg's death in September 2020, Breyer has been the oldest incumbent Supreme Court Justice.

Breyer's [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to the law "will tend to make the law more sensible", according to [[Cass Sunstein]], who added that Breyer's "attack on [[originalism]] is powerful and convincing".<ref name="115 YALE L.J. 1719">{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |title=Justice Breyer's Democratic Pragmatism |url=http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/221_om87hycw.pdf |journal=The Yale Law Journal |date=May 2006 |volume=115 |issue=7 |pages=1719–1743 |doi=10.2307/20455667 |jstor=20455667 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704041242/http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/221_om87hycw.pdf |archive-date=July 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2006, Breyer said that in assessing a law's constitutionality, while some of his colleagues "emphasize language, a more literal reading of the [Constitution's] text, history and tradition", he looks more closely to the "purpose and consequences".<ref>{{cite web |title=Justice Breyer Favors 'Less Literal' Readings |url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/2/9/130027.shtml |publisher=newsmax.com |date=February 9, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527130035/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/2/9/130027.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 27, 2012 |access-date=September 16, 2010}}</ref>

He has demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Justice since 1994.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Paul |last1=Gewirtz |last2=Golder |first2=Chad |title=So Who Are the Activists? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/opinion/06gewirtz.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 6, 2005 |access-date=March 23, 2007}}</ref>

Breyer's extensive experience in [[administrative law]] is accompanied by his staunch defense of the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]]. Breyer rejects the strict interpretation of the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] espoused by [[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] that all facts necessary to criminal punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.<ref>''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}.</ref> In many other areas on the Court, too, Breyer's pragmatism was considered the intellectual counterweight to Scalia's [[textualism|textualist]] philosophy.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathleen M. |last=Sullivan |title=Consent of the Governed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/books/review/05sullivan.html |work=The New York Times |date=February 5, 2006}}</ref>

In describing his interpretive philosophy, Breyer has sometimes noted his use of six interpretive tools: text, history, tradition, precedent, the purpose of a statute, and the consequences of competing interpretations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dalia |last=Lithwick |title=Justice Grover Versus Justice Oscar |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2154993/ |work=Slate |date=December 6, 2006 |access-date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> He has noted that only the last two differentiate him from textualists such as Scalia. Breyer argues that these sources are necessary, however, and in the former case (purpose), can in fact provide greater objectivity in legal interpretation than looking merely at what is often ambiguous statutory text.<ref>{{cite news |title=Interview with Nina Totenberg |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4929668 |publisher=NPR |date=September 30, 2005 |access-date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> With the latter (consequences), Breyer argues that considering the impact of legal interpretations is a further way of ensuring consistency with a law's intended purpose.<ref>Sunstein at 12 ("Breyer thinks that as compared with a single-minded focus on literal text, his approach will tend to make the law more sensible, almost by definition. He also contends that it 'helps to implement the public's will and is therefore consistent with the Constitution's democratic purpose.' Breyer concludes that an emphasis on legislative purpose 'means that laws will work better for the people they are presently meant to affect. Law is tied to life; and a failure to understand how a statute is so tied can undermine the very human activity that the law seeks to benefit' (p. 100).")</ref>

Court clerks described him as the "most effective emissary to the Court's right wing".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/10/florida-election-2000|title=Behind the aftermath of the 2000 U.S. election|last=Margolick|first=David|website=Vanity Fair|date=March 19, 2014|access-date=October 28, 2020}}</ref>

===''Active Liberty''===
[[File:Stephen Breyer (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Breyer in 2011]]
Breyer expounded his judicial philosophy in 2005 in ''[[Active Liberty|Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Constitution]]''. In it, Breyer urges judges to interpret legal provisions (of the Constitution or of statutes) in light of the purpose of the text and how well the consequences of specific rulings fit those purposes. The book is considered a response to the 1997 book ''A Matter of Interpretation'', in which [[Antonin Scalia]] emphasized adherence to the original meaning of the text alone.<ref name="Wittes2005" /><ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Feeney |title=Author in the Court: Justice Stephen Breyer's New Book Reflects His Practical Approach to the Law |url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2005/10/03/author_in_the_court/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=October 3, 2005}}</ref>

In ''Active Liberty'', Breyer argues that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Framers of the Constitution]] sought to establish a democratic government involving the maximum liberty for its citizens. Breyer refers to [[Isaiah Berlin]]’s ''Two Concepts of Liberty''. The first Berlinian concept, being what most people understand by liberty, is "freedom from government coercion". Berlin termed this "[[negative liberty]]" and warned against its diminution; Breyer calls this "modern liberty". The second Berlinian concept&nbsp;– "[[positive liberty]]"&nbsp;– is the "freedom to participate in the government". In Breyer's terminology, this is the "active liberty" the judge should champion. Having established what "active liberty" is, and positing the primary importance (to the Framers) of this concept over the competing idea of "negative liberty", Breyer makes a predominantly [[utilitarian]] case for rulings that give effect to the [[Original intent|democratic intentions]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

The book's historical premises and practical prescriptions have been challenged. For example, according to [[Peter Berkowitz]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peterberkowitz.com/democratizingtheconstitution.pdf |title=Democratizing the Constitution |access-date=October 26, 2007 |last=Berkowitz |first=Peter}}</ref> the reason that "[t]he primarily democratic nature of the Constitution's governmental structure has not always seemed obvious", as Breyer puts it, is "because it's not true, at least in Breyer's sense, that the Constitution elevates active liberty above modern [negative] liberty". Breyer's position "demonstrates not fidelity to the Constitution", Berkowitz argues, "but rather a determination to rewrite the Constitution's priorities". Berkowitz suggests that Breyer is also inconsistent in failing to apply this standard to the issue of abortion, instead preferring decisions "that protect women's modern liberty, which remove controversial issues from democratic discourse". Failing to answer the [[Textualism|textualist]] charge that the [[Living Constitution|Living Documentarian]] judge is a law unto himself, Berkowitz argues that ''Active Liberty'' "suggests that when necessary, instead of choosing the consequence that serves what he regards as the Constitution's leading purpose, Breyer will determine the Constitution’s leading purpose on the basis of the consequence that he prefers to vindicate".

Against the last charge, Cass Sunstein has defended Breyer, noting that of the nine justices on the Rehnquist Court, Breyer had the highest percentage of votes to uphold acts of Congress and also to defer to the decision of the [[Executive branch of the United States|executive branch]].<ref>Sunstein, pg. 7, citing Lori Ringhand, "Judicial Activism and the Rehnquist Court", available on ssrn.com and Cass R. Sunstein and Thomas Miles, "[https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?httpsredir=1&article=2663&context=journal_articles Do Judges Make Regulatory Policy? An Empirical investigation of Chevron]", ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 823 (2006).</ref> However, according to [[Jeffrey Toobin]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "Breyer concedes that a judicial approach based on 'active liberty' will not yield solutions to every constitutional debate", and that, in Breyer's words, "respecting the democratic process does not mean you abdicate your role of enforcing the limits in the Constitution, whether in the Bill of Rights or in separation of powers."<ref name="toobin">{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Toobin |title=Breyer's Big Idea |url=https://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/10/31/051031fa_fact?currentPage=1 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=October 31, 2005}}</ref>

To this point, and from a discussion at the [[New York Historical Society]] in March 2006, Breyer has noted that "democratic means" did not bring about an end to [[slavery]], or the concept of "one man, one vote", which allowed corrupt and discriminatory (but democratically inspired) state laws to be overturned in favor of [[civil rights]].<ref name=NYHS>{{cite web |last=Pakaluk |first=Maximilian |title=Chambered in a 'Democratic Space'.

===Other books===
In 2010, Breyer published a second book, ''Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View''.<ref>({{ISBN|978-0307269911}}); {{cite news |first=David |last=Fontana |title=Stephen Breyer's "Making Democracy Work", reviewed by David Fontana |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/01/AR2010100103520.html |work=The Washington Post |date=October 3, 2005 |access-date=October 8, 2010}}</ref> There, Breyer argued that judges have six tools they can use to determine a legal provision's proper meaning: (1) its text; (2) its historical context; (3) [[precedent]]; (4) tradition; (5) its purpose; and (6) the consequences of potential interpretations.<ref>Stephen Breyer, ''Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge's View'' 74 (2010).</ref> [[Textualists]], like [[Scalia]], only feel comfortable using the first four of these tools; while pragmatists, like Breyer, believe that "purpose" and "consequences" are ''particularly'' important interpretative tools.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Stephen Breyer, Antonin Scalia, Jan Crawford Greenburg (moderator) |date=2006-12-05 |title=A conversation on the constitution: perspectives from Active Liberty and A Matter of Interpretation |medium=Video |location=Capital Hilton Ballroom - Washington, D.C. |publisher=The American Constitution Society; The Federalist Society |url=https://fedsoc.org/commentary/videos/a-conversation-on-the-constitution-with-supreme-court-justices-stephen-breyer-and-antonin-scalia-event-audio}}</ref>

Breyer cites several watershed moments in Supreme Court history to show why the consequences of a particular ruling should always be in a judge's mind. He notes that [[President Jackson]] ignored the Court's ruling in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which led to the [[Trail of Tears]] and severely weakened the Court's authority.<ref name="Shesol">Jeff Shesol. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/books/review/Shesol-t.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=0 Evolving Circumstances, Enduring Values]'', N.Y. Times, September 17, 2010.</ref> He also cites the ''[[Dred Scott]]'' decision, an important precursor to the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="Shesol"/> When the Court ignores the consequences of its decisions, Breyer argues, it can lead to devastating and destabilizing outcomes.<ref name="Shesol"/>

In 2015, Breyer released a third book, ''The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities'', examining the interplay between U.S. and international law and how the realities of a globalized world need to be considered in U.S. cases.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Witt|first1=John Fabian|title=Stephen Breyer's 'The Court and the World'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/books/review/stephen-breyers-the-court-and-the-world.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Court and the World: American Law and the New Global Realities|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/253016/the-court-and-the-world-by-stephen-breyer/|publisher=Penguin Random House|access-date=October 27, 2015}}</ref>

===Other views===
In an interview on ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' on December 12, 2010, Breyer said that based on the values and the historical record, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] never intended guns to go unregulated and that history supports his and the other dissenters' views in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]''. He summarized:
{{Quote|We're acting as judges. If we're going to decide everything on the basis of history — by the way, what is the scope of the right to keep and bear arms? Machine guns? Torpedoes? Handguns? Are you a sportsman? Do you like to shoot pistols at targets? Well, get on the subway and go to Maryland. There is no problem, I don't think, for anyone who really wants to have a gun.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/12/12/breyer-founding-fathers-allowed-restrictions-guns/#content |title=Breyer: Founding Fathers Would Have Allowed Restrictions on Guns |publisher=Fox News |date=December 12, 2010 |access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref>}}

What [people] see in front of them at the State of the Union is that federal government.

In 2007, Breyer was honored with the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] by the [[Boy Scouts of America]].<ref name="breyerDE">{{cite journal |title=Distinguished Eagle Scout Award |journal=Scouting |issue=November&nbsp;– December 2007 |page=10 |year=2007 |url=http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0711/d-news.html |access-date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> In 2018, he was named to chair of the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]] jury, succeeding previous chair [[Glenn Murcutt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.architectmagazine.com/awards/u-s-supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-named-chair-of-pritzker-architecture-prize-jury_o |title=U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer Named Chair of Pritzker Architecture Prize Jury |website=Architect Magazine |access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>
