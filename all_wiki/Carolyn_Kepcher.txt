'''Carolyn Kepcher''' (born January 30, 1969) is an [[United States|American]] [[businesswoman]] who was one of the judges on the [[NBC]] [[television program]] ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. She was formerly the [[Executive Vice President]], [[Chief Operating Officer]], for the Trump Golf Properties. Before her career with Trump ended in August 2006,<ref name="cnnmoney">[https://money.cnn.com/2006/08/31/news/newsmakers/trump_kepcher/index.htm "Trump tells Carolyn: 'You're fired!': Kepcher, blonde assistant of ''The Apprentice'', loses job after Trump tires of her"]; cnnmoney.com; August 31, 2006</ref> she monitored the progress of the contestants on the program and assisted [[Donald Trump]] in determining who should be fired.

==Early life==
During High School, Kepcher sold [[Avon Products]] door-to-door. While studying marketing on a volleyball scholarship at [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], she took a job as a manager at a Manhattan restaurant.

==Career==
On graduation, in 1992, Kepcher secured a position as sales and marketing director of a golf club outside [[New York City]]. Her primary responsibility was to prepare the property for bank [[auction]], where it was eventually sold to Donald Trump. Kepcher's ideas on how best to use the property impressed him, and he hired her as director of sales and marketing in 1994.

===Trump: 1992â€“2006===
After four years in this capacity, she was named general manager. Her effective management skills convinced Trump of her ability to lead and he later named her the [[Chief Operating Officer]]  of [[Trump National Golf Club Westchester]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]], and subsequently the Trump National Golf Club in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]], overseeing over 250 employees at each location.

In 2004, she wrote a business book, ''Carolyn 101: Business Lessons From the Apprentice's Straight Shooter'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-7022-3}}) based on her business experience. The book went to #2 on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller List.

On August 31, 2006, Kepcher's employment at the Trump Organization ended. According to sources who spoke to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Trump felt that Kepcher's newfound celebrity status had kept her too busy with speaking engagements and endorsements to focus on her responsibilities for the Trump Organization. Kepcher was replaced on ''The Apprentice'' by [[Ivanka Trump]], beginning with Season 6.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/08312006/commentary/trump_dumps_his_firing_squad_aide_carolyn_commentary_richard_johnson.htm "Trump Dumps His Firing-Squad Aide Carolyn"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028111624/http://www.nypost.com/seven/08312006/commentary/trump_dumps_his_firing_squad_aide_carolyn_commentary_richard_johnson.htm |date=October 28, 2006 }}; ''[[New York Post]]'' August 31, 2006</ref>
