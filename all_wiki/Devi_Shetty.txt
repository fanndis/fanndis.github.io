==Early life==
Shetty was born in a village in the [[Dakshina Kannada]] district, [[Karnataka]], India. The eighth of nine children, he decided to become a heart surgeon when he was in fifth grade at school after hearing about Dr. [[Christiaan Barnard]], a South African surgeon who had just performed the world's first heart transplant.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125875892887958111#articleTabs%3Darticle|title=The Henry ford of heart surgery|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref>

He was educated at St. Aloysius School, Mangalore<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martina |first1=Mala |title=‘Surgery is an art’ |url=https://www.thehindu.com/education/surgery-is-an-art/article19895240.ece?utm_source=admitad&utm_content=111b9e9eede8c8911c64716d2520c2b5&admitad_uid=111b9e9eede8c8911c64716d2520c2b5 |work=The Hindu |date=22 October 2017 |language=en-IN}}</ref> and at the [[St. Aloysius College, Mangaluru]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Notable alumni: This Mangaluru College minted bigwigs like KV Kamath, VG Siddhartha & KL Rahul |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/notable-alumni-this-mangalore-college-minted-bigwigs-like-kv-kamath-vg-siddhartha-kl-rahul/articleshow/70481288.cms?from=mdr |work=The Economic Times}}</ref> He completed his MBBS in 1979<ref name="Gov">{{Cite journal |last=Directorate of Printing |first=Government of India |date=1981-01-03 |title=Gazette of India, 1981, No. 452 |url=http://archive.org/details/in.gazette.1981.452}}</ref> and post-graduate work in General Surgery from [[Kasturba Medical College]], [[Mangalore]]. Later he completed FRCS from Royal college of Surgeons, England.<ref>[https://www.narayanahealth.org/bangalore/cardiac-surgery-adult-cardiac-surgery-paediatric/dr-devi-prasad-shetty Brief Profile - Devi Prasad Shetty]</ref>

==Career==
He returned to India in 1989 and initially worked at B.M. Birla Hospital in [[Kolkata]]. He successfully performed the first neonatal heart surgery in the country in 1989, on a 9-day-old baby.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Anand |first1=Geeta |title=The Henry Ford of Heart Surgery |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125875892887958111 |website=The Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones |accessdate=25 November 2009}}</ref> In [[Kolkata]] he operated on [[Mother Teresa]] after she had a heart attack and subsequently served as her personal physician.<ref name="MSN-India" /> After some time, he moved to [[Bangalore]] and started the Manipal Heart Foundation at Manipal Hospitals, [[Bangalore]]. Financial contribution for the construction of the hospital was provided by Shetty's father-in-law.

In 2001, Shetty founded [[Narayana Hrudayalaya]] (NH), a multi-specialty hospital in [[Bommasandra]] on the outskirts of Bangalore. He believes that the cost of healthcare can be reduced by 50 percent in the next 5–10 years if hospitals adopt the idea of economies of scale.<ref name="ET_Awards_2012">{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-09-19/news/33952757_1_hospital-chain-narayana-hrudayalaya-cardiac-surgery|title=ET Awards 2012|newspaper=Economic Times|date=19 September 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref> Apart from [[cardiac surgery]], NH also has [[cardiology]], [[neurosurgery]], [[paediatric surgery]], [[haematology]] and [[Organ transplant|transplant]] services, and [[nephrology]] among various others. The heart hospital is the largest in the world with 1000 beds performing over 30 major heart surgeries a day. The land on which the health city was built, was previously a marshland which was reclaimed for this purpose. The Health City intends to cater to about 15,000 outpatients every day.
In August 2012, Shetty announced an agreement with TriMedx, a subsidiary of [[Ascension Health]], to create a joint venture for a chain of hospitals in India. In the past Narayana Hrudayalaya has collaborated with Ascension Health to set up a health care city in the Cayman Islands, planned to eventually have 2,000 beds.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/devi-shetty-to-leveragefrugal-engineeringfor-medical-fraternity/484651/|title=Devi Shetty to leverage frugal engineering for medical fraternity|newspaper=Business Standard|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref>

Shetty also founded [[Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences]] (RTIICS) in Kolkata and signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] with the Karnataka Government to build 5,000-bed specialty hospital near [[Bangalore International Airport]]. His company signed a MOU with the [[Government of Gujarat]], to set up a 5,000-bed hospital at [[Ahmedabad]].<ref name=mougujarat>{{cite news|title=Narayana Hrudayalaya, Gujarat join hands for health city project|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2009/01/17/stories/2009011750421700.htm|website=Thehindubusinessline.in|accessdate=26 May 2013|date=17 January 2009}}</ref>

He was elected as the chief patron of [[Indian Association of Clinical Cardiologists]] during the annual scientific session IACCCON 2013 at Bangalore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accindia.org/|title=Publications|website=Accindia.org|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>

He was a part of the seven-member panel of Board of Governors which replaced the MCI and served for a period of one year before it was further reconstituted.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Low cost health care ==
Shetty aims for his hospitals to use [[economies of scale]], to allow them to complete heart surgeries at a lower cost than in the United States. In 2009 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' newspaper described him as "the [[Henry Ford]] of heart surgery".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125875892887958111?mod=slideshow_overlay_mod|title=The Henry Ford of Heart Surgery|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=5 June 2012}}</ref> Six additional hospitals were subsequently planned on the Narayana Hrudayalaya model at several cities in India, with plans to expand to 30,000 beds with hospitals in India, Africa and other countries in Asia.<ref name="ET_Awards_2012" /> Shetty aims to trim costs with such measures as buying cheaper [[Scrubs (clothing)|scrubs]] and using [[cross ventilation]] instead of [[air conditioning]].<ref name="cost" />  That has cut the price of [[coronary bypass surgery]] to 95,000 rupees ($1,583), half of what it was 20 years ago.<ref name="Bloomberg 2013">{{cite news|last1=Gokhale|first1=Ketaki|title=Heart Surgery in India for $1,583 Costs $106,385 in U.S.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-28/heart-surgery-in-india-for-1-583-costs-106-385-in-u-s-|accessdate=6 May 2016|work=Bloomberg.com|date=28 July 2013}}</ref> In 2013 he aimed to get the price down to $800 within a decade. The same procedure costs $106,385 at Ohio's [[Cleveland Clinic]].<ref name="Bloomberg 2013"/> He has also eliminated many pre-ops testing and innovated in patient care such as "drafting and training patients’ family members to administer after-surgical care".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/saritharai/2015/12/16/devi-shetty-who-put-heart-surgeries-within-reach-of-indias-poor-is-taking-narayana-chain-public/#71f6ead2889a|title=Devi Shetty, Who Put Heart Surgeries Within Reach Of India's Poor, Is Taking Narayana Chain Public|last=Rai|first=Saritha|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref> Surgeons in his hospitals perform 30 to 35 surgeries a day compared to one or two in a US hospital. His hospitals also provide substantial free care especially for poor children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/05/375142025/india-s-philanthropist-delivers-cardiac-surgery-henry-ford-style|title=India's Philanthropist-Surgeon Delivers Cardiac Care Henry Ford-Style|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref> He performs free surgery for the poor. In many parts of rural northern India, the poor refer to Dr. Shetty as Bypasswale Baba, i.e. the Saint who Grants Bypasses. Also very much like the saints of yore, no one who dreams of a bypass and comes to his hospital/ashram leaves without a bypass.

Shetty and his family have a 75 percent stake in Narayana Hrudayalaya which he plans to preserve.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-06-25/news/32409047_1_healthcare-sector-150-bed-hospital-narayana-hrudayalaya|title=We will prove the poor can access healthcare: Dr. Devi Prasad Shetty, Narayana Hrudayalaya|newspaper=Economic Times|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref> Shetty has also pioneered low-cost diagnostic services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/news/Narayana-Health-Cisco-join-hands-to-offer-affordable-diagnostics-solution/2016/09/08/article3615707.ece|title=Narayana Health, Cisco join hands to offer affordable diagnostics solution|website=Newindianexpress.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>
