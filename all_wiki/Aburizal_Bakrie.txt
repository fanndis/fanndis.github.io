In May 2010, he successfully formed and was elected the leader of a majority parliamentary coalition with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's party.

===Sidoardjo mudflow disaster===
Bakrie's name has been mentioned in reference with the [[Sidoarjo mud flow]] that erupted on 29 May 2006 in [[Sidoarjo]], a regency of Eastern [[Java]], causing significant devastation to the environment and loss of life.<ref>{{cite news |title=Catastrophic Mud Eruption Had Natural Causes |author=Charles Choi |url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/mud-eruption-caused-by-earthquake-130722.htm |newspaper=[[Discovery News]] |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> Scientists are divided over the cause that triggered the mud flow.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mud Eruption in Indonesia: Was Disaster Blamed on Drilling Activity Actually Caused By Quake? |author=LiveScience |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/mud-eruption-indonesia-disaster-drilling-quake_n_3634361.html |newspaper=[[HuffPost]]|date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> One side is claiming it was a natural occurrence caused by a [[2006 Yogyakarta earthquake|6.3-magnitude earthquake]] that occurred two days earlier near [[Yogyakarta]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Study starts debate over Indonesia volcano |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/study-starts-debate-over-indonesia-volcano/story-fn3dxix6-1226683627179 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref> while the other side and government confirmed the drilling practices of the [[PT Lapindo Brantas]], a company in which Bakrie's family was a controlling shareholder, triggered the mudflow.

According to the ''[[Jakarta Globe]]'', [[Effendi Simbolon]], a legislator from the [[Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle|Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle PDI-P]] and deputy chairman of House of Representatives Commission VII, which oversees mines and energy affairs, said that "the criticism of Bakrie, whose family controls the company that is widely blamed for the disaster, was unwarranted, politicized and based largely on jealousy."<ref>{{cite news|title=Politicians Defend Bakrie, Say Sidoarjo Victims Are Better Off |author=Fidelis E Satriastanti, Ezra Sihite & Markus Junianto Sihaloho |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |newspaper=[[Jakarta Globe]] |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=30 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601232820/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/nvironment/politicians-defend-bakrie-say-sidoarjo-victims-are-better-off/520981 |archivedate=1 June 2012}}</ref>

A 2013 report indicated that for nearly seven years the mudflow had been wreaking havoc in the livelihoods of Porong residents in particular and on the Sidoarjo economy as a whole. The mudflow had also buried more than 6000 hectares of land, displacing 39,700 people and submerging three subdistricts, 12 villages, 11,241 buildings and 362 hectares of rice fields.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mudflow Erupting After Seven Years |author=Hans David Tampubolong |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/03/05/mudflow-erupting-after-7-years.html |date=5 March 2013}}</ref>
