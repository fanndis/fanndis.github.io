The settlement was located within the country of [[Tsenacommacah]], which belonged to the [[Powhatan Confederacy]], and specifically in that of the [[Paspahegh]] tribe. The natives initially welcomed and provided crucial provisions and support for the colonists, who were not agriculturally inclined. Relations quickly soured, and the colonists would annihilate the Paspahegh in warfare within four years.

The London Company's second settlement in [[Bermuda]] claims to be the site of the oldest ''town'' in the English [[New World]], as [[St. George's, Bermuda]] was officially established in 1612 as New London, whereas James Fort in Virginia was not converted into James Towne until 1619, and further did not survive to the present day.<ref>The Royal Gazette, World Heritage (Town of St. George's and related fortifications) Supplement, February 22, 2001.</ref>

In 1676, Jamestown was deliberately burned during [[Bacon's Rebellion]], though it was quickly rebuilt. In 1699, the colonial capital was moved to what is today [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]; Jamestown ceased to exist as a settlement, and remains today only as an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site.

Spain, Portugal, and France moved quickly to establish a presence in the [[New World]], while other European countries moved more slowly. The English did not attempt to found colonies until many decades after the explorations of [[John Cabot]], and early efforts were failures—most notably the [[Roanoke Colony]] which vanished about 1590.

The Jamestown settlers arrived in Virginia during a severe drought, according to a research study conducted by the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment (JAA) team in the 1990s. The JAA analyzed information from a study conducted in 1985 by David Stahle and others, who obtained drawings of 800 year-old bald cypress trees along the [[Nottoway River|Nottoway]] and [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater]] rivers. The lifespan of these trees is up to 1,000 years and their rings offer a good indication of an area's annual amount of rainfall. The borings revealed that the worst drought in 700 years occurred between 1606 and 1612. This severe drought affected the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan tribe's ability to produce food and obtain a safe supply of water.<ref>Blanton, Dennis B.

The delivery of supplies in 1608 on the [[Jamestown supply missions#First supply mission|First and Second Supply]] missions of Captain Newport had also added to the number of hungry settlers. It seemed certain at that time that the colony at Jamestown would meet the same fate as earlier English attempts to settle in North America, specifically the [[Roanoke Colony]] (Lost Colony) and the [[Popham Colony]], unless there was a major relief effort. The Germans who arrived with the Second Supply and a few others defected to the Powhatans, with weapons and equipment.<ref name="Horn123"/><ref name="Horn127"/> The Germans even planned to join a rumored Spanish attack on the colony and urged the Powhatans to join it.<ref>Horn, 2006, pp. 129–130.</ref> The Spanish were driven off by the timely arrival in July 1609 of Captain [[Samuel Argall]] in ''Mary and John'', a larger ship than the Spanish reconnaissance ship ''La Asunción de Cristo''.<ref>Horn, 2006, p.154–156.</ref> Argall's voyage also prevented the Spanish from gaining knowledge of the weakness of the colony.

The investors of the Virginia Company of London expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost [[Roanoke Colony]]. It fell to the third president of the Council [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]] to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.<ref>Horn, 2006, pp. 128–129.</ref>

They also had a new purpose-built flagship, ''[[Sea Venture]]'', constructed, and placed in the most experienced of hands, Christopher Newport.

On June 2, 1609, ''Sea Venture'' set sail from [[Plymouth]] as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional [[Full rigged pinnace|pinnaces]]) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the [[Third Supply]], carrying 214 settlers.<ref name="apva.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/history/ |title=History of Jamestown – Jamestown Rediscovery |publisher=Apva.org |accessdate=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107053739/http://www.apva.org/history/ |archive-date=November 7, 2015 }}</ref> On July 24, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a [[hurricane]], and the ships were separated. Although some of the ships did make it to Jamestown, the leaders, and most of the supplies had been aboard ''Sea Venture'', which fought the storm for three days before Admiral of the Company, Sir [[George Somers]], deliberately drove it onto the reefs of [[Bermuda]] to prevent its foundering. This allowed all aboard to be landed safely.<ref>Horn, James (2006). ''A Land as God Made It: Jamestown and the Birth of America'', pp. 158–60. New York: Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-03094-7}}.</ref>

The survivors (including Lieutenant-General [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Sir Thomas Gates]], Captain [[Christopher Newport]], Sylvester Jordain, [[Stephen Hopkins (settler)|Stephen Hopkins]], later of ''[[Mayflower]]'', and secretary [[William Strachey]]) were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. During that time, they built two new ships, the [[Full rigged pinnace|pinnaces]] ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience''. The original plan was to build only one vessel, ''Deliverance'', but it soon became evident that it would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food (salted pork) that was being sourced on the islands.<ref>Evans, Cerinda W. (1957). ''Some Notes On Shipbuilding and Shipping in Colonial Virginia''. Williamsburg, Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corp. p. 7.</ref>

While the Third Supply was stranded in Bermuda, the colony at Jamestown was in even worse shape. In the "[[Starving Time]]" of 1609–1610, the Jamestown settlers faced rampant starvation for want of additional provisions. During this time, lack of food drove people to eat snakes and even boil the leather from shoes for sustenance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=LaCombe|first1=Michael|title=Political Gastronomy: Food and Authority in the English Atlantic World|date=2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=53}}</ref> Only 60 of the original 214 settlers at Jamestown survived.<ref name="apva.org"/> There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to [[cannibalism]] during the starving time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22362831|title='Proof' Jamestown settlers turned to cannibalism|author="Jane O'Brien"|work=[[BBC News]]|date=May 1, 2013|accessdate=May 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502014046/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22362831|archive-date=May 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-02/cannibalism/4664156|title=Skull proves settlers resorted to cannibalism|publisher=ABC News|date=May 2, 2013|accessdate=May 2, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502062754/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-02/cannibalism/4664156|archive-date=May 2, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Jamestown, the truth revealed|last=M.|first=Kelso, William|isbn=9780813939933|location=Charlottesville|oclc=964303596|year = 2017}}</ref>

===1610–1624: Rising fortunes===
<!--the following is intended to be a summary of the key points for the casual reader; a detailed articled exists at History of the Jamestown Settlement (1607–1699)-->
Due to the [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] backgrounds of many of the new colonists, a historic drought and the communal nature of their work load, progress through the first few years was inconsistent at best. By 1613, six years after Jamestown's founding, the organizers and shareholders of the Virginia Company were desperate to increase the efficiency and profitability of the struggling colony. Without stockholder consent the Governor, Sir [[Thomas Dale]], assigned {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} plots to its "[[ancient planter]]s" and smaller plots to the settlement's later arrivals. Measurable economic progress was made, and the settlers began expanding their planting to land belonging to local native tribes. That this turnaround coincided with the end of a drought that had begun the year before the English settlers' arrival probably indicates multiple factors were involved besides the colonists' ineptitude.<ref name="Stahle">[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/drought/drght_james.html "The lost colony and Jamestown droughts."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913074343/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/drought/drght_james.html |date=September 13, 2009 }}, Stahle, D.

Among the colonists who survived the Third Supply was [[John Rolfe]], who carried with him a cache of untested new [[tobacco]] seeds from Bermuda, which had grown wild there after being planted by shipwrecked Spaniards years before.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Rolfe|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/john-rolfe.htm|publisher=NPS.gov|work=Historic Jamestowne|accessdate=June 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530093741/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/john-rolfe.htm|archive-date=May 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1614, Rolfe began to successfully harvest tobacco.<ref>''John Marshall'' p.52</ref> Prosperous and wealthy, he married [[Pocahontas]], daughter of [[Chief Powhatan]], bringing several years of peace between the English and natives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/history/pocahont.html |title=history of Pocahontas |publisher=Apva.org |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417025121/http://www.apva.org/history/pocahont.html |archive-date=April 17, 2009 }}</ref> However, at the end of a public relations trip to England, Pocahontas became sick and died on March 21, 1617.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/pocahontas-her-life-and-legend.htm |title=Historic Jamestowne – Pocahontas: Her Life and Legend (U.S. National Park Service) |publisher=NPS.gov |work=Historic Jamestowne |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901024035/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/pocahontas-her-life-and-legend.htm |archive-date=September 1, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The following year, her father also died. Powhatan's brother, a fierce warrior named [[Opchanacanough]], became head of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]]. As the English continued to appropriate more land for tobacco farming, relations with the natives worsened.

Due to the high cost of the trans-Atlantic voyage at this time, many English settlers came to Jamestown as [[indentured servant]]s: in exchange for the passage, room, board, and the promise of land or money, these immigrants would agree to work for three to seven years. Immigrants from continental Europe, mainly Germans, were usually [[redemptioner]]s—they purchased some portion of their voyage on credit and, upon arrival, borrowed or entered into a work contract to pay the remainder of their voyage costs.<ref>Gary Walton; ''History of the American Economy''; p. 32</ref>

In 1619, the first representative assembly in America, the General Assembly, convened in the [[Jamestown Church]], "to establish one equal and uniform government over all Virginia" which would provide "just laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people there inhabiting," Initially, only men of English origin were permitted to vote.

Jamestown was located in [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]].

After several years of strained coexistence, Chief Opchanacanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities up and down the James River in what became known as the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]]. More than 300 settlers were killed in the attack, about a third of the colony's English-speaking population.<ref name="Stahle" /> Sir [[Thomas Dale]]'s development at [[Henricus]], which was to feature a [[college]] to educate the natives, and [[Wolstenholme Towne]] at [[Martin's Hundred]], were both essentially wiped out. Jamestown was spared only through a timely warning by a Virginia Indian employee. There was not enough time to spread the word to the outposts.

Of the 6,000 people who came to the settlement between 1608 and 1624, only 3,400 survived.<ref name="Stahle" />
<!--During these first years of the colony, many of the people lived in cavelike holes dug into the ground, and in the winter of 1609–1610, they were

<!--(Through their son, [[Thomas Rolfe]], many of the [[First Families of Virginia]] trace both Virginia Indian and English roots.) -->

===1624–1699: Later years===
In 1624, King James revoked the Virginia Company's charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. Despite the setbacks, the colony continued to grow. Ten years later, in 1634, by order of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the colony was divided into the original eight [[shires of Virginia]] (or [[County (United States)|counties]]), in a fashion similar to that practiced in England. Jamestown was now located in [[James City Shire]], soon renamed the "County of James City", better known in modern times as [[James City County, Virginia]], the nation's oldest county.

Another large-scale "Indian attack" occurred in 1644. In 1646, Opchanacanough was captured and while in custody an English guard shot him in the back—against orders—and killed him. Subsequently, the Powhatan Confederacy began to decline. Opechancanough's successor signed the first peace treaties between the Powhatan Indians and the English. The treaties required the Powhatan to pay yearly tribute payment to the English and confined them to reservations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm |title=Historic Jamestowne – Powhatan |publisher=NPS.gov |work=Historic Jamestowne |date=January 4, 2008 |accessdate=September 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924132642/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/powhatan-indian-lifeways.htm |archive-date=September 24, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A generation later, during [[Bacon's Rebellion]] in 1676, Jamestown was burned, eventually to be rebuilt. During its recovery, the Virginia legislature met first at Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]]'s nearby [[Green Spring Plantation]], and later at [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]], which had been started in 1632 as a fortified community inland on the [[Virginia Peninsula]], about {{convert|8|mi|km}} distant.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite web |author=How Jamestown Got Us Started |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/four-centuries?page=2 |title=Four Centuries &#124; American History Lives at American Heritage |publisher=Americanheritage.com |accessdate=December 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226210017/http://www.americanheritage.com/content/four-centuries?page=2 |archive-date=December 26, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When the statehouse burned again in 1698, this time accidentally, the legislature again temporarily relocated to Middle Plantation, and was able to meet in the new facilities of the [[College of William and Mary]], which had been established after receiving a royal charter in 1693. Rather than rebuilding at Jamestown again, the capital of the colony was moved permanently to Middle Plantation in 1699. The town was soon renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], to honor the reigning monarch, [[William III of England|King William III]]. A new Capitol building and "Governor's Palace" were erected there in the following years. This was a dramatic change that spelled the decline and doomed the town.

==Aftermath and preservation==
[[File:Jamestown Virginia ruin.JPG|thumb|1854 image of the ruins of Jamestown showing the tower of the old [[Jamestown Church]] built in the 17th century]]
Due to the movement of the capital to Williamsburg, the old town of Jamestown began to slowly disappear from view. Those who lived in the general area attended services at Jamestown's church until the 1750s, when it was abandoned. By the mid-18th century, the land was heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families.

During the [[American Revolutionary War]], although the [[Battle of Green Spring]] was fought nearby at the site of former Governor Berkeley's plantation, Jamestown was apparently inconsequential.
In 1831, David Bullock purchased Jamestown from the Travis and Ambler families.

===American Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War]], in 1861, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[William (Orgain) Allen|William Allen]], who owned the Jamestown Island, occupied Jamestown with troops he raised at his own expense with the intention of blockading the James River and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] from the Union Navy.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> He was soon joined by Lieutenant [[Catesby ap Roger Jones]], who directed the building of batteries and conducted ordnance and armor tests for the first Confederate [[ironclad warship]], [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], which was under construction at the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] in late 1861 and early 1862.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> Jamestown had a peak force of 1,200 men.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" />

During the [[Peninsula Campaign]], which began later that spring, Union forces under General [[George B. McClellan]] moved up the Peninsula from Fort Monroe in an attempt to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> The Union forces captured [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] in April 1862, and the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] was fought the following month.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> With these developments, Jamestown and the lower James River were abandoned by the Confederates.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> Some of the forces from Jamestown, and the crew of ''Virginia'', relocated to [[Drewry's Bluff]], a fortified and strategic position high above the river about {{convert|8|mi|km}} below Richmond. There, they successfully blocked the Union Navy from reaching the Confederate capital.

Once in Federal hands, Jamestown became a meeting place for runaway slaves, who burned the Ambler house, an eighteenth-century plantation house, which along with the old church was one of the few remaining signs of old Jamestown.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" /> When Allen sent men to assess the damage in late 1862, they were killed by the former slaves.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War">{{cite web|last=Riggs|first=David F.|title=Jamestown During the Civil War|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/jamestown-during-the-civil-war.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=April 12, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131003303/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/jamestown-during-the-civil-war.htm|archive-date=January 31, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Following the Confederate surrender at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Courthouse]], the oath of allegiance was administered to former Confederate soldiers at Jamestown.<ref name="COLO NPS Civil War" />

In the years after the Civil War, Jamestown became quiet and peaceful once again. In 1892, Jamestown was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Barney. The following year, the Barneys donated 22½ acres of land, including the ruined church tower, to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]).

By this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island's western shore. Visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a [[sea wall]] was constructed in 1900 to protect the area from further erosion. The archaeological remains of the original 1607 fort, which had been protected by the sea wall, were not discovered until 1996.

In 1932, [[George C. Gregory|George Craghead Gregory]] of Richmond was credited with discovering the foundation of the first brick statehouse (capitol) building, circa 1646, at Jamestown on the land owned by Preservation Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/popular/15/ps15-1.htm |title=NPS Publications: Popular Study Series |publisher=Nps.gov |date=October 20, 2001 |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106093527/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/popular/15/ps15-1.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Around 1936, Gregory, who was active with the [[Virginia Historical Society]], founded the [[Jamestowne Society]] for descendants of stockholders in the [[Virginia Company of London]] and the descendants of those who owned land or who had domiciles in Jamestown or on Jamestown Island prior to 1700.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestowne.org/ |title=Welcome to the Jamestowne Society! |publisher=Jamestowne.org |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961230060435/http://jamestowne.org/ |archive-date=December 30, 1996 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Colonial National Monument was authorized by the [[U.S. Congress]] on July 3, 1930 and established on December 30, 1930. In 1934, the [[National Park Service]] obtained the remaining {{convert|1500|acre|ha|abbr=off}} portion of Jamestown Island which had been under private ownership by the Vermillion family. The National Park Service partnered with Preservation Virginia to preserve the area and present it to visitors in an educational manner. On June 5, 1936, the national monument was re-designated a [[national historical park]], and became known as [[Colonial National Historical Park]].

From 1936 [[J.C. Harrington|J.C. "Pinky" Harrington]] worked on the NPS's excavations at Jamestown. In 1954 [[John L. Cotter]] took charge of field projects at Jamestown, conducted with the site's 350th anniversary (1957) in mind. Cotter worked with [[Edward B. Jelks]] and Harrington to survey the area's colonial sites. In 1957 Cotter and J. Paul Hudson co-authored [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16277/16277-h/16277-h.htm ''New Discoveries at Jamestown''].

The site gained renewed importance when in 1996 the [[Jamestown Rediscovery]] project began excavations in search of the original James Fort site, originally in preparation for the quadricentennial of Jamestown's founding. The primary goal of the archaeological campaign was to locate archaeological remains of "the first years of settlement at Jamestown, especially of the earliest fortified town; <nowiki>[and the]</nowiki> subsequent growth and development of the town".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/pubs/94reprt.html |title=1994 Interim Field Report – Jamestown Rediscovery |publisher=Apva.org |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106081545/http://www.apva.org/pubs/94reprt.html |archive-date=January 6, 2009 }}</ref>

===Jamestown Settlement===
{{main|Jamestown Settlement}}
Jamestown Settlement is a living-history park and museum located {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} from the original location of the colony and adjacent to Jamestown Island. Initially created for the celebration of the 350th anniversary in 1957, Jamestown Settlement is operated by the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, and largely sponsored by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]]. The museum complex features a reconstruction of a Powhatan village, the James Fort as it was {{circa|lk=no|1610}}–1614, and seagoing replicas of the three ships that brought the first settlers, ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]''.

==Commemorations==
With the national independence of the United States established by the end of the 18th century, Jamestown came to be looked at as a starting point. Its founding in 1607 has been regularly commemorated, with the most notable events being held every fifty years.

===200th anniversary (1807)===
The [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] of Jamestown on May 13–14, 1807, was called the Grand National Jubilee.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology">{{cite web|title=Chronology of Jamestown Commemorations|url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chronology-of-jamestown-commemorations.htm|publisher=Colonial National Historical Park (National Park Service)|accessdate=March 4, 2014|date=April 15, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208104821/http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/chronology-of-jamestown-commemorations.htm|archive-date=December 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Over 3,000 people attended the event, many arriving on vessels which anchored in the river off the island.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" />

May 13 was the opening day of the festival, which began with a procession which marched to the graveyard of the old church, where the attending bishop delivered the prayer.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> The procession then moved to the Travis mansion, where the celebrants dined and danced in the mansion that evening.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> Also during the festivities, students of the [[College of William and Mary]] gave orations. An old barn on the island was used as a temporary theater, where a company of players from Norfolk performed.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> Attending were many dignitaries, politicians, and historians. The celebration concluded on May 14 with a dinner and toast at the [[Raleigh Tavern]] in Williamsburg.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" />

===250th anniversary (1857)===
In 1857, the Jamestown society organized a celebration marking the 250th anniversary of Jamestown's founding.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> According to the Richmond ''Enquirer'', the site for the celebration was on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} on the spot where some of the colonists' houses were originally built.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> However, it is also speculated that the celebration was moved further east on the island closer to the Travis grave site, in order to avoid damaging Major [[William (Orgain) Allen|William Allen]]'s corn fields.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" />

The attendance was estimated at between 6,000 and 8,000 people.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> Sixteen large steam ships anchored offshore in the James River and were gaily decorated with streamers.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> Former US President [[John Tyler]] of nearby [[Sherwood Forest Plantation]] gave a 2½ hour speech, and there were military displays, a grand ball and fireworks.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" />

===300th anniversary (1907): Jamestown Exposition===
{{main|Jamestown Exposition}}

The 100th anniversary of the Surrender at Yorktown in 1781 had generated a new interest in the historical significance of the colonial sites of the Peninsula. Williamsburg, a sleepy but populated town of shops and homes, was still celebrating Civil War events. However, as the new century dawned, thoughts turned to the upcoming 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as [[Preservation Virginia]]) started the movement in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown to be held on the 300th anniversary in 1907.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|title='Meet us on the War Path!': 1907 Jamestown Exposition drew millions to Hampton Roads|first=Mark St John|last=Erickson|website=dailypress.com|access-date=August 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830024225/https://www.dailypress.com/history/dp-nws-jamestown-expo-1907-20170511-story.html|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

As a celebration was planned, virtually no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was believed to have been long ago swallowed by the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of [[railroad|rail travel]] before automobiles were common.

As the tricentennial of the 1607 Founding of the Jamestown neared, around 1904, despite an assumption in some quarters that Richmond would be a logical location, leaders in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at [[Sewell's Point]] near the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]]. This was about {{convert|30|mi|km}} downstream from Jamestown in a rural section of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]]. It was a site which could become accessible by both long-distance passenger railroads and local streetcar service, with considerable frontage on the harbor of Hampton Roads. This latter feature proved ideal for the naval delegations which came from points all around the world.

The [[Jamestown Exposition]] of 1907 was one of the many [[world's fairs]] and expositions that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. Held from April 26, 1907 to December 1, 1907, attendees included US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] of Germany, the Prince of Sweden, [[Mark Twain]], [[Henry H. Rogers]], and dozens of other dignitaries and famous persons. A major naval review featuring the United States' [[Great White Fleet]] was a key feature. U.S. Military officials and leaders were impressed by the location, and the Exposition site later formed the first portion of the large U.S. [[Naval Station Norfolk]] in 1918 during [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|title=Jamestown Ter-Centennial Exposition of 1907|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719221140/https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jamestown_Ter-Centennial_Exposition_of_1907|archive-date=July 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|title=Earth Station Nine|website=www.earthstation9.com|access-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921060108/http://earthstation9.com/index.html?1907_jam.htm|archive-date=September 21, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

===350th Anniversary (1957): Jamestown Festival===
[[File:Queen elizabeth and prince phillip.gif|thumb|right|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and her consort [[Prince Philip]] inspect the replica of ''Susan Constant'' at Jamestown Festival Park in [[Virginia]] on October 16, 1957]]
With America's increased access to automobiles, and with improved roads and transportation, it was feasible for the 350th anniversary celebration to be held at Jamestown itself in 1957. Although erosion had cut off the land bridge between Jamestown Island and the mainland, the isthmus was restored and new access provided by the completion of the National Park Service's [[Colonial Parkway]] which led to Williamsburg and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], the other two portions of Colonial Virginia's [[Historic Triangle]]. There were also improvements of state highways. The north landing for the popular [[Jamestown Ferry]] and a portion of [[State Route 31 (Virginia)|State Route 31]] were relocated.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" />

Major projects such were developed by non-profit, state and federal agencies. [[Jamestown Festival Park]] was established by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adjacent to the entrance to Jamestown Island. Full-sized replicas of the three ships that brought the colonists, ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', and ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'' were constructed at a shipyard in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Virginia]] and placed on display at a new dock at Jamestown, where the largest, ''Susan Constant'', could be boarded by visitors. On Jamestown Island, the reconstructed [[Jamestown Glasshouse]], the Memorial Cross and the visitors center were completed and dedicated.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> A loop road was built around the island.

Special events included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings and even an outdoor drama at [[Cape Henry, Virginia|Cape Henry]], site of the first landing of the settlers.<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> This celebration continued from April 1 to November 30 with over a million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> The highlight for many of the nearly 25,000 at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957 was the visit and speech of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and her consort, [[Prince Philip]].<ref name="COLO NPS Commemorations Chronology" /> Queen Elizabeth II loaned a copy of the [[Magna Carta]] for the exhibition. It was her first visit to the United States since assuming the throne.

The 1957 Jamestown Festival was so successful that tourists still kept coming long after the official event was completed. Jamestown became a permanent attraction of the [[Historic Triangle]], and has been visited by families, school groups, tours, and thousands of other people continuously ever since.
<!--For the 300th anniversary of the settlement in 1907, transportation considerations at the isolated location did not even bring Jamestown into serious contention as the venue for its own celebration. Instead, the [[Jamestown Exposition]] was held 25 miles away, at [[Sewell's Point]] on [[Hampton Roads]] in the former [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]].

By 1957, a lot of things had changed since 1907. During [[World War I]], the Sewell's Point site of the Jamestown Exposition had become part of the massive [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the largest Navy Base in the world. That site was unavailable.

In the 1930s, the US [[National Park Service]] (NPS) had acquired the rest of the land at Jamestown Island, and turned it over to the [[Colonial National Historical Park]]. Portions of the NPS's bucolic [[Colonial Parkway]] had been completed between [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].

For the 350th anniversary, plans were made for Jamestown to host its own celebration. In anticipation, the remaining portion of the Colonial Parkway linking Jamestown to the other two points of the [[Historic Triangle|Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia]] was rushed to completion. For vehicular access, the [[isthmus]] linking the island to the mainland was restored by the NPS as part of the Colonial Parkway project. The [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] relocated the [[Glass House Point]] landing for the [[Jamestown Ferry]] and created the [[Jamestown Festival Park]] on adjacent land to the isthmus leading to the island (or peninsula) itself. Replicas of the three ships which had brought the original colonists were built, and placed on display.

The 1957 Jamestown Festival celebration was a huge success. Among many notable events, it featured a visit by U.S. Vice-President [[Richard M. Nixon]] and a state visit by Queen [[Elizabeth II of Great Britain]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]. After 1957, tourism and interest in Jamestown became continuous, with both the state and the NPS's Colonial National Historical Park maintaining their complementary year-round attractions.-->

Early in the 21st century, new accommodations, transportation facilities and attractions were planned in preparation for the quadricentennial of the founding of Jamestown. Numerous events were promoted under the banner of [[America's 400th Anniversary]] and promoted by the Jamestown 2007 Commission. The commemoration included 18 months of statewide, national and international festivities and events, which began in April 2006 with a tour of the new replica ''Godspeed''.

In January 2007, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] held a session at Jamestown. On May 4, 2007, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] attended a ceremony commemorating the 400th anniversary of the settlement's arrivals, reprising the honor they paid in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/05/nqueen05.xml |title=Telegraph Dead Link |accessdate=April 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005150345/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F05%2F05%2Fnqueen05.xml |archive-date=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>

In addition to the Virginia State Quarter, Jamestown was also the subject of two [[United States commemorative coin]]s celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement. A [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary silver dollar|silver dollar]] and a [[Jamestown 400th Anniversary gold five dollar coin|gold five dollar coin]] were issued in 2007.

=== 2019 Commemoration ===
In 2019 Jamestown, in cooperation with [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], will hold a commemoration that marks the 400th anniversary of three landmark events in American history: the first meeting of the General Assembly, the arrival of the first Africans to English North America, and the first Thanksgiving.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyisfun.org/jamestown-settlement/2019-commemoration/|title=2019 Commemoration – History Is Fun|website=Jamestown Settlement & Yorktown Victory Center|language=en-US|access-date=August 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810013331/http://www.historyisfun.org/jamestown-settlement/2019-commemoration/|archive-date=August 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=85 photos from events in Jamestown and Richmond to commemorate 400 years of democracy in America |url=https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/photos-from-events-in-jamestown-and-richmond-to-commemorate-years/collection_bf7ec862-7750-5b1e-9ece-e7e0f8f78984.html |accessdate=July 31, 2019 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731131623/https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/photos-from-events-in-jamestown-and-richmond-to-commemorate-years/collection_bf7ec862-7750-5b1e-9ece-e7e0f8f78984.html |archive-date=July 31, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>
