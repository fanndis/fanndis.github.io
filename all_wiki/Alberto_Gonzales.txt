'''Alberto R. Gonzales''' (born August 4, 1955) is an American lawyer who served as the 79th [[United States Attorney General]], appointed in February 2005 by President [[George W. Bush]], becoming the highest-ranking [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] in [[Executive (government)|executive government]] to date.<ref name="Alberto Gonzales 2006"/> He was the first Hispanic to serve as [[White House Counsel]]. Earlier he had been Bush's General Counsel during his governorship of Texas. Gonzales had also served as [[Secretary of State of Texas]] and then as a [[Texas Supreme Court|Texas Supreme Court Justice]].

Gonzales's tenure as U.S. Attorney General was marked by controversy regarding [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|warrantless surveillance]] of U.S. citizens and the [[torture memos|legal authorization]] of [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], later generally acknowledged as constituting [[torture]], in the U.S. government's post-[[9/11]] "[[War on Terror]]". Gonzales had also presided over the [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|firings of several U.S. Attorneys]] who had refused back-channel White House directives to prosecute political enemies, allegedly causing the office of Attorney General to become improperly politicized.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/28/washington/28resign.html |accessdate=May 23, 2019 |work=The New York Times |first1=Philip |last1=Shenon |first2=David |last2=Johnston |title=A Defender of Bush's Power, Gonzales Resigns |date=August 28, 2007}}</ref> Following calls for his removal, Gonzales resigned from the office "in the best interests of the department," on August 27, 2007, effective September 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/27/AR2007082700372.html |title=The Gonzales Resignation |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |first=Dan |last=Eggen |first2=Michael A. |last2=Fletcher }}</ref><ref name="Presidential Statement">{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/08/20070827.html |title=President Bush Discusses Resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales |date=August 27, 2007 |website=[[whitehouse.gov]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 }}</ref>

In 2008, Gonzales began a mediation and consulting practice. Additionally, he taught a political science course and served as a diversity recruiter at [[Texas Tech University]]. Gonzales is currently the Dean of [[Belmont University]] College of Law, in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where he currently teaches National Security Law. He was formerly Of Counsel at a Nashville-based law firm, [[Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP]] where he advised clients on special matters, government investigations and regulatory matters. He often writes opinion pieces for national newspapers<ref>{{cite news |first=Alberto |last=Gonzales |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/08/07/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-alberto-gonzales-column/2624151/ |title=Alberto R.

==Personal life==
Gonzales was born to a Catholic family<ref name="AofAinterview"/> in [[San Antonio]], Texas, and raised in [[Humble, Texas]], a town outside of [[Houston]]. Of [[Mexican-American|Mexican]] descent, he was the second of eight children born to Maria (Rodriguez) and Pablo M. Gonzales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VDXR-H9V |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211121928/https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VDXR-H9V |archive-date=2015-02-11 |work=[[FamilySearch]] |title=Person Details for Alberto R Gonzales, "Texas, Birth Index, 1903-1997" |accessdate=May 24, 2019 }}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=May 2019}} His father, who died in 1982, was a migrant worker and then a construction worker with a second grade education. His mother worked at home raising eight children and had a sixth grade education. Gonzales and his family of ten lived in a small, two-bedroom home built by his father and uncles with no telephone and no hot running water.<ref name="Alberto Gonzales 2006"/> According to Gonzales, he is unaware whether immigration documentation exists for three of his grandparents who were born in [[Mexico]] and may have entered and resided in the United States [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegally]].<ref name="HuffingtonPost"/>

An [[honors student]] at [[Aldine Independent School District|MacArthur High School]] in unincorporated [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]], Gonzales enlisted in the [[United States Air Force]] in 1973, for a four-year term of enlistment. He served one year at a remote radar site with 100 other GIs at [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]], Alaska. He was then released from active duty to attend the USAFA Prep School after which he received an appointment to the [[United States Air Force Academy]].<ref name="gonzalesUSAFA"/> Prior to beginning his third year at the academy, which would have caused him to incur a further service obligation, he left the Academy and was released from the enlistment contract. He transferred to [[Rice University]] in Houston, where he was a resident of [[Lovett College]].<ref name="Alum Gonzales to Give Grads Send-off"/> He went on to be selected as the Charles Parkhill Scholar of Political Science and was awarded a [[bachelor's degree]] with honors in [[political science]] in 1979.<ref name="An Interview with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales"/> He then earned a [[Juris Doctor|Juris Doctor (J.D.)]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1982.

Gonzales has been married twice: he and his first wife, Diane Clemens, divorced in 1985; he and his second wife, Rebecca Turner Gonzales, have three sons.

==Early career==
Gonzales was an attorney in private practice from 1982 until 1994 with the [[Houston]] law firm [[Vinson and Elkins]], where he became a partner – one of the first Hispanic partners in its history – and where he worked primarily with corporate clients. In 1994, he was named general counsel to then-[[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]], rising to become [[Secretary of State of Texas]] in 1997 and subsequently named to the [[Texas Supreme Court]] in 1999, both appointments made by Governor Bush. Gonzales won his election bid to remain on the court in the Republican Primary in 2000, and was subsequently elected to a full six-year term on the State Supreme Court in the November 2000 general election.<ref name="tabulation"/>

==Recognition==
Gonzales has been active in the community, serving as board director or committee member for several non-profit organizations between 1985 and 1994.

In the legal sphere Gonzales provided pro bono legal services to the Host Committee for the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, acted as a board director for the State Bar of Texas from 1991 to 1994, and was board trustee of the Texas Bar Foundation from 1996 to 1999. He has received numerous professional honors, including the Presidential Citation from the [[State Bar of Texas]] in 1997 for his dedication to addressing basic legal needs of the indigent. In 1999, he was named Latino Lawyer of the Year by the [[Hispanic National Bar Association]].

Between 2002 and 2003, Gonzales was recognized as a Distinguished Alumnus of Rice University and received the Harvard Law School Association Award, John Ben Shepperd Public Leadership Institute Outstanding Texas Leader Award, United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce President's Award, League of United Latin American Citizens President's Award, the Gary L. McPherson Distinguished Alumni Award from the American Council of Young Political Leaders, the Chairman's Leadership Award from the Texas Association of Mexican American Chamber of Commerce, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund's Truinfador Award, the Hispanic Hero Award from the Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, the Good Neighbor Award from the United States-Mexican Chamber of Commerce, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Travis County, Texas Republican Party. In 2004, Gonzales was honored with the Exemplary Leader Award by the Houston American Leadership Forum and in 2005 with the Hector Barreto, Sr. Award by the Latino Coalition and with a President's Award by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.

As the son of former migrant workers, many recognized Gonzales's appointment as Attorney General of the United States as the embodiment of the [[American dream]]. His professional achievements and work in the Hispanic community earned him recognition as Hispanic American of the Year by ''[[Hispanic (magazine)|Hispanic Magazine]]'' in 2005 and one of The 25 Most Influential Hispanics in America by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''. Gonzales was inducted into the Class of 2005 in the Academy of Achievement.<ref name="achievement"/> Gonzales received the Distinguished Leadership Award in 2006 from Leadership Houston. In 2007, as he left government service, he was honored with the Director's Award from the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service.

On May 20, 2006, Houston Mayor Bill White proclaimed "Alberto R. Gonzales Day" in Houston for his contributions to the betterment of the City of Houston. Academic institutions have also recognized Gonzales's achievements. He received an Honorary Doctor of Laws in 2002 from The Catholic University of America; an Honorary Degree in Arts and Letters in 2003 from Miami-Dade Community College; an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws in 2005 from the University of District of Columbia; an Honorary Degree in Associate of Arts in 2005 from the Houston Community College System; and an Honorary Alumnus Award in 2007 from Southern Methodist University.

==Counsel to Governor Bush==
As counsel to Governor Bush, Gonzales helped advise Bush in connection with jury duty when he was called in a 1996 [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] [[drunk driving]] case. The case led to controversy during Bush's [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]] because Bush's answers to the potential juror questionnaire did not disclose Bush's own 1976 [[misdemeanor]] drunk driving [[conviction (law)|conviction]].<ref name="George W. Bush arrest record"/> Gonzales made no formal request for Bush to be excused from jury duty but raised a possible conflict of interest because as the Governor, Bush might be called upon to pardon the accused party. Gonzales's work in this case has been described as "canny lawyering".<ref name="The Outsider"/>

As Governor Bush's counsel in Texas, Gonzales also reviewed all [[clemency]] requests. A 2003 article in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, and failed to second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales's deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush.<ref name="wassdorf"/><ref name="washington"/> Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency even if he had wanted to do so in a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas [[death penalty|executed]] more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.<ref name="The Texas Clemency Memos"/><ref name="White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales's Texas Execution Memos: How They Reflect on the President, And May Affect Gonzales's Supreme Court Chances"/>

==White House Counsel==
As White House counsel, and later as Attorney General, Gonzales served president George W. Bush through a period of escalating controversy over the legality of U.S. policies in the fight against terrorism. Gonzales approved the legal framework for the administration's anti-terrorism efforts and was a reliable advocate for White House policy. He supported positions that enlarged the power of the executive and diminished protections for interrogation subjects. These rulings were vocally challenged by many scholars and human-rights advocates and were partly overturned by the courts. He resigned following sharp criticism of his handling of the firing of nine U.S. attorneys and subsequent testimony during congressional hearings.<ref name=ControversialLegacy>{{cite news |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/gonzales-leaves-a-controversial-legacy/ |date=August 28, 2007|title=Gonzales leaves a controversial legacy|first1=Michael A.|last1=Fletcher|first2=R. Jeffrey|last2=Smith|work=Seattle Times |accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Dismissal of U.S. attorneys===
{{Main|Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy}}

By law, U.S. Attorneys are appointed for a term of four years, and each U.S. Attorney serves at the pleasure of the President and is subject to removal by the President for any and no reason, so long as it is not for an illegal or improper reason.<ref name="ref"/> When Gonzales became Attorney General in 2005, he ordered a performance review of all U.S. Attorneys.<ref name="testimony"/> On December 7, 2006, seven [[United States attorney]]s were notified by the [[United States Department of Justice]] that they were being dismissed, after the [[George W. Bush administration]] sought their resignation.<ref name="Plan for Replacing Certain United States Attorneys"/> One more, [[Bud Cummins]], who had been informed of his dismissal in June 2006, announced his resignation on December 15, 2006, effective December 20, 2006, upon being notified of [[Tim Griffin]]'s appointment as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.<ref name="DOJ-Griffin-Announce-2006-12-15"/><ref name="Nat-Jnl-2007-03-10"/><ref name="house"/> In the subsequent congressional hearings and press reports, it was disclosed that additional U.S. attorneys were [[Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy|controversially dismissed without explanation]] to the dismissee in 2005 and 2006, and that at least 26 U.S. attorneys were at various times considered for dismissal.

Although U.S. attorneys can be dismissed at the discretion of the president, critics claimed that the dismissals were either motivated by desire to install attorneys more loyal to the Republican party ("loyal Bushies," in the words of [[Kyle Sampson]], Gonzales's former chief of staff) or as retribution for actions or inactions damaging to the Republican party. At least six of the eight had received positive performance reviews at the Department of Justice.<ref name="Reviews of 6 fired attorneys positive"/> However, DOJ officials Will Moschella and Monica Goodling both testified under oath that EARS evaluations are office-wide reviews, they are not reviews of the U.S. Attorneys themselves.<ref name="moschella"/><ref name=goodling /> Gonzales testified under oath that EARS evaluations do not necessarily reflect on the U.S. Attorney.<ref name="April 19, 2007 hearing"/> In other words, these reviews were not evaluations of the performance of the fired federal prosecutors.

In a press conference given on March 13, Gonzales suggested that "incomplete information, was communicated or may have been communicated to the Congress" and he accepted full responsibility.<ref name="PRNewswireTranscriptAvailability">{{cite news |url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/2007/ag_speech_070313.html |title=Transcript of Media Availability with Attorney General Alberto R.

Gonzales also asserted that was all he knew of the process, saying that "[I] was not involved in seeing any memos, was not involved in any discussions about what was going on. That's basically what I knew as the Attorney General."<ref name="PRNewswireTranscriptAvailability" />

However, Department of Justice records released on March 23 appeared to contradict some of the Attorney General's assertions, indicating that on his Nov 27 schedule "he attended an hour-long meeting at which, aides said, he approved a detailed plan for executing the purge."<ref>{{cite news|first=Lara |last=Jakes Jordan |title=White House Backs AG As Support Wanes |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/26/national/w074341D05.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624113643/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F26%2Fnational%2Fw074341D05.DTL |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |agency=Associated Press |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 26, 2007 |accessdate=September 1, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Despite insisting that he was not involved in the "deliberations" leading up to the firing of the attorneys, newly released emails also suggest that he had indeed been notified and that he had given ultimate approval.

In his [[prepared testimony]] to Congress on April 19, 2007, Gonzales insisted he left the decisions on the firings to his staff. However, [[ABC News]] obtained an internal department email showing that Gonzales urged the ouster of [[Carol Lam]], one of the fired attorneys, six months before she was asked to leave.<ref name=GreenburgApril2007>{{cite news |accessdate=September 3, 2007 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=3046651|title=Gonzales Contradicts His Own Testimony|date=April 16, 2007|author=Jan Crawford Greenburg and Ariane de Vogue|publisher=ABC News}}</ref> During actual testimony on April 19, Gonzales stated at least 71 times that he couldn't recall events related to the controversy.<ref name=JohnsonApril2007>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-04-20-gonzales-prosecutors_N.htm|title=Gonzales seeks GOP support|author=Johnson, Kevin |work=USA Today|date=April 20, 2007}}</ref>

His responses frustrated the Democrats on the committee, as well as several Republicans. One example of such frustration came in an exchange between Senator [[Jeff Sessions]] of Alabama and Gonzales regarding a November 2006 meeting. Sessions was one of the most conservative members of the Senate, and was one of the Bush Administration's staunchest allies. At the meeting, the attorney firings were purportedly discussed, but Gonzales did not remember such discussion. As reported by the Washington Post, the dialogue went as follows:

{{quote|
'''Gonzales:''' Well, Senator, putting aside the issue, of course, sometimes people's recollections are different, I have no reason to doubt Mr. Battle's testimony [about the November meeting].

'''Sessions:''' Well, I guess I'm concerned about your recollection, really, because it's not that long ago. It was an important issue. And that's troubling to me, I've got to tell you.

'''Gonzales:''' Senator, I went back and looked at my calendar for that week. I traveled to Mexico for the inauguration of the new president. We had National Meth Awareness Day. We were working on a very complicated issue relating to CFIUS.

'''GONZALES:''' And so there were a lot of other weighty issues and matters that I was dealing with that week.<ref name=CQTranscriptsApril2007>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/19/AR2007041902130_pf.html
|title=Gonzales Testifies Before Senate Panel, Part II|author=CQ Transcripts Wire |work=The Washington Post|date=April 19, 2007}}</ref>}}

Another example came when Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] of New York, who had been the first lawmaker to call for Gonzales's ouster, declined to ask his last round of questions. Instead, a visibly angry Schumer said there was no point to further questioning and reiterated his call for Gonzales to resign. By Schumer's count, Gonzales had stated "over a hundred times" that he didn't know or couldn't recall important details concerning the firings, and also didn't seem to know about the workings of his own department. Gonzales responded that the onus was on the committee to prove whether anything improper occurred. Schumer replied that Gonzales faced a higher standard, and that under this standard he had to give "a full, complete and convincing explanation" for why the eight attorneys were fired.<ref>{{YouTube|51Iezc2kIcw|Schumer 4}}</ref>

Both Democrats and Republicans were critical of Gonzales's testimony to congress, which was widely regarded as exhibiting greater loyalty to president Bush than to the truth.<ref name="ControversialLegacy"/> With increasing numbers of senators calling for him to go, Gonzales resigned as Attorney General effective September 17, 2007.<ref name="BBC-BushAllyResigns">{{cite news|title=Bush Ally Gonzales resigns post |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6965602.stm |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2007}}</ref>

The Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility commenced an investigation into the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys and issued a report in September 2008.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> The report cited serious issues of accountability removing a few of the U.S. Attorneys, but there was no finding that the nine U.S. Attorneys were removed for illegal or improper reasons. To the contrary, the report concluded that Margaret Chiara and Kevin Ryan were removed appropriately for management issues. Paul Charlton was removed for his action relating to a death penalty case and unilateral implementation of an interrogation policy. The report found Carol Lam was removed because of the Justice Department's concerns about the low number of gun and immigration prosecutions in her district. The report concluded John McKay was asked to leave because of his disagreement with the Deputy Attorney General over an information-sharing program.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> The report could not cite to a reason Dan Bogden was asked to leave, but there was no finding that anything illegal or improper occurred with his removal. The report concluded Bud Cummins was asked to leave to make room for another political appointee that he himself conceded under oath was qualified to serve as a U.S. Attorney. These findings were consistent with testimony given by Gonzales. Politics was clearly involved.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/>

The report also concluded Todd Graves was removed to settle a political dispute in Missouri, which was motivated by politics.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> The report found that it could not conclude that David Iglesias was removed for an improper reason. However, since the IG had no authority to investigate Congress or the White House, the IG asked Attorney General Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the Iglesias removal.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> This special prosecutor found no wrongdoing in the removal of David Iglesias. The DOJ IG found no criminal wrongdoing in the records.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> As the Wall Street Journal reported "the Justice Department informed Congress on Wednesday that a special investigator in the case found no evidence of wrongdoing... the investigator's final word is that no Administration official gave 'false statements' to Congress or to the DOJ Inspector General, which carried out their own investigation."<ref name="exoneration"/> In particular, the report found no evidence that Gonzales made false or misleading statements to Congress, thus clearing him of accusations of perjury.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/><ref name=Weich>{{cite web |title=Letter dated July 21, 2010 from Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich to Chairman John Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee regarding the investigation by Assistant United States Attorney Nora R.

The IG report did find that some statements made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information.<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/>{{rp|347}} He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted to set the record straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard.<ref name="April 19, 2007 hearing"/> Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." That statement was too broad. At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. Thus, my statement about "discussions" was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people."

In August 2009, White House documents released showed that Rove raised concerns directly with Gonzales and that Domenici or an intermediary may have contacted the Justice Department as early as 2005 to complain.<ref name="washingtonpost1"/> In contrast, Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007: "I don't recall... Senator Domenici ever requesting that Mr. Iglesias be removed."<ref name="washingtonpost1"/> In July 2010, Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firings were not criminal, saying "Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias. The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias."<ref name="yahoo"/>

===Right to writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. Constitution===
{{main|Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Habeas_corpus_in_the_21st_Century}}

Gonzales helped draft the January 2002 Presidential Order which authorized the use of military tribunals to try terrorist suspects. The order provided the President the power to hold any non-citizen who he deemed a terrorist, or accessory to a terrorist, in military detention and subject to trial before a military commission.<ref name=AmericanBarMilComm>{{cite news |url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/leadership/military.pdf |title=American Bar Association Task Force on Terrorism and the law report and recommendations on Military Commissions |publisher=[[American Bar Association]] |date=January 4, 2002 |accessdate=December 16, 2007 }}</ref> Subsequently the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DOD) organized military tribunals to judge charges against [[enemy combatant]] detainees being held at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. In the early years, the camp authorities did not allow foreign detainees access to attorneys, or materials supporting their charges, and the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] declared them outside the reach of due process under ''[[habeas corpus]]''. In ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that they did have rights to habeas corpus and had to be provided access to legal counsel and an opportunity to challenge their detention before an impartial tribunal. Further, in 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' that trying [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] detainees under the existing Guantanamo military commission (known also as [[Military Tribunal]]) was illegal under [[US law]], including the [[Geneva Convention]]s.<ref name=Scotus2005October>{{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-184.pdf |title=Syllabus: Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the United States]] |date=October 2005 |accessdate=December 17, 2007 }}</ref>

The president requested and Congress passed the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]].<ref name=nytimes0502>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/us/politics/02gitmo.html |title=U.S. May Revive Guantánamo Military Courts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |format=webpage |first=William |last=Glaberson}}</ref> The bill was controversial for continuing to authorize the President to designate certain people as "[[unlawful enemy combatant]]s," thus making them subject to military commissions, and depriving them of ''habeas corpus''. In ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' (2008), the US Supreme Court ruled that foreign detainees held by the United States, including those at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], did have the right of ''habeas corpus'' under the US constitution, as the US had sole authority at the Guantanamo Bay base. It held that the 2006 Military Commissions Act was an unconstitutional suspension of that right.

On January 18, 2007, Gonzales was invited to speak to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], where he shocked the committee's ranking member, [[Arlen Specter]] of [[Pennsylvania]], with statements regarding the right of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Gonzales says the Constitution doesn't guarantee habeas corpus"/> An excerpt of the exchange follows:

{{quote|
'''Gonzales:''' The fact that the Constitution—again, there is no express grant of habeas in the Constitution. There is a prohibition against taking it away. But it's never been the case, and I'm not a Supreme—

'''Specter:''' Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. The Constitution says you can't take it away, except in the case of rebellion or invasion. Doesn't that mean you have the right of habeas corpus, unless there is an invasion or rebellion?<ref name=tp_habeas />

'''Gonzales:''' I meant by that comment, the Constitution doesn't say, "Every individual in the United States or every citizen is hereby granted or assured the right to habeas." It doesn't say that. It simply says the right of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except by —<ref name=tp_habeas>{{cite news |url=https://thinkprogress.org/gonzales-there-is-no-express-grant-of-habeas-corpus-in-the-constitution-ee8f44c06161/ |title=Gonzales: 'There Is No Express Grant of Habeas Corpus In The Constitution' |work=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="Gonzales Questions 'Habeas Corpus{{'}}"/>}}

Senator Specter was referring to [[Denied powers|2nd Clause of Section 9 of Article One of the Constitution of the United States]] which reads: "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." This passage has been historically interpreted to mean that the right of habeas corpus is inherently established.<ref name="federalist-84"/> Gonzales dissents from the consensus view, siding with Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who said "[a]though the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus except during times of rebellion or invasion, this provision was probably meant to keep Congress from suspending the writ and preventing state courts from releasing individuals who were wrongfully imprisoned. The constitutional provision does not create a right to habeas corpus; rather federal statutes [do so]."<ref name="jurisdiction"/> Additionally, "the Constitutional Convention prevented Congress from obstructing the states courts' ability to grant the writ, but did not try to create a federal constitutional right to habeas corpus".<ref name="constitutional"/> "After all, if the suspension clause itself were an affirmative grant of procedural rights to those held in federal custody, there would have been little need for the first Congress to enact as it did, habeas corpus protections in the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]]." Chemerinsky's argument has been denied by Justice Paul Stevens in a 2001 opinion in an immigration case involving the issue, where Stevens touches upon what he believes the 'far more sensible view':

{{quote|The dissent reads into Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807), support for a proposition that the Chief Justice did not endorse, either explicitly or implicitly. See post, at 14—15. He did note that "the first congress of the United States" acted under "the immediate influence" of the injunction provided by the Suspension Clause when it gave "life and activity" to "this great constitutional privilege" in the Judiciary Act of 1789, and that the writ could not be suspended until after the statute was enacted. 4 Cranch, at 95. That statement, however, surely does not imply that Marshall believed the Framers had drafted a Clause that would proscribe a temporary abrogation of the writ, while permitting its permanent suspension. Indeed, Marshall's comment expresses the far more sensible view that the Clause was intended to preclude any possibility that "the privilege itself would be lost" by either the inaction or the action of Congress. See, e.g., ibid. (noting that the Founders "must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation" imposed by the Suspension Clause).<ref name="cornell"/>}}

Justice Steven's assertion is backed up by sentiments found in the [[Federalist No. 84]], which enshrines the right to petition for habeas corpus as fundamental:

{{quote|The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, to which we have no corresponding provision in our Constitution, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny."<ref name="federalist-84" />}}

The Constitution presupposes that courts in the United States will have the authority to issue the writ as they historically did at common law. See, e.g., [[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr]], 533 U.S. 289 (2001); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 666 (1996). The [[Suspension clause]] of the Constitution provides that "[t]he privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in case of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it." As some commentators have noted, "the text does not explicitly confer a right to habeas relief, but merely sets forth when the Privilege of the Writ may be suspended".<ref name="wechsler"/>

Hertling, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs</ref>

As Robert Parry writes in the Baltimore Chronicle & Sentinel:

{{quote|Applying Gonzales's reasoning, one could argue that the First Amendment doesn't explicitly say Americans have the right to worship as they choose, speak as they wish or assemble peacefully.

===Support for use of torture===
{{main|Torture Memos}}
Alberto Gonzalez was a supporter of the Bush administration's policy of torture of detainees, internally referred to as "[[Enhanced interrogation techniques]]".

In January 2002, Gonzales authored a memo that explored whether the [[Geneva Convention]] section III on the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW) applied to [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] fighters captured in [[Afghanistan]] and held in detention facilities around the world, including [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantánamo Bay]], Cuba. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing GPW protection to al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The memo concluded that certain provisions of GPW were outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters: "[The war against terrorism] is not the traditional clash between nations adhering to the laws of war that formed the backdrop for GPW. The nature of the new war places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians, and the need to try terrorists for war crimes such as wantonly killing civilians."<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/>

Gonzales later explained, "The old ways may not work here. That's what the memo was intended to convey to the President. I never meant to convey to the President that the basic values in the Geneva Convention were outdated." He noted that a British parliamentary committee visiting Guantánamo, while horrified by conditions at the base, had reached a similar conclusion when it said, "the Geneva Conventions are failing to provide necessary protection because they lack clarity and are out of date".<ref name="guantanamo"/> He argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Convention would be applied. He also expressed a concern that undefined language in Common Article III of GPW, such as "outrages upon personal dignity" and "inhuman treatment" could make officials and military leaders subject to the [[War Crimes Act of 1996]] if actions were deemed to constitute violations of the Act.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/> Attorney General John Ashcroft made a similar argument on behalf of the Justice Department by letter to the President dated February 1, 2002, writing that a presidential determination "against treaty application would provide the highest assurance that no court would subsequently entertain charges that American military officers, intelligence officials or law enforcement officials violated Geneva Convention rules relating to field conduct, detention conduct or interrogation of detainees. The War Crimes Act of 1996 makes violations of parts of the Geneva Convention a crime in the United States."<ref name="president2"/>

Gonzalez oversaw President Bush's Office of Legal Counsel on August 1, 2002, at which time the [[Office of Legal Counsel|OLC]] produced the [[Bybee memo]], a document that provided the legal framework by which previous interpretations of the [[Geneva Convention]] and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] were modified to expand Presidential authority to enable so-called "enhanced interrogation techniques".<ref name="August02TortureMemoReleased">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html |title=Previously Secret Torture Memo Released |work=[[CNN]] |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2018}}</ref>

The memo was produced in response to a specific [[CIA]] request for clarification of the standards of interrogation under U.S. law, in the specific case of [[Abu Zabaydah]], a man believed at the time to be a high-level [[al-Qaeda]] leader. In response, the Justice Department issued a classified August 1, 2002, memo<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/olc/zubaydah.pdf |title=Memorandum for John Rizzo], Acting General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency, re: Interrogation of Al-Qaeda operative |date=August 1, 2002 |work=[[Office of Legal Counsel]], [[United States Department of Justice]] }}</ref> to the CIA from Jay Bybee, the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, and an August 1, 2002, legal opinion<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/legacy/2010/08/05/memo-gonzales-aug2002.pdf |title=Memorandum for Alberto R.

===NSA domestic eavesdropping program===
{{Main|NSA warrantless surveillance controversy}}
Gonzales was an early advocate of the controversial [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on October 26, 2001. During Gonzales's tenure, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] were accused of improperly, and perhaps illegally, using the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] to uncover personal information about U.S. citizens.<ref name="usdoj"/>

In a December 2005 article<ref name="Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts"/><ref name="Eavesdropping and the Election: An Answer on the Question of Timing"/> in ''[[The New York Times]]'', it was revealed that the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) was eavesdropping on U.S. citizens without warrants in cases where (i) NSA intelligence agents had reason to believe at least one party to the call was a member of al Qaeda or a group affiliated with al Qaeda, and (ii) the call was international.<ref name="president10"/> ''The New York Times'' acknowledged that the activities had been classified, and that it had disclosed the activities over the Administration's objections. As such, Attorney General Gonzales threatened ''The Times'' with prosecution under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]],<ref name="washingtonpost"/> since knowing publication of classified information is a federal crime. Gonzales raised the possibility that ''The New York Times'' journalists could be prosecuted for publishing classified information based on the outcome of the criminal investigation underway into leaks to the ''Times'' of data about the National Security Agency's surveillance of terrorist-related calls between the United States and abroad. He said, "I understand very much the role that the press plays in our society, the protection under the First Amendment we want to protect and respect..." As for the ''Times'', he said, "As we do in every case, it's a case-by-case evaluation about what the evidence shows us, our interpretation of the law. We have an obligation to enforce the law and to prosecute those who engage in criminal activity."<ref name="washingtonpost"/>

The publication led to an investigation by the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] (OPR) over the role of Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers in giving legal advice to support various intelligence collection activities. OPR is responsible for investigating allegations of professional misconduct by DOJ attorneys. The objective of OPR is to ensure that DOJ attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the highest professional standards.

The Bush Administration and Attorney General Gonzales believed that OPR did not have the authority to investigate Gonzales's role as White House Counsel in connection with certain intelligence activities authorized by the President. In response to suggestions that Gonzales blocked the investigation or that the President blocked the investigation to protect Gonzales, Assistant Attorney General Richard Hertling informed Chairman John Conyers on March 22, 2007, that "the President made the decision not to grant the requested security clearances to" OPR staff. Judge Gonzales "was not told he was the subject or target of the OPR investigation, nor did he believe himself to be..." Judge Gonzales "did not ask the President to shut down or otherwise impede the OPR investigation". Judge Gonzales "recommended to the President that OPR be granted security clearance."<ref name="information"/>

In a letter to the Senate dated August 1, 2007, Gonzales disclosed that shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], the President authorized the NSA, under a single Presidential Authorization, to engage in a number of intelligence activities, which would later be collectively described as the "President's Surveillance Program" (PSP) by the DOJ Inspector General, [[Glenn A. Fine]].<ref name="OIG-Sept08"/> Some of these authorized activities were described as the "Terrorist Surveillance Program" (TSP) by President Bush, in an address to the nation on December 16, 2005. As the August 1 letter indicates, the dispute between the President and James Comey that led to the hospital visit was not over TSP, it concerned other classified intelligence activities that are part of PSP and have not been disclosed. He defended his authorization of the program, asserting "... if you are talking with al-Qaeda, we want to know why."{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In his letter, Gonzales wrote the Senate Judiciary Committee that he defined TSP as the program the President publicly confirmed, a program that targets communications where one party is outside the United States, and as to which the government had reason to believe at least one party to the communication is a member of al-Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist organization.<ref name="February 6, 2006 hearing"/> Indeed, prior to the 2007 letter, Gonzales provided the same definition of TSP in several public appearances<ref name="usdoj15"/><ref name="whitehouse16"/><ref name="transcripts"/><ref name="usdoj17"/> leading up to a hearing in Congress on February 6, 2006.<ref name="transcripts18"/>

In March 2004, the TSP operations, (code-named [[Stellar Wind (code name)|Stellar Wind]],<ref name="newsweek"/>) became the focal point for a dispute between the White House and then-acting-Attorney-General [[James B. Comey]], resulting in a dramatic, late-night meeting between Gonzales, Comey, the bedridden AG [[John Ashcroft]], and other DOJ officials, in a George Washington University Hospital room. According to initial statements by Gonzales, the disagreement was not over TSP; rather, he claimed it concerned other classified intelligence activities which fell under the PSP, which had not been disclosed. However, Comey contended that the incident, (which had culminated in a heated phone conversation following the hospital visit,) had indeed been over the activities comprising the TSP. Through a spokesperson, Gonzales later denied his original assertion that the dispute was over TSP, claiming that he had misspoken. The controversy over these conflicting statements led Senator Charles Schumer to request appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate if Gonzales had committed perjury.<ref name="youtube"/>

In testimony to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] on May 15, 2007, former Deputy Attorney General Comey was asked to recall the events of the evening of March 10, 2004, when, (at the behest of President Bush,<ref name="decision1"/><ref name="Bush Intervened in Dispute Over N.S.A. Eavesdropping"/>) Gonzales and Bush's then-chief-of-staff [[Andrew H. Card Jr.]] sought to bypass Comey's refusal to authorize "a particular classified program,"<ref name="testimony11"/> by appealing to the ailing John Ashcroft in a visit to his hospital bedside, as he recovered from surgery for [[pancreatitis]]. According to Comey, he had consulted with AG Ashcroft prior to his hospitalization and, (though Ashcroft had previously signed off on the program many times in previous years,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}) the two of them came to agree that there had arisen legitimate concerns, which interfered with the ability of the Attorney General's office, "to certify (the program's) legality, which was our obligation for the program to be renewed."<ref name="testimony11"/> More than a week later, Comey continued, Ashcroft had become extremely ill and his wife had forbidden any visitors to his hospital room, so when he and the other officials met at his bedside on March 10, he was very concerned about General Ashcroft's ability to think clearly about the issue at hand.

{{quote|In walked Mr. Gonzales, carrying an envelope, and Mr. Card. They came over and stood by the bed. They greeted the attorney general very briefly, and then Mr. Gonzales began to discuss why they were there, to seek his approval... I was very upset. I was angry. I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man, who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me.<ref name="Gonzales faces"/>}}

Later testimony from Gonzales and others confirmed that Ashcroft did not seem disoriented, but in fact seemed lucid enough to describe to Card and Gonzales, in great detail, the basis of the Department's legal arguments, and even to complain about clearance decisions by the President relative to the TSP.

Comey also testified that there was significant dissent among top law enforcement officers over the program, although he did not specifically identify it in the hearing. Moreover, in light of the incident at the hospital, "top Justice Department officials were prepared to resign over it."<ref name="Gonzales faces"/>

[[Jack Goldsmith]], the former head of the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], corroborates many of the details of Comey's Senate testimony regarding the March 10, 2004, hospital room visit, in a preview of his book "The Terror Presidency" which was to be published in Fall 2007. In the September 9, 2007, issue of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' Jeffrey Rosen reports on an extended interview he had with Goldsmith, who was also in the hospital room that night.<ref name="Conscience of a Conservative"/>

{{quote|As he recalled it to me, Goldsmith received a call in the evening from his deputy, Philbin, telling him to go to the George Washington University Hospital immediately, since Gonzales and Card were on the way there. Goldsmith raced to the hospital, double-parked outside and walked into a dark room. Ashcroft lay with a bright light shining on him and tubes and wires coming out of his body.

Suddenly, Gonzales and Card came in the room and announced that they were there in connection with the classified program. "Ashcroft, who looked like he was near death, sort of puffed up his chest," Goldsmith recalls. "All of a sudden, energy and color came into his face, and he said that he didn't appreciate them coming to visit him under those circumstances, that he had concerns about the matter they were asking about and that, in any event, he wasn't the attorney general at the moment; Jim Comey was. He actually gave a two-minute speech, and I was sure at the end of it he was going to die. It was the most amazing scene I've ever witnessed."

After a bit of silence, Goldsmith told me, Gonzales thanked Ashcroft, and he and Card walked out of the room. "At that moment," Goldsmith recalled, "Mrs. Ashcroft, who obviously couldn't believe what she saw happening to her sick husband, looked at Gonzales and Card as they walked out of the room and stuck her tongue out at them. She had no idea what we were discussing, but this sweet-looking woman sticking out her tongue was the ultimate expression of disapproval. It captured the feeling in the room perfectly."}}

Comey also testified that Ashcroft "expressed himself in very strong terms."<ref name="testimony11"/> Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke at length about the legal issue. "Attorney General Ashcroft... [gave] a couple of minutes' speech in which he said that he.... shared the Justice department's concerns."<ref name="goldsmith"/> Although he was not present for the conversation between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director [[Robert Mueller|Bob Mueller]] testified, "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed."<ref name="Text: F.B.I.

And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision."<ref name="July 24, 2007 hearing"/> In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. When we got there, I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.<ref name="July 24, 2007 hearing"/>
During the July 24 hearing, Gonzales's testimony lasted for almost four hours before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]. He appeared to contradict the earlier statements made by James Comey regarding the hospital room meeting with [[John Ashcroft]].

{{quote|Mr. Comey's testimony about the hospital visit was about other intelligence activities—disagreement over other intelligence activities. That's how we'd clarify it.<ref name="Gonzales faces"/>}}

Through his testimony before Congress on issues ranging from the Patriot Act to U.S. Attorney firings, he commonly admitted ignorance.<ref name="Hardly Working: How Alberto Gonzales's incompetence became a defense for his wrongdoing"/> The response to Gonzales's testimony by those Senators serving on both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees was one of disbelief. [[Russ Feingold]], who is a member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said, "I believe your testimony is misleading at best," which [[Sheldon Whitehouse]]—also a member of both committees—concurred with, saying, "I have exactly the same perception." [[Chuck Schumer]] said Gonzales was "not being straightforward" with the committee. Judiciary Committee Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] said, "I just don't trust you," and urged Gonzales to carefully review his testimony. The ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, [[Arlen Specter]], said to Gonzales, "Your credibility has been breached to the point of being actionable." Leahy and Specter's comments were interpreted as warnings that Gonzales might have been perjuring himself. After the meeting, Intelligence Committee Chairman [[Jay Rockefeller]] said Gonzales was being "untruthful." Rockefeller's sentiments were echoed by [[Jane Harman]], a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who accused Gonzales of "selectively declassifying information to defend his own conduct."<ref name="Gonzales Denies Improper Pressure on Ashcroft"/>

On July 26, 2007, the [[Associated Press]] obtained a four-page memorandum from the office of former [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[John D. Negroponte]] dated May 17, 2006, which appeared to contradict Gonzales's testimony the previous day regarding the subject of a March 10, 2004 emergency Congressional briefing which preceded his hospital room meeting with former Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], [[James B. Comey]] and former White House Chief of Staff [[Andrew H. Card Jr.]].<ref name="nytimes"/> However, there is no contradiction as the July 1, 2009 IG report confirms.<ref name="OIG-July09"/> Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the President authorized a number of intelligence activities reported by the IG on the President's Surveillance Program (PSP). One set of activities were TSP, but the dispute was about certain of the Other Intelligence Activities. The IG report is clear on p.&nbsp;37 that the TSP "was not the subject of the hospital room confrontation or the threatened resignations." P. 36 of the Inspector General report goes on to say that the White House had a major disagreement related to PSP.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>{{rp|36}} The dispute which resulted in the visit to Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital room by Gonzales and Card and brought several senior DOJ and FBI officials to the brink of resignation-concerned certain of the Other Intelligence Activities that were different from the communications interception activities that the President later publicly acknowledged as the TSP, but that had been implemented through the same President Authorizations.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>{{rp|36}}

On that same day, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) Director [[Robert S.

Rep. [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX) asked Mueller "Did you have an opportunity to talk to General Ashcroft, or did he discuss what was discussed in the meeting with Attorney General Gonzales and the chief of staff?" He replied "I did have a brief discussion with Attorney General Ashcroft." Lee went on to ask "I guess we use [the phrase] TSP [Terrorist Surveillance Program], we use warrantless wiretapping. So would I be comfortable in saying that those were the items that were part of the discussion?" He responded "It was—the discussion was on a national—an NSA program that has been much discussed, yes."<ref name="Gonzales faces"/>

On Thursday, August 16, 2007, the [[House Judiciary Committee]] released the heavily redacted notes<ref name="Text: F.B.I. Director's Notes"/> of FBI Director [[Robert S.

On Wednesday, June 27, 2007, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] issued subpoenas to the [[United States Department of Justice]], the White House, and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] seeking internal documents regarding the program's legality and details of the NSA's cooperative agreements with private telecommunications corporations.

On July 27, 2007, both [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] and White House spokeswoman [[Dana Perino]] defended Gonzales's [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] testimony regarding the events of March 10, 2004, saying that it did not contradict the sworn [[House Judiciary Committee]] account of FBI director [[Robert S. Mueller III]], because Gonzales had been constrained in what he could say because there was a danger he would divulge classified material.<ref name="White House Backs Gonzales on Testimony"/> Lee Casey, a former Justice Department lawyer during the [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] administrations, told [[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]] that it is likely that the apparent discrepancy can be traced to the fact that there are two separate Domestic Surveillance programs. "The program that was leaked in December 2005 is the Comey program. It is not the program that was discussed in the evening when they went to Attorney General Ashcroft's hospital room. That program we know almost nothing about. We can speculate about it. ...The program about which he said there was no dispute is a program that was created after the original program died, when Mr. Comey refused to reauthorize it, in March 2004. Mr. Comey then essentially redid the program to suit his legal concerns. And about that program, there was no dispute. There was clearly a dispute about the earlier form or version of the program. The attorney general has not talked about that program. He refers to it as "other intelligence activities" because it is, in fact, still classified."<ref name="Gonzales faces"/>

On Tuesday, August 28, 2007—one day after Gonzales announced his resignation as Attorney General effective September 17—[[Senate Judiciary Committee]] chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] indicated that it would not affect ongoing investigations by his committee. "I intend to get answers to these questions no matter how long it takes," Leahy said, suggesting that Gonzales could face subpoenas from the committee for testimony or evidence long after leaving the administration. "You'll notice that we've had people subpoenaed even though they've resigned from the White House," Leahy said, referring to [[Harriet E. Miers]], the former White House counsel, and [[Karl Rove]], who resigned in August 2007 as the president's top political aide. "They're still under subpoena. They still face contempt if they don't appear."<ref name="Democrats Say They Will Press Gonzales Inquiries"/> Gonzales testified voluntarily to Congress and provided interviews to the Inspector General on numerous occasions. He ordered full cooperation by all Department of Justice employees with ongoing investigations.

On Thursday, August 30, 2007, Justice Department [[Inspector General]] [[Glenn A. Fine]] disclosed in a letter to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] that as part of a previously ongoing investigation, his office is looking into whether Gonzales made statements to Congress that were "intentionally false, misleading, or inappropriate," both about the firing of federal prosecutors and about the terrorist-surveillance program, as committee chairman Patrick Leahy had asked him to do in an August 16, 2007 letter. Fine's letter to Leahy said that his office "has ongoing investigations that relate to most of the subjects addressed by the attorney general's testimony that you identified." Fine said that his office is conducting a particular review "relating to the terrorist-surveillance program, as well as a follow-up review of the use of [[national security letter]]s," which investigators use to obtain information on e-mail messages, telephone calls and other records from private companies without court approval.<ref name="Testimony by Gonzales Is Subject of Inquiry"/> Fine concluded his investigation and found that Gonzales did not intend to mislead Congress.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>

It has been reported that a person involved in the incident of March 10, 2004 hospital room meeting with [[John Ashcroft]] has said that much of the confusion and conflicting testimony that occurred about intelligence activities was because certain programs were so classified that they were impossible to speak about clearly.<ref name="The Outsider"/> The [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Department of Justice Inspector General]] recognized that Gonzales was in the difficult position of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a highly classified program in an open forum.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>

===Objectivity===
Gonzales has had a long relationship with former president George W. Bush. Gonzales served as a general counsel when Bush was the governor of Texas. Such relationship made critics question whether he would maintain independence in his administration of the U.S. Department of Justice.<ref name="Gonzales, Bush Go Back a Long Way"/><ref name="Gonzales explains bedside meeting with ailing Ashcroft"/> Gonzales has been called Bush's "[[wikt:yes man|yes man]]." Even though the advice given by Gonzales was based and supported by other lawyers, specifically the Department of Justice, charged by statute to provide legal advice to the President, critics claim that Gonzales gave only the legal advice Bush wanted. Critics questioned Gonzales's ethics and professional conduct.<ref name="rapped"/><ref name="Part I: Alberto Gonzales: A Willing Accessory at Justice"/>

"To his backers, Gonzales is a quiet, hardworking attorney general notable for his open management style and his commitment to the administration of justice and to the war on terrorism."<ref name="national2006"/>

One publication reported, "Gonzales contends that his friendship with Bush makes him a better advocate for the rule of law within the executive branch." My responsibilities is to ensure that the laws are enforced, that everyone in the country receives justice under the law—independent of my relationship with the White House, independent of my relationship with the President of the United States," he told National Journal.<ref name="national2006"/> However, another report states that Gonzales has "a long history of dogged obedience to the President, which often has come at the cost of institutional independence and adherence to the rule of law."<ref name="Part I: Alberto Gonzales: A Willing Accessory at Justice"/>

===Executive Order 13233===
[[Executive Order 13233]], drafted by Gonzales and issued by President George W. Bush on November 1, 2001, shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], attempted to place limitations on the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] by restricting access to the records of former presidents. The order asserted the President's power to delay the release of presidential records longer than the congressionally mandated period of 12 years after the president leaves office. Executive Order 13233 revoked President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Executive Order 12667]] on the same subject and had the effect of delaying the release of Reagan's papers, which were due to be made public when Bush took office in 2001. While the policy was being drawn up, Gonzales as Counsel to the President issued a series of orders to the U.S. Archivist to delay the release of Reagan's records.<ref name="WHmemo"/> This order was the subject of a number of lawsuits and Congressional attempts to overturn it. In 2007, a D.C. district court ordered the Archivist not to obey this order, finding it to be "arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act."<ref name="Opinion of the D.C. District Court"/> On January 21, 2009 (his first day in office), President [[Barack Obama]] revoked Executive Order 13233 by issuing {{Executive Order|13489}}, with wording largely matching Reagan's Executive Order 12667.

===Energy Task Force secrecy===
Gonzales fought with Congress to keep Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s [[Energy Task Force]] documents from being reviewed. His arguments were ultimately upheld by courts. On July 2, 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Vice President, but remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit. On May 11, 2005, the D.C. Circuit threw out the lawsuit and ruled the Vice President was free to meet in private with energy industry representatives in 2001 while drawing up the President's energy policy.<ref name="angeles"/>

==Attorney general==
[[File:George W Bush and Alberto Gonzales.jpg|thumb|left|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] announces his nomination of Gonzales to succeed Ashcroft as the next Attorney General during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room Wednesday, November 10, 2004.]]

Gonzales's name was sometimes floated as a possible nominee to the [[United States Supreme Court]] during Bush's first presidential term. On November 10, 2004, it was announced that he would be nominated to replace [[United States Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] for Bush's second term. Gonzales was regarded as a moderate compared to Ashcroft because he was not seen as opposing abortion or [[affirmative action]]. Although he has never stated publicly his support for abortion and later as Attorney General, was the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case [[Gonzales v. Carhart]], which reinforced the ban on late-term abortion that was previously overturned, and had stated publicly his opposition to racial quotas, some people assumed Gonzales did not oppose abortion or affirmative action. According to a Texas Monthly article, Gonzales has never said he was pro-choice and he has publicly opposed racial quotas.<ref name="The Outsider"/>

The perceived departure from some conservative viewpoints elicited strong opposition to Gonzales that started during his [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation proceedings at the beginning of President Bush's second term. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted anonymous Republican officials as saying that Gonzales's appointment to Attorney General was a way to "bolster Mr. Gonzales's credentials" en route to a later Supreme Court appointment.<ref name="Choice of Gonzales May Blaze a Trail for the High Court"/>

Gonzales enjoyed broad bipartisan support in connection with his nomination, including the support of former Democratic HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Colorado Democratic Senator Ken Salazar. One writer noted, "A senator from Pennsylvania said, 'I have always found him [Alberto Gonzales] to be completely forthright, brutally honest – in some cases telling me things I did not want to hear but always forthright, always honest, sincere, serious. This is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been given to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds very carefully and gently in his hands.' Said another senator, this one from Kentucky, 'Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial barriers to success. A man or woman can climb to any height that his or her talents can take them. For Judge Gonzales, that is a very high altitude indeed. And luckily for his country, he is not quite finished climbing yet.{{'"}}<ref name="Alberto Gonzales 2006"/>
The nomination was approved on February 3, 2005, with the confirming vote largely split along party lines 60–36 (54 Republicans and 6 Democrats in favor, and 36 Democrats against, along with 4 abstentions: 3 Democrat and 1 Republican).<ref name="On the Nomination (Confirmation Alberto R. Gonzales to be Attorney General)"/>
He was sworn in on February 3, 2005.

==Speculation over a Supreme Court nomination==
Shortly before the July 1, 2005 retirement announcement of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], rumors started circulating that a memo had leaked from the White House stating that upon the retirement of either O'Connor or [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[William Rehnquist]], that Gonzales would be the first [[George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates|nominee for a vacancy on the Court]].

Quickly, conservative stalwarts<ref name="pfaw"/> such as ''[[National Review]]'' magazine<ref name="No to Justice Gonzales"/> and [[Focus on the Family]], among other socially conservative groups, stated they would oppose a Gonzales nomination.<ref name="The Holy War Begins: Bush must choose between the big tent or the revival tent"/>

Much of their opposition to Gonzales was based on his perceived support of [[abortion rights]] as a result of one vote on a single case before the Texas Supreme Court, In re Jane Doe 5 (43 Tex. Sup. J.910).

In a series of cases before the Texas Supreme Court in 2000, the court was asked to construe for the first time the 1999 Texas parental notification law forbidding a physician from performing an abortion on a pregnant, unaccompanied minor without giving notice to the minor's parents at least 48 hours before the procedure. However, Texas legislators adopted a policy to create a judicial bypass exception in those cases where (1) the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without notification to either of her parents; (2) notification will not be in the best interest of the minor or (3) notification may lead to physical, sexual or emotional abuse of the minor. The court was asked in these cases to discern legislative intent for the first time to these subjective standards, presumably included in the law as a matter of Texas policy and to make the law constitutional under U.S. Supreme Court precedents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the seven parental notification decisions rendered by the court, Gonzales voted to grant one bypass. For ''In re Jane Doe 5'' his concurring opinion began with the sentence, "I fully join in the Court's judgment and opinion." He went on, though, to address the three dissenting opinions, primarily one by [[Nathan Hecht|Nathan L. Hecht]] alleging that the court majority's members had disregarded legislative intent in favor of their personal ideologies. Gonzales's opinion dealt mostly with how to establish legislative intent. He wrote, "We take the words of the statute as the surest guide to legislative intent. Once we discern the Legislature's intent we must put it into effect, even if we ourselves might have made different policy choices." He added, "[T]o construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an unconscionable act of [[judicial activism]]," and "While the ramifications of such a law and the results of the Court's decision here may be personally troubling to me as a parent, it is my obligation as a judge to impartially apply the laws of this state without imposing my moral view on the decisions of the Legislature."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Political commentators had suggested that Bush forecast the selection of Gonzales with his comments defending the Attorney General made on July 6, 2005, in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. Bush stated, "I don't like it when a friend gets criticized. I'm loyal to my friends. All of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire. And so, do I like it? No, I don't like it, at all." However, this speculation proved to be incorrect, as Bush nominated [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] Judge [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] to the Supreme Court.

After the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] on September 3, 2005, creating another vacancy, speculation resumed that President [[George W. Bush]] might nominate Gonzales to the Court. This again proved to be incorrect, as Bush decided to nominate Roberts to the Chief Justice position, and on October 3, 2005, nominated [[Harriet Miers]] as Associate Justice, to replace Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. On October 27, 2005, Miers withdrew her nomination, again renewing speculation about a possible Gonzales nomination. This was laid to rest when Judge [[Samuel Alito]] received the nomination and subsequent confirmation.
{{wikiquote}}
On September 11, 2005, [[U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] chairman [[Arlen Specter]] was quoted as saying that it was "a little too soon" after Gonzales's appointment as Attorney General for him to be appointed to another position, and that such an appointment would require a new series of confirmation hearings. "He [Gonzales] is attacked a lot," observes Larry Sabato, a political analyst and the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, who adds that the serious political spats "virtually eliminated him from the Supreme Court chase."<ref name="hispanic3"/>

A number of members of both houses of Congress publicly said Gonzales should resign, or be fired by Bush. Calls for his ousting intensified after his testimony on April 19, 2007. But the President gave Gonzales a strong vote of confidence saying, "This is an honest, honorable man, in whom I have confidence." The President said that Gonzales's testimony "increased my confidence" in his ability to lead the Justice Department. Separately, a White House spokeswoman said, "He's staying".<ref name="hunt"/>

===Announcement===
[[File:20070826 Bush Gonzales.jpg|thumb|Gonzales and his wife Rebecca, with [[George W. Bush]] and [[Laura Bush]] at the [[Prairie Chapel Ranch]] on August 26, 2007, the day that Gonzales's resignation was accepted.]]
On August 26, 2007, Gonzales submitted his resignation as Attorney General with an effective date of September 17, 2007.<ref name="BBC-BushAllyResigns"/> In a statement on August 27, Gonzales thanked the President for the opportunity to be of service to his country, giving no indication of either the reasons for his resignation or his future plans. Later that day, President Bush praised Gonzales for his service, reciting the numerous positions in Texas government, and later, the government of the United States, to which Bush had appointed Gonzales. Bush attributed the resignation to Gonzales's name having been "dragged through the mud" for "political reasons".<ref name="BBC-BushAllyResigns" /> Senators Schumer (D-NY), Feinstein (D-CA), and Specter (R-PA) replied that the resignation was entirely attributable to the excessive politicization of the Attorney General's office by Gonzales, whose credibility with Congress, they asserted, was nonexistent.

===Successor===
On September 17, 2007, President Bush announced the nomination of ex-Judge [[Michael B. Mukasey]] to serve as Gonzales's successor. Bush also announced a revised appointment for acting Attorney General: [[Paul Clement]] served for 24 hours and returned to his position as [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]]; the departing Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division, [[Peter Keisler]] was persuaded to stay on, and was appointed acting Attorney General effective September 18, 2007.<ref name="WPost-Eggen-2007-09-19"/>

==Post-resignation==

===Investigations===
Soon after departure from the DOJ in September 2007, continuing inquiries by Congress and the Justice Department led Gonzales to hire a criminal-defense lawyer [[George J. Terwilliger III]], partner at [[White & Case]], and former deputy attorney general under former president [[George H. W. Bush]]. Terwiliger was on the Republican law team involved in Florida presidential election recount battle of 2000.<ref name='Newsweek-Isikoff-=2007-10-10'>{{cite news |first= Michael | last= Isikoff |author2=Mark Josenball | title= Gonzales Hires a Top Gun: Still under investigation by Congress and Justice Department lawyers who once worked for him, the former attorney general has turned to a leading Washington attorney to help him beat the rap |date=October 10, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21224607/site/newsweek/page/0/ | work = Newsweek | accessdate =October 13, 2007 |url-status= dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012024820/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21224607/site/newsweek/page/0/ |archivedate = October 12, 2007}}</ref>

On October 19, 2007, [[John McKay (attorney)|John McKay]], the former [[United States District Court for the Western District of Washington|U.S. Attorney for Washington's Western District]], told [[The Spokesman-Review|''The (Spokane) Spokesman-Review'']] that [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Inspector General]] [[Glenn A. Fine]] may recommend criminal charges against Gonzales.<ref name="spokesmanreview"/> The Inspector General did not recommend criminal charges against Gonzales. To the contrary, the Inspector General found no criminal wrongdoing and no perjury.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>

On November 15, 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that supporters of Gonzales had created a trust fund to help pay for his legal expenses, which were mounting as the Justice Department Inspector General's office continued to investigate whether Gonzales committed perjury or improperly tampered with a congressional witness.<ref name="Gonzales Defense Fund Set Up - Former Attorney General's Legal Fees Mount in Probe"/> The Inspector General determined that Gonzales did not commit perjury or improperly tamper with a congressional witness.<ref name="OIG-July09"/>

In July 2008, the DOJ-OIG issued a report investigating improperly politicized hirings by the Attorney General's office.<ref name=OIG-July08>{{cite web |url=https://oig.justice.gov/special/s0807/final.pdf |title=An Investigation of Allegations of Politicized Hiring by Monica Goodling and Other Staff in the Office of the Attorney General |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |work=[[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]] |date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 20, 2018 }}</ref>

On September 2, 2008, the Inspector General found that Gonzales had stored classified documents in an insecure fashion, at his home and insufficiently secure safes at work.<ref name="nina" /> The Inspector General investigation found no evidence showing that there was any unauthorized disclosure of classified information resulting from his mishandling and storage of the materials in question, and the IG did not make a referral to the National Security Division for violation of a criminal statute.<ref name="investigation32"/>

Some members of Congress criticized Gonzales for selectively declassifying some of this information for political purposes.<ref name="nina"/> The Justice Department declined to press criminal charges.<ref name="nina" />

===Later career===

In April 2008, ''The New York Times'' reported that Gonzales was having difficulty securing a new job, unusual for a former Attorney General.<ref name="NYTimes-2008-04-13-Lewis">{{cite news |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |title=In Searching for New Job, Gonzales Sees No Takers |date=April 13, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/13/washington/13gonzales.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=April 16, 2008 }}</ref> Gonzales had a mediation and consulting practice in Austin, TX and taught at Texas Tech beginning in 2009.

Gonzales gave an interview to ''The Wall Street Journal'' on December 31, 2008, in which he discussed the effect that controversies in his Bush Administration roles had had on his career and public perception.<ref name="wsj"/><ref name="Daily News"/> He stated:

{{quote|For some reason, I am portrayed as the one who is evil in formulating policies that people disagree with. I consider myself a casualty, one of the many casualties of the war on terror.<ref name="Daily News" /><ref name="WSJ08"/>}}

Since leaving public office he has appeared on a number of television and radio news shows, including ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer]]'', to discuss the nomination of [[Sonia Sotomayor]] to the U.S. Supreme Court,<ref name="situation"/> ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to discuss the challenges of immigration,<ref name="larry"/> and ''[[Geraldo at Large]]'' to discuss terrorism related issues.<ref name="december"/> He has given numerous radio interviews on shows such as [[NPR]]'s ''[[Tell Me More]]'', covering such topics as Guantanamo Bay and Supreme Court nominations.<ref name="tellmemore">{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/tellmemore/2009/01/alberto_gonzales_defends_his_t.html |work=[[Tell Me More]], [[NPR]] |date=January 26, 2009 |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |first=Douglas |last=Hopper |title=Alberto Gonzales Defends His Tenure }}</ref> Additionally, he has written opinion pieces for ''The Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times'', and ''USA Today'', covering issues ranging from immigration to sexual predators.<ref name="immigration35"/><ref name=latinofactor /><ref name=protect /> He stated an intention to write a book about his roles, with the intention of publishing the book "for my sons, so at least they know the story." No publishing company had agreed to promote the book at the time of the interview.<ref name=WSJ08/>

Gonzales was featured in the 2008 [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]].''<ref name="IMDb"/> A biography of Gonzales and his controversial public life, "The President's Counselor: The Rise to Power of Alberto Gonzales," was written in 2006 by presidential biographer and historian [[Bill Minutaglio]].

===Texas Tech University===

In 2009, [[Texas Tech University System]] hired Gonzales. He acted as the diversity recruiter for both [[Texas Tech University]] and [[Angelo State University]].<ref name="Controversial former U.S. Attorney General hired at Texas Tech"/> Additionally, at Texas Tech, he taught a political science "special topics" course dealing with contemporary issues in the executive branch,<ref name="Former AG Gonzales to teach at Texas Tech"/> and a graduate level course to students pursuing a master's degree in public administration. He began the new job on August 1, 2009.<ref name="Alberto Gonzales Brings Expertise, Experience to Texas Tech"/> After the announcement, more than 40 professors at Texas Tech signed a petition opposing the hiring.<ref name="Inside Higher Ed - Texas Tech Profs Oppose Hiring of Alberto Gonzales"/> Texas Tech Chancellor [[Kent Hance]] said Gonzales has generated interest in the University by recruiting outside of Lubbock and through his reputation in the news. "I had a young man come up to me Monday in a restaurant and he said, "I'm in Judge Gonzales's class, and it's the best class I've ever taken. Thank you for providing him to the community." Hance said.<ref name="professorship"/>

===Grand jury indictment===
In November 2008 Gonzales was indicted by a grand jury in Willacy County in Texas. He was accused of stopping an investigation into abuses at the [[Willacy Detention Center]], a federal detention center. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and other elected officials were also indicted.<ref name="hc420"/> A judge dismissed the indictments and chastised the Willacy County district attorney, Juan Angel Gonzales, who brought the case.<ref name="lat420"/> The district attorney himself had been under indictment for more than a year and a half before the judge dismissed the indictment. The district attorney left office after losing in a Democratic primary in March 2008.<ref name="hc420"/> All charges were dropped after further investigation.<ref name="lat420"/>

===International investigation===
On November 14, 2006, invoking [[universal jurisdiction]], legal proceedings were started in Germany against Gonzales for his alleged involvement under the [[command responsibility]] of prisoner abuse by writing the controversial legal opinions.<ref name="Text of criminal complaint"/>
On April 27, 2007, Germany's Federal Prosecutor announced she would not proceed with an investigation. In November 2007, the plaintiffs appealed the decision. On April 21, 2009, the Stuttgart Regional Appeals Court dismissed the appeal.

On March 28, 2009, a Spanish court, headed by [[Baltasar Garzón]], the judge who ordered the arrest of former Chilean President [[Augusto Pinochet]], announced it would begin an investigation into whether or not Gonzales, and five other former Bush Justice and Defense officials violated international law by providing the Bush Administration a legal framework and basis for the torture of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Garzón said that it was "highly probable" the matter would go to court and that arrest warrants would be issued. Also named in the Spanish court's investigation are [[John Yoo]], [[Douglas Feith]], [[William Haynes II]], [[Jay Bybee]], and [[David Addington]].<ref name="NYTimes2009-03-28"/><ref name="Reuters2009-03-28"/> In April 2010, on the advice of the Spanish Attorney General [[Cándido Conde-Pumpido]], who believes that an American tribunal should judge the case (or dismiss it) before a Spanish Court ever thinks about becoming involved, prosecutors recommended that Judge Garzon should drop his investigation. As CNN reported, Mr. Conde-Pumpido told reporters that Judge Garzon's plan threatened to turn the court "into a toy in the hands of people who are trying to do a political action".<ref name="worthington"/>
