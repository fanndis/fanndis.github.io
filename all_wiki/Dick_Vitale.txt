'''Richard John "Dick" Vitale''' ({{IPAc-en|v|aɪ|ˈ|t|æ|l}}; born June 9, 1939), also known as "'''Dickie V'''", is an American [[basketball]] [[sportscaster]]. A former head coach in the college and professional ranks, he is well known for his 40-year tenure as a college basketball broadcaster for [[ESPN]]. He is known for catchphrases such as "This is awesome, baby!" and "diaper dandy" (outstanding freshman player), as well as enthusiastic and colorful remarks he makes during games. He has also written nine books, and appeared in several films.

==Early life==
Vitale was born in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], and grew up in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. His father, John, was a piece work clothing press operator and had a second job as a security guard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/71/Dick-Vitale.html|title=Dick Vitale Biography (1939–)}}</ref> His mom, Mae, worked in a factory as a seamstress and sewed coats until she suffered a stroke.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/dickvitale/news/story?id=3566939&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab7pos1|title=Hall call is simply awesome|last=Vitale|first=Dick|date=September 6, 2008|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> In kindergarten, Vitale lost the vision in his left eye due to an accident with a pencil.
Vitale graduated from [[East Rutherford High School]], and in 1963, he graduated from [[Seton Hall University]] with a bachelor of science degree in business administration. He later earned a master's degree in education from [[William Paterson University]].

==Coaching==

===High school coaching===
Vitale took his first job as a coach at an elementary school in [[Garfield, New Jersey]] in 1958.  Eventually he moved up to the high school level to become head coach at [[Garfield High School (New Jersey)|Garfield High School]] for one season, and then at [[East Rutherford High School]] (his [[alma mater]]), where he had a record of 131–47 from 1964 to 1971 and led his teams to two New Jersey state championships.<ref>Moran, Malcolm. [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/01/archives/dick-vitale-frustrated-but-still-trying.html "Dick Vitale: Frustrated But Still"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 1, 1979. Accessed January 9, 2018. "He won two New Jersey state championships at East Rutherford High School, and had a career record of 131‐47."</ref>

===College coaching===
In 1971, Vitale moved to [[Rutgers University]] as an assistant coach under head coach Dick Lloyd. After two seasons there, he was hired in 1973 by the [[University of Detroit Mercy|University of Detroit]] to become its head coach. Vitale took [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|Detroit]] to the 32-team NCAA tournament in [[1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]]. Vitale had a 78–30 record during his tenure at Detroit, which included a 21-game winning streak during the 1977 season. During that streak the Titans defeated the eventual champion [[1976–77 Marquette Warriors men's basketball team|Marquette]], [[UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena|on the road]], in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. Following the 1977 season, his fourth as Detroit head coach, Vitale was named the university's [[athletic director]].

===NBA coaching===
Vitale coached the [[Detroit Pistons]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] for the 1978–79 season, leading them to a 30–52 (.366) record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pistons Coaching Records |url=http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/alltime_coaching_records.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202135250/http://www.nba.com/pistons/history/alltime_coaching_records.html |archivedate=2009-12-02 }}</ref> On November 8, 1979, Pistons owner [[Bill Davidson (businessman)|Bill Davidson]] came to Vitale's house and told him that the Pistons were making a coaching change. It was twelve games into the 1979–80 season, after the Pistons struggled to a 4–8 start. The primary reason for Vitale's downfall with the Pistons was the maneuver that brought [[Bob McAdoo]] to Detroit. [[M.L. Carr]]'s decision to sign with [[Boston Celtics|Boston]] as a free agent in 1979 spawned a transaction in which the Pistons, entitled to compensation for Carr, demanded Bob McAdoo, whom the Celtics were looking to unload due to injuries. The Pistons sent two 1980 first-round draft picks (in addition to Carr) to the Celtics in exchange for McAdoo in a combination free agent signing/trade. The Pistons would have the worst season in franchise history in 1979–80, and their pick would become the first overall pick in the [[1980 NBA Draft|1980 draft]]. Boston then traded the two picks to the [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] (who selected [[Joe Barry Carroll]] with the #1 pick and [[Rickey Brown]] with the #13 pick) in exchange for [[Robert Parish]] and the #3 pick ([[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]).

==Personal life==

Vitale married Lorraine McGrath in 1971.  The couple have two daughters, Terri and Sherri,<ref>{{cite web |title=To honor of Dick Vitale’s 80th birthday, here’s eight things to know about ‘Dickie V’ |url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/2019/06/07/to-honor-of-dick-vitales-80th-birthday-heres-eight-things-to-know-about-dickie-v/ |website=Tampa Bay Times |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> and five grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dick Vitale |url=https://www.facebook.com/therealdickvitale/photos/my-5-grandchildren-pose-for-pic-after-dinner-atthe-utc-mall/1831389863550746/ |website=Facebook |accessdate=18 February 2020}}</ref> He is a fan of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], and [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]].<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/rays/2020/10/20/world-series-dick-vitale-revels-tampa-bays-recent-sports-surge/3712173001/</ref>

==Broadcasting==
Following his departure as coach of the [[Detroit Pistons]], Scotty Connal gave Vitale his first TV opportunity at the then fledgling [[ESPN]] cable network. His first reaction to the job of broadcaster was "Absolutely no way. I know nothing about TV. I want to get back to where I belong and my spirit belongs." He was reluctant to accept the position but his wife Lorraine told him to "go on TV and have some fun," so Vitale accepted on a temporary basis until another coaching job became available. He called ESPN's first [[college basketball]] game on December 5, 1979, when [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul]] defeated [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] 90–77.<ref>{{cite web | title = Vitale's first broadcast| url = http://www.jsonline.com/sports/39534602.html}}</ref> His first play-by-play partner was Joe Boyle.

Vitale was not a natural at first for broadcasting. He missed his first-ever production meeting when he was walking the streets of [[Chicago]]. Also, he would talk while the producers were talking to him through his earpiece, during commercials, and while the play-by-play man was talking. Vitale himself was not sure if broadcasting would fit him. Connal, who had hired him, told him, "You have a quality we can't teach." Vitale did not understand this until many people wanted his autograph at the 1983 Final Four. He credits a lot of his success to working with [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]] at the beginning of his career.

In 1985, after the [[American Broadcasting Company]] acquired ESPN, Vitale also began doing broadcasts on the ABC network.

In 1999, Vitale was featured in a series of thirty-second promo shorts for "Hoops Malone".  The shorts, which aired in heavy rotation on ESPN, were presented as a sitcom featuring Vitale, [[George Gervin]] and others, including a puppet called "O'Hoolix".  ESPN promoted "Hoops" with banners and other marketing premiums, with the idea of generating buzz about the show, but no actual episodes were ever produced.  Though this led to an offer for Vitale to do an actual sitcom, he turned down the opportunity.

In December 2002, Vitale called a [[St. Vincent - St. Mary High School|St. Vincent – St. Mary's]]–[[Oak Hill Academy (Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] prep game, featuring then high school phenom [[LeBron James]]. He announced the game with [[Brad Nessler]] and NBA great [[Bill Walton]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://usatoday.com/sports/columnist/martzke/2002-12-04-martzke_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Packer vexed at Vitale for doing prep star's game | date=December 4, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

By the 2004–05 season, Vitale was doing approximately 40 games a year.<ref>{{cite web| title=TV/RADIO: Hoops boosts Vitale's vitality| url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml| access-date=2009-03-09| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706091318/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/031205/spo_18198829.shtml#| archive-date=2015-07-06| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Vitale is signed with ESPN through the 2021–22 college basketball season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Vitale agrees to contract extension with ESPN|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13044327/dick-vitale-agrees-contract-extension-espn|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=9 June 2015|date=2015-06-09}}</ref> Vitale was recruited to do color in the first two rounds of the NCAA tournament by [[College Basketball on CBS|CBS]] but ESPN would not allow it. However, ESPN's analysts [[Jay Bilas]] and [[Len Elmore]] were allowed to provide color for CBS's tournament coverage, teaming with play-by-play announcers [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]]. However, this is slightly misleading as Elmore continues to call games for both CBS and ESPN during the college basketball season; in Bilas' case he was loaned to CBS for the tournament only in 2003 and from 2005–2010.

In February 2015, ESPN removed Vitale from covering [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]-[[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|UNC]] basketball. He had covered every Duke-UNC game televised by ESPN since 1979.<ref> http://www.diehardsport.com/college-basketball/espn-taken-dick-vitale-off-broadcast-unc-duke-game/</ref>

Vitale is a voter on the [[Associated Press|AP]] Top 25 men's basketball polls, the annual [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith Award]] and the [[John Wooden Award]].

Vitale called his first NBA game on television since the 1984 NBA playoffs, along with [[Dan Shulman]], on January 7, 2009 when the Miami Heat played the Denver Nuggets as ESPN swapped its NBA and NCAA crews. During ESPN's first incarnation covering the NBA, he regularly covered games.

===Broadcasting partners===
As of 2009, Vitale had called close to a thousand games. Vitale, a [[color commentator]], is primarily paired with play-by-play announcers [[Mike Patrick]], primarily those in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] games; and [[Dan Shulman]] for [[Saturday Primetime]] and other non-ACC games. During the postseason, he appears as an in-studio analyst with host [[Rece Davis]] and fellow analysts [[Jay Bilas]], [[Digger Phelps]], [[Hubert Davis]], and [[Bob Knight]]. Previously, he has been paired with [[Keith Jackson]], [[Roger Twibell]], and [[Brent Musburger]] for [[College Basketball on ABC|ABC]] as well as [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]], [[Tim Brando]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1142535/index.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121202230801/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1142535/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 2, 2012 |work=CNN |title=You Said A Mouthful, Dick, Baby |date=March 19, 1990 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 }}</ref> [[Mike Tirico]], [[Dave O'Brien (sportscaster)|Dave O'Brien]], [[Sean McDonough]] and [[Brad Nessler]].

==Recognition==

On September 5, 2008 Vitale was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a contributor to the sport, after falling just short of induction the previous year.

In 2011 the University of Detroit named their basketball court in his honor.

On August 18, 2012, he was inducted into the [[Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum|Little League Museum]] Hall of Excellence.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lembo |first=John |title=Dick Vitale honored by Little League hall induction |url=http://www.bradenton.com/2012/08/04/4142748/dick-vitale-honored-by-little.html |newspaper=Bradenton Herald |date=August 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805052422/http://www.bradenton.com/2012/08/04/4142748/dick-vitale-honored-by-little.html |archivedate=2012-08-05 }}</ref>
