==Examples==
===Standards===
{{Main|De facto standard}}
<!--::<small>''Summarized from [[De facto standard]]''.</small>-->

A [[de facto standard|{{dfn|de facto standard}}]] is a standard (formal or informal) that has achieved a dominant position by tradition, enforcement, or market dominance. It has not necessarily received formal approval by way of a standardisation process, and may not have an official standards document.

[[Technical standard|{{dfn|Technical standard}}]]s are usually voluntary, such as [[ISO 9000]] requirements, but may be obligatory, enforced by government norms, such as [[Water quality|drinking water quality]] requirements. The term "de facto standard" is used for both: to contrast obligatory standards (also known as "de jure standards"); or to express a dominant standard, when there is more than one proposed standard.

In [[social sciences]], a voluntary standard that is also a de facto standard, is a typical solution to a [[coordination problem]].<ref name="Ulmann">Edna Ullmann-Margalit: ''The Emergence of Norms'', Oxford Un. Press, 1977. (or Clarendon Press 1978)</ref>

===National languages===
Several countries, including [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], have a de facto [[national language]] but no official, de jure national language.

Some countries have a de facto national language in addition to an official language. In [[Lebanon]] and [[Morocco]] the official language is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but an additional de facto language is also [[French language|French]]. In [[New Zealand]], [[Maori language|Maori]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] are de jure official languages, while English is a de facto official language. In [[Singapore]], [[English language|English]] is a de facto language, but [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] are the [[de jure]] languages.

[[Russian language|Russian]] was the de facto official language of the central government and, to a large extent, [[Republicanism|republican]] governments of the former [[Soviet Union]], but was not declared de jure state language until 1990. A short-lived law, effected April 24, 1990, installed Russian as the sole de jure official language of the Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bestpravo.ru/ussr/data01/tex10935.htm |title=USSR Law "On the Languages of the Peoples of USSR" |date=April 24, 1990 |language=ru |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618042714/http://www.bestpravo.ru/ussr/data01/tex10935.htm |archive-date=2009-06-18 }}</ref>

A de facto [[government]] is a government wherein all the attributes of sovereignty have, by usurpation, been transferred from those who had been legally invested with them to others, who, sustained by a power above the forms of law, claim to act and do really act in their stead.<ref>30 Am Jur 181. Law Dictionary, James A. Ballentine, Second Edition, 1948, p. 345.</ref>

In [[politics]], a de facto leader of a country or region is one who has assumed authority, regardless of whether by lawful, constitutional, or legitimate means; very frequently, the term is reserved for those whose power is thought by some faction to be held by unlawful, unconstitutional, or otherwise illegitimate means, often because it had deposed a previous leader or undermined the rule of a current one. De facto leaders sometimes do not hold a constitutional office and may exercise power informally.

Not all [[dictator]]s are de facto rulers. For example, [[Augusto Pinochet]] of [[Chile]] initially came to power as the chairperson of a [[military junta]], which briefly made him de facto leader of Chile, but he later amended the nation's constitution and made himself president until new elections were called, making him the formal and legal ruler of Chile. Similarly, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s formal rule of [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] is often recorded as beginning in 1979, the year he assumed the [[President of Iraq|Presidency of Iraq]]. However, his de facto rule of the nation began earlier: during his time as [[vice president]]; he exercised a great deal of power at the expense of the elderly [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], the de jure president.

In [[Argentina]], the successive military coups that overthrew constitutional governments installed de facto governments in [[Jose Felix Uriburu|1930–1932]], [[Revolution of '43|1943–1946]], [[Revolución Libertadora|1955–1958]], [[Revolución Argentina|1966–1973]] and [[National Reorganization Process|1976–1983]], the last of which combined the powers of the [[President of Argentina|presidential office]] with those of the [[Argentine National Congress|National Congress]]. The subsequent legal analysis of the validity of such actions led to the formulation of a [[De facto government doctrine|doctrine of the de facto governments]], a [[case law]] ([[precedent]]ial) formulation which essentially said that the actions and decrees of past de facto governments, although not rooted in legal legitimacy when taken, remained binding until and unless such time as they were revoked or repealed de jure by a subsequent legitimate government.

That doctrine was nullified by the [[1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution|constitutional reform of 1994]]. Article 36 states:

{{quote|
*(1) This Constitution shall rule even when its observance is interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and the democratic system. These acts shall be irreparably [[null and void|null]].
*(2) Their authors shall be punished with the penalty foreseen in Section 29, disqualified in perpetuity from holding public offices and excluded from the benefits of [[pardon]] and [[Commutation of sentence|commutation]] of sentences.
*(3) Those who, as a consequence of these acts, were to assume the powers foreseen for the authorities of this Constitution or for those of the provinces, shall be punished with the same penalties and shall be civil and criminally liable for their acts. The respective actions shall not be subject to prescription.
*(4) All citizens shall have the right to oppose resistance to those committing the acts of force stated in this section.
*(5) He who, procuring personal enrichment, incurs in serious fraudulent offense against the Nation shall also attempt subversion against the democratic system, and shall be disqualified to hold public office for the term specified by law.
*(6) Congress shall enact a law on public [[ethics]] which shall rule the exercise of public office.

In 1526, after seizing power [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the de jure [[Sultan]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. Ahmad, however, was in all practice the de facto Sultan.<ref name="bvhlgfi">{{cite web|title=Aḥmad Grāñ |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/10110/Ahmad-Gran |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |accessdate=2014-05-04}}</ref> Some other notable true de facto leaders have been [[Deng Xiaoping]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] and General [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]]. Both of these men exercised nearly all control over their respective nations for many years despite not having either legal constitutional office or the legal authority to exercise power. These individuals are today commonly recorded as the "leaders" of their respective nations; recording their legal, correct title would not give an accurate assessment of their power. Terms like ''[[strongman (politics)|strongman]]'' or ''dictator'' are often used to refer to de facto rulers of this sort. In the [[Soviet Union]], after [[Vladimir Lenin]] was incapacitated from a stroke in 1923, [[Joseph Stalin]]—who, as [[General Secretary of the CPSU|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] had the power to appoint anyone he chose to top party positions—eventually emerged as leader of the Party and the legitimate government. Until the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] officially declared the Party "...the vanguard of the working people", thus legitimising Stalin's leadership, Stalin ruled the USSR as the de facto dictator.

Another example of a de facto ruler is someone who is not the actual ruler but exerts great or total influence over the true ruler, which is quite common in monarchies. Some examples of these de facto rulers are [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] of China (for son [[Tongzhi Emperor|Tongzhi]] and nephew [[Guangxu Emperor|Guangxu]] Emperors), Prince [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]] (for his former lover Empress [[Catherine I]] of Russia), [[Cardinal Richelieu]] of France (for [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]) and Queen [[Marie Caroline of Naples and Sicily]] (for her husband King [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]]).

The term "de facto head of state" is sometimes used to describe the office of a [[governor general]] in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, since a holder of that office has the same responsibilities in their country as the de jure head of state (the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|sovereign]]) does within the [[United Kingdom]].

In the [[Westminster system]] of government, [[executive (government)|executive]] authority is often split between a de jure executive authority of a [[head of state]] and a de facto executive authority of a [[prime minister]] and [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] who implement executive powers in the name of the de jure executive authority. In the United Kingdom, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] is the de jure executive authority, even though executive decisions are made by the indirectly elected [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] and her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] on the Sovereign's behalf, hence the term [[Her Majesty's Government]].

The de facto boundaries of a country are defined by the area that its government is actually able to enforce its laws in, and to defend against encroachments by other countries that may also claim the same territory de jure. The [[Durand Line]] is an example of a de facto boundary. As well as cases of [[border dispute]]s, de facto boundaries may also arise in relatively unpopulated areas in which the border was never formally established or in which the agreed border was never surveyed and its exact position is unclear. The same concepts may also apply to a boundary between provinces or other subdivisions of a [[federation|federal state]].

====Segregation====
In South Africa, although de jure [[apartheid]] formally began in 1948, de facto racist policies and practices discriminating against black South Africans, Coloureds, and Indians dated back decades before.<ref name="Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law">{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoro00leeruoft |title=Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law |accessdate=27 March 2011 |author=R.W Lee |publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press }}</ref><ref name="Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents">{{cite book |title=Afrikaner political thought: analysis and documents |author=A.

De facto racial discrimination and [[Racial segregation|segregation]] in the United States (outside of the South) until the 1950s and 1960s was simply discrimination that was {{em|not}} segregation by law (de jure). "[[Jim Crow laws]]", which were enacted in the 1870s, brought legal racial segregation against [[black Americans]] residing in the [[Southern United States|American South]].

==Other uses==
A de facto [[monopoly]] is a system where many suppliers of a product are allowed, but the market is so completely dominated by one that the others might as well not exist. The related terms [[oligopoly]] and [[monopsony]] are similar in meaning and this is the type of situation that [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] laws are intended to eliminate.

In April 2014, a federal court judge ruled that a heterosexual couple who had a child and lived together for 13 years were not in a de facto relationship and thus the court had no jurisdiction to divide up their property under family law following a request for separation. In his ruling, the judge stated "de facto relationship(s) may be described as ‘marriage like’ but it is not a marriage and has significant differences socially, financially and emotionally."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/de-facto-couples-have-differences-to-married-counterparts-judge-says/story-e6frg97x-1226893110835|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504210414/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/legal-affairs/de-facto-couples-have-differences-to-married-counterparts-judge-says/story-e6frg97x-1226893110835|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 May 2014|title=De facto couples have differences to married counterparts, judge says|work=[[The Australian]]|date=23 April 2014}}</ref>

The above sense of de facto is related to the relationship between common law traditions and formal (statutory, regulatory, civil) law, and [[common-law marriage]]s. Common law norms for settling disputes in practical situations, often worked out over many generations to establishing [[precedent]], are a core element informing decision making in [[legal system]]s around the world. Because its early forms originated in [[England in the Middle Ages]], this is particularly true in Anglo-American legal traditions and in former colonies of the [[British Empire]], while also playing a role in some countries that have mixed systems with significant admixtures of civil law.

===Relationships not recognised outside Australia===
Due to [[Federalism in Australia|Australian federalism]], de facto partnerships can only be legally recognised whilst the couple lives within a state in Australia. This is because the power to legislate on de facto matters relies on referrals by States to the Commonwealth in accordance with [[Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution]], where it states the new federal law can only be applied back within a state.<ref>{{cite web|date=Feb 2003|url=http://www.fedcourt.gov.au/aboutct/judges_papers/speeches_frenchj6.rtf|title=The Referral of State Powers Cooperative Federalism lives?|work=Western Australia Law Review|first= Justice|last=French}}.</ref><ref>''Thomas'' (2007) 233 CLR 307, [208] (Kirby J).</ref> There must be a state nexus between the de facto relationship itself and the Australian state.<ref>See sections [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90rd.html 90RG], [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90sd.html 90SD] and [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90sk.html 90SK], section [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/s90ra.html 90RA], of the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fla1975114/ Family Law Act].</ref>

If an Australian de facto couple moves out of a state, they do not take the state with them and the new federal law is tied to the territorial limits of a state. The legal status and rights and obligations of the de facto or unmarried couple would then be recognised by the laws of the country where they are ordinarily resident. See the section on [[Family Court of Australia]] for further explanation on jurisdiction on de facto relationships.

This is unlike marriage and "matrimonial causes" which are recognised by sections 51(xxi) and (xxii) of the [[Constitution of Australia]]<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html Section 51], [[Australian Constitution]]</ref> and internationally by [[marriage law]] and conventions, [[International matrimonial law|Hague Convention on Marriages]] (1978).<ref name="Hague Convention">[http://www.legallanguage.com/resources/treaties/hague/1978-march-14th-convention-2 Hague Convention on Marriages 1978]</ref>

===Non-marital relationship contract===
A de facto relationship is comparable to non-marital relationship contracts (sometimes called "palimony agreements") and certain limited forms of domestic partnership, which are found in many jurisdictions throughout the world.

A de facto Relationship is not comparable to [[common-law marriage]], which is a fully legal marriage that has merely been contracted in an irregular way (including by habit and repute). Only nine U.S. states and the District of Columbia still permit common-law marriage; but common law marriages are otherwise valid and recognised by and in all jurisdictions whose rules of comity mandate the recognition of any marriage that was legally formed in the jurisdiction where it was contracted.

===Family law – custody===
De facto joint custody is comparable to the joint legal decision-making authority a married couple has over their child(ren) in many jurisdictions (Canada as an example). Upon separation, each parent maintains de facto joint custody, until such time a court order awards custody, either sole or joint.<ref name="What you should know about Family Law in Ontario">http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/family/familyla.pdf What you should know about Family Law in Ontario</ref>

===Sports===
Examples of a de facto General Manager in sports include [[Syd Thrift]] who acted as the GM of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] between 1999 and 2002. [[Bill Belichick]], the head coach of the [[New England Patriots]] in the [[NFL]] does not hold the official title of GM, but serves as de facto general manager as he has control over [[NFL Draft|drafting]] and other personnel decisions.

==Other uses of the term==
In finance, the [[World Bank]] has a pertinent definition:

<blockquote>A "de facto government" comes into, or remains in, power by means not provided for in the country's constitution, such as a coup d'état, revolution, usurpation, abrogation or suspension of the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web | title = OP 7.30 – Dealings with De Facto Governments | work = Operational Manual | publisher = The World Bank | date = July 2001 | url = http://go.worldbank.org/UHU8EMUDZ0 | accessdate = 2010-11-28 }}</ref></blockquote>

A de facto state of war is a situation where two nations are actively engaging, or are engaged, in aggressive military actions against the other without a formal [[declaration of war]].

In engineering, {{dfn|de facto technology}} is a system in which the intellectual property and know-how is privately held. Usually only the owner of the technology manufactures the related equipment. Meanwhile, a {{dfn|standard technology}} consists of systems that have been publicly released to a certain degree so that anybody can manufacture equipment supporting the technology. For instance, in cell phone communications, CDMA1X is a de facto technology, while GSM is a standard technology.
