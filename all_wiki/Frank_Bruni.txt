'''Frank Anthony Bruni''' (born October 31, 1964) is an American journalist and long-time writer for ''[[The New York Times]]''. In June 2011, he was named an [[op-ed]] columnist for the newspaper. His columns appear twice weekly and he also writes a weekly newsletter.

One of his many previous posts for the newspaper was as its chief restaurant critic, from 2004 to 2009. He is the author of three bestselling books: ''Born Round'', a memoir about his family's love of food and his own struggles with overeating,  ''Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be'', about the college admissions mania, and ''Ambling Into History,'' about [[George W. Bush]].

He was a [[Morehead Scholar]] and wrote for the student paper, ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]''.<ref name=baby>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19bruni-t.html?pagewanted=7 | work=The New York Times | title=I Was a Baby Bulimic | first=Frank | last=Bruni | date=2009-07-19 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> He then attended [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Graduate School of Journalism]], from which he graduated second in his class with a master of science degree in journalism, and also won a [[Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship]].

==Life and career==
After graduating from Columbia University in the City of New York, Bruni joined the staff of the ''[[New York Post]]'' and then moved on to the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', where he did a wide range of beats, including a stint covering the Persian Gulf War. He spent more than a year as the movie critic and also wrote extensively about [[LGBT]] issues and [[AIDS]]. In 1992,<ref>{{cite web |title=1992 Pulitzer Prizes |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-year/1992 |website=pulitzer.org |accessdate=October 24, 2020}}</ref> he was a runner-up for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in feature writing for his profile of a convicted child molester. In 1995, Bruni took a job with ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a metropolitan reporter and often wrote for ''The Times's<nowiki/> ''Sunday magazine and for Sunday Arts & Leisure.'' ''In 1998, he was assigned to the [[Washington, D.C.]], bureau, where he covered [[Capitol Hill]] and [[U.S. Congress|Congress]], before being sent on the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|campaign trail]] to follow then-[[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[George W. Bush]]. He then covered the [[White House]] for the first eight months of the Bush administration and served as the Washington-based staff writer for the Sunday magazine. In July 2002, he was promoted to [[Rome]] bureau chief. Two years later, he became ''The Times''{{‘}} restaurant critic. After more than five years in that position, he returned briefly to the magazine before becoming an op-ed columnist.

Bruni's book ''Ambling into History'' chronicles his time covering Bush's campaign. ''Born Round <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/books/review/Browning-t.html|title=Book Review - 'Born Round: The Secret History of a Full-Time Eater,' by Frank Bruni|first=Dominique|last=Browning|date=19 August 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>'' deals in part with his time as ''The Times''{{‘}} restaurant critic and was named one of the best nonfiction books of 2009 by ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]] ''and [[Amazon.com]]. In ''The Times''{{‘}} Sunday Book Review, Dominique Browning raved that "the love with which Bruni writes about his family is breathtaking." ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' deemed ''Born Round'' a "powerful, honest book about desire, shame, identity and self-image."

''Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be'' was published by [[Grand Central Publishing]], an imprint of the [[Hachette Book Group]], in March 2015 and was reissued in an expanded, updated paperback a year later. In a review of it in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/not-getting-into-harvard-or-stanford-will-take-you-farther-than-getting-in/2015/04/08/1151870c-b6cc-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html|title=Not getting into Harvard or Stanford will take you farther than getting in|first=Michael S.|last=Roth|date=10 April 2015|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> [[Wesleyan University]] President Michael Roth called it "a humane, measured book" with "lessons for a very wide audience indeed." In February 2017, Bruni released his first cookbook, written with his ''[[The New York Times]]'' colleague [[Jennifer Steinhauer]] titled ''A Meatloaf in Every Oven''. It includes recipes from such prominent chefs as [[Bobby Flay]] and [[April Bloomfield]].

In September 2018, Bruni's footprint at The Times expanded to include a [https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/frank-bruni weekly newsletter] that readers can subscribe to for free. It arrives in their inboxes midday Wednesday every week. It mingles political commentary with cultural riffs and personal reflections.

Bruni has also done extensive reporting on religion and is the author, with Elinor Burkett, of ''A Gospel of Shame: Children, Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church''. His freelance work has appeared in several magazines, including ''[[Conde Nast Traveler]]''. Although he formalized a relationship with CNN in September 2017 and appears on its shows as a commentator about four times a week, he also appears occasionally on ''[[Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]]'', and has been a guest on late-night talk shows as well. He once served as a guest judge on ''[[Top Chef]]'' and appeared briefly in the movie ''[[Julie & Julia]]'', which was written and directed by his friend [[Nora Ephron]]. In the spring of 2014, he taught a journalism seminar at [[Princeton University]].<ref>https://humanities.princeton.edu/journalism/courses/spring2014</ref>

In February 2018, he published a long and unusually [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/opinion/eyesight-going-blind.html personal column] for The Times about an affliction that, overnight, robbed him of functional vision in his right eye. He described the difficult adjustment to that and what it's like to live with the fear of his left eye being affected, too. He is at work on a book for [[Simon & Schuster]], scheduled to be published in late 2020, that reflects further on the experience and discusses aging and physical limitations among [[Baby Boomer]]s who once thought themselves invincible.

In 2016, the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association gave him its Randy Shilts Award for his career-long contribution to [[LGBT]] Americans. He was previously awarded the [[GLAAD]] [[GLAAD Media Award|Media Award]] for Outstanding Newspaper Columnist in 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2012/03/24/glaad-media-awards-winners-list/|title=GLAAD Media Awards honor Lady Gaga, 'DWTS,' 'Oprah Winfrey Show': Full winners list|last=Bierly|first=Mandy|date=March 24, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>
