'''Hurricane Irma''' was an extremely powerful [[Cape Verde hurricane]] that caused widespread destruction across its path in September 2017. Irma was the first [[Category&nbsp;5 hurricane]] to strike the [[Leeward Islands]] on record, followed by [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] two weeks later. At the time, it was considered as the most powerful hurricane on record in the open Atlantic region, outside of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] until it was surpassed by [[Hurricane Dorian]] [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season|two years later]]. It was also the third strongest Atlantic hurricane at landfall ever recorded, just behind the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane|1935 Labor Day Hurricane]] and [[Hurricane Dorian]]. <ref>{{Cite web|date=May 25, 2020|title=Atlantic hurricane best track (HUDRAT version 2)|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-1851-2019-052520.txt|website=United States National Hurricane Center.}}</ref>

It was also the most intense hurricane <!-- In terms of pressure, not wind speed --> to strike the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]] since [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], the first major hurricane to make landfall in [[Florida]] since [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] in the same year, and the first Category&nbsp;4 hurricane to strike the state since [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]] in [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]].

Irma developed from a [[tropical wave]] near the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]] on August&nbsp;30. Favorable conditions allowed Irma to [[Rapid intensification|rapidly intensify]] into a [[Category&nbsp;3 hurricane]] on the [[Saffir–Simpson wind scale]] by late on August&nbsp;31. The storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories&nbsp;2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of [[eyewall replacement cycle]]s. On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by early on the next day. Early on September 6, Irma peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]] of {{convert|914|hPa|inHg|abbr=on}}. Irma was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 in terms of barometric pressure, and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category&nbsp;5 status before making landfall in [[Cuba]]. Although Irma briefly weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 storm while making landfall on Cuba, the system re-intensified to Category&nbsp;4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the [[Straits of Florida]], before making landfall on [[Cudjoe Key, Florida|Cudjoe Key]] on September&nbsp;10. Irma then weakened to Category&nbsp;3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on [[Marco Island, Florida|Marco Island]] later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over [[Alabama]] and ultimately dissipated on September&nbsp;13 over [[Missouri]].

The storm caused catastrophic damage in [[Barbuda]], [[Saint Barthélemy]], [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], [[Anguilla]], and the [[Virgin Islands]] as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane. The hurricane caused at least 134 deaths: one in [[Anguilla]]; one in [[Barbados]]; three in [[Barbuda]]; four in the [[British Virgin Islands]]; 10 in [[Cuba]]; 11 in the [[French West Indies]]; one in [[Haiti]]; three in [[Puerto Rico]]; four on the Dutch side of [[Sint Maarten]]; 92 in the [[contiguous United States]], and four in the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].

On September 4, after moving into more favorable conditions, Irma strengthened into a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane. As it continued approaching the Leeward Islands, Irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on the following day, with winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h). The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h) near 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September 5. Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern [[Leeward Islands]]. Almost eight hours later, around 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of [[Barbuda]] at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at {{convert|914|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since [[Hurricane Dean|Dean]] in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;mph (285&nbsp;km/h). Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15&nbsp;UTC on [[Sint Maarten]], and at 16:30&nbsp;UTC on [[Virgin Gorda]], in the [[British Virgin Islands]], though the storm's central pressure had risen slightly prior to its third landfall.<ref name="TCR"/>

As the hurricane moved away from the [[Virgin Islands]] late on September&nbsp;6, observations from reconnaissance flights, as well as Doppler radar in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], indicated an elliptical eye and double eyewalls. Late on September&nbsp;6, the cyclone passed about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the north coast of [[Hispaniola]] throughout the day on September&nbsp;7. After beginning an [[eyewall replacement cycle]], Irma weakened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane as it passed south of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] early on September&nbsp;8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category&nbsp;5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above {{convert|156|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} – behind only the [[1932 Cuba hurricane]]. At 05:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, Irma made landfall on the island of [[Little Inagua]] in the Bahamas with sustained winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h). The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a [[ridge (meteorology)|subtropical ridge]] to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category&nbsp;5 intensity at 18:00&nbsp;UTC that day east of [[Cuba]] as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in [[Cayo Romano|Cayo Romano, Cuba]], at 03:00&nbsp;UTC on September 9, with winds of 165&nbsp;mph (270&nbsp;km/h). This made Irma only the second Category&nbsp;5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the [[1924 Cuba hurricane]]. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category&nbsp;2 storm later on September 9.<ref name="TCR"/>

After slowing down late on September 9, the hurricane turned northwestward towards [[Florida]] around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental [[United States]]. Moving over the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, Irma quickly restrengthened to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane at 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 10, as deep convection improved and the eye became better defined.<ref name="TCR"/> In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} and gale-force winds spanning {{convert|220|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack L.

Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category&nbsp;3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30&nbsp;UTC, in [[Marco Island, Florida]], with sustained winds of 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h). Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category&nbsp;3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] as a weakening Category&nbsp;1 hurricane around 06:00&nbsp;UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation – though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds.

Hurricane Irma's path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating, with landfalls in [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Martin (island)|Saint Martin]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], and the United States, all at major hurricane intensity. Furthermore, the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrences. Irma is the second-costliest Caribbean hurricane on record, after Maria.<ref name=irmacosts>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41231323|title=Hurricane Irma: Florida assesses damage as storm weakens|date=September 11, 2017|access-date=November 6, 2017|publisher=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012200040/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41231323|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition to the catastrophic impact on Barbuda's human residents, concern turned to the storm's effects on the island's wildlife. The island's only [[endemic]] bird, the [[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]] [[Barbuda warbler]], numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane. It is unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath.

Irma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the French island of [[Saint Barthélemy]], southeast of Saint Martin. Describing the extent of the destruction, one local compared it to "a bomb that burned all vegetation," while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively "erased the island from the map".<ref name=barts>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2017/09/07/ouragan-irma-des-chambres-ont-litteralement-implose-les-murs-vibraient-comme-du-carton_5182354_3244.html|title=Ouragan Irma : 'A Saint-Barthélemy, on a été rayés de la carte'|date=September 7, 2017|access-date=September 7, 2017|newspaper=Le Monde|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907162623/http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2017/09/07/ouragan-irma-des-chambres-ont-litteralement-implose-les-murs-vibraient-comme-du-carton_5182354_3244.html|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments, with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation.<ref name=bartsfr>{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/nature/irma-a-saint-barthelemy-l-ile-est-vraiment-aneantie-temoigne-une-habitante-07-09-2017-7242084.php|title=Irma : à Saint-Barthélémy, "l'île est vraiment anéantie", témoigne une habitante|access-date=September 7, 2017|date=September 7, 2017|newspaper=Le Parisien|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010115757/http://www.leparisien.fr/environnement/nature/irma-a-saint-barthelemy-l-ile-est-vraiment-aneantie-temoigne-une-habitante-07-09-2017-7242084.php|archive-date=October 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Streets in the capital of [[Gustavia, Saint Barthélemy|Gustavia]] were turned into rushing rivers, which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture.

Hurricane Irma affected multiple states in the South, especially Florida. Except the Florida Keys, the total damage Irma caused was not as great as government officials and forecasters had warned. Irma weakened after making landfall in Cuba, but strengthened back into a Category 4 prior to hitting the Keys. The Florida Keys suffered the worst of the damage in the United States. After surveying the aftermath of Irma, Florida governor [[Rick Scott]] said "I thought we would see more damage" [on the mainland] but said "he witnessed devastation in the Keys".<ref>{{cite news |author1=Andres Viglucci |author2=Carli Teproff |author3=Daniel Chang |title=Irma could have been a lot worse for South Florida, but it's still not a pretty picture |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=September 11, 2017 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article172766396.html |access-date=September 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912072220/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article172766396.html |archive-date=September 12, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]] commented on [[Twitter]] that the devastation in some places was "far greater than anyone thought".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890193981585444864|title=The devastation left by Hurricane Irma was far greater, at least in certain locations, than anyone thought – but amazing people working hard!|author=Donald J.

Damage in the United States was estimated at a minimum of $50&nbsp;billion. At the time, Irma was the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in the United States, behind hurricanes [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]] in 2012, [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] earlier that year, and [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] in 2005. However, later in September&nbsp;2017, [[Hurricane Maria]] became the third costliest United States tropical cyclone, causing Irma to fall to the fifth costliest.

==Aftermath==

Irma made landfall in the [[Florida Keys]] with winds of 130&nbsp;mph (215&nbsp;km/h) and a pressure of 931&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.49&nbsp;inHg), making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]] in [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004]], and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since [[Hurricane Andrew|Andrew]] in [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992]].

==Retirement==
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
On April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the RA IV hurricane committee, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired the name ''Irma'' from its rotating naming lists, due to the extensive amount of damage and loss of life it caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, and it will never again be used for another [[Atlantic hurricane]]. It will be replaced with ''Idalia'' for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/national/hurricane-names-harvey-irma-maria-and-nate-being-retired/2018/04/12/1d594506-3e4d-11e8-955b-7d2e19b79966_story.html|title=Hurricane names Harvey, Irma, Maria and Nate being retired|publisher=Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=April 12, 2018|access-date=April 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043249/https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/national/hurricane-names-harvey-irma-maria-and-nate-being-retired/2018/04/12/1d594506-3e4d-11e8-955b-7d2e19b79966_story.html|archive-date=April 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
