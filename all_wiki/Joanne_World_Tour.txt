The '''Joanne World Tour''' was the fifth headlining [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], in support of her fifth studio album, ''[[Joanne (album)|Joanne]]'' (2016). It began on August 1, 2017, in [[Vancouver]], Canada and ended on February 1, 2018, in [[Birmingham]], England. After tickets went on sale, various shows in Europe and North America quickly sold out, prompting additional dates in both continents. The concert series was deemed "more minimalist" in comparison to the singer's previous tours,<ref name="telegraph review">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/older-wiser-still-fabulous-lady-gaga-arena-birmingham-review/|title=Older, wiser but still fabulous - Lady Gaga, Arena Birmingham, review|first=Alice|last=Vincent|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=February 1, 2018|url-status=live|date=February 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201135324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/older-wiser-still-fabulous-lady-gaga-arena-birmingham-review/ |archive-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> but received praise for the visuals, Gaga's singing abilities and her connection with the audience.

Altogether they render the different configurations and shapes to the stage: elevated, flat, criss-cross, diagonal or staircase.<ref name="tait"/>

Additionally, {{convert|60|ft}} above the audience there are three inflatable lightning pods with video projection displays, that also act as bridges. When not being used for videos, they descend to connect the main stage with the circular satellite stages and the b-stage, allowing access to the performers to move between them.<ref name=livedesign/> Through these moving platforms and stage, Gaga was able to traverse the entirety of an arena and perform close to the audience. The satellite stages also consisted of two {{convert|10|ft}} hydraulic lifts, which raised the singer to join a platform on the b-stage. Tait also designed a laser lit, heart-shaped piano. It was adorned with 44 laser beams, that lit up the arena and sequenced with the keypads on the piano. The 1.25-inch acrylic shell piano was enhanced by adding a mix of dichroic filmed polycarbonate fascia, thereby reflecting the beams more.<ref name="tait">{{cite press release|url=http://www.taittowers.com/2017/08/07/media-kit-lady-gaga-joanne-world-tour-stage-design/|title=Lady Gaga Slays Joanne World Tour with a Top-Notch Stage Design|date=August 7, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017|publisher=TAIT Inc|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815023631/http://www.taittowers.com/2017/08/07/media-kit-lady-gaga-joanne-world-tour-stage-design/|archive-date=August 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

She said that "this show's actually extremely complex and complicated, and the stage is coded with a computer. It's intense and the cues all have to be met at a particular time. It's high stress and tense backstage to make sure everything happens at the exact moment it's supposed to.

The show begins with a countdown displayed on a large screen, with the line "Don't call me Gaga" repeatedly played from the speakers. After Gaga shouts out that she instead wants to be called Joanne, she starts performing "Diamond Heart", standing solely on a raised platform with a microphone stand. She then moves on to sing "[[A-Yo (Lady Gaga song)|A-Yo]]", while playing on a guitar, and her dancers and guitarists also appear on stage.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7897028/lady-gaga-joanne-world-tour-concert-recap-los-angeles-forum|title=Lady Gaga Brings All Her Pop-Star Personas to One Stage for Joanne World Tour Stop in Los Angeles|work=Billboard|access-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917195343/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7897028/lady-gaga-joanne-world-tour-concert-recap-los-angeles-forum|archive-date=September 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The show then continues with a choreographed performance of "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" with her dancers clad in black cowboy-style leather costumes. The first act of the show is concluded by "[[Perfect Illusion]]", followed by a video interlude that shows Gaga driving a vintage convertible letting out pink smoke. "[[John Wayne (song)|John Wayne]]" is performed with pyrotechnic effects alongside her dancers. This is followed by "[[Scheiße (song)|Scheiße]]", performed on the raised platforms.<ref name=":3" /> After a solo performance of "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]", Gaga leaves the stage for a costume change.

Following another video interlude, depicting the singer with rhino horns, Gaga appears on stage playing her [[keytar]] to "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]". "[[LoveGame]]" and "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]" follows the performance, the former using her characteristic disco-stick. During "[[Applause (Lady Gaga song)|Applause]]", the three lightning pods that were used for video projection are lowered, forming bridges for Gaga and her dancers to cross between the b-stages, allowing them to get to the piano by the end of the song. Here Gaga gives a speech to the crowd and then starts singing "Come to Mama" and "[[The Edge of Glory]]" on the piano. Changing into a [[ball gown]] Gaga performs "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]" accompanied by colorful lighting effects.

After another video interlude, Gaga returns to sing "Bloody Mary" in a puffer coat red dress, which is changed into a red bodysuit for "Dancin' in Circles". Gaga then performs "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]" portraying a choreographed battle onstage, showing someone stalked and murdered.<ref name=":3" /> Ambulance sirens are heard and a cross with a red and blue background is displayed as one of the pods are lifted, containing her. The show then shifts into "Angel Down" as the pod that contained Gaga, now in a white fringe blazer and a brownish hat with a feather, is lowered halfway.<ref name=":3" /> Gaga then goes down to the platform to tell the audience a story about her late aunt, Joanne Germanotta, before sitting down on a stool, guitar in-hand to perform the album [[Joanne (Lady Gaga song)|title track]].

The final segment begins with "[[Bad Romance]]", with Gaga and her dancers all decked in white, followed by "[[The Cure (song)|The Cure]]" with full choreography. She takes a bow and leaves the stage, only to return a few minutes later for the encore, wearing a long silver sparkling jacket paired with the signature pink hat.<ref name=":3" /> "[[Million Reasons]]" is sung on piano, with the singer standing atop it, and the show ends with Gaga disappearing under the stage, while leaving the pink hat behind on the piano stool.<ref name="MG"/>

Tom Murray from the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'' was very positive in his review, saying that "a big, over-the-top assault on the senses, Gaga's Joanne World Tour is as impressive as an arena show gets, with a dramatic arc that hinges as much on the singer's charisma and vocal skills as it does any of the special effects."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/music/gaga-world-tour-as-impressive-as-it-gets|title=Lady Gaga world tour as impressive as it gets|last=Murray|first=JTomane|date=August 4, 2017|accessdate=September 10, 2017|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805140551/http://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/music/gaga-world-tour-as-impressive-as-it-gets|archive-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref> Alex Stedman for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated: "Lady Gaga can do more than your average pop star. ...

[[Jon Caramanica]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the first part of the show was "disjointed, shifting styles and attitudes seemingly at random", but Gaga later "struck a rhythm".

[[Alexis Petridis]] from ''[[The Guardian]]'' rated the show 4 stars out of five, and singled out Gaga's performance during the acoustic sections and her connection with the audience as highlights. He further added that although the show cannot be called "understated", compared to Gaga's older concert tours, "the weirdness that was once her calling card has been considerably scaled back".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/lady-gaga-review-arena-birmingham|title=Lady Gaga review – a uniquely human star in a sea of conformity|first=Alexis|last=Petridis|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=February 1, 2018|url-status=live|date=February 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201144453/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/01/lady-gaga-review-arena-birmingham |archive-date=February 1, 2018}}</ref> Alice Vincent from ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' also noted that the Joanne Tour is "a more minimalist affair", but in her opinion "Gaga's appeal" is "not gimmicks or dramatic reinventions, but that she stays the same beneath them all".<ref name="telegraph review"/>
