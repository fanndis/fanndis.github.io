====Universal Periodic Review Working Group====
{{Main|Universal Periodic Review}}

An important component of the Council consists in a periodic review of all 193 UN member states, called the [[United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review|Universal Periodic Review]] (UPR).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/universal-periodic-review-mechanism | publisher=Human Rights Watch | date=27 June 2006 | access-date=24 February 2009 | title=The Universal Periodic Review Mechanism}}</ref>

The new mechanism is based on reports coming from different sources, one of them being contributions from [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs). Each country's situation will be examined during a three-and-a-half-hour debate.<ref>Main points: [http://www.upr-info.org/en/upr-process/what-is-it What is the UPR].

The General Assembly resolution establishing the Council, provided that "the Council shall review its work and functioning five years after its establishment".<ref>Paragraph 16 of General Assembly Resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006</ref> The main work of the review was undertaken in an Intergovernmental Working Group established by the Council in its Resolution 12/1 of 1 October 2009.<ref>See:  [http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/53&referer=/english/&Lang=E  Resolution 12/1 of 1 October 2009, included in UN document A/65/53, containing the Report of the Human Rights Council on its Twelfth Session (14 September – 2 October 2009)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324064236/https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2F65%2F53&referer=%2Fenglish%2F&Lang=E |date=24 March 2020 }}</ref> The review was finalized in March 2011, by the adoption of an "Outcome" at the Council's sixteenth session, annexed to Resolution 16/21.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/general-document/pdf/a_hrc_res_16_21_hrc_review_e.pdf |title= Resolution 16/21|website=upr-info.org}}</ref>

First cycle: The following terms and procedures were set out in General Assembly Resolution 60/251:
* Reviews are to occur over a four-year period (48 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/member-states/|title=Member States {{!}} United Nations|publisher=United Nations|access-date=7 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504180220/https://www.un.org/en/member-states/|archive-date=4 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2008 and 2011;
* The order of review should follow the principles of universality and equal treatment;
* All Member States of the Council will be reviewed while they sit at the Council and the initial members of the Council will be first;
* The selection of the countries to be reviewed must respect the principle of equitable geographical allocation;
* The first Member States and the first observatory States to be examined will be selected randomly in each regional group to guarantee full compliance with the equitable geographical allocation. Reviews shall then be conducted alphabetically.

Second cycle: HRC Resolution 16/21 brought the following changes:
* Reviews are to occur over a four-and-a-half-year period (42 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2012 and 2016;
* The order of review will be similar to the 1st cycle;
* The length of each Review will be extended from three to three-and-a-half hours;
* The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the recommendations.

Similar mechanisms exist in other organizations: [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Organization of American States]], [[International Labour Bureau]], and the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref>Lars Müller, (ed.), The First 365 days of the United Nations Human Rights Council, p. 81 and ff.</ref>

Except for the tri-annual reports on development of human rights policies, that Member States have to submit to the Secretary General since 1956, the Human Rights Council UPR procedure constitutes a first in the area. It marks the end of the discrimination that had plagued the work of the Human Rights Commission and had caused it to be harshly criticised. Finally, this mechanism demonstrates and confirms the universal nature of human rights.

====Advisory Committee====
The [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]] was the main subsidiary body of the CHR. The Sub-Commission was composed of 26 elected human rights experts whose mandate was to conduct studies on discriminatory practices and to make recommendations to ensure that racial, national, religious, and linguistic minorities are protected by law.<ref name = "SubC">{{cite web

In 2006, the newly created UNHRC assumed responsibility for the Sub-Commission. The Sub-Commission's mandate was extended for one year (to June 2007), but it met for the final time in August 2006.<ref name = "SubC"/> At its final meeting, the Sub-Commission recommended the creation of a Human Rights Consultative Committee to provide advice to the UNHRC.<ref>{{cite web

====Complaints procedure====
The UNHRC complaint procedure was established on 18 June 2007 (by UNHRC Resolution 5/1)<ref name="UNHRC Website Complaint Procedure"/> for reporting of consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world and under any circumstances.

The UNHRC has set up two working groups for its Complaint Procedure:

* the ''Working Group on Communications'' (WGC) – consists of five experts designated by the Advisory Committee from among its members, one from each regional group. The experts serve for three years with the possibility of one renewal. The experts determine whether a complaint deserves investigation, in which case it is passed to the WGS.
* the ''Working Group on Situations'' (WGS) – has five members, appointed by the regional groups from among its members on the Council for one year, which is renewable once. The WGS meets twice a year for five working days to examine the communications transferred to it by the WGC, including the replies of states thereon, as well as the situations which are already before the UNHRC under the complaint procedure. The WGS, on the basis of the information and recommendations provided by the WGC, presents the UNHRC with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and makes recommendations to the UNHRC on the course of actions to take.<ref name="UNHRC Website Complaint Procedure">{{cite journal|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/574157|title=Resolution 5/1|date=23 June 1949|journal=United Nations Digital Library System|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213045709/https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/574157|archive-date=13 February 2020}}</ref>

;Filing a complaint

The Chairman of the WGC screens complaints for admissibility. A complaint must be in writing, and cannot be anonymous. Examples provided by the UNHRC of cases that would be considered consistent patterns of gross human rights violations include alleged deterioration of human rights of people belonging to a minority, including forced evictions, [[racial segregation]] and substandard living conditions, and alleged degrading situation of prison conditions for both detainees and prison workers, resulting in violence and death of inmates.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/623242?ln=es|title=Complaint Procedure of the Human Rights Council|date=4 March 2008|journal=United Nations Digital Library System|access-date=11 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219093945/https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/623242?ln=es|archive-date=19 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Individuals, groups or NGOs can claim to be victims of humans rights violations or that have direct, reliable knowledge of such violations. Complaints cannot be made by a single victim of a single incident that alleges violation of their human rights.

Complaints can be regarding any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular treaty. Complaints are confidential and the UNHRC will only communicate with the complainant, unless it decides that the complaint will be addressed publicly.

The interaction with the complainant and the UNHRC during the complaints procedure will be on an as needed basis. UNHRC Resolution 5/1, paragraph 86, emphasizes that the procedure is victims-oriented. Paragraph 106 provides that the complaint procedure shall ensure that complainants are informed of the proceedings at the key stages. The WGC may request further information from complainants or a third party.<ref name="UNHRC Website Complaint Procedure"/>

Following the initial screening a request for information will be sent to the state concerned, which shall reply within three months of the request being made. WGS will then report to the UNHRC, which will usually be in the form of a draft resolution or decision on the situation referred to in the complaint.

The UNHRC will decide on the measures to take in a confidential manner as needed, but this will occur at least once a year. As a general rule, the period of time between the transmission of the complaint to the state concerned and consideration by the UNHRC shall not exceed 24 months. Those individuals or groups who make a complaint should not publicly state the fact that they have submitted a complaint.

To be accepted complaints must:
* be in writing and has to be submitted in one of the six UN official languages ([[Arabic]], Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish);
* contain a description of the relevant facts (including names of alleged victims, dates, location and other evidence), with as much detail as possible, and shall not exceed 15 pages;
* not be manifestly politically motivated;
* not be exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media;
* not be already dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights;
* be after domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged;
* not use a language that is abusive or insulting.

The complaint procedure is not designed to provide remedies in individual cases or to provide compensation to alleged victims.<ref name="UNHRC Website Complaint Procedure"/>

;Effectiveness

Due to the confidential manner of the procedure, it is almost impossible to find out what complaints have passed through the procedure and also how effective the procedure is.

There is a principle of non-duplication, which means that the complaint procedure cannot take up the consideration of a case that is already being dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights.

On the UNHRC website under the complaints procedure section there is a list of situations referred to the UNHRC under the complaint procedure since 2006. This was only available to the public as of 2014, however generally does not give any details regarding the situations that were under consideration other than the state that was involved.

In some cases the information is slightly more revealing, for example a situation that was listed was the situation of trade unions and human rights defenders in [[Iraq]] that was considered in 2012, but the UNHRC decided to discontinue that consideration.<ref name="McBeth 2011">McBeth, Nolan and Rice ''The International Law of Human Rights'' (OUP, 2011) at 231</ref>

The complaints procedure has been said to be too lenient due to its confidential manner.<ref name="McBeth 2011"/> Some have often questioned the value of the procedure, but its effectiveness should not be underestimated, 94% of states respond to the complaints raised with them.<ref>Moeckli, Shah, Sivakumaran, Harris International Human Rights Law 2nd ed (OUP, 2014) at 371</ref>

The OHCHR receives between 11,000–15,000 communications per year. During 2010–11, 1,451 out of 18,000 complaints were submitted for further action by the WGC. The UNHRC considered four complaints in their 19th session in 2012. Although the majority of the situations that have been considered have since been discontinued, the procedure should not be questioned as it still has an impact and should be continued.

History shows that the procedure works almost in a petition like way; if enough complaints are received then the UNHRC is very likely to assign a [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]] to the state or to the issue at hand. It has been said that an advantage of the procedure is the confidential manner, which offers the ability to engage with the state concerned through a more [diplomatic] process, which can produce better results than a more adversarial process of public accusation.<ref name="McBeth 2011"/>

The procedure is a useful tool to have at the disposal on the international community for situations where naming and shaming has proved ineffective.<ref name="McBeth 2011"/> Also another advantage is that a complaint can be made against any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular [[treaty]].

Due to the limited information that is provided on the complaints procedure it is hard to make comments on the process itself, the resources it uses versus its effectiveness. It is likely that a lot happens behind the scenes, such as communications between the WGS and states.

====Other subsidiary bodies====
In addition to the UPR, the Complaints Procedure and the Advisory Committee, the UNHRC's other subsidiary bodies include:
*''Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples'', which replaced the CHR's [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]]
*''Forum on Minority Issues'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/minority/forum.htm |title=Forum on Minority Issues |publisher=.ohchr.org |access-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702104345/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/minority/forum.htm |archive-date=2 July 2012  }}</ref> established to provide a platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities

Special procedures are categorized as either thematic mandates, which focus on major phenomena of human rights abuses worldwide, or country mandates, which report on human rights situations in specific countries or territories. Special procedures can be either individuals (called "[[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]]s" or "independent experts"), who are intended to be independent experts in a particular area of human rights, or working groups, usually composed of five members (one from each UN region). As of August 2017 there were 44 thematic and 12 country mandates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Welcomepage.aspx |title=Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council |publisher=ohchr.org |year=2020 |access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref>

The mandates of the special procedures are established and defined by the resolution creating them.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Policy Report: UN Human Rights Council resolutions|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/ensuring-relevance-driving-impact-the-evolution-and-future-direction-of-the-un-human-rights-councils-resolution-system/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 10 February 2016}}</ref> Various activities can be undertaken by mandate-holders, including responding to individual complaints, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation, and engaging in promotional activities. Generally the special procedures mandate-holders report to the Human Rights Council at least once a year on their findings.<ref name="IJRC-reports">"[http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/#Additional_Information Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council]".

====Special procedures mandate-holders====
Mandate-holders of the special procedures serve in their personal capacity, and do not receive pay for their work. The independent status of the mandate-holders is crucial to be able to fulfill their functions in all impartiality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Welcomepage.aspx|access-date=2 June 2012}}</ref> The OHCHR provides staffing and logistical support to aid each mandate-holders in carrying out their work.

Applicants for Special Procedures mandates are reviewed by a Consultative Group of five countries, one from each region. Following interviews by the Consultative Group, the Group provides a shortlist of candidates to the UNHRC President. Following consultations with the leadership of each regional grouping, the President presents a single candidate to be approved by the Member states of the UNHRC at the session following a new mandate's creation or on the expiration of the term of an existing mandate holder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nomination, Selection and Appointment of Mandate Holders|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Nominations.aspx|access-date=2 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518115049/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/SP/Pages/Nominations.aspx|archive-date=18 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Country mandates must be renewed yearly by the UNHRC; thematic mandates must be renewed every three years.<ref name="IJRC-reports"/> Mandate-holders, whether holding a thematic or country-specific mandate, are generally limited to six years of service.<ref name="IJRC">"[http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/#Additional_Information Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030141157/http://www.ijrcenter.org/un-special-procedures/#Additional_Information |date=30 October 2016 }}".

The amendments to the duties of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, passed by the Human Rights Council on 28 March 2008, has given rise to sharp criticism from western countries and human rights NGOs. The additional duty is phrased thus:
:(d)&nbsp;To report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression

The council voted on 30 June 2006 to make a review of alleged human rights abuses by Israel a permanent feature of every council session. The council's special rapporteur on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] is its only expert mandate with no year of expiry. The resolution, which was sponsored by [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], passed by a vote of 29 to 12 with five abstentions. [[Human Rights Watch]] urged it to look at international human rights and humanitarian law violations committed by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] armed groups as well. Human Rights Watch called on the Council to avoid the selectivity that discredited its predecessor and urged it to hold special sessions on other urgent situations, such as that in [[Darfur]].<ref>[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/06/30/global13685.htm U.N.: Mixed Start for New Human Rights Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708051250/https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/06/30/global13685.htm |date=8 July 2006 }} Human Rights Watch, 30 June 2006</ref>

The [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]] on the question of Palestine to the previous UNCHR, the current UNHRC and the General Assembly was, between 2001 and 2008, [[John Dugard]]. Bayefski quotes him as saying that his mandate is to "investigate human rights violations by Israel, not by Palestinians".<ref>His job description, or U.N. mandate, deliberately excludes Palestinian human-rights abuses. As Dugard said on 19 October, "I have a limited mandate, which is to investigate human rights violations by Israelis, not by Palestinians." The pre-determined outcome, however, has never been a problem for this lawyer. Far from being embarrassed, he launched into this year's diatribe this way: "Today I deliver my annual criticism of Israel’s human rights record." Bayefsky, Anne.

But the Council should give the same attention to grave violations committed by other states as well".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sgsm10788.doc.htm |title=Secretary-General Urges Human Rights Activists To 'Fill Leadership Vacuum', Hold World Leaders To Account, In Address To International Day Event |publisher=United Nations |date=8 December 2006 |access-date=26 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604123740/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sgsm10788.doc.htm |archive-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=====United States and UNHRC President=====
The Council's charter preserves the watchdog's right to appoint special investigators for countries whose human rights records are of particular concern, something many developing states have long opposed. A Council meeting in [[Geneva]] in 2007 caused controversy after Cuba and Belarus, both accused of abuses, were removed from a list of nine special mandates. The list, which included North Korea, Cambodia and Sudan, had been carried forward from the defunct Commission.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120156891659323879 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=The U.N.'s Human-Rights Sham | first=Ronan | last=Farrow | date=29 January 2008}}</ref> Commenting on Cuba and Belarus, the UN statement said that Ban noted "that not having a Special Rapporteur assigned to a particular country does not absolve that country from its obligations under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]."

The United States said a day before the UN statement that the Council deal raised serious questions about whether the new body could be unbiased. [[Alejandro Wolff]], deputy US permanent representative at the United Nations, accused the council of "a pathological obsession with Israel" and also denounced its action on Cuba and Belarus. "I think the record is starting to speak for itself", he told journalists.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3415619,00.html UN's Ban faults rights council over Israel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629235609/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3415619,00.html |date=29 June 2007 }} Ynet 21 June 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070621.wcomment0621/BNStory/International/home Why single out Israel?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725083749/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070621.wcomment0621/BNStory/International/home |date=25 July 2008 }} ''The Globe and Mail'' 21 June 2007.</ref>

The UNHRC President Doru Costea responded: "I agree with him. The functioning of the Council must be constantly improved". He added that the Council must examine the behaviour of all parties involved in complex disputes and not place just one state under the magnifying glass.<ref>[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/Human_Rights_Council_president_wants_reform.html?siteSect=105&sid=8265630&cKey=1191080216000&ty=st www.swissinfo.org Human Rights Council president wants reform] SwissInfo.sc 29 September 2007.</ref><ref>Steven Edwards: [http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=88cdec73-c6c9-4858-a95c-f2e8cbfe45dc&k=11105 Controversial changes to UN rights body passes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120055850/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=88cdec73-c6c9-4858-a95c-f2e8cbfe45dc&k=11105 |date=20 November 2007 }} CanWest News Service/National Post 16 November 2007.</ref>

=====Netherlands=====
Speaking at the IDC's [[Herzliya Conference]] in Israel in January 2008, Dutch Foreign Minister [[Maxime Verhagen]] criticized the actions of the Human Rights Council actions against Israel. "At the United Nations, censuring Israel has become something of a habit, while Hamas's terror is referred to in coded language or not at all. The Netherlands believes the record should be set straight, both in New York and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva", Verhagen said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minbuza.nl/nl/actueel/speeches,2008/01/Verhagen-spreekt-tijdens-Herzliya-conferentie-in-I.html |title=MinBuza.nl |publisher=MinBuza.nl |access-date=26 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706165852/http://www.minbuza.nl/nl/actueel/speeches,2008/01/Verhagen-spreekt-tijdens-Herzliya-conferentie-in-I.html |archive-date=6 July 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

At its Second Special Session in August 2006, the Council announced the establishment of a High-Level Commission of Inquiry charged with probing allegations that Israel systematically targeted and killed Lebanese civilians during the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/5B9DECECFE9A68A6C12571CA0026386B?opendocument Second Special Session of Human Rights Council Decides to Establish High-level Iinquiry Commission For Lebanon] UN Press release 11 August 2006.</ref> The resolution was passed by a vote of 27 in favour to 11 against, with 8 abstentions. Before and after the vote several member states and NGOs objected that by targeting the resolution solely at Israel and failing to address [[Hezbollah]] attacks on Israeli civilians, the Council risked damaging its credibility. The members of the Commission of Inquiry, as announced on 1 September 2006, were [[Clemente Baena Soares]] of Brazil, [[Mohamed Chande Othman]] of Tanzania, and Stelios Perrakis of Greece. The Commission noted that its report on the conflict would be incomplete without fully investigating both sides, but that "the Commission is not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe [its charter] as equally authorizing the investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel", as the Council had explicitly prohibited it from investigating the actions of Hezbollah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/specialsession/A.HRC.3.2.pdf |title=Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Lebanon pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-2/1* |last=Human Rights Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115172923/http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/specialsession/A.HRC.3.2.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2007 }}</ref>

====January 2008 decree====
UNHRC released a statement calling on Israel to stop its military operations in the Gaza Strip and to open the Strip's borders to allow the entry of food, fuel and medicine. UNHRC adopted the resolution by a vote of 30 to 1, with 15 states abstaining.

"Unfortunately, neither this resolution nor the current session addressed the role of both parties. It was regretful that the current draft resolution did not condemn the [[Rocket and mortar attacks on southern Israel|rocket attacks on Israeli civilians]]," said Canada's representative Terry Cormier, the lone voter against.<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/8FDBF12E3EF5DDC4C12573D9007606C7?opendocument Human Rights Council opens special session on violations stemming from Israeli incursions in occupied Palestinian territory] UNHRC Press release, 23 January 2008.</ref>

The United States and Israel boycotted the session. U.S. ambassador [[Warren Tichenor]] said the Council's unbalanced approach had "squandered its credibility" by failing to address continued rocket attacks against Israel. "Today's actions do nothing to help the [[Palestinian people]], in whose name the supporters of this session claim to act," he said in a statement. "Supporters of a Palestinian state must avoid the kind of inflammatory rhetoric and actions that this session represents, which only stoke tensions and erode the chances for peace", he added.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCB46LeoIDiLNzQYVOkRaPwS354A Human Rights Council slams Israel over Gaza; EU abstains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131211809/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCB46LeoIDiLNzQYVOkRaPwS354A |date=31 January 2008 }} AFP, 24 January 2008.</ref> "We believe that this council should deplore the fact that innocent civilians on both sides are suffering", Slovenian Ambassador Andrej Logar said on behalf of the seven EU states on the council.

====Gaza report====
{{main|United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict}}

On 3 April 2009, South African Judge [[Richard Goldstone]] was named as the head of the independent United Nations Fact-Finding Mission to investigate international human rights and humanitarian law violations related to the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. The Mission was established by Resolution S-9/1<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-91-L1.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219083233/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/A-HRC-S-91-L1.doc |archive-date=19 February 2011 }}</ref> of the United Nations Human Rights Council.<ref name="unhrc_pr">{{Cite journal | publisher = [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Richard J.

On 15 September 2009, the UN Fact-Finding mission released its report which found that there was evidence "indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict, and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes, and possibly crimes against humanity". The mission also found that there was evidence that "Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes, as well as possibly crimes against humanity, in their repeated launching of rockets and mortars into Southern Israel".<ref>{{Cite journal | title= UN Fact Finding Mission finds strong evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Gaza conflict | url= http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/9B63490FFCBE44E5C1257632004EA67B?opendocument | date= 15 September 2009 | publisher= United Nations Human Rights Council | access-date= 15 September 2009 | archive-url= https://www.webcitation.org/66OLCGxmZ?url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/view01/9B63490FFCBE44E5C1257632004EA67B?opendocument | archive-date= 24 March 2012 | url-status= live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf |publisher=United Nations Human Rights Council |access-date=15 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007093730/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf |archive-date=7 October 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/un_inquiry_finds_israel_punished_and|title=UN Inquiry Finds Israel 'Punished and Terrorized' Palestinian Civilians, Committed War Crimes During Gaza Assault|access-date=18 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304090136/http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/un_inquiry_finds_israel_punished_and|archive-date=4 March 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The mission called for referring either side in the conflict to the [[UN Security Council]] for prosecution at the [[International Criminal Court]] if they refuse to launch fully independent investigations by December 2009.<ref name=AIonUN>{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israel-gaza-implementation-un-fact-finding-mission-recommendations-crucial-justi |title=UN must ensure Goldstone inquiry recommendations are implemented |publisher=Amnesty International |date=15 September 2009 |access-date=26 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209001810/https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/israel-gaza-implementation-un-fact-finding-mission-recommendations-crucial-justi |archive-date=9 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Goldstone has since partially retracted the report's conclusions that Israel committed war crimes, as new evidence has shed light upon the decision making by Israeli commanders. He said, "I regret that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes."<ref name=Post>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes|publisher=Amnesty International|date=2 April 2009|access-date=2 April 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68EveqgW5?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|archive-date=7 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Goldstone acknowledged that Israel has "to a significant degree" implemented the report's recommendations that "each party to investigate [the incidents] transparently and in good faith," but "Hamas has done nothing". The Palestinian Authority has also implemented the report's recommendations by investigating "assassinations, torture and illegal detentions, perpetrated by Fatah in the West Bank", but Goldstone noted that "most of those allegations were confirmed by this inquiry".

====March 2011 controversy====
At UNHRC's opening session in February 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized the council's "structural bias" against the State of Israel: "The structural bias against Israel – including a standing agenda item for Israel, whereas all other countries are treated under a common item – is wrong. And it undermines the important work we are trying to do together."<ref>{{cite news |last=Lazaroff| first=Tovah| title=Clinton: UNHRC bias against Israel undermines its work |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=210208|access-date=21 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=28 February 2011|quote=The United Nations Human Rights Council must abandon its bias against Israel, which undermines its work, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Monday in Geneva.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303125605/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=210208|archive-date=3 March 2011}}</ref>

An editorial in the ''Jerusalem Post'' subsequently revealed that UNHRC was "poised to adopt six resolutions&nbsp;... condemning Israel," noting that it was the highest number of resolutions ever to be adopted against Israel in a single session. Human rights activist and [[Hudson Institute]] senior fellow [[Anne Bayefsky]] accused UNHRC of failing to remove antisemitic propaganda distributed by the [[IHH (Turkish NGO)|IHH]] during one of its sessions. The material in question was an illustration depicting Israel as a sinister Nazi octopus seizing control of a ship.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bayefsky|first=Anne|title=The UNHRC: Hard at work condemning Israel|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=213121|access-date=21 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=21 March 2011|quote=The Council is poised to adopt six resolutions this week condemning just Israel – the highest number of resolutions dedicated to bashing the Jewish state at a single session.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322100236/http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=213121|archive-date=22 March 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Chair of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] Rep. [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R) said she would propose legislation making U.S. funding for the UN contingent on extensive reform. Her bill will also call for the United States to withdraw from UNHRC, as "Israel is the only country on the council's permanent agenda, while abuses by rogue regimes like Cuba, China, and Syria are ignored".<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodenough|first=Patrick|title=House Foreign Affairs Chairman: U.S. Must Withdraw from U.N.

====Hosting of Hamas member====
In March 2012, the UNHRC was criticized for facilitating an event in the UN Geneva building featuring a Hamas politician. Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] castigated the UNHRC's decision stating, "He represents an organization that indiscriminately targets children and grown-ups, and women and men. Innocents – is their special favorite target". Israel's ambassador to the UN [[Ron Prosor]] denounced the speech stating that Hamas was an internationally recognized terrorist organization that targeted civilians. "Inviting a Hamas terrorist to lecture to the world about human rights is like asking [[Charles Manson]] to run the murder investigation unit at the NYPD", he said.<ref name="jpost.com">{{cite news|title=Netanyahu to UNHRC: You should be ashamed|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262512|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=19 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320091305/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262512|archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref>

==== March 2012 criticism ====
The United States urged UNHRC in Geneva to stop its anti-Israel bias. It took particular exception to the council's Agenda Item 7, under which at every session, Israel's human rights record is debated. No other country has a dedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to UNHRC [[Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe]] said that the United States was deeply troubled by the "Council's biased and disproportionate focus on Israel." She said that the hypocrisy was further exposed in the [[Golan Heights]] resolution that was advocated by the Syrian regime at a time when it was murdering its own citizens.<ref>{{cite news|title=US to UNHRC: 'Stop anti-Israel bias'|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262520|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=19 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320025507/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=262520|archive-date=20 March 2012}}</ref>

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva [[Tamara Kunanayakam]] pointed out that 80% of the UNHRC's funding requirements are supplied by powerful nations such as the United States and its allies.

===United States===

U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] declared that the United States would not seek a seat on the Council, saying it would be more effective from the outside. He did pledge, however, to support the Council financially. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] spokesman [[Sean McCormack]] said, "We will work closely with partners in the international community to encourage the council to address serious cases of human rights abuse in countries such as Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma, Sudan, and North Korea".

The U.S. State Department said on 5 March 2007 that, for the second year in a row, the United States has decided not to seek a seat on the Human Rights Council, asserting the body had lost its credibility with repeated attacks on Israel and a failure to confront other rights abusers.<ref>US Department of State: [https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2007/mar/81471.htm Daily Press Briefing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117155705/https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2007/mar/81471.htm |date=17 November 2017 }} 6 March</ref> Spokesman Sean McCormack said the council has had a "singular focus" on Israel, while countries such as Cuba, [[Myanmar]] and North Korea have been spared scrutiny. He said that though the United States will have only an observer role, it will continue to shine a spotlight on human rights issues. The most senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] of the U.S. House of Representatives, [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]], supported the administration decision. "Rather than standing as a strong defender of fundamental human rights, the Human Rights Council has faltered as a weak voice subject to gross political manipulation," she said.

Upon passage of UNHRC's June 2007 institution-building package, the U.S. restated its condemnation of bias in the institution's agenda. Spokesman Sean McCormack again criticised the Commission for focusing on Israel in light of many more pressing human rights issues around the world, such as Sudan or Myanmar, and went on to criticise the termination of [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]]s to Cuba and Belarus, as well as procedural irregularities that prevented member-states from voting on the issues; a similar critique was issued by the Canadian representative.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181813077343&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709081324/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181813077343&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 July 2012 |title=US slams UNHRC's singling out of Israel |author=Staff, Tovah Lazaroff & AP |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=20 June 2007 }}</ref> In September 2007, the US Senate voted to cut off funding to the council.<ref>{{cite web |last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1200572487688&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708181622/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1200572487688&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Ban Ki-moon: End Gaza violence, blockades  |work=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=26 February 2011 }}</ref>

The United States joined with Australia, Canada, Israel, and three other countries in opposing the UNHRC's draft resolution on working rules citing continuing misplaced focus on Israel at the expense of action against countries with poor human-rights records. The resolution passed 154–7 in a rare vote forced by Israel including the support of France, the United Kingdom, and China, although it is usually approved through consensus. United States Ambassador to the United Nations, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], spoke about the "council's relentless focus during the year on a single country – Israel," contrasting that with failure "to address serious human rights violations taking place in other countries such as Zimbabwe, DPRK (North Korea), Iran, Belarus and Cuba." Khalilzad said that aside from condemnation of the crackdown of the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests|Burmese anti-government protests]], the council's past year was "very bad" and it "had failed to fulfill our hopes."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1195127524546&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull| title=US attacks UN Human Rights Council| agency=Associated Press| newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=17 November 2007| access-date=18 November 2007}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=Tribe of Tiger |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Japan, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC condemning China's mistreatment of the [[Uyghurs]] and other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang re-education camps.<ref name="diplomat">{{cite news |title=Which Countries Are For or Against China's Xinjiang Policies? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/ |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=15 July 2019 |access-date=16 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716160658/https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/ |archive-date=16 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=More than 20 ambassadors condemn China's treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang {{!}} Xinjiang {{!}} The Guardian |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/more-than-20-ambassadors-condemn-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-in-xinjiang |website=The Guardian |access-date=16 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714102532/https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/more-than-20-ambassadors-condemn-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-in-xinjiang |archive-date=14 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

In response, UN ambassadors from 50 countries including Russia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, UAE, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Angola, Algeria and Myanmar signed a joint letter to the UNHRC praising China's "remarkable achievements in Xinjiang" and opposing the practice of "politicizing human rights issues."<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|title=Letter to UNHRC|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G19/240/77/PDF/G1924077.pdf?OpenElement|access-date=2020-08-12|website=United Nations Human Rights Council}}</ref><ref name="diplomat" />

In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, [[Vanuatu]] made a joint statement on behalf of [[Tonga]], [[Nauru]], [[Palau]], [[Tuvalu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Marshall Islands]] raising human rights violations in the [[Western New Guinea]], which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,<ref>{{cite news |title=Freedom of the press in Indonesian-occupied West Papua |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/22/freedom-of-the-press-in-indonesian-occupied-west-papua |work=The Guardian |date=22 July 2019 |access-date=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725001246/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/22/freedom-of-the-press-in-indonesian-occupied-west-papua |archive-date=25 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Liam|title=Pacific nations call for UN investigations into alleged Indonesian rights abuses in West Papua|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-02/pacific-nations-call-for-un-investigations-into-west-papua/8320194|work=ABC News|date=2 March 2017|access-date=30 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031203404/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-02/pacific-nations-call-for-un-investigations-into-west-papua/8320194|archive-date=31 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="SBSMar17">{{cite news|title=Pacific nations want UN to investigate Indonesia on West Papua|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/03/02/pacific-nations-want-un-investigate-indonesia-west-papua|work=SBS News|date=7 March 2017|access-date=30 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107034058/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/03/02/pacific-nations-want-un-investigate-indonesia-west-papua|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Indonesia rejected Vanuatu's allegations.<ref name="SBSMar17" /> Also, a joint NGO statement was made.<ref>{{cite news|title=NGOs deliver statement about the situation of indigenous Papuans at Human Rights Council|url=http://humanrightspapua.org/news/23-2017/222-ngos-deliver-statement-about-the-situation-of-indigenous-papuans-at-human-rights-council-session |work=The International Coalition for Papua: Human Rights and Peace for Papua|date=23 March 2017}}</ref> More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year [[Papua conflict]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Goodbye Indonesia |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2013/01/201313018313632585.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=31 January 2013 |access-date=30 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730063457/https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2013/01/201313018313632585.html |archive-date=30 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Disproportional focus on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
The UNHRC has been accused of anti-Israel bias, a particular criticism being its focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at each session as Agenda Item 7. The Council voted on 30 June 2006 to make a review of alleged human rights abuses by Israel a permanent feature of every council session:<ref>[https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/325B5DF6ABBFBF268525734100634561 Resolution A/HRC/RES/5/1 – Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620074159/https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/325B5DF6ABBFBF268525734100634561 |date=20 June 2018 }}, 7 August 2007</ref>

{{quote|Item 7. ''Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories''
* Human rights violations and implications of the Israeli occupation of Palestine and other occupied Arab territories
* Right to self-determination of the Palestinian people}}

None of the nine other items deals exclusively with a specific conflict. The council's [[United Nations special rapporteur|special rapporteur]] on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] is the council's only expert mandate with no year of expiry. The rapporteur between 2008 and 2014, [[Richard A.

UN Secretaries General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Ban Ki-moon]], former president of the council [[Doru Costea]], the [[European Union]], Canada, and the United States have accused the UNHRC of focusing disproportionately on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and Israel's [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]].<ref name="un.org"/><ref name="ynetnews.com"/><ref name="swissinfo.ch"/> Many allege an [[anti-Israel bias]] – the Council has resolved more resolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="un.org">[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sgsm10788.doc.htm Secretary-General urges human rights activists to ‘fill leadership vacuum’, hold world leaders to account, in address to international day event] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903143328/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sgsm10788.doc.htm |date=3 September 2014 }}, UN Department of Public Information 8 December 2008</ref><ref name="ynetnews.com">[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3415619,00.html UN's Ban faults rights council over Israel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629235609/http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3415619,00.html |date=29 June 2007 }}, Reuters (reprinted in Ynet News) 21 June 2007</ref><ref name="swissinfo.ch">[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Human_Rights_Council_president_wants_reform.html?cid=6171460 Human Rights Council president wants reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002555/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/foreign_affairs/Human_Rights_Council_president_wants_reform.html?cid=6171460 |date=11 August 2011 }}, SwissInfo 29 September 2007</ref>

[[Boris Johnson]], the then-[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] on 18 June 2018 said: “We share the view that a dedicated agenda item focused solely on Israel and the occupied [[Palestinian territories]] is disproportionate and damaging to the cause of peace."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/International/Britain-warns-UNHRC-Stop-the-bias-or-well-vote-against-anti-Israel-560274|title=Britain gives UNHRC six months to cease anti-Israel bias – World News – Jerusalem Post|website=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=27 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190927130328/https://www.jpost.com/International/Britain-warns-UNHRC-Stop-the-bias-or-well-vote-against-anti-Israel-560274|archive-date=27 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 19 June 2018, the United States pulled out of the UNHRC accusing the body of bias against Israel and a failure to hold human rights abusers accountable. [[Nikki Haley]], [[US Ambassador to the UN]] called the organisation a "cesspool of political bias".<ref name=":1">{{cite news | url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/haley-pompeo-human-rights-bias/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=US leaving UN Human Rights Council – "a cesspool of political bias." | date=19 June 2018 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620001611/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/19/politics/haley-pompeo-human-rights-bias/index.html | archive-date=20 June 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref> At UNHRC's 38th Session, on 2 July 2018, Western nations held a ''de facto'' boycott of Agenda Item 7 by not speaking to the item.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/West-holds-de-facto-boycott-of-UNHRCs-Agenda-Item-7-debate-561397|title=Western nations de-facto boycott condemnation of Israel at UNHRC – Israel News – Jerusalem Post|website=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref>

Of the 53 countries which defended China's imposition of the [[Hong Kong national security law|Hong Kong National Security Law]] following the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|2019-2020 Hong Kong protests]], at least 43 were participants in the [[Belt and Road Initiative|Chinese Belt and Road Initiative]], with one [[Axios (website)|Axios]] reporter noting that "Beijing has effectively leveraged the UN Human Rights Council to endorse the very activities it was created to oppose."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.axios.com/countries-supporting-china-hong-kong-law-0ec9bc6c-3aeb-4af0-8031-aa0f01a46a7c.html | work=Axios | title=The 53 countries supporting China's crackdown on Hong Kong | date=3 July 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725001632/https://www.axios.com/countries-supporting-china-hong-kong-law-0ec9bc6c-3aeb-4af0-8031-aa0f01a46a7c.html | access-date=25 July 2020| archive-date=25 July 2020 }}</ref>

Ban Ki-Moon also appealed for the United States to fully join the council and play a more active role.<ref name=xinhua/>

The UNHRC was criticized in 2009 for adopting a resolution submitted by Sri Lanka praising its conduct in [[Vanni (Sri Lanka)|Vanni]] that year, ignoring pleas for an international war crimes investigation.<ref name=timestam>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6375044.ece "Sri Lanka forces West to retreat over ‘war crimes’ with victory at UN"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826173447/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6375044.ece |date=26 August 2009 }}, Times, 28 May 2009</ref>

===Accountability program===
On 18 June 2007, one year after holding its first meeting, the UNHRC adopted its ''Institution-building package'', to guide it in its future work. Among its elements was the [[United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review|Universal Periodic Review]], which assesses the human rights situations in all 193 UN member states. Another element is an [[#Advisory Committee|''Advisory Committee'']], which serves as the UNHRC's ''think tank'' and provides it with expertise and advice on thematic human rights issues. A further element is a [[#Complaint procedure|''Complaint procedure'']], which allows individuals and organizations to bring complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the council.

In the election of members, the General Assembly takes into account each candidate state's contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights, as well as their voluntary pledges and commitments in this regard. The General Assembly, by a two-thirds majority, can suspend the rights and privileges of any council member that it decides has persistently committed gross and systematic violations of human rights during its term of membership. The resolution establishing the UNHRC states that "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights".<ref name="http">{{cite web |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/A.RES.60.251_En.pdf |title=UN General Assembly Resolution 60/251.8 |access-date=18 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618102047/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/A.RES.60.251_En.pdf |archive-date=18 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>
