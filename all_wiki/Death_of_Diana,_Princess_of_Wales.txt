Diana feared for her life and had written about it in a letter, ten months before her death. She had given the letter to her butler, Paul Burrell.

Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 [[Mercedes-Benz W140]] in order to elude the [[paparazzi]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6217366.stm|title=Timeline: How Diana died|date=14 December 2006|work=BBC News|access-date=13 October 2008}}</ref> a [[decoy]] vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on [[Place Vendôme]], attracting a throng of photographers.

===The crash===
At 00:23, Paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel.

==Reactions==
[[File:Correspondence regarding death of Diana, Princess of Wales (1997) (20393151714).jpg|thumb|Official correspondence by the [[Government of New Zealand]] regarding Diana's death]]
Some criticised the reaction to Diana's death at the time as being "hysterical" and "irrational". As early as 1998, philosopher [[Anthony O'Hear]] identified the mourning as a defining point in the "sentimentalisation of Britain", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.<ref>[[O'Hear, Anthony]] (1998) "Diana, Queen of Hearts: Sentimentality personified and canonised" in Anderson and Mullen ''Faking It: The sentimentalisation of modern society'', [[Social Affairs Unit]], {{ISBN|978-0-907631-75-0}}</ref> [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] bandleader [[Noel Gallagher]] responded to the reaction with, "The woman's dead. Shut up. Get over it".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1425553/oasis-noel-sounds-off-on-paul-mccartney-diana-mourners/|title=Oasis' Noel Sounds Off On Paul McCartney, Diana Mourners|date=10 October 1997|work=MTV|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref> These criticisms were repeated on the tenth anniversary of the crash, when journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]] of ''[[The Guardian ]]'' expressed the opinion that, "It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it." In 2010, [[Theodore Dalrymple]] suggested "sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself".<ref>{{cite book|title=Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality|last=Dalrymple|first=Theodore|publisher=Gibson Square Books Ltd|year=2010|isbn=978-1-906142-61-2|page=154}}</ref>

Some cultural analysts disagreed. Sociologist [[Deborah Lynn Steinberg|Deborah Steinberg]] pointed out that many Britons associated Diana not with the Royal Family but with social change and a more liberal society: "I don't think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070830/diana_grieving_070831/20070831/|title=Hysteria after Diana's death: A myth or reality?|author=Sandie Benitah|date=31 August 2007|work=CTV News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903042643/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070830/diana_grieving_070831/20070831/|archive-date=3 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Carol Wallace of [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]] said that the fascination with Diana's death had to do with "the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13458191/|title=Fascination With Princess Diana As Great in Death as it Was in Life|last=Kane|first=Karen|date=1 September 1997|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=30 August 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>

A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen's private secretary, Sir [[Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes|Robert Fellowes]] (Diana's brother-in-law), was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess' funeral should be, with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen's idea of a private one.<ref name="Public-Private">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/16/world/queen-issues-feisty-denial-of-disputes-over-funeral.html|title=Queen Issues Feisty Denial Of Disputes Over Funeral|publisher=The New York Times|first=Youssef M.|last=Ibrahim|date=16 September 1997|access-date=17 March 2018}}</ref> The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.<ref name="Public-Private"/>

During the four weeks following her funeral, the [[suicide rate]] in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of [[Self-injury|deliberate self-harm]] by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years.

The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected [[productivity]], and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200&nbsp;million, or a total loss of 0.1% of [[gross domestic product]] for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.<ref name="Economic effect">{{cite news|last=Marks|first=Kathy|title=Diana 1961–1997: The legacy – Death to affect British economy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/diana-1961-1997-the-legacy-death-to-affect-british-economy-1238058.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=7 September 1997|access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref>

The reactions following Diana's death were subject of criticism by [[Christopher Hitchens]]. His 1998 documentary ''Princess Diana: The Mourning After'' accused the British media of playing an essential role in creating a national, unchallengeable, and at times hysterical [[cult of personality]] surrounding the death of Diana, whereas previously they had been extremely critical of her and the monarchy after she had separated and divorced from Charles, and was having an affair with Dodi Fayed. Hitchens claimed the public were behaving irrationally, and that many appeared to not even know why they were mourning. He also scrutinised the level of censorship against criticism of Diana and the monarchy but was accused, in a review by ''[[The Independent]]'', of exaggerating on this point.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-its-a-state-of-total-dianarchy-1175026.html |title=Television: It's a state of total Dianarchy |author=Nicholas Barber |work=The Independent |date=30 August 1998 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref> ''[[Private Eye]]''{{'}}s sales dropped by one third after it ran a cover titled "Media to Blame", which attempted to criticize the instant switch in the media and the public's opinion of Diana after her death from critical to complimentary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/princess-diana-press-private-eye-censorship-paparazzi-public-grief-outpouring-a7922591.html|title=The attempts to censor Private Eye after Diana's death remind us of how a nation went mad with grief|newspaper=The Independent|first=Peyvand|last=Khorsandi|date=31 August 2017|accessdate=2 December 2020}}</ref>

Christopher Hitchens's views were later supported by [[Jonathan Freedland]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' who also questioned the reason behind the "outburst of mass hysteria" following Diana's death and described it as "an episode when the British public lost its characteristic cool and engaged in seven days of bogus sentimentality, whipped up by the media, and whose flimsiness was demonstrated when it vanished as quickly as it had appeared".<ref name="Fade-Legacy">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/13/britishidentity.monarchy|title=A moment of madness?|work=The Guardian|date=12 August 2007|access-date=2 February 2017|first=Jonathan|last=Freedland|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203172846/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/13/britishidentity.monarchy|archive-date=3 February 2017}}</ref> Comparing Diana's funeral to [[Death and state funeral of Winston Churchill|that of Winston Churchill]], [[Peter Hitchens]] noted the "difference in the self-discipline of the people and their attitudes" at the two historical events, with them being more restrained at Churchill's funeral but "un-English" at Diana's.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?159943-1/the-abolition-britain|title=The Abolition of Britain|publisher=C-SPAN|date=20 October 2000|accessdate=1 December 2020}}</ref>

A permanent memorial, the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain]], was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/hyde-park-attractions/diana-memorial-fountain|title=Diana Memorial Fountain|work=The Royal Parks|access-date=25 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810143439/http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/hyde-park-attractions/diana-memorial-fountain|archive-date=10 August 2013}}</ref>

Later in 2004, US television network [[CBS]] showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were "part of a 4,000-page French government report." It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat{{snd}}the right rear door is fully open.

The British newspaper ''[[The Daily Express]]'' has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Diana following her death. A 2006 report in ''The Guardian'' showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including, "Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt", "Diana inquiry chief's laptop secrets stolen", "£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain" and "Diana seatbelt sabotage probe".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/may/09/pressandpublishing.themonarchy|title=Any old Diana headline here|date=9 May 2006|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=30 August 2017}}</ref>

===Internet coverage===
Diana's death occurred at a time when [[Internet]] use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. [[BBC News]] had set up online coverage of the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] earlier in 1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online/|title=Major events influenced BBC's news online|date=5 June 2008|work=Fresh Networks|access-date=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228193301/http://www.freshnetworks.com/blog/2008/06/major-events-influenced-bbcs-news-online/|archive-date=28 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana's death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana's death and the events that followed it. Diana's death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full [[BBC News Online|online news service]] was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC's rolling news channel [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] on 9 November.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/|title=Diana Remembered|work=BBC|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref>
