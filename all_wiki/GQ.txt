'''''GQ''''' (formerly '''''Gentlemen's Quarterly''''') is an international monthly [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]] based in [[New York City]] and founded in 1931. The publication focuses on fashion, style, and culture for men, though articles on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, travel, sports, technology, and books are also featured.

== History ==
''Gentlemen's Quarterly'' was launched in 1931 in the United States as ''Apparel Arts''.<ref name=Sterlacci101>{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of the Fashion Industry| last=Sterlacci| first=Francesca| author2=Joanne Arbucklee|year=2009| publisher=Scarecrow Press| location=Lanham, MD| isbn=978-0810870468| page=101| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPKScm9h6v0C&pg=PA101| accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref> It was a men's fashion magazine for the clothing trade, aimed primarily at wholesale buyers and retail sellers. Initially it had a very limited print run and was aimed solely at industry insiders to enable them to give advice to their customers. The popularity of the magazine among retail customers, who often took the magazine from the retailers, spurred the creation of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in 1933.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Esquire-American-magazine|title=Esquire {{!}} American magazine| work=Encyclopedia Britannica| access-date=March 6, 2018| language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://dkcnews.com/esquire-blog-draft/| title=History of Esquire Magazine| date=May 21, 2015| work=DKC| access-date=March 6, 2018| language=en-US}}</ref>

''Apparel Arts'' continued until 1957 when it was transformed into a quarterly magazine for men, which was published for many years by Esquire Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philsp.com/data/data140.html|title=Magazine Data, page 140: Gentlemen's Quarterly|accessdate=January 13, 2009}}</ref> Apparel was dropped from the logo in 1958 with the spring issue after nine issues, and the name ''Gentlemen's Quarterly'' was established.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/GQ| title=GQ: American magazine| work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| access-date=August 22, 2017| language=en}}</ref>

''Gentlemen's Quarterly'' was re-branded as ''GQ'' in 1967.<ref name=Sterlacci101/> The rate of publication was increased from quarterly to monthly in 1970.<ref name=Sterlacci101/> In 1979 [[Condé Nast]] bought the publication, and editor [[Art Cooper]] changed the course of the magazine, introducing articles beyond fashion and establishing ''GQ'' as a general men's magazine in competition with ''Esquire''.<ref>{{cite news| issn=0362-4331| title=Advertising| work=The New York Times| accessdate=December 22, 2019| date=February 16, 1979| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/advertising-conde-buys-a-mens-magazine.html}}</ref> Subsequently, international editions were launched as regional adaptations of the U.S. editorial formula. Jim Nelson was named editor-in-chief of ''GQ'' in February 2003; during his tenure, he worked as both a writer and an editor of several [[National Magazine Award]]-nominated pieces,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} and the magazine became more oriented towards younger readers and those who prefer a more casual style.

[[Nonnie Moore]] was hired by ''GQ'' as fashion editor in 1984, having served in the same position at [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|''Mademoiselle'']] and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''. Jim Moore, the magazine's fashion director at the time of her death in 2009, described the choice as unusual, observing that "She was not from men's wear, so people said she was an odd choice, but she was actually the perfect choice". Jim Moore also noted that she changed the publication's more casual look: "She helped dress up the pages, as well as dress up the men, while making the mix more exciting and varied and approachable for men."<ref>{{cite news| title=Nonnie Moore, Fashion Editor at Magazines, Dies at 87| first=Dennis| last=Hevesi| date=February 24, 2009| accessdate=February 26, 2009| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/business/media/25moore.html| work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

''GQ'' has been closely associated with [[metrosexual]]ity. The writer [[Mark Simpson (journalist)|Mark Simpson]] coined the term in an article for British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' about his visit to a ''GQ'' exhibition in London: "The promotion of metrosexuality was left to the men's style press, magazines such as [[The Face (magazine)|''The Face'']], ''GQ'', ''Esquire'', [[Arena (magazine)|''Arena'']] and ''[[FHM]]'', the new media which took off in the Eighties and is still growing ... They filled their magazines with images of narcissistic young men sporting fashionable clothes and accessories. And they persuaded other young men to study them with a mixture of envy and desire."<ref>{{cite news| last=Simpson| first=Mark| date=November 15, 1994| title=Here Come the Mirror Men| work=The Independent| location=London| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Safire|first=William|date=December 7, 2003|title=On Language; Metrosexual|language=en-US| newspaper=The New York Times| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-12-7-03-on-language-metrosexual.html| url-status=live| access-date=May 24, 2020| issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The magazine has expanded its coverage beyond lifestyle issues. For example, in 2003, journalist [[Sabrina Rubin Erdely]] wrote an eight-page feature story in ''GQ'' on famous con man [[Steve Comisar]].<ref name="GQ">{{cite journal| url=http://sabrinaerdely.com/docs/TheCreepWithTheGoldenTongue.pdf| title=The Creep With the Golden Tongue| first=Sabrina R.| last=Erdely| journal=GQ| date=August 2003| pages=126–132, 155–156}}</ref> ''GQ'' has been called the "holy text of [[woke]] capital, according to ''[[The Spectator]]''.  <ref>{{cite news| title=GQ is a holy text of woke capital| first=Ben| last=Sixsmith| date=October 19, 2019| accessdate=January 21, 2020| url=https://spectator.us/gq-holy-text-woke-capital| work=[[The Spectator]]}}</ref>

In 2016, ''GQ'' launched the spinoff quarterly ''GQ Style''.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Inside the GQ Style Launch Party Photo Booth| journal=GQ| accessdate=June 9, 2019| url=https://www.gq.com/gallery/gq-style-launch-party-photo-booth}}</ref>

In 2018, writing for ''GQ'', [[Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]] for her article about [[Dylann Roof]], who had [[Charleston church shooting|shot nine Afro-Americans in a church in Charleston]].<ref>[http://orf.at/#/stories/2434433/ Pulitzer-Preis für Weinstein-Enthüllungen] orf.at, April 16, 2018, retrieved April 17, 2018.

== Controversies ==

=== ''Glee'' controversy ===
In 2010, ''GQ'' magazine had three adult members of the television show [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']] ([[Dianna Agron]], [[Lea Michele]] and [[Cory Monteith]]) partake in a photoshoot.<ref name=nellie>{{cite news| last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie| title=Racy 'Glee' GQ Shoot Creates Controversy| url=https://deadline.com/2010/10/racy-glee-gq-shoot-creates-controversy-77208/| journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref> The sexualization of the actresses in the photos caused controversy among parents of teens who watch the show ''Glee''. The [[Parents Television Council]] was the first to react to the photo spread when it was leaked prior to GQ's planned publishing date. Their President Tim Winter stated, "By authorizing this kind of near-pornographic display, the creators of the program have established their intentions on the show's directions. And it isn't good for families".<ref>{{cite web| last1=de Moraes| first1=Lisa| title=Racy GQ photo spread gives you all the 'Glee' you could expect to see, and so much more| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/20/AR2010102006278.html| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| accessdate=February 28, 2015}}</ref> The photoshoot was published as planned and Dianna Agron went on to state that the photos that were taken did not represent who she is and that she was sorry if anyone was offended by them.<ref name=nellie/> 

=== Russian apartment bombings ===
''GQ''{{'}}s September 2009 U.S. magazine published, in its "backstory" section, an article by [[Scott Anderson (novelist)|Scott Anderson]], "None Dare Call It Conspiracy". Before ''GQ'' published the article, an internal email from a Condé Nast lawyer referred to it as "Vladimir Putin's Dark Rise to Power".<ref>{{cite journal| journal=GQ| title=None Dare Call It Conspiracy| author=Anderson, Scott| date=September 2009|page=246}}</ref> The article reported Anderson's investigation of the 1999 [[Russian apartment bombings]], and included interviews with [[Mikhail Trepashkin]] who investigated the bombings while he was a [[colonel]] in Russia's [[Federal Security Service]].

The story, including Trepashkin's own findings, contradicted the Russian Government's official explanation of the bombings and criticized [[Vladimir Putin]], the [[President of Russia]].<ref name="NPR 2009-09-04"/>

Condé Nast's management tried to keep the story out of Russia. It ordered executives and editors not to distribute that issue in Russia or show it to "Russian government officials, journalists or advertisers".<ref name="NPR 2009-09-04"/> Management decided not to publish the story on ''GQ''{{'}}s website or in Condé Nast's foreign magazines, not to publicize the story, and asked Anderson not to syndicate the story "to any publications that appear in Russia".<ref name="NPR 2009-09-04">{{cite episode| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112530364| title=Why 'GQ' Doesn't Want Russians To Read Its Story| author=Folkenflik, David| authorlink=David Folkenflik| series=[[Morning Edition]]| network=[[NPR]]| date=September 4, 2009| accessdate=July 16, 2020}}</ref>

=== Criticism of the Bible and Western literary canon ===

On April 19, 2018, the editors of ''GQ'' published an article titled "21 Books You Don't Have to Read" in which the editors compiled a list of works they think are overrated and should be passed over, including ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]'', ''[[Blood Meridian]]'', ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Catch-22]].''<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.gq.com/story/21-books-you-dont-have-to-read| title=21 Books You Don't Have to Read| journal=GQ| date=April 19, 2018| accessdate=October 12, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Bryant>{{cite news| url=https://nylon.com/articles/gq-books-dont-have-to-read-white-men| title=White Men Are Mad That This 'GQ' List Dismisses Books By White Men| date=April 20, 2018| journal=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]| last=Bryant| first=Taylor| access-date=April 21, 2018| language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://ew.com/books/2018/04/20/western-books-list-gq/| title=GQ suggests people not read Catch-22, Catcher in the Rye, more — and it's totally fine| journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| first= Dana| last=Schwartz|  date=April 20, 2018| accessdate=July 16, 2020}}</ref> ''GQ'''s review included a criticism of the [[Bible]], calling it "repetitive, self-contradictory, [[:wikt:sententious|sententious]], foolish, and even at times ill-intentioned".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/gq-magazine-condemns-holy-bible-repetitive-self-contradictory-sententious| title=GQ Condemns the Holy Bible: 'Repetitive, Self-Contradictory, Sententious, Foolish…Ill-Intentioned'| website=CNS News| first=Craig| last=Bannister| date=April 20, 2018 | language=en| accessdate=July 16, 2020}}</ref> The article generated a backlash among Internet commentators.<ref name=Bryant/>
