He served as [[Czechoslovakia]]'s ambassador to [[Yugoslavia]], the chair of the [[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]], and then as a professor of international politics at the [[University of Denver]], where he founded the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]].

==Background and career==
Josef was born on 20 September 1909 to Jewish parents [[Arnost and Olga Korbel]], both of whom were killed in the Holocaust.<ref name=dobbs>Michael Dobbs, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/admin/stories/albright020497.htm "Albright's Family Tragedy Comes to Light"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' February 4, 1997, p. A01.</ref> At the time of his daughter Madeleine's birth, Josef was serving as press-attaché at the Czechoslovak Embassy in [[Belgrade]].<ref name=Denver/>

Though he served as a diplomat in [[First Czechoslovak Republic|the government of Czechoslovakia]], Korbel's politics and Judaism forced him to flee with his wife and baby Madeleine after the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] invasion in 1939 and move to London. Korbel served as an advisor to [[Edvard Beneš]], in the Czech government in exile. He gave speeches for the BBC's daily broadcasts to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.<ref name=legacy/><ref name="KovenGötzke2010">{{citation |last1=Koven |first1=Steven G. |last2=Götzke |first2=Frank |title=American Immigration Policy: Confronting the Nation's Challenges |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq04PFuRmQgC&pg=PA159 |date=2010 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-95940-5 |page=159}}</ref> During their time in England the Korbels converted to Catholicism.<ref name=dobbs/>

Korbel returned to Czechoslovakia after the war, receiving a luxurious [[Prague]] apartment expropriated from Karl Nebrich, a [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918-1938)|Bohemian German]] industrialist [[expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] under the [[Beneš decrees]].<ref name=Germans/> Korbel was appointed as the Czechoslovak ambassador to [[Yugoslavia]], where he remained until the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|Communist coup in Czechoslovakia]] in May 1948. Around this time, he was named a delegate to the [[United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan]] to mediate on the [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir dispute]]. He served as its chair, and subsequently wrote several articles and a book on the Kashmir problem.<ref name=Denver/>

Following the [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|Communist Party's rise to power in 1948]], in 1949 Korbel applied for political asylum in the United States stating that he would be arrested in Czechoslovakia for his "faithful adherence to the ideals of democracy." He received asylum and also a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to teach [[international politics]] at the [[University of Denver]]. In 1964, with the benefaction of Ben Cherrington, Korbel established the Graduate School of International Studies and became its founding Dean.<ref name=Denver>[http://www.du.edu/korbel/about/history.html About us],  Josef Korbel School of International Studies, University of Denver, retrieved May 15, 2016.</ref><ref name="KovenGötzke2010"/> One of his students was [[Condoleezza Rice]], the first woman appointed [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] (2001) and the first African-American woman appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (2005). Korbel's daughter Madeleine became the first female [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in 1997. Both of them have testified to his substantial influence on their careers in foreign policy and international relations.<ref name=legacy>Michael Dobbs, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/28/josef-korbels-enduring-foreign-policy-legacy/8d31958e-07e6-4aff-a3a5-0426f487c9fe/ Josef Korbel's Enduring Foreign Policy Legacy] ''[[Washington Post]]'' December 28, 2000.</ref>

After his death, the University of Denver established the Josef Korbel Humanitarian Award in 2000. Since then, 28 people have received it.

===Danger in Kashmir===
Norman Palmer notes in a review of Korbel's book ''Danger in Kashmir'' that Korbel covers the same ground as Michael Brecher.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=Norman|title=Danger in Kashmir - Book Review|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=March 1955|volume=298|pages=223–224}}</ref> Yashina Tarr sees that Korbel has succeeded in providing an objective assessment of the United Nations' work and recommends it to readers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tarr|first1=Yashina|title=Danger in Kashmir - Book Review|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=1955|volume=9|issue=1|page=121}}</ref> Birdwood labels the content on the United Nations Commission involvement "authoritative" due to Korbel's own membership in the Commission. He also observes that the huge number of footnotes and quotations testify to Korbel's vast research put into this "valuable contribution" on the Kashmir dispute.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Birdwood|title=Danger in Kashmir - Book Review|journal=International Affairs|date=July 1955|volume=31|issue=3|pages=395–396}}</ref> Werner Levi observes that Korbel tends to abstain from giving his own judgements and evaluations. Levi states that Korbel's book is a "comprehensive and balanced statement" of a contested topic.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Levi|first1=Werner|title=Danger in Kashmir - Book Review|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=September 1955|volume=28|issue=3|pages=288–289}}</ref>

== Artwork ownership controversy==
Philipp Harmer, an [[Austria]]n citizen, filed a lawsuit claiming that Josef Korbel's family is in inappropriate possession of artwork belonging to his great-grandfather, the German entrepreneur Karl Nebrich. Like most other ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, Nebrich and his family were expelled from the country under the postwar "Beneš decrees", and left behind artwork and furniture in an apartment subsequently given to Korbel's family, before they also were forced to flee the country.<ref name=Germans>Suzanne Smalley: [http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/31921-germans-lost-their-art-too.html Germans lost their art, too.
