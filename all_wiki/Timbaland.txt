Timbaland's first full credit production work was in 1996 on ''[[Ginuwine...the Bachelor]]'' for [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Ginuwine]]. After further work on [[Aaliyah]]'s second studio album ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' (1996) and [[Missy Elliott]]'s debut studio album ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'' (1997), Timbaland became a prominent producer for R&B and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists. As a rapper he initially released several albums with fellow rapper [[Magoo (rapper)|Magoo]], followed by his debut solo album ''[[Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment|Tim's Bio]]'' in 1998. In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" for [[Justin Timberlake]], going on to produce most of Timberlake's subsequent LPs such as ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and their respective hit singles. A Timbaland-owned imprint label, [[Mosley Music Group]], featured artists such as [[Nelly Furtado]], whose Timbaland-produced album ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' (2006) was a commercial and critical success. In 2007, Timbaland released a solo album, ''[[Shock Value (Timbaland album)|Shock Value]]'', which was followed by ''[[Shock Value II]]'' in 2009. Later in his career he was responsible, along with [[Swizz Beatz]], for creating the popular webcast series ''[[Verzuz]]'' in 2020.

Aside from the aforementioned artists, Timbaland's production credits from the 2000s forward include work with [[Jay-Z]], [[Nas]], [[Ludacris]], [[Bubba Sparxxx]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Rihanna]], [[OneRepublic]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], [[Rick Ross]] and others. As a songwriter, he has written 85 UK hits and 99 hits Stateside, as of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOAW274#reader_B00LOAW274|title=Amazon.com: The People Who Created The Soundtrack To Your Life eBook: stuart devoy: Kindle Store|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref> Timbaland has received widespread acclaim for his production style. In 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that "just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him — from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses ... to the art of incorporating [[avant-garde]] sounds into No. 1 hits."<ref name="ew">{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Ethan|title=Timbaland wants to be his own star|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2007/03/23/timbaland-wants-be-his-own-star|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref>

("Timbaland is 38; Sebastian declines to give his age but is likely around 29.")</ref> His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and an author from [[New Jersey]]. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured [[The Neptunes|Neptunes]] producer [[Pharrell Williams]].<ref name="timbalandmusic"/> Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as [[Pusha T]] and Malice of the rap group [[Clipse]], respectively.<ref name="xxl.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=65847 |title=XXLmag.com |publisher=XXLmag.com |access-date=July 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117031032/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=65847 |archive-date=January 17, 2010 }}</ref> In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local [[Red Lobster (restaurant)|Red Lobster]] restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months.<ref>[http://www.complex.com/music/2013/01/a-history-of-rappers-getting-shot-and-surviving/timbaland "A History of Rappers Getting Shot and Surviving"] January 28, 2013</ref> During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015777,00.html|title=Everyone Wants Timbaland|author=Ethan Brown|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 23, 2007|quote=He made ends meet with a series of menial jobs, including washing dishes at a Red Lobster, until late one night he wound up on the wrong end of a gun. The bullet passed through Tim's neck and lodged in his right shoulder (fragments remain to this day). For nine months, Tim was paralyzed on his right side, forcing him to learn to DJ with his left hand.<br/>Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. ''I'm not a rapper," he says dismissively. ''I'm not talking about my scars or my battles.'' Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. ''I'll tell you this,'' Tim says. ''If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like any minute you gonna be dyin'.''}}</ref>

Singer and rapper [[Missy Elliott]] heard his material and began working with him. She and her R&B group, Sista, auditioned for [[DeVante Swing]], a producer and member of the successful R&B act [[Jodeci]]. DeVante signed Sista to his Swing Mob record label and Elliott brought Mosley and Barcliff along with her to New York, where Swing Mob was based. It was DeVante who renamed the young producer Timbaland, after the [[The Timberland Company|Timberland]] brand of construction boots.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} He and Magoo became part of SCI Zakys School stable of Swing Mob signees known as "Da Bassment" crew, joining artists such as R&B singer [[Ginuwine]], male vocal group [[Playa (band)|Playa]] ([[Smoke E. Digglera]], [[Static Major]] and Digital Black), and the girl group Sugah.<ref name="timbalandmusic"/> Timbaland did production work on a number of projects with DeVante, including the 1995 Jodeci LP ''[[The Show, The After-Party, The Hotel]]'', and Sista's (unreleased) début LP ''[[4 All the Sistas Around da World]]''. Elliott began receiving recognition as a songwriter for artists such as R&B girl group 702 and [[MC Lyte]]. Due to Timbaland's connection with her, he was often contacted to produce remixes of her songs.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/9850,213743,2083,22.html|title=Tim's Brio |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]}}</ref>

==Career==
===1994–2002: Focus on production work and ''Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment''===
Timbaland began his producing career for [[R&B]] acts. In the early-1990s, he produced a few songs for R&B acts such as [[Jodeci]] and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both [[Aaliyah]]'s second album ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]'' and [[Ginuwine]]'s debut album ''[[Ginuwine...the Bachelor]]''. This included the major hit singles "[[If Your Girl Only Knew]]" by [[Aaliyah]] and "[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]" by [[Ginuwine]]. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&B artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R&B, and in this way his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R&B production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier |first=Jason |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/timbaland-p218225 |title=Timbaland |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> In 1997, he fully produced ''[[Supa Dupa Fly]]'', the debut album of [[Missy Elliott]], who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner [[Magoo (rapper)|Magoo]], ''[[Welcome to Our World]]'', also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including [[Jay-Z]], [[Nas]], and [[The LOX]]. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group [[UGK]] with the hit "[[Big Pimpin']]". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, ''[[Da Real World]]''. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R&B artists. He continued to produce for [[Ginuwine]] and [[Aaliyah]], as well as contributing significantly to albums by [[Xscape (band)|Xscape]], [[Nicole Wray|Nicole]], [[Playa (band)|Playa]], and [[Total (music)|Total]]. He remixed [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]'s major hit "[[You Make Me Wanna]]". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including [[Ludacris]]' "Roll Out (My Business)",<ref>{{cite news|access-date=April 29, 2008 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/10/07/2003-10-07_ludacris_hits_the_silly_summ.html |title=LUDACRIS HITS THE SILLY SUMMIT |publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |date=October 7, 2003 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511044140/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/10/07/2003-10-07_ludacris_hits_the_silly_summ.html |archive-date=May 11, 2009 }}</ref> Jay-Z's "Hola' Hovito",<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 29, 2008|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/blogs/statusainthood/archives/2007/04/jayz_and_timbal.php|title=Jay-Z and Timbaland, Together Again |publisher=[[Village Voice]]}}</ref> [[Petey Pablo]]'s "Raise Up",<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 29, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452482/20020220/pablo_petey.jhtml|title=Petey Pablo, The Black Robert De Niro? |publisher=MTV}}</ref> and [[Beck]]'s cover of [[David Bowie]]'s "Diamond Dogs" during this period.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 29, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1438577/20010126/timbaland.jhtml|title=Timbaland Film Vying For Sundance Grand Jury Prize |publisher=MTV}}</ref> He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to [[Aaliyah]]’s self-titled third album, the exotic lead single "[[We Need a Resolution]]" (featuring himself rapping a verse), "[[More than a Woman (Aaliyah song)|More than a Woman]]", and the ballad "[[I Care 4 U]]".<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 29, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442244/20010328/aaliyah.jhtml|title=Aaliyah Finds 'Resolution' With New Single, Video |publisher=MTV}}</ref> He also makes an appearance in [[Aaliyah]]'s single "[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]", which he also produced and co-wrote.

Timbaland & Magoo’s second album together was slated for release in November 2000. ''Indecent Proposal'' was to feature appearances by [[Beck]], [[Aaliyah]], as well as new Timbaland protégés—some from his new Beat Club Records imprint--[[Ms. Jade]], [[Kiley Dean]], [[Sebastian (rapper)|Sebastian]] (Timbaland's brother), [[Petey Pablo]], and [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]] (who was a member of Sugah during the Swing Mob days). The album was delayed for an entire year, finally released in November 2001. It was a commercial disappointment. Beck’s vocals for the track "I Am Music" were not included on the last version, which instead featured Timbaland singing along [[Steve "Static" Garrett]] of Playa and Aaliyah.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448808/20010911/story.jhtml|title=Timbaland To Release Aaliyah / Beck Duet |publisher=MTV}}</ref> The first release on Beat Club was the début album by [[Bubba Sparxxx]] in September 2001, ''[[Dark Days, Bright Nights]]''.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=April 25, 2008 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/timbaland/articles/story/5932482/timbaland_launches_label |title=Timbaland Launches Label |work=Rolling Stone |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220212711/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/timbaland/articles/story/5932482/timbaland_launches_label |archive-date=December 20, 2007 }}</ref> The loss of [[Aaliyah]] deeply affected Timbaland. In a phone call to the MTV show ''[[Total Request Live]]'', Timbaland said: {{quote|She was like blood, and I lost blood. Me and her together had this chemistry.

==Legacy and influence==
An important figure in the creation of American R&B's "stuttering kick-drums template,"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Energy Flash : A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|publisher=Soft Skull Press|year=2012|page=449}}</ref> Timbaland's influence extended beyond the U.S. and crossed international waters, especially in [[UK garage#cite note-Reynolds 2012 449–451-5|UK garage]] and rave culture. Timbaland, as an R&B producer, created a distinctive, rhythmic sound using breakbeats, which break up the smooth flow of tracks to create moments of tension and release. This technique that Timbaland pioneered would later serve to create "bootleg" garage tracks, which was essential in the rise of UK garage. What began as an underground movement soon grew in popularity, with bootleg remixes selling upwards of 20,000 copies, something unheard of at the time. One such example is the remix of Brandy & Monica's "[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|publisher=Soft Skull Press|year=2012|page=450}}</ref>

==Plagiarism accusations==
{{Main|Timbaland plagiarism controversy}}
In January 2007, Timbaland was alleged to have plagiarized several elements (both motifs and samples) in the song "[[Do It (Nelly Furtado song)|Do It]]" on the 2006 album ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' by [[Nelly Furtado]] without giving credit or compensation.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/18/is-timbaland-a-thief/|title=Is Timbaland a Thief?|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 18, 2007|access-date=April 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417014937/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/01/18/is-timbaland-a-thief/ <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=April 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Iltalehti">[http://www.iltalehti.fi/popstars/200701145593138_ps.shtml Onko Nellyn hitti Suomesta?] ('''Finnish''')<!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --></ref><ref name="eDome">[http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta Yhdysvaltalaistuottaja pölli suomalaismuusikolta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223023640/http://plaza.fi/harrastukset/edome/artikkelit/yleiset/yhdysvaltalaistuottaja-polli-suomalaismuusikolta |date=February 23, 2007 }} ('''Finnish''')<!-- An English alternative for this source would be appropriate, as it is not too hard to find (an American matter, after all). --></ref> The song itself was released as the fifth North American [[single (music)|single]] from ''Loose'' in July 2007.

Timbaland's legal troubles continued. In lieu of a copyright lawsuit over the song "[[Throw It on Me]]" from his ''Shock Value'' album, Timbaland and David Cortopassi, the composer of "Spazz", a song originally recorded by The Elastik Band and released by ATCO/Atlantic and EMI, reached a settlement agreement in July 2009.<ref name=allhspazz>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Winslow|title=Timbaland Settles 'Spazz' Lawsuit For Undisclosed Amount|newspaper=AllHipHop News|date=May 24, 2010|url=http://allhiphop.com/2010/05/24/timbaland-settles-spazz-lawsuit-for-undisclosed-amount}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Smokey|last=Fontaine|title=Timbaland Settles 'Spazz' Lawsuit For Undisclosed Amount|newspaper=The Urban Dailey|date=May 24, 2010|url=http://theurbandaily.com/771545/timbaland-settles-spazz-lawsuit-for-undisclosed-amount}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Copsey|title=Timbaland settles copywright lawsuit|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=May 25, 2010|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a221657/timbaland-settles-copywright-lawsuit.html}}</ref> The terms of the settlement remained undisclosed at the time.<ref name=allhspazz/> "Spazz", noted as being "one of the most tasteless records ever made", was initially banned by radio stations and even pulled mid-stream while on air when first released in 1967,<ref name=allhspazz/> with the DJ even apologizing to his listeners for playing the record.<ref>{{cite news

In January 2014, the Swiss newspaper [[Basler Zeitung]] revealed another plagiarism case concerning the track "Versus" by Jay-Z, which was produced by Timbaland. The track's instrumental is very similar to, if not directly sampled from "On the Way" by Swiss musician [[Bruno Spoerri]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Fabienne|last=Klenger|title=Jay-Z kupfert von Basler Jazzmusiker ab|newspaper=Basler Zeitung|date=January 27, 2014|url=http://bazonline.ch/schweiz/standard/JayZ-kupfert-von-Basler-Jazzmusiker-ab/story/26425247}}</ref> According to Swiss newspaper [[Tages Anzeiger]], the plagiarism case was settled by March 2015. [[Jay-Z]] and Timbaland were to pay 50% from the song's revenue to Spoerri as royalties for the music, with [[Jay-Z]] retaining 50% for the lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/pop-und-jazz/Jay-Z-muss-Spoerri-entloehnen/story/20944469|title=Jay Z muss Spoerri entlöhnen|website=tagesanzeiger.ch}}</ref>
