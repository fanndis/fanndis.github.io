'''North West Durham''' is a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]]{{#tag:ref|A [[county constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}} represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since [[2019 United Kingdom general election|12 December 2019]] by [[Richard Holden (British politician)|Richard Holden]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

==History==
;1885–1918
A first incarnation of the seat occurred under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] however this was abolished in 1918 to create [[Consett (UK Parliament constituency)|Consett]] and to enlarge, using its Weardale part, [[Barnard Castle (UK Parliament constituency)|Barnard Castle]]. During the first creation, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] represented the area and the first member until 1914 was the son of a prominent [[Chartism|Chartist]], Ernest Jones, and helped to promote New Liberalism, encouraging the Liberal Party to take on instead the politics of "mass working-class" appeal. This politics was epitomised by [[David Lloyd George]] whose [[People's Budget]] in 1909 led to the supremacy of the House of Commons over the [[House of Lords]] in [[Parliament Act 1911|1911]], national pensions under a basic [[welfare state]] (but without a [[National Health Service]]).

;1950–present
On its recreation in 1950, North-West Durham became the successor to Barnard Castle save for the town of that name and its immediate vicinity which instead joined the [[Bishop Auckland (UK Parliament constituency)|Bishop Auckland]] seat. [[Consett (UK Parliament constituency)|Consett]] was abolished in 1983 having seen a gradual decline in population in the latter half of its years, and its area was added to North West Durham that year. Until December 2019, this seat has been represented in Westminster by members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], it is now represented by [[Richard Holden (British politician)|Richard Holden]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

Both the future Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]], and the future Liberal Democrat leader, [[Tim Farron]], were candidates for their respective parties at this seat for the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], which both of them lost to incumbent Labour MP [[Hilary Armstrong]].

The constituency is in the north west of [[County Durham]], in the [[North East England]] region. When it was created in 1885 it centred on two main communities, [[Consett]] and [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]].

It currently consists of the western part of the former [[Derwentside]] district (including [[Consett]] and [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]]) and the northern part of the former [[Wear Valley]] district (including [[Weardale]], [[Crook, County Durham|Crook]] and [[Willington, County Durham|Willington]]).

==Constituency profile==
For many years the area gave large majorities suggesting a [[safe seat]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]; the majority of the electorate live in former mining or steel towns, where Labour traditionally have polled higher than other parties with the remainder in rural farms and villages throughout valleys cleft from the eastern, rocky part of the [[Pennines]].  The previous MP was [[Laura Pidcock]], who was elected at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. Prior to that, the constituency was served by [[Pat Glass]] who announced her intention to step down at the 2017 general election in the wake of the Brexit referendum. Her successor, [[Laura Pidcock]] a close supporter of party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] lost the seat in [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] to the current MP, [[Richard Holden (British politician)|Richard Holden]], as part of the Conservative Party's strategy to target seats in the so-called [[Red wall (British politics)|red wall]].
