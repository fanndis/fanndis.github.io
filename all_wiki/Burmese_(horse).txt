'''Burmese''' (1962â€“1990), a black RCMP Police Service Horse (PSH) [[mare]], was given to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and ridden by the Queen for [[Trooping the Colour]] for eighteen consecutive years from 1969 to 1986. She was trained and presented by RCMP Staff Sergeant Fred Rasmussen in 1969.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Burmese was foaled at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Remount Ranch at [[Fort Walsh, Saskatchewan]].  She was trained in [[Ottawa]] and in 1969 was presented to the Queen when members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police came to the UK to perform in the [[Royal Windsor Horse Show]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/news-nouvelles/2009/2009-05-03-george-eng.htm |title=RCMP Horse Presentation to Her Majesty The Queen |publisher=rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref>

The Queen was mounted on Burmese when [[Marcus Sarjeant|six blank shots were fired]] during the 1981 birthday parade, on the way to Trooping the Colour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/13/newsid_2512000/2512333.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 13 &#124; 1981: Queen shot at by youth |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref> Although the horse was startled, the Queen was able to bring her under control.

Burmese's last public appearance was at Trooping the Colour in 1986, after which she retired. She was not replaced, as the Queen decided to ride in a [[phaeton (carriage)|phaeton]] (carriage) and review the troops from a dais, rather than train a new [[Horses in warfare#Europe|charger]].<ref>{{citation | publisher = MoD | place = UK | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/ceremonialandheritage/household/trooping.htm | title = Trooping the Colour (The Queen's Birthday Parade) | section = Army}}.</ref>

Burmese was put out to pasture at [[Windsor Castle]]'s Park, where she died in 1990.

PSH Burmese was followed by PSH Centenial, presented to The Queen in 1973 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the RCMP (the spelling of "Centenial" was changed by the Queen from the original spelling of "Centennial"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmpveteransvancouver.com/memories-from-the-musical-ride/ |title= Queen changes spelling of RCMP presented horse's name |publisher=Royal Canadian Mounted Police Veterans' Association |date=2015-05-18 |accessdate=2018-08-26}}</ref>); and PSH Saint James, in 1998, to mark the RCMP's 125th anniversary. In 2002, The Queen presented the RCMP with PSH Golden Jubilee in honour of her Golden Jubilee year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Both Burmese and Centenial were trained for the Queen by RCMP Staff Sergeant Fred Rasmussen.

==Statue of Burmese==
During [[Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan's]] centennial in 2005, the Queen unveiled a [[bronze statue]] in front of the [[Saskatchewan Legislative Building]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Canada, where she is depicted atop Burmese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4561169.stm |title= Queen defies rain on Canada visit |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-19 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}</ref> The statue was sculpted by Saskatchewan artist Susan Velder.

==Naming of Burmese==
An RCMP spokesperson said the name "Burmese" originally refers to citizens of modern-day [[Burma]]. However, the rationale of giving such a name was not explicitly mentioned.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
