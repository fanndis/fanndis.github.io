The [[Department of Health and Social Care]] (DHSC) for England launched a [[Behavior change (public health)|public health information campaign]] to help slow the virus's spread, and began posting daily updates in early February. In February, the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care|Health Secretary]], [[Matt Hancock]], introduced the [[Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020]] for England, and hospitals set up drive-through [[screening (medicine)|screening]]. The [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer for England]], [[Chris Whitty]], outlined a four-pronged strategy, relevant to England, to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate.

In March, the UK government imposed a [[stay-at-home order]], dubbed "Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives", banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside one's home (including family and [[Living apart together|partners]]), and shutting almost all schools, business, venues, facilities, amenities and places of worship.

Cases rose significantly from late August onwards (by a factor of 3.2 from Aug 15 - Sept 15). The government responded with a [[First COVID-19 tier regulations in England|"tiered" regional lockdown in England]], and the devolved governments introduced similar restrictions. These restrictions evolved during late October as more [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe|countries in Europe affected by COVID-19]] reacted to their high case incidence resulting in actual or potential health system pressure, by announcing national as opposed to regional lockdowns or "circuit breakers".

On 1 June, [[Primary school]]s in England reopened to some reception (4-5 years), year 1 (5-6 years) and year 6 (10-11 years) pupils with social distancing measures in place.

On 6 June, [[Parliament Square]] in London, saw thousands of people participating in the [[Black Lives Matter]] [[George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom|protest]] against racism and [[police violence]] in the UK, following the death of [[George Floyd]] apparently caused by US police in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]].

On 8 June, the government introduced new quarantine rules from anyone coming into the UK, requiring individuals to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.

On 15 June, England made face masks compulsory on all public transport. [[Secretary of State for Transport|Transport Secretary]] [[Grant Shapps]] still advised people not to use public transport, but acknowledged that for some people this wasn't an option, especially as the use of public transport had been increasing throughout late May and early June, which brought fears of the coronavirus being transmitted on public transport.

On 2 July, the government revised the total number of cases down by 30,302 because some people were counted twice in the earlier figures.  The actual increase in the number of cases for 2 July was 576 or 0.18%.<ref name=gov.uk2Update/>

Also on 2 July, the UK Government removed 75 countries from the England related quarantine list since they were now dubbed "low risk". Travellers entering the UK would no longer have to self-isolate.<!--  So what about the other 3 nations? No mention of their lists? -->

On 17 July, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock called for an urgent review into how coronavirus deaths were recorded in England.

On 24 July, in England, [[The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings in a Relevant Place) (England) Regulations 2020|new regulations]] made it compulsory to wear face coverings in most indoor shops and public spaces. Those breaking the rules could be fined up to £100. Face coverings remained optional in some indoor venues where wearing a mask might be 'impractical', such as restaurants and gyms. Exemptions were made for children under 11, individuals with physical or mental illness or disability, and for anyone to whom it might cause distress.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344 |title=Coronavirus: What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2020}}</ref>

On 25 July, the government added [[Spain]] back onto the quarantine list due to a spike in cases. This drew criticism from the [[Spanish PM]], [[Pedro Sánchez]], as the outbreak was largely only happening in [[Catalonia]].

On 27 July, the first confirmed case of an animal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK was reported, having been detected in a pet cat.<ref name=petcat>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-confirmed-in-pet-cat-in-the-uk |title=COVID-19 confirmed in pet cat in the UK |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=27 July 2020 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref> UK health officials said that the cat had probably contracted the coronavirus from its owners, but there was no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can transmit the disease to humans.<ref name=petcat/>

On 30 July, the UK government announced that people in Greater Manchester, east [[Lancashire]] and parts of [[West Yorkshire]] faced new restrictions, banning separate households from meeting each other at home after a spike in COVID-19 cases.

On 31 July, the UK government announced they were delaying a further ease of lockdown restrictions in England until at least 15 August due to recent increases in cases.

On 2 November, a five-level tier system came into force in Scotland to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in regional and local areas. In Scotland, [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and all towns in the central belt were placed on level 3.

A three-tier system was implemented in England.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coronavirus (COVID-19): local protection levels - gov.scot|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/|access-date=2020-11-02|website=www.gov.scot}}</ref> whereby:

* Level 0 (Lowest) - A maximum of 8 people from three different households would be allowed to meet indoors.
* Level 1 - A maximum of 6 people from two different households would be allowed to meet indoors. Pubs and restaurants would remain open, but still face a curfew at 10:30pm. Funerals and weddings would face a 20 person limit.
* Level 2 - Households would be banned from mixing but a maximum of 6 people from different households can meet outside. Pubs and restaurants still face a curfew. Non-essential shops and hairdressers would remain open under these restrictions.
* Level 3 - Rule of 6 applies to people meeting outside. Non-essential travel out of level three strictions was banned. Non-essential shops, hairdressers, pubs and restaurants would remain open, but alcohol sales would be banned.
* Level 4 (Highest) - Rule of 6 still applies to people meeting outside. Travel limits and a 'Stay at Home' message would be enforced. All non-essential shops, hairdressers, pubs and restaurants would close. Schools would remain open.

No regions of Scotland were immediately placed under level 4 restrictions.

Because of [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], the responses by each of the four nations have differed from one another; the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Welsh Government]], and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] have produced different policies to those produced by [[Government of the United Kingdom]] (many of which apply only to England). The [[National Health Service]] is the [[Publicly funded health care|publicly funded healthcare]] system in the UK; each nation has its own [[National Health Service]] and public health bodies, [[Publicly funded health care|funded]] by devolved block grants via the Barnett formula and accountable to their devolved governments.

== National health services response ==
[[Health care in the United Kingdom|Healthcare in the UK]] is a devolved matter, with [[Healthcare in England|England]], [[Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland)|Northern Ireland]], [[Healthcare in Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Healthcare in Wales|Wales]] each having their own systems of publicly funded healthcare, funded by and accountable to separate governments and parliaments. As a result of each country having different policies, laws and priorities, a variety of differences now exist between these systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7586147.stm |title='Huge contrasts' in devolved NHS| work=[[BBC News]] |date= 28 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm |title=NHS now four different systems |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2 January 2008}}</ref>

The UK Government launched a booking portal for people to be tested for COVID-19. The governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland governments signed up to use the portal that England were using. The Welsh Government went on to partner with Amazon to create a portal.

In May, the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England confirmed that two samples taken from single subjects, such as in the common [[COVID-19 testing#Polymerase chain reaction|saliva and nasal swab test]], are processed as two separate tests.

According to Health Minister Vaughan Gething, this test is an important part of the "Test, Trace, Protect" strategy which will help Wales come out of lockdown.<ref>{{cite web |title=New made-in-Wales blood test for coronavirus |url=https://gov.wales/new-made-wales-blood-test-coronavirus |website=Welsh Government |publisher=Welsh Government |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref>

' * ' Values for these dates questionable in light of announcement of 3 October.

Warning: the values in the above graph are not directly comparable between different time periods because they were measured under different testing rates. It is therefore vital to consult [[#Test positivity rate|Test positivity rate]] and [[#New daily tests|New daily tests]], and to understand the strategy for selection of subjects for testing.

On 3 October, the UK Government Dashboard "GOV.UKCoronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK" issued the following note: <blockquote>Due to a technical issue, which has now been resolved, there has been a delay in publishing a number of COVID-19 cases to the dashboard in England. This means the total reported over the coming days will include some additional cases from the period between 24 September and 1 October, increasing the number of cases reported.</blockquote>

On 4 October, the UK Government Dashboard "GOV.UKCoronavirus (COVID-19) in the UK" issued the following note:
<blockquote>An issue was identified overnight on Friday 2 October in the automated process that transfers positive cases data to PHE. It has now been resolved.
The cases by publish date for 3 and 4 October include 15,841 additional cases with specimen dates between 25 September and 2 October — they are therefore artificially high for England and the UK.</blockquote>

After correction as calculated by the BBC,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54412581 Covid: 16,000 coronavirus cases missed in daily figures after IT error] 4 October 2020, ''www.bbc.co.uk'', accessed 4 October 2020</ref> the case numbers should read from 25 September as below, showing a trend (apart from the 28 September and 4 October figures) which is subsequently maintained: <!-- if the 15,841 additional cases are subtracted from the 4 October figure, that becomes 7120.-->

Statistics suggest that certain groups in British society have been partially effected by the pandemic both medically and by the impact of lockdown.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-30|title=What do we know about Covid-19 inequalities among people from minority ethnic groups?|url=https://fullfact.org/health/Covid-19-inequalities-minority-ethnicities/|access-date=2020-12-03|website=Full Fact|language=en}}</ref>

==== Coronavirus risk and ethnicity ====
In April 2020, the British Medical Association called on the government to investigate if and why people from [[black, Asian and minority ethnic]] (BAME) groups were more vulnerable to COVID-19, after the first 10 doctors to die were all from the group.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma |title = UK government urged to investigate coronavirus deaths of BAME doctors |work=The Guardian |date = 10 April 2020|last1 = Siddique|first1 = Haroon}}</ref> The Labour Party called for a [[public enquiry]] after the first 10 deaths in the health service were from BAME backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-deaths-doctors-inquiry-government-labour-marsha-de-cordova-a9460871.html |title = Labour calls for inquiry into 'disproportionate' number of ethnic minority deaths from coronavirus|work=The Independent|date = 11 April 2020}}</ref> The Mayor of London [[Sadiq Khan]] wrote to the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] asking them to investigate whether the effects of coronavirus on BAME groups could have been prevented or mitigated.<ref>{{cite news|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|date=10 May 2020|title=Equality watchdog urged to investigate coronavirus impact on BAME people|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/equality-watchdog-urged-investigate-impact-on-bame-people-london-mayor|access-date=16 May 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> A group of 70 BAME figures sent a letter to Boris Johnson calling for an independent public enquiry into the disproportionate impact of the coronavirus on people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-boris-johnson-public-inquiry-ethnic-minorities-bame-a9506596.html |title = Boris Johnson urged to launch independent public inquiry into disproportionate impact of coronavirus on ethnic minorities|work=The Independent|date = 10 May 2020}}</ref>

Research by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre concluded that people from BAME backgrounds made up 34% of critical patients.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52255863|first=Rianna|last=Croxford|title=Coronavirus: Ethnic minorities 'are a third' of patients|date=12 April 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref> NHS England and Public Health England were appointed to lead an inquiry into why people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds appear to be disproportionately affected by coronavirus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame|title=Inquiry announced into disproportionate impact of coronavirus on BAME communities|last1=Siddique|first1=Haroon|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|date=16 April 2020|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref> On 18 April, Public Health England said that they would start recording the ethnicity of victims of coronavirus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52338101|first=Rianna|last=Croxford|title=Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity|date=18 April 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref>

Research carried out by ''The Guardian'' newspaper concluded that ethnic minorities in England when compared to white people were dying in disproportionately high numbers. They said that deaths in hospitals up to 19 April 19% were from BAME backgrounds who make up only 15% of the population of England.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/racial-inequality-in-britain-found-a-risk-factor-for-covid-19 |title=Ethnic minorities dying of Covid-19 at higher rate, analysis shows |work=The Guardian |date=22 April 2020 |last1=Barr |first1=Caelainn |last2=Kommenda |first2=Niko |last3=McIntyre |first3=Niamh |last4=Voce |first4= Antonio}}</ref>

The Office for National Statistics (ONS), meanwhile, wrote that in England and Wales black men were four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white men, from figures gathered between 2 March to 10 April.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds |title = Black people four times more likely to die from Covid-19, ONS finds |work=The Guardian |date = 7 May 2020|last1 = Booth|first1 = Robert|last2 = Barr|first2 = Caelainn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to10april2020 |title = Coronavirus (COVID-19) related deaths by ethnic group, England and Wales – Office for National Statistics}}</ref> They concluded that "the difference between ethnic groups in COVID-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained".  Some commentators including Dr. John Campbell have pointed to [[Vitamin D deficiency]] as a possible cause of the discrepancy, but the theory remains unproven.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.technicalpolitics.com/articles/were-going-to-need-one-heck-of-a-lot-of-oxygen-an-exclusive-interview-with-dr-john-campbell/ |title = "We're Going to Need One Heck of a Lot of Oxygen": An Exclusive Interview with Dr. John Campbell|work=Technical Politics|date = 4 March 2020}}</ref>

Another study carried out by University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on behalf of NHS England and a separate report by the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] corroborated the ONS' findings.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-05-07-risk-factors-covid-19-death-revealed-world-s-largest-analysis-patient-records-date |title = Risk factors for COVID-19 death revealed in world's largest analysis of patient records to date|date=7 May 2020|publisher=University of Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Are some ethnic groups more vulnerable to COVID-19 than others? |url=https://www.ifs.org.uk/inequality/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Are-some-ethnic-groups-more-vulnerable-to-COVID-19-than-others-V2-IFS-Briefing-Note.pdf |last1=Platt |first1=Lucinda |date=May 2020 |editor-last=Payne |editor-first=Judith |publisher=The Institute for Fiscal Studies |isbn=978-1-912805-75-4|last2=Wawrick|first2=Ross}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-01/clear-disparity-between-ethnic-groups-in-covid-19-deaths-ifs-study/ |title = Coronavirus fatalities among black and minority ethnic groups are disproportionately high, study finds |date=1 May 2020 |work=ITV News}}</ref> An Oxford University led study into the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy concluded that 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1 March to 14 April were from a BAME background. The study also concluded that BAME women were four times more likely to be hospitalised than white women.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/bame-majority-pregnant-women-hospitalised-covid-19-troubling-midwives|title=BAME women make up 55% of UK pregnancy hospitalisations with Covid-19|date=15 May 2020|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-05-12-pregnant-women-are-not-greater-risk-severe-covid-19-other-women | title=Pregnant women are not at greater risk of severe COVID-19 than other women |date=12 May 2020 |publisher=University of Oxford}}</ref>

A study by [[Public Health Scotland]] found no link between BAME groups and COVID-19.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-in-scotland-experts-to-study-impact-on-ethnic-minorities-j6b8twvg8|title=Coronavirus in Scotland: Experts to study impact on ethnic minorities|first=Conor|last=Riordan|website=The Times}}</ref>  A second Public Health England study found that those with a Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white Britons.  Other BAME groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death from COVID-19.<ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/892085/disparities_review.pdf Disparities in the risk and outcomes of COVID-19] August 2020 ''assets.publishing.service.gov.uk''.

==== Fines and ethnicity ====
Figures from the Metropolitan Police showed that BAME people received proportionally more fines than white people for breaching COVID-related restrictions.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last1=Dodd|first1=Vikram|date=3 June 2020|title=Met police twice as likely to fine black people over lockdown breaches – research|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research|access-date=3 June 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==== Coronavirus risk and employment status ====
The ONS study, using data collected up to 17 April 2020 across England and Wales, concluded that men in low-skilled jobs were four times more likely to die from the virus than those in professional jobs. Women who worked as carers were twice as likely to die than those who worked in technical or professional jobs. The GMB trade union commented on the findings that ministers must stop any return to work until "proper guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe". An analysis of the figures by ''The Guardian'' concluded that deaths were higher in occupations where physical distancing was more difficult to achieve.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Barr |first1=Caelainn  |last2=Inman |first2=Phillip |date=11 May 2020 |title= Low-paid workers more likely to die from Covid-19 than higher earners |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/manual-workers-likelier-to-die-from-covid-19-than-professionals |access-date=11 May 2020}}</ref> Analysis by ''The Independent'' and the ''Financial Times'' concluded that mortality rates from coronavirus were higher in deprived and urban areas than in prosperous and rural locations, across England and Wales.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-death-rate-uk-deprived-inequality-ons-latest-a9493716.html |title = Death rates from Covid-19 more than twice as high in deprived areas|date = May 2020|work=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c26434a2-5337-45e9-a94b-2c33fd55306a|title=Deprived areas hit hardest in UK by pandemic|work=Financial Times|date=1 May 2020|first1=Chris|last1=Giles|first2=William|last2=Wallis| url-access=subscription}}</ref> Analysis of the ONS data by the ''Guardian'' also concluded that by 13 May, only about 12% of people who had died from the virus in England and Wales were under 65 while 59% were over 80.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/13/pensioners-34-times-more-likely-to-die-of-covid-19-than-working-age-brits-data-shows|work=The Guardian|date= 13 May 2020|title=Pensioners 34 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than working age Brits, data shows|first=Niamh|last=McIntyre}}</ref> A [[Public Health England]] report in June 2020 found that security guards, taxi and bus drivers, construction workers and social care staff were at a higher risk of COVID-19 when compared to other occupations.<ref name="Demographic"/>

==== Unemployment by age ====
One of the demographics most severally effected by the increase in unemployment during the pandemic were the youngest members of the working-aged population. Figures from the Office of national statistics showed that 174,000 fewer 16- to 24-year-olds were employed in July to September 2020 than during the preceding three months. Their statistics also suggested youth unemployment as a percentage had increased more sharply than among the general population reaching 14.6% by November 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-11-25|title=Unemployment rate: How many people are out of work?|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-52660591|access-date=2020-12-03}}</ref> The pandemic also appeared to have hurried many of the oldest workers exit from employment, data collected by the institute for fiscal studies in June and July 2020 showed that 6% of those aged 66–70 and 11% of those aged 71 and older who were working immediately before the crises were now retired half of whom had not previously planned to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Crawford|first=Rowena|last2=Karjalainen|first2=Heidi|date=2020-09-30|title=The coronavirus pandemic and older workers|url=https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/15040|access-date=2020-12-03|website=www.ifs.org.uk}}</ref>
