'''Jean Gol'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberaalarchief.be/E_G.html |title=Jean Gol |publisher=Liberaalarchief.be |date= |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref> (8 February 1942 – 18 September 1995) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] politician for the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Walloon Region|Walloon]] party [[Parti Réformateur Libéral]] (PRL). He was a minister, on several occasions, in the Belgian government, including service as Deputy Prime Minister.

==Early life==

His [[Jewish]] parents, Stanislas Gol (1908-1976), born in [[Warsaw]], and Léa Karny (1911-2001), born in [[Liège]] from parents born in present-day [[Lithuania]] (then [[Russian Empire]]), were both medical doctors with diplomas from the [[University of Liège]]. After the Nazi invasion of Belgium in 1940, the Karny family and their stepsons took refuge in England, via France, Algeria, Morocco and Portugal. Stanislas Gol enlisted in the [[Independent Belgian Brigade|Belgian Army in the United Kingdom]], and Léa gave birth to Jean in exile. The family returned to Belgium in 1945, but Léa's parents, Coussel Karny (1883-1944) and Yocheved Chamech (1886-1944), had gone back to Liège in December 1940 and had been deported to  [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in July 1944 and didn't survive deportation.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190622111051/https://beeldbank.kazernedossin.eu/index.php/collection/watch/f2171fcd074c4e3296b548fa038452a89260a5f9d49e4449bed677bad5dbdba3e883682f297346348480012689b01299 Karny-Chamech family.

After the Second World War, Gol grew up in Belgium and studied law. He obtained a doctorate in [[law]] at the University of Liège.

==Political career==
Then a self-identified Marxist, he cofounded in 1965 with François Perin the Parti wallon des travailleurs (PWT), which was linked to the Belgian section of the Fourth International. Then, in 1968, they both split to form the Parti wallon, and Gol was elected on a larger regionalist ticket, the ''Rassemblement Wallon'' (Walloon Rally), a few weeks later for the [[1968 Belgian general election]] on 31 March 1968.

===Public offices===
In 1974, he was ''Secrétaire d'État à l'Economie régionale wallonne'' in the government [[Leo Tindemans|Tindemans]] II. In 1976, he was one of the co-founders of the ''Parti des Réformes et des Libertés de Wallonie'' (PRLW), a merger of the liberal [[Walloon Region|Walloon]] ''PLP'', and some dissidents of the ''[[Rassemblement Wallon]]''. During the governments [[Wilfried Martens|Martens]] V-VII, of 17 December 1981 up to 9 May 1988, he was: vice-premier, minister of justice and institutional reform. From 6 January 1985 up to 28 November 1985, Jean Gol replaced [[Willy De Clercq]] on the department of foreign trade.

In June 1994, he was elected a member of the [[European Parliament]], and in addition was elected as a member of the Belgian Senate in 1995.

===Leadership within Francophone circles===

Over a long period he was noted for his ability to empathize with local Walloon and Liégeois leaders from diverse political backgrounds, including with veteran [[Walloons|Walloon]] Socialist [[André Cools]]; out of these efforts emerged what became known as the 'Colonster' group, which partly proved to be the catalyst for a strengthening of collective Francophone responses by way of counterweight to the increasing influence of [[Flanders|Flemish]]-based parties in Belgium.<ref>Jean-François Furnemont, 'Jean Gol: le pirate devenu amiral', Bruxelles: Editions Luc Pire, 1997, pp. 123&ndash;131</ref>

In May 1992, he became president of the ''PRL'', and in 1993 he was one of the architects of the ''PRL-FDF Federation'', in collaboration with [[Antoinette Spaak]].

===Contribution to political theory===

He re-defined the doctrine of [[social liberalism]], which he had already worked on in 1976.

Jean Gol has voiced his support for [[Rattachism]].<ref>https://doorbraak.be/lonken-naar-het-zuiden/</ref>

==Death==

He died of a sudden illness in 1995. He was succeeded<ref>Jean-François Furnemont, 'Jean Gol: le pirate devenu amiral', Bruxelles: Editions Luc Pire, 1997, pp. 210-213</ref> as leader of the ''PRL'' by his longstanding party colleague [[Louis Michel]].
