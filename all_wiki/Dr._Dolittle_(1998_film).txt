'''''Dr. Dolittle''''' (also written as '''''Doctor Dolittle''''') is a 1998 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[dark comedy film]] directed by [[Betty Thomas]], written by Larry Levin and [[Nat Mauldin]], and starring [[Eddie Murphy]] in the titular role. The film was based on the series of [[Dr. Dolittle|children's stories of the same name]] by [[Hugh Lofting]], but used no material from any of the novels; the main connection is the name and a doctor who can speak to animals, although the [[List of Doctor Dolittle characters#The pushmi-pullyu|pushmi-pullyu]], a much-loved feature of the books, notably makes a very brief appearance in a couple of scenes.

The first novel, ''[[The Story of Doctor Dolittle]]'' (1920) had originally and previously been filmed in 1967 as a musical [[Doctor Dolittle (1967 film)|of the same name]], which was a closer (albeit still very loose) adaptation of the book. The 1967 film was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], but became a [[Cult film|cult classic]], while the 1998 version of the film was a box office success,<ref name=mojo/> and was received warmly by audiences who praised its humor and thematic profundity. It has become a cult classic in recent years due to Murphy's performance, despite receiving mixed reviews from film critics upon release.<ref name=RT/><ref name=MC/> The film's success generated one theatrical [[sequel]], ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'' (2001), and three films released direct to video: ''[[Dr. Dolittle 3]]'' (2006), ''[[Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief]]'' (2008), and ''[[Dr. Dolittle: Million Dollar Mutts]]'' (2009).<ref>{{IMDb title|1080926|Dr. Dolittle Million Dollar Mutts}}</ref>

==Plot==
In 1968, 5-year old John Dolittle displays an ability to talk to and understand [[animal]]s, starting with his own [[dog]]. John asks his dog questions like: "Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?"; the dog's response is that it's their own way of [[shaking hands]] and he does it when meeting his new [[school principal|principal]]. However, his behavior distracts his father, Archer. Archer hires a local [[priest]] to perform an [[exorcism]] on John in order to remove the "[[devil]]" from him, but during the exam, the dog bites and attacks the man, therefore resulting in Archer sending the dog away. Following this ordeal, John eventually stops talking to animals.

Thirty years later in 1998, John becomes a [[physician|doctor]] and a [[surgeon]], while living in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He is happily married to his wife Lisa, and has two daughters, typical teenager Charisse, and nerdy Maya, who has a pet [[guinea pig]] named Rodney, and what she believes is a [[swan]] egg, which she hopes will bond with her upon hatching. A large medical company owned by Mr. Calloway seeks to buy John's practice, a deal in which one of his colleagues, Dr. Mark Weller, is enthusiastic about. Their other colleague, Dr. Gene Reiss, is skeptical about the deal due to the potential of downsizing patients and staff.

John's family goes on vacation, but he goes back to work to see a patient, and then pick up Rodney. Unfortunately, on his way home, he accidentally nearly hits a dog with his [[Nissan Pathfinder|SUV]], causing the dog to shout at him in anger. Afterwards, Rodney starts talking to John, causing him to believe he is having a mental breakdown. John has a [[CT scan]] after animals start asking for favors when he helps a wounded [[owl]], and he then unwittingly adopts the dog he ran over, eventually naming him Lucky. John starts secretly helping various animals, including a [[suicide|suicidal]] circus [[Bengal tiger|tiger]] named Jake, who suffers [[great cerebral vein]]. Through all this, John begins learning to re-appreciate his gift, at one point confiding to both Lucky and Mark that he has never felt excited about his work in years. However, Lisa and Mark catch him performing [[CPR]] on a [[rat]], and have him sectioned in a [[mental hospital]].

Believing his [[gift]] is a [[hindrance]], John rejects all abnormality in his life and returns to work, but in doing so, ostracizes Maya as well, who comes to believe he doesn't like her. Maya admits to Archer that she liked the idea of her father talking to animals. However, John has a change of heart when he eavesdrops on the conversation. He admits to Maya that he does not like, but still loves her for who she is, and encourages her to continue being what she wants to be. John then apologizes to Lucky, and together, they steal Jake from the circus to perform surgery on him. Mark and Gene catch John, but Gene is sympathetic of the former's opportunistic attitude. Archer reveals to Lisa that John's gift is real, encouraging her to venture into the operating theatre and keep Jake calm while John and Gene remove the cause of pain, saving Jake's life.

John becomes both a doctor and a [[veterinarian]] afterwards, embracing his ability to talk to animals. The film ends with Maya's egg hatching and revealing to be a baby [[alligator]].
