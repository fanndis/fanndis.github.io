[[Oprah Winfrey]]'s endorsement of [[Barack Obama]] was one of the most widely covered and studied developments of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential campaign]], as she has been described as [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|the most influential woman in the world]].<ref name="$40m  school">{{cite news | last = Meldrum Henley-on-Klip | first = Andrew | title = 'Their story is my story' Oprah opens $40m school for South African girls |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 2007-01-03 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jan/03/broadcasting.schoolsworldwide | accessdate = 2007-03-04 }}</ref><ref name = "Obama party">{{cite news | last = Doyle | first = Leonard | date = 2007-09-07 | title = Oprah throws house party to aid Obama bid |work=The Independent |location=London | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/oprah-throws-house-party-to-aid-obama-bid-401528.html | accessdate = 2008-02-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1435442/The-most-influential-US-liberals-1-20.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London  | title=The most influential US liberals: 1–20 | date=2007-10-31 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}</ref>  Winfrey first endorsed Obama in September 2006 before he had even declared himself a candidate.  In May 2007 Winfrey made her official endorsement of candidate Obama, and in December 2007, she made her first campaign appearances for him.  Two economists estimate that Winfrey's endorsement was worth over a million votes in the Democratic primary race<ref>{{cite news| url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/so-much-for-one-person-one-vote/ | work=The New York Times | first=Steven D. | last=Levitt | date=2008-08-06 | accessdate=2010-04-01 | title=So Much for One Person, One Vote}}</ref> and that without it, Obama would have received fewer votes.<ref name="econ.umd.edu">[http://www.econ.umd.edu/~garthwaite/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf The Role of Celebrity Endorsements in Politics: Oprah, Obama, and the 2008 Democratic Primary].</ref> Then-[[Governor of Illinois]] [[Rod Blagojevich]] claimed that the endorsement was so significant in electing Obama president that he considered offering Obama's former seat in the Senate to Winfrey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/5230/53/ |title=MINA Breaking News – Troubled Illinois Governor wanted Oprah in Senate |publisher=Macedoniaonline.eu |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>

==Winfrey's endorsement influence==
Winfrey was at times called "arguably the world's most powerful woman" by [[CNN]] and Time.com,<ref name="2001 Global Influentials">{{cite news | title = 2001 Global Influentials: 19.

Winfrey is the only person in the world to have made [[Time 100#Listed nine times|all nine lists]].

At the end of the 20th century ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' listed Winfrey as both the most influential woman and the most influential [[black person]] of her generation, and in a cover story profile the magazine called her "America's most powerful woman".<ref name="Boomers">{{cite web | title = The 50 Most Influential Boomers | publisher=LIFE | url = http://www.life.com/Life/boomers/50boomers01.html#05 | accessdate = 2007-03-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127042315/http://www.life.com/Life/boomers/50boomers01.html#05 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}</ref>
Ladies Home Journal also ranked Winfrey number one in their list of the most powerful women in America and then senator [[Barack Obama]] has said she "may be the most influential woman in the country".<ref name="Obama on LKL">{{cite news | title = Interview With Barack Obama | work=Larry King Live | publisher=CNN | date = 2006-10-19 | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/19/lkl.01.html | accessdate = 2007-03-06}}</ref> In 1998 Winfrey became the first woman and first African American to top [[Entertainment Weekly]]'s list of the 101 most powerful people in the entertainment industry.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n24_v94/ai_21257357 | work=Jet | title=Oprah Winfrey named most powerful person in entertainment industry | year=1998}}</ref> In 2003 Winfrey edged out both [[Superman]] and [[Elvis Presley]] to be named the greatest pop culture icon of all time by VH1.<ref name="Greatest Icon">{{cite news | title = Oprah named greatest icon |work=The Age | date = 2003-07-23 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/23/1058853120238.html | accessdate = 2008-08-25 | location=Melbourne, Australia}}</ref> ''Forbes'' named her the world's most powerful celebrity in 2005,<ref name="Most Powerful">{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title = Oprah Tops Powerful Celebs List| publisher=CBS News | date = 2005-06-17 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/16/entertainment/main702512.shtml | accessdate = 2008-08-25}}</ref> 2007,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6753847.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Oprah 'most powerful celebrity' | date=2007-06-14 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}</ref> and 2008. Columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] seems to agree with such assessments:

{{quote|She is the top alpha female in this country. She has more credibility than the president. Other successful women, such as [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Martha Stewart]], had to be publicly slapped down before they could move forward.

''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' wrote:

[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] said:

{{quote|I mean this is a woman that came from nothing to rise up to be the most powerful woman, I think, in the world. I think Oprah Winfrey is the most powerful woman in the world, not just in America. That's – anybody who goes on her program immediately benefits through the roof.

Biographer [[Kitty Kelley]] states that she has always been "fascinated" by Winfrey:

{{quote|As a woman, she has wielded an unprecedented amount of influence over the American culture and psyche,...There has been no other person in the 20th century whose convictions and values have impacted the American public in such a significant way.<ref name="VIBE Kitty Kelley">{{cite web | first = Bonami | last = Jones | title = Kitty Kelley To Write Bio of Oprah | publisher = VIBE | date = 2006-12-08 | url = http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/12/kitty_kelley_to_write_bio_for_oprah/ | accessdate = 2008-08-25 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081007201255/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/12/kitty_kelley_to_write_bio_for_oprah/ | archivedate = October 7, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>...

The power of Winfrey's endorsement has been most consistently measured by the spike in sales that products receive when she endorses them on her show, most notably, books selected for [[Oprah's Book Club]].

''[[Business Week]]'' stated:

{{quote|Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that [[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[The Daily Show]] could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include [[Fox News]]'s [[Sean Hannity]], [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Terry Gross]], radio personality [[Don Imus]], and [[CBS]]' [[60 Minutes]]. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.<ref name="wallet">{{cite news | title =Why Oprah Opens Readers' Wallets  |work=Business Week  | date =2005-10-10 | url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954059.htm | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}</ref>}}

The power of Winfrey's endorsement is also credited with making [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]], who got his start appearing on Winfrey's show, into a household name, hit talk show host, and the author of multiple best-sellers.

==Endorsing Barack Obama==
On September 25, 2006, Winfrey appeared on [[Larry King Live]] and was asked about a fan who started a campaign to get Winfrey to run for president. Larry King noted that Winfrey's lawyers had apparently warned the man to stop the campaign. Winfrey chided the lawyers and advised the fan to "take all your energy, and put it in Barack Obama". Winfrey explained that Obama was her favorite senator and she hoped he would run for president. Then, on October 19, 2006, Winfrey interviewed Obama and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] on her show and reiterated the endorsement that she had previously made on Larry King, while promoting his book ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]''. Winfrey explained that she would be on the air for several more years, so if he ever decided to run, she would hope he would announce it on her show. Obama's appearance on Oprah caused his book to reach the No. 1 spot on both Amazon.com's and the ''[[New York Times]]''{{'}} bestseller list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/2907.html |title=Could Oprah Help Elect Obama? – News & Features |publisher=washingtonian.com |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> Immediately following Winfrey's two endorsements, [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] put Obama on their October 23, 2006 cover with the caption "Why Barack Obama could be the next president."

Obama eventually decided to announce his candidacy, not on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], but at the steps of the [[Illinois state legislature]]. With Obama officially becoming a candidate for president in 2008, Winfrey decided not to interview him or any other candidate during the campaign because as a vocal Obama supporter, she noted that she may be unable to be objective.

In May 2007, Winfrey once again appeared on Larry King Live and was asked if her endorsement of Obama still applied. She replied "of course" and explained that what Obama stood for was worth her going out on a limb for. When King asked Winfrey if there was a woman side of her that would lean towards Obama's opponent, then front-runner [[Hillary Clinton]], Winfrey explained that she had great respect for Senator Clinton, and that her endorsement of Obama did not imply that she was against anyone else.  After endorsing Obama, however, Oprah's ratings fell 7%.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2037083/Oprah-Winfrey-Show-suffers-ratings-slump.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph  | first=Lucy | last=Cockcroft | title=Oprah Winfrey Show suffers ratings slump | date=2008-05-27}}</ref>

In June 2008, when Obama secured the Democratic nomination, Winfrey told [[Entertainment Tonight]]:
{{quote|I'm euphoric, I've been doing the happy dance all day. I'm so proud of Barack and [his wife] [[Michelle Obama]] and what this means for all of us ... the new possibilities for our country. And if he wants me to, I'm ready to go door to door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/06/62355/index.html |title=Oprah 'Euphoric' Over Obama Nomination |publisher=Etonline.com |accessdate=2010-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228041455/http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/06/62355/index.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009 }}</ref>}}

In late August 2008, Winfrey attended the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]] and reacted emotionally to Obama's speech, telling reporters "I've never experienced anything like that.  I cried my eyelashes off."  Elaborating further, Winfrey explained "I woke up this morning and I went to Google and I googled the entire [[Martin Luther King]] speech because like most Americans I, you know, you listen to the '[[I Have a Dream]]' part. In the earlier part of the speech, he talks about the promise of democracy. And I think that today that promise was fulfilled in a way that I never imagined in my lifetime."<ref name="swamppolitics.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/08/oprah_barack_obama_mlk_fdr_lin.html |title=Oprah: Obama's speech like FDR, MLK: The Swamp |publisher=Swamppolitics.com |date=2008-08-29 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>  Winfrey also told reporters:

{{quote|And what I saw with Barack Obama was something that was transcendent and I felt transformational for me as a human being and for this country. And I only pray in the deepest part of my being that America will rise to this moment. And I feel that what he was able to offer us as individual citizens and as a united country was something that we have never seen before. I really, I think it's the most powerful thing I've ever experienced.  I often wondered what it would be like to sit and listen to Lincoln speak or Roosevelt speak or what it would have been like to have been old enough to understand what Martin Luther King was saying 45 years ago today. And what he did brought that home in a way that I could never have imagined.<ref name="swamppolitics.com"/>}}

==Fundraising==
In the fall of 2007 Winfrey held a fundraiser for Obama at her California home and raised several million dollars.  In October 2008 Winfrey hosted a second fundraiser for Obama, this time in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Suzi |url=http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2008/10/08/oprah-pushing-for-obama-still/ |title=Politics News, Analysis, and Opinion for the U.S. and the World |publisher=News.aol.com |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>

In the fall of 2007, Obama was considered a long shot, an absolute outsider in the race for the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States and was still considered unlikely to win the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2008|Iowa caucus]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20081110.wdoyle10/BNStory/Entertainment/home?cid=al_gam_mostemail |title=This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> and polls showed him losing the black vote to Clinton.<ref name="salon.com">{{cite web|last=Tennis |first=Cary |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2008/05/05/clinton_blackvote/index.html |title=How Hillary Clinton botched the black vote – Barack Obama News |work=Salon.com |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>  In late November 2007, the Obama campaign announced that Winfrey would be campaigning for Obama for a series of rallies in the early [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|primary]] states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina.<ref>[http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071208/NEWS/712080332/-1/NEWS04]{{full citation needed|date=August 2008}}</ref> Even before Winfrey appeared thousands of Iowans flocked to Obama's campaign offices, and 1,385 signed up as volunteers to score tickets to see Winfrey's Iowa appearance.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070701212805/http://wcbstv.com/politics/Oprah.Winfrey.Barack.2.606660.html]</ref>  The [[Columbia, South Carolina]] event on December 9, 2007 drew a crowd of nearly 30,000, the largest for any political event of 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/12/09/506930.aspx |title=About 30,000 see Obama-Oprah In SC |publisher=Firstread.msnbc.msn.com |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2011-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210125348/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/12/09/506930.aspx |archivedate=December 10, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/09/oprah.obama/ | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-04-01 | title=Thanks to Oprah, Obama camp claims biggest crowd yet | date=2007-12-09}}</ref>

[[Newsweek]]'s [[Howard Fineman]] reviewed Winfrey's speech in [[South Carolina]]:

{{quote|Oprah riffed her way through an eloquent paean to the need for a change of leadership in America. "Dr. King talked about the dream," she said. "Now we get to vote that dream into reality.

==Impact==

===More than one million votes===
[[File:Oprah Winfrey at Obama victory, toilet visit (3005476255) (cropped2).jpg|thumb|right|Winfrey attending Obama's election night rally at [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]]]
Using a novel methodology, Craig Garthwaite and Tim Moore, economists at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] concluded that Winfrey's endorsement of Obama not only netted him 1,015,559 votes in the Democratic primary alone (with a 95% confidence interval of 423,123 to 1,596,995) but decided the election. The researchers were not able to apply their methodology to all states however, so their estimate does not include any additional Oprah effect that may have emerged in Texas, [[Michigan]], [[North Dakota]], [[Kansas]], or [[Alaska]]. "It does appear to have been a decisive, if not a deciding, factor," explained Garthwaite.<ref name="econ.umd.edu"/>

Garthwaite and Moore matched sales of Winfrey's "O" magazine and the spike in sales of her book club picks to Obama's votes in the Democratic primary. After controlling for a large range of confounding factors such as the fact that both Obama and Winfrey are popular with African Americans, Garthwaite and Moore showed that votes for Obama spiked in precisely the same geographic areas where Winfrey is the most popular. By applying the same methodology to Obama's 2004 Senate race, when he did not have Winfrey's endorsement, they found no relationship between Obama votes and Winfrey popularity in Illinois; the relationship only emerged after the endorsement, suggesting that Winfrey's endorsement had caused the spike in Obama's vote total in those counties.<ref name="econ.umd.edu"/>

Garthwaite and Moore also showed that the connection is not because people who read women's magazines preferred Obama to Clinton. Just the opposite, Obama  got less support where women's magazines such as Self and People are popular. After controlling for racial demographics, the economists also found no relationship between the popularity of Ebony magazine, whose readership is largely African American, and support for Obama.<ref name="econ.umd.edu"/>

In addition to getting Obama over a million votes, the researchers found that Winfrey's support boosted campaign contributions to him in those counties where she is most popular.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/31/AR2008083101761.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Oprah Effect | first=Shankar | last=Vedantam | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-04-01}}</ref> They found that Winfrey's biggest effect was in caucus states like Iowa.<ref name="econ.umd.edu"/>

During the Democratic primary, there was controversy over which states should be counted in the popular vote total and not all states released official vote counts, but it's estimated that at most, Obama won the popular vote by 151,844 votes without counting Michigan's disputed votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_vote_count.html |title=2008 Elections – Democratic Vote Count |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> Clinton, however, won the popular vote by 176,645 votes when Michigan's numbers were included.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/did_clinton_win_the_popular_vote.html |title=Did Clinton win the popular vote? |publisher=FactCheck.org |accessdate=2011-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026185022/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/did_clinton_win_the_popular_vote.html |archive-date=October 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Increased viability===
Another study suggests that Winfrey's endorsement may have also had indirect benefits for Obama. Researchers Andrew Pease and Paul R. Brewer of the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] conducted an experiment in which some subjects were exposed to news of Winfrey's endorsement and others weren't. They found that those who had such exposure were more likely to vote for Obama, if only because they thought her endorsement made Obama more electable; for such voters Winfrey's endorsement was important for strategic reasons. The researchers concluded that when evaluating the impact of celebrity endorsements, one must also consider "subtler effects, such as those on viability assessments."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/4/386 |title=The Oprah Factor: The Effects of a Celebrity Endorsement in a Presidential Primary Campaign – The International Journal of Press/Politics |publisher=Hij.sagepub.com |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>

===Polls===
A CBS poll found that a third of all Americans claimed that most people they know would be more inclined to vote for Obama because of Winfrey's endorsement.<ref>{{cite news|author=James M Klatell |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/08/opinion/polls/main3244412.shtml |title=CBS Poll: Oprah's Support May Help Obama |publisher=CBS News |date=2007-09-08 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> A study by the Pew Research Center found that Winfrey's campaign appearances had dramatically increased Obama's visibility, especially among African-Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/379/oprah-boosts-obamas-visibility |title=Oprah Boosts Obama's Visibility: Summary of Findings – Pew Research Center for the People & the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>
One reason Winfrey's endorsement was useful in helping Obama compete with Senator Clinton was because as of December 2007 (when Winfrey first began campaigning) Winfrey was the one woman in the world more admired than Hillary Clinton among American women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103462/Hillary-Edges-Oprah-Most-Admired-Woman-07.aspx |title=Hillary Edges Out Oprah as Most Admired Woman in '07 |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>

===Political commentary===
"There's no doubt that Oprah could tip a close presidential election if she strongly backed one candidate," predicted psychologist James Houran.<ref>''Newsmax'', May 2007, pg 62</ref>
In the May 2007 issue of ''Newsmax'', political analyst [[Dick Morris]] predicted Winfrey's endorsement would have an important impact:

{{quote|Oprah's endorsement is particularly important as a black woman, since she will provide millions of African-American women with guidance on their personal decision about whether to back the first of their gender or the first of their race.  But as a statement to all women, a decision by Oprah to endorse Obama would be a huge rejection of Hillary Clinton.  While she will likely play such an endorsement as reflecting more of a love for Obama than any dislike for Hillary, women voters are sure to draw the conclusion that there is something flawed in Hillary that made Oprah turn away from her candidacy.  I think Oprah's support will not only be important, it will be more important than any other political endorsement this year.}}

When asked by Larry King if there was a "woman side" of Oprah that "would lean towards a Hillary" Winfrey replied:

{{quote|Well, I have great respect for Hillary Clinton. I – I think I've said this before and it's true. Because I am for Barack does not mean I am against Hillary or anybody else. So the fact that I would endorse Barack Obama and the fact that I would support Barack Obama, I have not one negative thing to say about Hillary Clinton.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/13/lkl.01.html | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-04-01 | title=CNN.com}}</ref>}}

Later Dick Morris would see significance in the fact that Winfrey campaigned for Obama in December, and Iowa voted right after Christmas:

{{quote|Oprah is from the world of Christmas – mystical, cheerful, appealing, even beguiling. She is no policy wonk but is cast well as a black, female St. Nick bringing joy to the world. Her endorsement softens Obama, wraps him up, and makes of him a Christmas present to America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/12/the_oprah_factor_a_big_boost_f.html |title=Articles – The Oprah Factor: A Big Boost for Obama |publisher=RealClearPolitics |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>}}

"Because Oprah has such a reputation as a tastemaker, I think her early endorsement forced people to take Obama's candidacy seriously," explained Dr. Mark Anthony Neal, author, pop culture critic and Duke University professor. "It made Obama more than a 'Black' candidate. Also, given Oprah's championing of women's issues, her decision not to support Hillary (Clinton) struck a chord for early undecideds... Obama's people understood that much of the Black electorate in the South was made up of women, and Oprah's campaigning with the Obamas, particularly in South Carolina, helped give the campaign some momentum"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/News/NewsArticleOprahEffectonObamaWin.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished&Referrer=%7B0471DDF0-D0D8-48A8-9E30-ADD40CBE0269%7D |title=The 'Oprah' Effect: How Helped Obama Win &#124; News |publisher=BET.com |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>

In April 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' editorial board wrote:

{{quote|If Barack Obama is elected president, a good chunk of credit should go to Oprah Winfrey. Her early and enthusiastic endorsement of Senator Obama – and her heavily attended appearances with him in Iowa and South Carolina – played a big role in winning over bit parts of Middle America to the Obama cause.  Ms. Winfrey has since faded into the background of the campaign, but her impact persists.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/the-oprah-fication-of-michelle-obama/ | work=The New York Times | date=2008-08-26 | accessdate=2010-04-01 | title=The Oprah-fication of Michelle Obama}}</ref>}}

And Thomas Schaller noted:

{{quote|Oprah's unprecedented mid-December endorsement of Obama sent a clear signal to her mixed-race female-dominated audience that they should feel as comfortable having Obama on their living room television screens for the nightly newscast as they do having her there during late-afternoon coffee talk,|Thomas F. Schaller of Salon.com.<ref name="salon.com"/>}}

==Senate seat consideration==
The then governor of Illinois reported being so impressed by Winfrey's influence on the election of Barack Obama that he considered offering Winfrey Obama's vacant senate seat. Governor [[Blagojevich]] summarized his reasons for considering Winfrey on various talk shows:

{{quote|To begin with, she was perhaps the most instrumental person in electing Barack Obama president. She is a larger-than-life figure in America and around the world. She has a huge bully pulpit and tremendous support across America...She has a voice larger than all 100 senators combined. And if she was a U.S. Senator, she would be a voice for the Obama program, which she supports, and she would be in a position to be able to use an unbelievable bully pulpit to be able to get it done.  She obviously can't be bought. And she's actually a very, obviously, in my judgment, a very impressive and a very nice person.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,485046,00.html |title=Part 2 of Gov. Blagojevich on 'Glenn Beck' – Glenn Beck |publisher=Fox News |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>... On the other hand, how likely is it she'd give up what she's doing for that? I mean, being a senator's a big deal, but it ain't Oprah.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,484104,00.html |title=Gov.

Winfrey responded to the disclosure with amusement, noting that although she was absolutely not interested, she did feel she could be a senator.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wbbm780.com/Oprah--Absolutely-Not--Interested-In-Senate-Seat/3726315 |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 26, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090211055831/http://www.wbbm780.com/Oprah--Absolutely-Not--Interested-In-Senate-Seat/3726315 |archive-date=February 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Political analyst [[Chris Matthews]] praised the idea of making Winfrey a senator suggesting that in one move it would diversify the senate and raise its collective IQ.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28899478 |title='Hardball with Chris Matthews' for Monday, January 26 - NBC News tv - Hardball with Chris Matthews |publisher=NBC News |date=2009-01-28 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref> Elaborating further he said:

{{quote|Anybody who doesn't think Winfrey would be a great senator from Illinois or anywhere is crazy.  She gets along with everybody.  She brings people together.  She finds common ground.  She's way past race politics 20 years ago.  She's so far ahead of most people in human relations.  And she listens...I think she is up there with [[Will Rogers]] and [[Bob Hope]] and some of our great public personalities of the last century.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/>}}

[[Lynn Sweet]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' agreed with Matthews, claiming Winfrey would be "terrific" and an "enormously popular pick."<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/>

== Winfrey's potential presidential run ==
Winfrey has been urged by many media figures to run in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]], recalling her endorsement for Obama.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/08/oprah-for-president-in-2020-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Oprah for president in 2020?
