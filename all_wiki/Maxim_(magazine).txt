'''''Maxim''''' is an international [[Lads mags|men's magazine]], devised and launched in the UK in 1995, but based in [[New York City]] since 1997,<ref>{{cite journal|author2=Simon Mowatt|author1=Howard Cox|title=Technological change and innovation in consumer magazine publishing|journal=Technology Analysis and Strategic Management|date=2007|url=http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/229/1/TASM_preprint.pdf|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref> and prominent for its photography of [[actresses]], [[singers]], and female models whose careers are at a current peak. <!--Unsourced and still true?: It is the largest young men's lifestyle brand in America,--> ''Maxim'' has a circulation of about 9 million readers each month. Maxim Digital reaches more than 4 million unique viewers each month. ''Maxim'' magazine publishes 16 editions, sold in 75 countries worldwide.

==History==
''Maxim'' was founded by [[Felix Dennis]] in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2014/06/23/poet-founder-of-maxim-dead-at-dead-at-67.html|title=Poet-founder of Maxim, dead at 67|last=del Castillo|first=Michael|date=23 June 2014|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=7 January 2020}}</ref> and expanded to the United States in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/media/felix-dennis-founder-maxim-week-dies-67/293850|title=Felix Dennis, Founder of Maxim and The Week, Dies at 67|date=23 June 2014|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=7 January 2020}}</ref> 

''Maxim'' has expanded into many other countries, including [[Maxim (Australia)|Australia]].<!--Unsourced, or at least I'm not sure still published in these countries: [[Argentina]], [[Maxim (Australia)|Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Maxim (India)|India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], [[Romania]], the Czech Republic, [[France]] (marketed under ''Maximal''), [[Germany]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], Korea, [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]],  [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Singapore]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Portugal]] (marketed as "Maxmen").-->

In 1999, MaximOnline.com (now maxim.com) was created.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/5094509/Lads-mag-Maxim-moves-online-only-after-collapse-in-sales.html|title=Lads' mag Maxim moves online only after collapse in sales|last=Mason|first=Rowena|date=2009-04-02|access-date=2020-01-07|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> It contains content not included in the print version and focuses on the same general topics, along with exclusive sections such as the "Girls of ''Maxim''" galleries and the "Joke of the Day". "Maxim Video" contains video clips of interviews, music videos, photo shoots, and original content.

On February 5, 2005, [[Maxim Radio]], featuring male-oriented talk programming, debuted on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].  Following the Sirius-XM merger in late 2008, the Maxim brand was dropped, and the channel is now known as [[Sirius XM Stars Too]].

On June 5, 2006, the magazine announced plans to build a casino on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] north of [[Circus Circus Las Vegas|Circus Circus]], but the casino plan failed after local condominium owners complained that the proposed casino would ruin their view. The land was sold to [[MGM Mirage]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Stutz |title=MGM buys parcels for new center |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|pages=A1+A8 |date=April 19, 2007 }}</ref>

On June 15, 2007, private equity firm [[Quadrangle Group]], along with long-time media executive Kent Brownridge, announced the acquisition of the parent company of ''Maxim'', ''Blender'', ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' and MaximOnline.com in the United States, under the name Alpha Media Group. As of April 23, 2009 [[Dennis Publishing]] has announced that it will no longer continue producing a print edition of ''Maxim'' in the [[UK]], though the website for the UK version will remain.

In July 2009, ''Maxim'' partnered with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] for the first-ever ''Maxim'' UFC Octagon Girl Search at the UFC Fan Expo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmawaves.com/2009/07/02/ufc-and-maxim-partner-up-for-the-first-ever-octagon-girl-search-at-ufc-fan-expo |title=UFC and Maxim Partner Up For the First-Ever Octagon Girl Search at UFC Fan Expo|publisher=MMAWaves.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212115727/http://mmawaves.com/2009/07/02/ufc-and-maxim-partner-up-for-the-first-ever-octagon-girl-search-at-ufc-fan-expo |archive-date=December 12, 2012 }}</ref> 40 girls participated in the contest, and the winner was Natasha Wicks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmawaves.com/2009/07/17/maxim-ufc-octagon-girl-search-highlight-video/ |title=Maxim UFC Octagon Girl Search Highlight Video |publisher=MMAWaves.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022013/http://mmawaves.com/2009/07/17/maxim-ufc-octagon-girl-search-highlight-video|archive-date=December 25, 2012 }}</ref>

Quadrangle Group gave up on its investment in Alpha Media Group in August 2009, making [[Cerberus Capital Management]] the majority partner. In 2013, Alpha announced the sale of ''Maxim'' to the newly created Darden Media Group, but Darden was unable to raise the money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2013/darden-media-group-buys-maxim-alpha-media-group|title=Darden Media Group Buys Maxim from Alpha Media Group|work=Folio|date=September 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2013/12/20/darden-not-alpha-enough-to-nail-maxim-mag/|title=Darden not Alpha enough to nail Maxim mag|date=December 20, 2013|work=New York Post}}</ref> Calvin Darden, Jr. was later charged with fraud relating to the transaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/02/13/man-charged-in-scheme-to-fraudulently-buy-maxim-magazine/|title=Man Charged in Scheme to Fraudulently Buy Maxim Magazine|author=Adam Samson|work=Fox Business|access-date=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704040949/http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/02/13/man-charged-in-scheme-to-fraudulently-buy-maxim-magazine/|archive-date=July 4, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Between 2010 and 2012, ''Maxim'' eliminated two issues, going from 12 issues a year to 10, and decreased its circulation numbers by 20%, from a reported 2.5 million to only 2 million.<ref name="adage.com">{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/media/maxim-cuts-circulation-20/237351/ |title=Maxim Cuts Circulation|work=Adage.com |date=September 21, 2012|access-date=February 21, 2014}}</ref>

Maximum Warrior debuted in 2011, as an online reality competition that tests ten of America's most elite military operators in ten military-inspired challenges. The videos are available online and on the Maxim app on Xbox Live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://premiumpartners.atk.com/whatsnew/press_release.aspx?id=475&brand=30&year=2013 |title=Premium Partners - News Releases|publisher=Premium Partners|date=October 3, 2013 |access-date=February 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211060202/http://premiumpartners.atk.com/whatsnew/press_release.aspx?id=475&brand=30&year=2013|archive-date=December 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Several episodes feature [[Dakota Meyer]], ''Maxim''{{'}}s Military Advisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxim.com/military/dakota-meyer-joins-maxim-military-advisor|title=Dakota Meyer Joins Maxim as Military Advisor|work=Maxim|access-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218043354/http://www.maxim.com/military/dakota-meyer-joins-maxim-military-advisor |archive-date=February 18, 2014 }}</ref> Maximum Warrior is produced by [[Grand Street Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wheatoncollege.edu/quarterly/2012/05/17/action/|title=Action!|work=Wheaton Quarterly |access-date=February 21, 2014}}</ref>

On February 27, 2014, entrepreneur [[Sardar Biglari]], the founder of [[Biglari Holdings]] and Biglari Capital, purchased ''Maxim''. "We plan to build the business on multiple dimensions," he said at the time, "thereby energizing our readership and viewership." In September 2014 he hired [[Kate Lanphear]], the former style director of ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[T: The New York Times Fashion Magazine]]'' as editor, in an attempt to remake it as a luxury, lifestyle and fashion journal, at an annual salary that was thought to be more than $700,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/10/22/maxim-editor-ousted-after-failed-luxury-magazine-relaunch/|title=Maxim editor ousted after failed 'luxury magazine' relaunch|first=Keith J.|last=Kelly|date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> During Lanphear's tenure, the September 2015 issue featured actor [[Idris Elba]] on its cover, marking the first time that the magazine did not have a woman on the cover.<ref>{{cite news |first=VÃ©ronique |last=Hyland |title=Idris Elba Makes Men's History, Covers Maxim |url= http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/08/idris-elba-makes-mens-history-covers-maxim.html|work=New York Magazine|date=August 4, 2015}}</ref> Lanphear left the magazine in November 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/fashion/at-maxim-the-editor-kate-lanphear-is-on-her-way-out.html|title=At Maxim, the Editor Kate Lanphear Is on Her Way Out|first=Matthew|last=Schneier|date=October 23, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

In January 2016, Biglari officially took over as [[Editor-in-Chief]] of ''Maxim'', though a ''Maxim'' staffer said that the new masthead title just formalizes what has always been clear: Biglari exercises full editorial control over ''Maxim''. At one point last year, the staffer said, he decided to throw out a nearly-complete version of the December issue in order to completely redesign the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/01/8586909/maxim-name-owner-sardar-biglari-editor-chief|title=Maxim to name owner Sardar Biglari editor in chief|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506214030/http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/01/8586909/maxim-name-owner-sardar-biglari-editor-chief|archive-date=May 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 13, 2016, [[Gilles Bensimon]] joined Biglari as a special creative director. "What drew me to ''Maxim'' was Sardar's vision for the brand," said Bensimon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/media-news/fashion-memopad/maxim-names-gilles-bensimon-as-special-creative-advisor-sardar-bilgari-10313209/|title=Maxim Taps Gilles Bensimon as Special Creative Adviser|author=Alexandra Steigrad|work=WWD}}</ref>

In 2019, shortly after being acquired by Biglari, Maxim (aka, Alpha Media Group) has stopped paying vendor invoices and all contact information for their finance/accounting/legal teams has been removed. Maxim currently has several lawsuits pending, including City Marshalls currently trying to track them down, for large amount of unpaid fees due to vendors and contract workers.

== Events and controversies ==
[[File:Black crowes-Newport.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[The Black Crowes]]]]
In 2004, the Gender Issues Centre, an on-campus feminist organization at [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, protested an on-campus "Thunder Bay Boob Idol" event sponsored by ''Maxim'' and [[Coors Light]]. The Centre described ''Maxim'' as consisting of "sexist bravado and racist imagery".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rabble.ca/news/discriminating-tastes-discriminating-boobs|title=Discriminating tastes, discriminating 'boobs' |author=Margi Ende|date=December 7, 2004|access-date=November 25, 2015}}</ref> In 2006, Alok Jha of ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized ''Maxim'' for encouraging excessive [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol consumption]] and [[Objectification of women|sexual objectification of women]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=Alok Jho|title=Lad Culture Corrupts Men as much as it Debases Women|newspaper=The Guardian| date = March 30, 2006|url =https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/mar/30/comment.prisonsandprobation }}</ref>

In June 2007, Israeli diplomat [[David Saranga]] invited ''Maxim'' to the country.  In what came to be known as "beers and babes", the magazine did photo shoots of near-naked [[Israelis|Israeli]] women who serve in the [[Israeli army|army]].  The campaign drew an angry reaction from lawmaker [[Colette Avital]], a former diplomat who served as Israel's consul-general in New York City in the 1990s.<ref>Friedman, Matti (June 20, 2007).

In February 2008, ''Maxim'' was criticized by the rock band [[The Black Crowes]] for rating their upcoming CD, ''[[Warpaint (The Black Crowes album)|Warpaint]],'' without hearing the entire album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maxim Magazine reviews album without hearing it |publisher=blackcrowes.com |url=http://www.blackcrowes.com/Release_MAXIM.html |access-date=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225093224/http://www.blackcrowes.com/Release_MAXIM.html |archive-date=February 25, 2008 }}</ref> Black Crowes manager Pete Angelus said, "''Maxim''{{'}}s actions seem to completely lack journalistic integrity and intentionally mislead their readership." According to Crowes, the magazine stated in an email that "Of course, we always prefer to {{sic}} hearing music, but sometimes there are big albums that we donâ€™t want to ignore that arenâ€™t available to hear, which is what happened with the Crowes. Itâ€™s either an educated guess preview or no coverage at all, so in this case we chose the former." The magazine's editorial director [[James Kaminsky]] later apologized, stating "It is ''Maxim''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editorial policy to assign star ratings only to those albums that have been heard in their entirety. Unfortunately, that policy was not followed in the March 2008 issue of our magazine and we apologize to our readers."<ref>{{cite news|title=Maxim Apologizes for Black Crowes Review |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hHOAjk5E7X13mmzngI4wUdwCZZJQD8V25PNG1|access-date=February 26, 2008|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302054810/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hHOAjk5E7X13mmzngI4wUdwCZZJQD8V25PNG1 |archive-date=March 2, 2008 }}</ref> Facing more criticism over rating albums without listening to them, ''Maxim'' magazine maintains it was previewing CDs in its March 2008 issue, not reviewing them, and the mistake was to include star ratings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maxim: Whole reviewing mess a 'mistake'|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/28/music.blackcrowes.maxim.ap/index.html|access-date=February 28, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229222713/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/28/music.blackcrowes.maxim.ap/index.html|archive-date=February 29, 2008}}</ref>

In December 2019 Presto Media Productions, criticized the "Maxim Cover Girl 2019" competition with an independent documentary created by model, actress and producer Valentina Lucia Faltoni.
