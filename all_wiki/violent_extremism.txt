{{Terrorism}}
'''Violent extremism''' is a form of [[extremism]] that condones and enacts [[violence]] with [[ideological]] or deliberate intent, such as [[religious]] or [[political violence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.dhs.gov/countering-violent-extremism|title= Countering Violent Extremism {{!}} Homeland Security|website= www.dhs.gov|access-date= 2016-12-06 | quote = Violent extremist threats come from a range of groups and individuals, including domestic terrorists and homegrown violent extremists in the United States, as well as international terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL.}}</ref><ref name="Living Safe Together Home">{{Cite web|url= https://www.livingsafetogether.gov.au/about/Pages/about.aspx |title= Living Safe Together Home|website= www.livingsafetogether.gov.au|access-date= 2019-05-21 | quote = Extremism is a tendency or disposition to go to extremes, whether they be political, environmental or ideological extremes. <br> <br> Not all extremist behaviour leads to violence but if a person or group decides that fear, terror and violence are justified to achieve ideological, political or social change, and then acts on this belief, that is violent extremism.}}</ref> Violent extremist views can manifest in connection with a range of issues, including politics, religion and gender relations. Though "[[radicalization]]" is a contested term,{{by whom|date=May 2019}} its general use has come to regard the process by which an individual or group adopts violence as a desirable and legitimate means of action. Extremist thought that does not condone the exercise of violence may be accepted within society, and be promoted by groups working within the boundaries of legally permitted activity.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002446/244676e.pdf|title= A Teacher’s  Guide on the Prevention of Violent Extremism|publisher= UNESCO}}</ref> The term "violent extremism" may also occur as a [[code name]] for [[Islamic terrorism]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/obama-violent-extremism-radical-islam/385700/|title= The Real Reason Obama Avoids the Phrase 'Radical Islam'|first= Peter|last= Beinart| quote = For weeks now, pundits and politicians have been raging over President Obama's insistence that America is fighting 'violent extremism' rather than 'radical Islam.'}}</ref>

In [[United States military|United States]] [[military jargon]], the term "violent extremist organizations" (VEO) is defined as groups of "individuals who support or commit ideologically motivated violence to further political goals".<ref>The White House, ''Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States'' (Washington, D.C.: Office of the President, 2011), available at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/sipfinal.pdf</ref> This may include both international terrorist organizations (ITO) and homegrown violent extremists (HVE).<ref>

== Causes ==
There is no single profile or pathway for radicalization, or even speed at which it happens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Lynn|title=Educating against Extremism: Towards a Critical Politicisation of Young People|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ830767|journal=International Review of Education|volume=55|pages=183–203|doi=10.1007/s11159-008-9126-8|issn=0020-8566}}</ref> Nor does the level of education seem to be a reliable predictor of vulnerability to radicalization. It is however established that there are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]], [[Psychology|psychological]], and [[institution]]al factors that lead to violent extremism. Specialists group these factors into three main categories: push factors, pull factors, and contextual factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA929.pdf|title=USAID Summary of Factors Effecting Violent Extremism|website=USAID}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://apo.org.au/resource/countering-violent-extremism-developing-evidence-base-policy-and-practice|title=Countering violent extremism: developing an evidence-base for policy and practice|last=Younis|first=Sara Zeiger, Anne Aly, Peter R.

Evans, Stevan Weine, Ahmed|date=2015-09-22|newspaper=Australian Policy Online|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

=== Push factors ===
“Push Factors” drive individuals to violent extremism, such as: [[marginalization]], inequality, [[discrimination]], [[persecution]] or the perception thereof; limited access to quality and relevant education; the denial of rights and civil liberties; and other environmental, historical and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] grievances.<ref name=":0" />

=== Pull factors ===
“Pull Factors” nurture the appeal of violent extremism, for example: the existence of well-organized violent extremist groups with compelling discourses and effective programs that are providing services, revenue and/or employment in exchange for membership. Groups can also lure new members by providing outlets for grievances and promise of adventure and freedom. Furthermore, these groups appear to offer spiritual comfort, “a place to belong” and a supportive social network.<ref name=":0" />

==== Radicalization and the Internet ====
''See also:'' [[Online youth radicalization]]

The current state of evidence on the link between the [[Internet]], [[social media]], and violent [[radicalization]] is very limited and it is still inconclusive. Most studies fail to provide evidence on the drivers of interest in extremist sites, the engagement of social media in these issues, the reasons for the influence of its content, and the correlated external and internal factors, as well as the trajectories of youth who come to perpetuate violent acts.<ref name=":72">Alava, Séraphin; Frau-Meigs, Divina & Hassan, Ghayda (2017). ''[https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000260382 Youth and Violent Extremism on Social Media: Mapping the Research]'' (PDF). UNESCO. pp. 1-167.</ref>

Some evidence suggests that the Internet and social media may play a role in the violent radicalization process, mainly through the dissemination of information and [[propaganda]], as well as the reinforcement, identification and engagement of a (self)-selected audience that is interested in radical and violent messages. The synthesis of evidence shows, at its best, that social media is an environment that facilitates violent radicalization, rather than driving it.<ref name=":72" />

=== Contextual factors ===
Contextual factors that provide a favorable terrain to the emergence of violent extremist groups, such as: fragile states, the lack of [[rule of law]], [[corruption]] and [[Crime|criminality]].

The following behaviors in combination have been identified as signs of potential radicalization:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr/|title=Stop-Djihadisme|website=Stop-Djihadisme|access-date=2016-12-06}}</ref><ref name=":0" />
* Sudden break with the family and long-standing friendships.
* Sudden drop-out of school and conflicts with the school.
* Change in behavior relating to food, clothing, language or finances.
* Changes in attitudes and behavior towards others: antisocial comments, rejection of authority, refusal to interact socially, signs of withdrawal and isolation.
* Regular viewing of internet sites and participation in social media networks that condone radical or extremist views.
* Reference to apocalyptic and conspiracy theories.

== Prevention of radicalization and deradicalization ==

=== Education ===
[[File:Key dimensions of preventing Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Key dimensions of preventing violent extremism]]
The role of [[education]] in preventing violent extremism and [[Deradicalization|deradicalizing]] young people has only recently gained global acceptance. An important step in this direction was the launch, in December 2015, of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]]’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism which recognizes the importance of quality education to address the drivers of this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sc/ctc/docs/2015/SCR%202178_2014_EN.pdf|title=Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Report of the Secretary-General|publisher=United Nations}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The [[United Nations Security Council]] also emphasized this point in its Resolutions 2178 and 2250, which notably highlights the need for “quality education for peace that equips youth with the ability to engage constructively in civic structures and inclusive political processes” and called on “all relevant actors to consider instituting mechanisms to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue that involve youth and discourage their participation in acts of violence, terrorism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unoy.org/wp-content/uploads/SCR-2250.pdf|title=UN Security Council Resolution 2250, adopted in December 2015|publisher=United Nations}}</ref>

Education has been identified as preventing radicalization through:<ref name=":0" />
* Developing the [[communication]] and [[interpersonal skills]] they need to dialogue, face [[disagreement]] and learn peaceful approaches to change.
* Developing [[critical thinking]] to investigate claims, verify [[rumor]]s and question the legitimacy and appeal of extremist beliefs.
* Developing resilience to resist extremist narratives and acquire the social-emotional skills they need to overcome their doubts and engage constructively in society without having to resort to violence.
* Fostering critically informed citizens able to constructively engage in peaceful collective action.

[[UNESCO]] has emphasized [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as an emerging approach to education that focuses on developing learners’ knowledge, skills, values and attitudes in view of their active participation in the peaceful and sustainable development of their societies. GCED aims to instill respect for [[human rights]], [[social justice]], [[gender equality]] and [[environmental sustainability]], which are fundamental values that help raise the defenses of peace against violent extremism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global  Citizenship Education – Topics and Learning Objectives|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002277/227729e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education - Preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> In line with the understanding of Global Citizenship Education, individual level impacts, which encompasses three domains of learning include: cognitive, social-emotional and behavioural. Cognitive impacts involves critical thinking skills, understanding of violent extremism and radicalization. Social-emotional impacts relate to the development of a sense of belonging to a common humanity, sharing values and responsibilities, based on human rights. Behavioral impacts relate to encouraging participants to act effectively and responsibly at local, national and global levels for a more peaceful and sustainable world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000266105.pdf|title=Preventing violent extremism through education: effective activities and impact; policy brief|last=UNESCO|date=2018}}</ref>

==== Media and Information Literacy (MIL) ====
[[UNESCO]] has also emphasized the need for [[Information and media literacy|Media and Information Literacy (MIL)]] as increasing terrorist attacks have called attention for more critical approaches to media via MIL and the issue of radicalization has been added to the MIL agenda. According to UNESCO, "MIL can effectively contribute to intercultural dialogue, mutual understanding, peace, promote human rights, freedom of expression, and counter hate, radicalization, and violent extremism."<ref name=":72" /> MIL has also been described as a strategy for "reducing demand for extremist content as a means to increase awareness of democracy, pluralism, and peaceful ideas for advancement."<ref>Neumann, P. R. (2013). Options and strategies for countering online radicalization in the United States. ''Studies in Conflict & Terrorism, 36''(6), 431-459. https://doi.org/10.1080/1057610X.2013.784568</ref><ref name=":72" />

Several formal and informal MIL initiatives have been implemented worldwide based on MIL as a [[pedagogical]] practice with a specific set of [[Competence (human resources)|competences]] that can deflect narratives of [[anger]] and [[revenge]] and/or [[self-realization]] through violent extremism. These initiatives aim at creating digital counter-narratives that are authentic and reflect youth perceptions of self and others, especially in terms of [[injustice]], felt experiences of [[discrimination]], [[corruption]] and [[abuse]] by security forces.<ref>Mercy Corps. (2015). [https://www.mercycorps.org/sites/default/files/MercyCorps_YouthConsequencesReport_2015.pdf Youth & Consequences. Unemployment, Injustice and Violence].</ref><ref name=":72" />

=== Pakistan's Sabaoon Project ===
[[File:Sabaoons deradicalisation Preventing violent extremism.svg|thumb|Sabaoon's deradicalization and rehabilitation model]]
The Sabaoon Project, initiated by the [[Pakistan Army]] and run by the Social Welfare Academics and Training organization (SWAaT) since 2009, has been implemented to deradicalize and rehabilitate former militant youth who were involved in violent extremist activities and apprehended by the army in [[Swat District|Swat]] and the surrounding areas in Pakistan. Based on an individualized approach and intervention, the project follows a three-step model (see image).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002477/247764e.pdf|title=Preventing violent extremism through education: A guide for policy makers|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100215-1|pages=24, 36, 41}}</ref>

=== Kenya’s initiatives to address radicalization of youth in educational institutions ===
To tackle the issue of violent extremism and radicalization in schools, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of Kenya launched a new national strategy targeting youth in 2014, entitled Initiatives to Address Radicalization of the Youth in Educational Institutions in the Republic of Kenya. The Strategy adopted measures that service the students’ interests and [[well-being]]. For example, it includes efforts to create child-friendly school environments and encourages students to participate in “talent academies” to pursue an area of their own interest.<ref name=":1" />

The Strategy also includes the discontinuation of ranking schools based on [[academic performance]]. This was to lessen the overemphasis on examinations and to reduce student pressure, incorporating other indicators of student achievement, such as abilities in sport and artistic talent. The purpose is to reduce the stress of students’ lives at home and in school that may be vented through escape tactics, including joining outlawed groups. The Strategy also employs other effective means to prevent violent extremism, including the integration of Preventing of Violent Extremism through Education (PVE-E) in [[Curriculum|curricula]] and school programs; adopting a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach; encouraging student participation through student governance processes and peer-to-peer education; and the involvement of media as a stakeholder.<ref name=":1" />

== Gender disparity ==
While it is being increasingly reported that women play an active role in violent extremist organizations and attacks as assailants and supporters, men are still more often the perpetrators of violent extremist acts and therefore the targets of recruitment campaigns.<ref>Carter, Becky. (2013). ''[http://www.gsdrc.org/docs/open/hdq898.pdf Women and violent extremism]'', GSDRC. Accessed on 2 November 2016.</ref><ref>[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/720/18/PDF/N0072018.pdf?OpenElement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security]. Accessed on 1 December 2016.</ref><ref name=":1" />

Some research suggests however, that "women are serious candidates for violent radicalization."<ref>Von Knop, Katharina. (2007). Hypermedia Seduction for Terrorist Recruiting. Conference Papers -- International Studies Association, 1.</ref> Although there may be a gender-based distribution of tasks (e.g. especially where participation in combat is involved), this distinction does not apply when it comes to embracing the radical [[ideology]] of, or the legitimation of, violent attacks. Some reports reveal that women recognize the same truths and accept the same rules of compliance validated by [[doctrine]]s as compared to their male counterparts.<ref name=":8">Hussein H. & Moreno Al-Ajamî C. (2016). [https://cdradical.hypotheses.org/15 Le djihad fantasmé de Daesh]. ''cdradical.hypotheses.org''.</ref> When they are radicalized, women may appear more indoctrinated than men and more prone to encourage political violence.<ref name=":9">Bermingham, Adam, Conway, Maura, McInerney, Lisa, O’Hare, Neil, & Smeaton, Alan F. (2009). [http://doras.dcu.ie/4554/3/DCU_asonam09.pdf Combining Social Network Analysis and Sentiment Analysis to Explore the Potential for Online Radicalization]. 2009 International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (pp. 231-236).</ref><ref name=":72" />

=== Online gender issues in religious violent radicalization ===
In spite of the growing presence of radicalized women online, the number of articles devoted to gender and radicalization on social media is very low. One possible explanation may stem from the fact that many women cloak their female identity online, because of a [[Masculinity|masculinist]] bias,<ref name=":9" /> making them impossible to identify.<ref name=":72" />

Online recruitment functions differently at a distance and reshuffles the roles of men and women alike. One identified trend is a [[Feminism|feminist]] claim of women coming forward to take their place in the fighting, which coincides with a structured use of communication processes by terrorist groups to recruit them. The Internet allows women to move out of relative invisibility, without crossing the limits drawn by their ideology.<ref name=":8" /><ref name=":72" />
