'''Khat''' or '''qat''' (''Catha edulis'', {{lang-ar|القات}} ''al-qāt''; {{Lang-am|ጫት}} ''ch’at'') is a [[flowering plant]] native to [[Ethiopia]]. Khat contains the [[alkaloid]] [[cathinone]], a [[stimulant]], which is said to cause excitement, [[Anorectic|loss of appetite]], and [[euphoria]]. Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of [[coca]] leaves in South America and [[betel nut]] in Asia.<ref name="Kciy" />

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) classified it in 1980 as a [[drug of abuse]] that can produce [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]],<ref name="King">{{Cite journal|last1=Nutt |first1=D. |last2=King |first2=L.A. |last3=Saulsbury |first3=C. |title=Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse |journal=Lancet |volume=369 |issue=9566 |pages=1047–53 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17382831 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4 |last4=Blakemore |first4=Colin|s2cid=5903121 }}</ref> although the WHO does not consider khat addiction to be a serious problem.<ref name="Kciy">{{cite journal|last=Al-Mugahed|first=Leen|year=2008|title=Khat Chewing in Yemen: Turning over a New Leaf: Khat Chewing Is on the Rise in Yemen, Raising Concerns about the Health and Social Consequences|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-188738635/khat-chewing-in-Yemen-turning-over-a-new-leaf-khat|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|issue=10|pages=741–42|doi=10.2471/BLT.08.011008|pmc=2649518|pmid=18949206|access-date=9 January 2014}}</ref>

The legality of khat varies by region. In many countries, khat might not be a specifically controlled substance but may nevertheless be illegal under more general laws. It is a specifically [[controlled substance]] in some countries including [[Canada]], [[Germany]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]]. By contrast, the production, sale, and consumption are legal in the nations where its use is traditional of those cultures, including [[Djibouti]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] and [[Yemen]].<ref name="Hafmc">{{cite journal|title=Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2009 | doi=10.1080/02791072.2009.10400669 |pmid=19455904 |last1=Manghi |first1=Rita Annoni |last2=Broers |first2=Barbara |last3=Khan |first3=Riaz |last4=Benguettat |first4=Djamel |last5=Khazaal |first5=Yasser |last6=Zullino |first6=Daniele Fabio |s2cid=30637165 }}</ref> In [[Israel]], which hosts a population of [[Yemenite Jews]], only the consumption of the plant's leaves in its natural state is permitted.<ref>''Sadeh ve'yerek'' – Newspaper of the Vegetable Growers Association, Issue 230, Tel-Aviv (March 2011).

==Nomenclature==

The Arabic name is قات, regularly [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]] as ''qāt''. In English, the spellings ''qat'' and ''khat'' were equally common until about 2000, when the ''khat'' spelling became more common.<ref>[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=khat%2Cqat&year_start=1900&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ckhat%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cqat%3B%2Cc0 Google Books Ngram Viewer]</ref> Other romanizations include ''kat'', ''quatt'', ''qaad'', ''qhat'', ''ghat'', and ''chat''.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1st edition, 1901 [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/102615 ''s.v.'']</ref><ref name="Tooea">{{cite book|last=Dickens |first=Charles |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdUnAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA176 |chapter=The Orsons of East Africa |title=Household Words: A Weekly Journal, Volume 14 |year=1856 |orig-year=Digitized 19 February 2010 |page=176 |access-date=9 January 2014 |publisher=Bradbury & Evans}} {{open access}} {{link note|note=Free eBook}}</ref> It also goes by various descriptive names, such as ''Abyssinian Tea'', ''Somali Tea'', ''Miraa'', ''Arabian Tea'', ''Jimaa'', and ''Kafta'' in its endemic regions of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.<ref name="Tooea"/><ref name=AlZarouni>{{cite book|last=Al Zarouni|first=Yousif|title=The Effects of Khat (Catha Edulis)|year=2015|publisher=Yousif Al Zarouni|location=London|isbn=978-1-326-24867-3|edition=First}}</ref>{{rp|4–5}}<ref name="Adfkf">{{cite web|title=Khat facts |url=http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/khat |publisher=ADF |access-date=14 May 2013}}</ref> In the [[African Great Lakes region]], where ''Catha edulis'' is in some areas cultivated, it is known as ''miraa'', ''muhulo'' and ''muirungi''.<ref name="GRIN">{{GRIN | access-date = 10 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book|last=Rätsch|first=Christian|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications|year=2004|publisher=Park Street Press, U.S.|isbn=978-0892819782}}</ref> In South Africa, the plant is known as ''Bushman's Tea''.<ref name="dwaf">{{cite web|url=http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf |title=Protected Trees |date=3 May 2013 |publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Republic of South Africa |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705085122/http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf |archive-date= 5 July 2010 }}</ref> Other names for khat include ''Chat Tree'' and ''Flower of Paradise''.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

==Description==
Khat is a slow-growing [[shrub]] or tree that typically attains a height of {{convert|1-5|m|abbr=on}}. However, it can reach heights of up to {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} in equatorial areas. The plant usually grows in [[Desert climate|arid]] environments, at a temperature range of {{convert|5|-|35|C|F}}.<ref name="Pfgce">{{cite web|title=Growing Catha edulis |url=http://www.plot55.com/growing/c.edulis.html |publisher=Plot55 |access-date=26 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826115643/http://www.plot55.com/growing/c.edulis.html |archive-date=26 August 2013 }}</ref> It has [[evergreen]] [[Leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|5–10|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|1-4|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} broad. The shrub's flowers are produced on short axillary [[Cyme (botany)#Determinate or Cymose|cymes]] that are {{convert|4-8|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Each flower is small, with five white petals. The [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] fruit is an oblong, three-valved capsule, which contains one to three seeds.

==Cultivation and uses==
[[File:Khat fields in western yemen.jpg|thumb|Khat cultivation in western Yemen near [[At Tawilah]]]]
[[File:Qat tree,yemen.jpg|thumb|Qat tree, Yemen]]
The khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as ''qat'' and ''gat'' in Yemen, ''qaat'' and ''jaad'' in [[Somalia]], and ''chat'' in [[Ethiopia]].<ref name="Kciy" /> It is also known as ''jimaa'' in the [[Oromo language]], ''mayirungi'' in [[Luganda]], and as ''miraa'' in Kenya. Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, especially in Kasenge (Wakiso), Butambala District, Mabira Forest, and in some parts of the western region of the country .<ref name="Kciy"/> In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.

Although the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the [[Red Sea]] area,<ref name="Kciy"/> the khat plant has over the years found its way to [[Southern Africa]] as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and [[Mpumalanga]] provinces of [[South Africa]], in addition to [[Swaziland]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref name="Pzce">{{cite web|title=Catha edulis |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantcd/cathedulis.htm |publisher=PlantZAfrica.com |access-date=15 January 2014}}</ref>

Its fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has [[anorectic]] (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, [[Amsterdam]], Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,<ref name="NZ_Herald_10415187">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10415187 |title=Concerns over African methamphetamine-like drug in Hamilton |first=O'Rourke |last=Simon |date=13 December 2006 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=12 October 2011}}</ref> and the United States. In the US, freshly packed khat leaves are sold on the markets of New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas, where the demand is highest.<ref>Zecharia Madar, "The Khat Phenomenon in Yemen and the Dangers it Poses", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid & Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 144 {{OCLC|1041776317}}</ref> Traditionally, khat is used as a socialising drug as in Yemen where khat-chewing is predominantly a male habit.<ref name="Sanaa">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm |title=Yemen's khat habit soaks up water |first=Alex |last=Kirby |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 April 2007 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>

Khat is so popular in Yemen that its cultivation consumes much of the country's agricultural resources. An estimated 40% of [[Water supply and sanitation in Yemen|Yemen's water supply]] goes towards irrigating it,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/752130/yemen-legal-high-is-fueling-extremism |title=Sky News report on Yemen's Qat |first=Tim |last=Marshall |newspaper=[[Sky News]] |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=4 April 2010}}</ref> with production increasing by about 10% to 15% every year. One "daily bag" of khat requires an estimated {{convert|500|L|gal}} of water to produce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/11/110411fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all |title=After the Uprising |first=Dexter |last=Filkins |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=11 April 2011 |access-date=5 April 2011}}</ref> Water consumption is high and [[groundwater]] levels in the Sanaa basin are diminishing, so government officials have proposed relocating large portions of the population of [[Sana'a]] to the coast of the [[Red Sea]].<ref name="Sanaa" />

One reason for khat being cultivated in Yemen so widely is the high income it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5&nbsp;million [[Yemeni rial]]s per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57&nbsp;million rials per hectare. Between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated was estimated to have grown from 8,000 to 103,000 hectares.<ref name="encyemen">{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Yemen |edition=2nd |publisher=Alafif Cultural Foundation |pages=2309–14 |year=2003 |language=ar}}{{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- Title of entry, original/transliterated titles of the book, and ISBN, please. --></ref> In 2000, according to a [[World Bank]] estimate, khat accounted for 30% of Yemen's economy.<ref name="ec" />

In other countries, outside of its core area of growth and consumption, khat is sometimes chewed at parties or social functions. It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.

It takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.

More recently, in 2019, reports indicate that child soldiers in Yemen have been chewing khat in order to remain alert on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-crisis-meet-the-child-soldiers-who-have-forsaken-books-for-kalashnikovs-10187235.html |title = Yemen crisis: Meet the child soldiers who have forsaken books for|date = 19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-child-soldiers.html |title = For Yemen Child Soldiers, a Refuge Mixes Play with Saudi Propaganda|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 22 February 2019|last1 = Kirkpatrick|first1 = David D.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/01/04/the-drug-that-is-starving-yemen.html]</ref>

The use of khat results in [[constipation]]. [[Pupillary response|Dilated pupil]]s ([[mydriasis]]) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the [[sympathomimetic]] effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure. Long-term use can precipitate permanent [[tooth]] darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s, and diminished [[Libido|sex drive]].

Khat is an effective [[anorectic]], causing loss of appetite.{{medcn|date=May 2018}}

==Chemistry and pharmacology==
[[File:S-Cathinone.svg|thumb|right|Cathinone structure]]
The stimulant effect of the plant was originally attributed to "katin", [[cathine]], a [[phenethylamine]]-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid [[cathinone]] was isolated, and its [[absolute configuration]] was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and [[norephedrine]]. These chemicals belong to the [[phenylpropanolamine|PPA (phenylpropanolamine)]] family, a subset of the [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] related to [[amfetamine|amphetamines]] and the [[catecholamine]]s [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name="drugs">{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/khat.html |title=Complete Khat Info |author=Drugs.com |date=1 January 2007}}</ref> In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine.<ref name="cox2003">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/apt.9.6.456 |title=Adverse effects of khat: a review |year=2003 |last1=Cox |first1=G. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=456–63}}</ref> Khat is sometimes confused with [[methcathinone]] (also known as ''cat''), a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule I]] substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.<ref name="Dfk">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugfree.org/drug-guide/khat |title=DF – Khat |website=Drugfree.org |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>

When khat leaves dry, the more potent chemical, cathinone, decomposes within 48 hours, leaving behind the milder chemical, cathine. Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.

When the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the [[reuptake]] of [[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed |first1=M.B. |last2=El-Qirbi |first2=A.B. |title=Biochemical effects of Catha edulis, cathine and cathinone on adrenocortical functions |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=213–16 |date=August 1993 |pmid=7903110 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(93)90039-8}}</ref>

Receptors for [[serotonin]] show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat. In mice, cathinone produces the same types of nervous pacing or repetitive scratching behaviours associated with amphetamines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970615054349/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 June 1997 |title=Behavioral Effects of Cathinone }}</ref> The effects of cathinone peak after 15 to 30 minutes, with nearly 98% of the substance metabolised into norephedrine by the liver.<ref name="cox2003" />

Cathine is somewhat less understood, being believed to act upon the [[adrenergic receptors]] causing the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Adeoya-Osiguwa |first1=S.A. |last2=Fraser |first2=L.R. |title=Cathine, an amphetamine-related compound, acts on mammalian spermatozoa via beta1- and alpha2A-adrenergic receptors in a capacitation state-dependent manner |journal=Hum.

However, amongst communities in the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Djibouti]], Ethiopia, [[Somalia]]) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.<ref name="Kciy" />

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian imperial cults considered the khat plant a sacred substance, which was capable of realizing a user's [[Deity|divinity]]. These early Egyptians consumed the plant ceremoniously in attempts to transcend into "[[apotheosis]]" and or garner and manifest [[mysticism|mystical experiences]], [[trance|systemic trances]], and other [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] experiences rather than habitual recreational use or abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Giannini |first1=A.J. |last2=Burge |first2=H. |last3=Shaheen |first3=J.M. |last4=Price |first4=W.A. |title=Khat: another drug of abuse? |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=155–58 |year=1986 |pmid=3734955|doi=10.1080/02791072.1986.10471395|doi-broken-date=6 November 2020 }}</ref> [[Sufism|Sufis]] also used it to intensify their [[Mysticism#Mystical experience and union with the Divine|mystical experience]] and to facilitate a sense of union with God.<ref>[http://oceanindien.revues.org/851 “Khat in the Western Indian Ocean – Regional Linkages and Disjunctures”] Neil Carrier et Lisa Gezon, 42–43 | 2009 : ''Plantes et Sociétés'', pp. 271–97.</ref>

The earliest known documented description of khat is found in the ''Kitab al-Saidala fi al-Tibb'' {{lang|ar|كتاب الصيدلة في الطب}}, an 11th-century work on [[pharmacy]] and [[materia medica]] written by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], a [[Islamic science|Persian scientist]] and [[Islamic medicine|biologist]]. Unaware of its origins, al-Bīrūnī wrote that khat is:<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth F. |last1=Kiple |first2=Kriemhild Coneè |last2=Ornelas |year=2001 |title=The Cambridge World History of Food |pages=672–73 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-40216-3 |oclc=174647831}}</ref>

{{quote|[A] commodity from [[Turkestan]]. It is sour to taste and slenderly made in the manner of ''batan-alu''. But ''khat'' is reddish with a slight blackish tinge. It is believed that ''batan-alu'' is red, coolant, relieves biliousness, and is a refrigerant for the stomach and the liver.}}

In 1854, [[Malaysia|Malay]] author [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]] noted that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in [[Al Hudaydah]] in Yemen:<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/713672763 |title=Munshi Abdullah's voyage to Mecca: A preliminary introduction and annotated translation |year=2000 |last1=Ché-Ross |first1=Raimy |journal=Indonesia and the Malay World |volume=28 |issue=81 |pages=173–213|s2cid=162579224 }}</ref>

{{quote|You observed a new peculiarity in this city&nbsp;– everyone chewed leaves as goats chew the [[cud]]. There is a type of leaf, rather wide and about two fingers in length, which is widely sold, as people would consume these leaves just as they are; unlike [[betel]] leaves, which need certain condiments to go with them, these leaves were just stuffed fully into the mouth and munched. Thus when people gathered around, the remnants from these leaves would pile up in front of them. When they spat, their [[saliva]] was green. I then queried them on this matter: ‘What benefits are there to be gained from eating these leaves?’ To which they replied, ‘None whatsoever, it’s just another expense for us as we’ve grown accustomed to it’. Those who consume these leaves have to eat lots of [[ghee]] and [[honey]], for they would fall ill otherwise. The leaves are known as ''Kad''."}}

In 1856, English writer [[Charles Dickens]] also described the custom of khat chewing in the Horn region and the adjacent Gulf territories, likening it to drinking strong [[green tea]]:<ref name="Tooea"/>

{{quote|And one may sleep well if, during the day, too much kat has not been chewed. The leaves of the drug called kat are the chief source of pleasurable excitement in these districts of East Africa. Botanists, taking the native name for the plant, turn it into Catha edulis, eatable kat. It is much used by the Arabs, to whom it is sent in camel loads, consisting of a number of small parcels, each containing about forty slender twigs, with the leaves attached, carefully, wrapped so as to avoid exposure to the air. These leaves are chewed, and act upon the spirits of those using them, much as a strong dose of green tea acts upon us in Europe, when it acts agreeably. Europeans used to stronger stimulants, are little affected by the use of kat, but among the more temperate Arabs it is so welcome a provocative to good humour, that about two hundred and eighty camel-loads of it are used every year in Aden only.}}

[[File:HarariMen.jpg|thumb|[[Harari people|Harari]] men consuming khat in the street of [[Harar]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
Nowadays khat consumption is limited to [[East Africa]] and South Western [[Arabia]]. These countries include [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Somalia]] (includes [[Somaliland]]), [[Uganda]], and [[Yemen]]. The author Yousif Al Zarouni writes in his book:<ref name=AlZarouni />{{rp|4}}

Following a ban on khat in the British-governed [[Aden Protectorate]], the [[Qāt Commission of Inquiry in Aden]] concluded: "Qāt does not create an addiction, like opium or hashish, in that those who are suddenly deprived of it, do not suffer physical consequences."<ref name="HehmeyerSchönig2012">{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Hehmeyer|author2=Hannelore Schönig|author3=Hanne Schönig|title=Herbal Medicine in Yemen: Traditional Knowledge and Practice, and Their Value for Today's World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm-bCFRcMHoC&pg=PA92|year=2012|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-22150-5|pages=92–}}</ref>

==Regulation==
In 1965, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs' ''Fourteenth Report'' noted, "The Committee was pleased to note the resolution of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] with respect to khat, confirming the view that the abuse of this substance is a regional problem and may best be controlled at that level."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1965-01-01_4_page007.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830160515/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1965-01-01_4_page007.html |archive-date=30 August 2003 |title=World Health Organization Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs: Fourteenth Report |publisher=United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime}}</ref> For this reason, khat was not scheduled under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].

====Israel====
Khat, called "Gat" in Israel, is consumed mainly by [[Yemenite Jews]]. The activity of chewing its leaves is called "lehazen" (לכזן he). The process of chewing the Gat can take up to several hours. Some chew the Gat in a gathering which is called "tahazina" (תכזינה he). The Gat is grown traditionally in private gardens, but it may be found in some markets.

The Gat is legal in Israel as long as it’s consumed in its natural form, a fact that makes distillation of its components illegal.

Some use the plant as a hedge since it’s evergreen.

On 23 January 2013, the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) said there was "insufficient evidence" that khat caused health problems.

In March 2014, the United Kingdom House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee announced that it would continue to lobby for the UK government not to go through with its intended ban on khat.

In January 2015, the ''[[Bristol Post]]'' reported that most khat houses in the city had closed down, "forcing users to take the drug in their homes instead".

Additionally, in September 2014 the police had seized 24 bags of dried khat from a property in [[Easton, Bristol|Easton]], but no arrests were made.

====Canada====
In Canada, khat is a controlled substance under Schedule IV of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] (CDSA), meaning it is illegal to seek or obtain unless approved by a [[medical practitioner]]. Possession of khat for personal use is not an arraingable offence in Canada. The maximum punishment for trafficking or possession with the intent of trafficking is ten years in prison.<ref name="justice">{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-38.8/bo-ga:s_1::bo-ga:s_2?page=2 |title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date=29 March 2010 |access-date=4 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063752/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-38.8/bo-ga%3As_1%3A%3Abo-ga%3As_2?page=2 |archive-date= 5 June 2011 }}</ref>

In 2008, Canadian authorities reported that khat is the most common illegal drug being smuggled at airports.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1216/p06s01-wogn.html |title=Gangs infiltrate Canada's airports |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |date=16 December 2008 |access-date=2 April 2010}}</ref>

However, in 2012 the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] upheld a 2011 absolute discharge of a young woman who brought 34 kilograms of khat into Canada in 2009.

In the United States, cathinone is a Schedule I drug, according to the US [[Controlled Substance Act]]. The 1993 [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] rule placing cathinone in Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning khat:

''Catha edulis'' (khat) is a stimulant similar to that of amphetamine and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]], not a drug as categorised by US FDA (United States Food & Drug Administration) and FDA import Alert #66-23 (published date 03/18/2011) states that "Districts may detain, without physical examination, all entries of khat",<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_180.html |title=Import Alert 66-23 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=2011-03-18 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> based on section 801(a) (3) of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] on the grounds that "its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use."

As federal and local khat raids have often targeted immigrants from countries where khat is legal, issues of cultural misunderstanding have sometimes been raised.<ref>Verhovek, Sam Howe (2006).

The plant itself is specifically banned in Missouri:
