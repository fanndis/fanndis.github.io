==History==
The genesis of ''USA Today'' was on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as "Project NN" met with [[Gannett]] chairman Al Neuharth in [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]] to develop a national newspaper. Early regional prototypes included ''East Bay Today'', an [[Oakland, California]]-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the ''[[Oakland Tribune]]'', an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-09-29-9103140104-story.html | title=PAPER PURSUES LIFE AFTER DEBT | first=James | last=Warren | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=September 29, 1991| url-access=subscription}}</ref> On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism, for review and feedback.<ref name="garcia-usatoday1"/><ref name=timeline>{{cite news | title=USA TODAY Media Kit :: Press Room :: Press Kit :: Timeline | url=https://static.usatoday.com/about/timeline/ | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=Gannett}}</ref> Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled ''USA Today'', on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's [[chief executive officer]].<ref name=timeline/><ref name="marking30">{{cite web|title=USA Today Is Turning 30, in Danger of 'Marking 30'|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/columns/usa-today-is-turning-30-in-danger-of-marking-30/ |author=John K. Hartman|website=[[Editor and Publisher]]|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref>

Gannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. ''USA Today'' began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] metropolitan areas for a newsstand price of 25¢ (equivalent to {{Inflation|US|25|1982|fmt=c}}¢ today). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected.

The design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a [[spot color]] format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics – developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant – was derided by critics, who referred to it as a "[[McDonald's|McPaper]]" or "television you can wrap fish in", because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of [[television news]], rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a [[dumbing down]] of content.<ref name=timeline/><ref name="marking30"/><ref name="garcia-usatoday2">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 2—-A newspaper that influenced all of us|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_2---a_newspaper_that_influenced_all_of_us|author=Mario R. García|website=García Media|date=September 10, 2012}}</ref> Although ''USA Today'' had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Psvlik|first1=John|last2=Mclntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media|year=2016|publisher=Oxford|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-027151-0|edition=Fifth}}</ref>

On July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from predominantly black-and-white to full color photography and graphics in all four sections. The next week on July 10, ''USA Today'' launched an international edition intended for U.S. readers abroad, followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to [[Singapore]]. On April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page section called "Baseball '85", which previewed the [[1985 Major League Baseball season]].<ref name=timeline/>

By the fourth quarter of 1985, ''USA Today'' had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4&nbsp;million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5&nbsp;million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, ''USA Today'' began production of its international edition in [[Switzerland]]. ''USA Today'' operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233&nbsp;million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.<ref name=timeline/>

On January 29, 1988, ''USA Today'' published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing [[Super Bowl XXII]]; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its [[Labor Day]] weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, ''USA Today'' launched a third international printing site, based in [[Hong Kong]]. The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.<ref name=timeline/>

By July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that ''USA Today'' had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6&nbsp;million, an all-time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 1, 1991, ''USA Today'' launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in [[London]] for the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[British Isles]].<ref name=timeline/> The international edition's schedule was changed as of April 1, 1994 to Monday through Friday, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, ''USA Today'' opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and [[Moscow]] in 1996.<ref name=timeline/>

On April 17, 1995, ''USA Today'' launched its website, www.usatoday.com to provide real-time news coverage; in June 2002 the site expanded to include USATODAY.com Travel, providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth international publishing site was launched in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], to print and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.<ref name=timeline/>

On October 4, 1999, ''USA Today'' began running advertisements on its front page for the first time.<ref name=timeline/> In 2017, some pages of USA Today's website features [[Auto-Play]] functionality for video or audio-aided stories.

On February 8, 2000, Gannett launched ''USA Today Live'', a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture also provided integration with the ''USA Today'' website, which transitioned from a text-based format to feature audio and video clips of news content.<ref name=timeline/>

The paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing facility in [[Charleroi, Belgium]].<ref name=timeline/>

In 2001, two interactive units were launched: on June 19, ''USA Today'' and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network (now Careers.com), a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the [[September 11 attacks]]. That November, ''USA Today'' migrated its operations from Gannett's previous corporate headquarters in [[Arlington, Virginia]] to the company's new headquarters in nearby [[McLean, Virginia|McLean]].<ref name=timeline/>

On December 12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of the online and print entities of ''USA Today'', with USAToday.com's vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson promoted to co-executive editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.<ref name=timeline/>

In December 2010, ''USA Today'' launched the USA Today [[API]] for sharing data with partners of all types.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/labs/post/2010/12/introducing-the-articles-api/1 | title=Introducing the Articles API | first=Ethan | last=Hamlin | work=USA Today | date=December 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks===
On August 27, 2010, ''USA Today'' announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms (including USAToday.com and its related [[mobile app]]lications) and launch of a new publication called ''USA Today Sports''.

On January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new [[sans-serif]] font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories (replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000); an updated "Newsline" feature featuring larger, "newsier" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of [[Nameplate (publishing)|mastheads]] and white space to present a cleaner style.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2011/usa-today-tweaks-include-larger-page-one-logo/ | title=USA Today tweaks include larger Page One logo | first=Jim | last=Romenesko | work=[[Poynter Institute]] | date=January 24, 2011}}</ref>

===2012 redesign===

On September 14, 2012, ''USA Today'' underwent the first major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper's first edition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wolff Olins creates new USA Today branding | url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/may-2012/wolff-olins-creates-new-usa-today-branding/ | first=Emily | last=Gosling | newspaper=DesignWeek | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> Developed in conjunction with brand design firm [[Wolff Olins]], the print edition of ''USA Today'' added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements.<ref name="Hagey">{{cite news|title=USA Today Redesigns Paper, Website | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444709004577649682788312016| first=Keach | last=Hagey | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=September 13, 2012 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The "globe" logo used since the paper's inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's top stories.<ref name="Hagey"/><ref name="garcia-usatoday5">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 5-Its First Major Visual Redesign |url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_5-its_a_new_look_for_usa_today--its_first_major_vis | first=Mario R. | last=García | website=García Media | date=September 14, 2012}}</ref>

The paper's website was also extensively overhauled using a new, in-house [[content management system]] known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), clickable video advertising and a [[responsive design]] layout. The site was designed to be more interactive, provide optimizations for [[mobile device|mobile]] and [[touchscreen]] devices, provide "high impact" advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014 (although archive content accessible through [[search engines]] remains available through the pre-relaunch design).<ref name=poynter-gannettpresto>{{cite news| title=Case Study: Gannett's monumental task – A content management system for all |url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/ | publisher=[[Poynter Institute]] | date=July 7, 2014}}</ref><ref name="garcia-usatoday6">{{cite web | title=It's a new website rethink for USA TODAY, too | url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/its_a_new_website_rethink_for_usa_today_too/ | first=Mario R. | last=García | website=García Media | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring===
On October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' (part of what was internally known within Gannett as the "Butterfly" initiative) for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers – ''[[The Indianapolis Star]]'', the ''[[Rochester Democrat & Chronicle]]'', the [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]]-based ''[[The News-Press]]'' and the [[Appleton, Wisconsin]]-based ''[[The Post-Crescent]]''. The launch of the syndicated insert caused ''USA Today'' to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of ''USA Today'' in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the [[Palm Springs, California]]-based ''[[The Desert Sun]]'' and the [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]-based ''Advertiser'' being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing "positive feedback" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of ''USA Today''.<ref name="Gannett">{{cite news | title=Gannett to distribute USA TODAY edition to 35 papers | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/12/11/usa-today-butterfly-expansion/3965309/ | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=December 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Placing a bet on USA Today | url=https://archives.cjr.org/reports/placing_a_bet_on_usa_today.php | first=David Cay | last=Johnston | work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |date=December 11, 2013}}</ref>

On January 4, 2014, ''USA Today'' acquired the consumer product review website [[Reviewed]].<ref>{{Cite press release | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/usa-today-acquires-reviewedcom-112863219.html | title=USA TODAY Acquires Reviewed.com | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=January 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name=timeline/> In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett launched a condensed ''USA Today'' insert into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort to shore up  circulation after it regained its position as the highest circulated week daily newspaper in the United States in October 2013.<ref name="Gannett"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/business/media/gannett-to-add-usa-today-to-local-papers.html | title=Gannett to Add USA Today to Local Papers

On December 3, 2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between ''USA Today'' and the company's 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national reach. The ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the [[Louisville, Kentucky]]-based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the [[Journal Media Group]], gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network (foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) through early January 2016.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Gannett Unites Largest Local to National Media Network under 'USA TODAY NETWORK' | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151203005219/en/Gannett-Unites-Largest-Local-National-Media-Network | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Gannett introduces USA TODAY NETWORK, uniting local, national properties | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/12/03/gannett-introduces-usa-today-network-uniting-local-national-properties/76716562/| first=Roger | last=Yu | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=December 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Gannett rebrands its local papers as USA TODAY Network | url=https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2015/gannett-rebrands-its-local-papers-as-usa-today-network/ | first=Rick | last=Edmonds | work=[[Poynter Institute]] | date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

==Layout and format==
[[File:USA Today cover page.jpg|thumb|This February 5, 2009 issue of ''USA Today'' shows the old layout and logo of the paper prior to its 2012 redesign.]]
''USA Today'' is known for synthesizing news down to easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and [[Canada]], each edition consists of four sections: News (the oft-labeled "front page" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been separated into two distinct sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled ''Weekend''; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, [[Film criticism|film reviews]] and trends, and a travel supplement called ''Destinations & Diversions'' (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.

Atypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition (although ''USA Today'' has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past, the first being published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday "Extra" edition updating coverage of the [[Gulf War]] from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of [[Atlanta]] and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]).<ref name=timeline/> ''USA Today'' prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.

Each section is denoted by a certain color to differentiate sections beyond lettering and is seen in a box the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at ''USA Today''{{'}} printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.<ref name="garcia-usatoday4">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 4-The first newspaper to do that tango of the serious and the silly|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_4-the_first_newspaper_to_do_that_tango_of_the_serio|author=Mario R. García|website=García Media|date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> Orange is used for bonus sections (section E or above), which are published occasionally such as for [[business travel]] trends and the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]; other bonus sections for sports (such as for the [[PGA Tour]] preview, [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournaments]], [[Memorial Day]] auto races ([[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Coca-Cola 600]]), [[National Football League|NFL]] opening weekend and the [[Super Bowl]]) previously used the orange color, but now use the red designated for sports in their bonus sections. To increase their ties to ''USA Today'', Gannett incorporated the ''USA Today'' coloring scheme into an internally created graphics package for news programming that the company began phasing in across its television station group – which were spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company [[Tegna, Inc.|Tegna]] – in late 2012 (the package utilizes the color scheme for a rundown graphic used on most stations – outside those that Gannett acquired in 2014 from London Broadcasting, which began implementing the package in late 2015 – that persists throughout its stations' newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics). Gannett's television stations began to a new on-air appearance that uses a color-coding system identical to that of the paper.<ref name=tvnc-newgraphics>{{cite news | title=Gannett Stations Clean Up Their Graphics| url=https://tvnewscheck.com/article/64783/gannett-stations-clean-up-their-graphics/ | first=Diana | last=Marszalek | website=TVNewsCheck | date=January 15, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:USA Today Logo.svg|upright=0.8|thumb|left|Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012.]]
In many ways, ''USA Today'' is set up to break the typical newspaper layout. Some examples of that divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as reefers (front-page paragraphs referring to stories on inside pages<ref>{{cite web |title=Reefer, noun 3 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reefer|website=Dictionary.com}}</ref>), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside; the lead reefer is the cover page feature "Newsline", which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, ''USA Today'' cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps for the [[continental United States]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world (temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as "t" for [[thunderstorm]]s, referencing the expected weather conditions); the colorized forecast map, originally created by staff designer George Rorick (who left ''USA Today'' for a similar position at ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1986), was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of using monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.<ref name="garcia-usatoday2"/><ref name="garcia-usatoday3">{{cite web|title=USA TODAY turns 30-Part 3—A weather map that created a global tsunami|url=http://www.garciamedia.com/blog/usa_today_turns_30-part_3--a_weather_map_that_created_a_global_tsunami | author=Mario R. García|website=García Media |date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> National precipitation maps for the next three days (previously five days until the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and [[air quality index]]es for 36 major U.S. cities (originally 16 cities prior to 1999) – with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map – are also featured. Weather data is provided by [[AccuWeather]], which has served as the forecast provider for ''USA Today'' for most of the paper's existence (with an exception from January 2002 to September 2012, when [[The Weather Channel]] provided data through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).<ref>{{cite press release |title=AccuWeather Announces New Partnership With USA Today |url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/usa-today-accuweather-partnership/73810|website=[[AccuWeather]]|publisher=AccuWeather, Inc. | date=September 17, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title=AccuWeather Chosen by USA TODAY to Help Deliver the News of the Future | url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/press/73792 | publisher=[[AccuWeather]] | date=September 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |title=The Weather Channel is Named Premier Weather Provider for USA TODAY | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2002-01-14/the-weather-channel-is-named-premier-weather-provider-for-usa-ii7ptfu8 | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | via=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=January 14, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=AccuWeather celebrates 50-year anniversary| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/accuweather-celebrates-50-year-anniversary/2012/11/15/8c03d930-2f49-11e2-9f50-0308e1e75445_blog.html | first=Jason | last=Samenow| work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=November 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/accuweather-commemorates-50-years-with-yearlong-celebration,1183951/ | title=AccuWeather Commemorates 50 Years With Year-Long Celebration | first=Laura | last=Nichols | website=The State College | date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is "Weather Focus", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.

On Mondays, the Money section uses its back page for "Market Trends", a feature that launched in June 2002 and presents an unusual graphic depicting the performance of various industry groups as a function of quarterly, monthly, and weekly movements against the [[S&P 500]]. On days featuring bonus sections or business holidays, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising coverage is seen in the Monday Money section, which often includes a review of a current television ad, and after [[Super Bowl Sunday]], a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the ''Ad Track'' live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and another for companies trading on [[NASDAQ]] and the [[American Stock Exchange]]) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad of electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.

Book coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart (the latter of which debuted on October 28, 1994), is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the official full [[A.C. Nielsen]] [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the [[Mediabase]] survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay spins on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations cited for its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life – which provides [[prime time]] and [[late night television|late night]] listings (running from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone]]) – incorporates a boilerplate "[[Local news]]" or "[[Local programming]]" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[The CW]]) cede airtime to allow their affiliates to carry [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programs]] or local newscasts; the television page has never been accompanied by a weekly listings supplement with broader scheduling information similar to those featured in local newspapers. Like most national papers, ''USA Today'' does not carry [[comic strip]]s.

[[File:USA Today building.jpg|thumb|left|''USA Today'' is headquartered in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]]<!-- Despite the McLean, VA address, the HQ is in Tysons Corner -->.]]
One of the staples of the News section is "Across the USA", a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length [[Associated Press]] reports highlighting one story of note in each state, the [[District of Columbia]], and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the "For the Record" page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for both the previous four days of league play and individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for the current day's games). The page previously featured a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for [[Lotteries in the United States|all participating state lotteries]] and individual multi-state lotteries.

Some traditions have been retained. The [[news style|lead story]] still appears on the upper-right hand of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But ''USA Today'' is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a [[newsstand]]. The overall design and layout of ''USA Today'' has been described as neo-Victorian.<ref>{{cite web | title=After Modernism | url=http://formofnews.pbworks.com/w/page/13852307/Chapter%201%20%28part%205%29 | first=Kevin G. | last=Barnhurst | work=American Media in the XX Century: Chapter 1 (part 5) | publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago | year=2006 | quote=The mélange of styles and practices in printed and now web-based newspapers, although postmodern in terms of scholarly and design thinking, might more meaningfully be understood as neo-Victorian. The new styles, embodied most famously in ''USA Today'' and its clones, mark a return to the mystifying abundance of facts and stories that newspapers of the industrial revolution made visually present to readers.}}</ref>

Also, in most of the sections' front pages, on the lower left-hand corner, are "USA Today Snapshots", which give statistics of various lifestyle interests according to the section it is in (for example, a snapshot in "Life" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon the type of mood they are in at the time). These "Snapshots" are shown through graphs that are made up of various illustrations of objects that roughly pertain to the graphs subject matter (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). These are usually loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source mentioned in fine print in the box below the graph).

The newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called ''Open Air'', which launched on March 7, 2008 and appears several times a year. Various other [[advertorial]]s appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://redesign.adweek.com/digital/usa-today-launches-open-air/ | title=USA Today Launches "Open Air" | work=[[AdWeek]] | date=December 10, 2007 | url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/72444/gannett-to-launch-open-air-mslo-shutters-bluep.html | title=Gannett To Launch 'Open Air', MSLO Shutters 'Blueprint' | first=Erik | last=Sass | work=[[MediaPost]] | date=December 11, 2007}}</ref>

===Opinion section===
The opinion section prints ''USA Today'' editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the Editorial Board of Contributors,<ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today's Opinion columnists | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USA-TODAY-board-of-contributors.htm | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=August 29, 2011}}</ref> letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the ''USA Today'' editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view; alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field. The opinion pieces featured in each edition are decided by the Board of Contributors, which are separate from the paper's news staff.<ref name=debate>{{cite news | title=About USA Today Editorials/Debate | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USATODAY-editorials-debate.htm | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=April 6, 2010}}</ref>

From 1999 to 2002 and from 2004 to 2015, the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding in 1982.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.cision.com/us/2015/05/changes-at-usa-today-editorial-board/ | title=Changes at USA Today Editorial Board | publisher=[[Cision]] | date=May 15, 2015}}</ref> Other members of the Editorial Board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry.<ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today's Editorial Board | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/USATODAY-editorial-board.htm | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=April 6, 2010}}</ref> The newspaper's website calls this group "demographically and ideologically diverse."<ref name=debate/>

Beginning with the [[1984 United States presidential election]]'', USA Today'' has traditionally maintained a policy not to endorse candidates for the [[President of the United States]] or any other state or federal political office, which has been since re-evaluated by the paper's Board of Contributors through an independent process during each four-year election cycle, with any decision to circumvent the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/donald-trump-editorial-board-al-neuharth-editorials-debates/91294382/ | title=Why we're breaking tradition: Our view | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=September 29, 2016}}</ref> For most of its history, the paper's political editorials (most of them linked to the then-current Presidential election cycle) had focused instead on providing opinion on major issues based on the differing concerns of voters, the vast amount of information on these themes, and the board's aim to provide a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias.

Such avoidance of doing political editorials played a great part in ''USA Today''<nowiki/>'s long-standing reputation for "fluff", but after its 30th anniversary revamp, the paper took a more active stance on political issues, calling for stronger gun laws after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in 2012. It heavily criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for both the [[2013 government shutdown]] and the 2015 revolts in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that ended with the resignation of [[John Boehner]] as House Speaker. It also called out then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and other top members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for what they perceived as "inaction" over several issues during 2013–14, particularly over the [[NSA]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|scandal]] and the [[ISIL beheading incidents]].

The editorial board broke from the "non-endorsement" policy for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]], calling him "unfit for the presidency" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at the press, with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]], military veterans who had been prisoners of war, including 2008 Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran [[John McCain]], immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his "checkered" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he has made during his campaign and criticisms by both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to "resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue".<ref>{{cite news | title=USA TODAY's Editorial Board: Trump is 'unfit for the presidency' | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/29/dont-vote-for-donald-trump-editorial-board-editorials-debates/91295020/ | newspaper=USA Today | publisher=[[Gannett]] | date=September 29, 2016}}</ref> The board noted that the piece was not a "qualified endorsement" of Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]], for whom the board was unable to reach a consensus for endorsing (some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record would help her "serve the nation ably as its president", while others had "serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and [...] [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|extreme carelessness in handling classified information]]"), endorsing instead [[tactical voting]] against Trump and GOP seats in swing states, advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton, [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee [[Gary Johnson]], [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] nominee [[Jill Stein]] or a write-in candidate for President; or focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.<ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today maroons readers with un-endorsement of Donald Trump | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/09/30/usa-today-maroons-readers-with-un-endorsement-of-donald-trump/| first=Erik | last=Wemple | work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=USA Today breaks non-endorsement tradition | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/usa-today-breaks-non-endorsement-tradition-calls-donald-trump-unfit-for-the-presidency/ | first=Emily | last=Schultheis | work=[[CBS News]] | date=September 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title='Don't vote for Trump,' says USA Today in first presidential endorsement in its history | url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-live-updates-trailguide-09292016-htmlstory.html#dont-vote-for-trump-says-usa-today-in-first-presidential-endorsement-in-its-history | first=Melanie | last=Mason | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 29, 2016 | url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In October 2018, ''USA Today'' was criticized by [[NBC News]] for publishing an editorial by President Trump that was replete with inaccuracies.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/usa-today-criticized-printing-trump-op-ed-despite-inaccuracies-n918536 | title=USA Today criticized for printing Trump op-ed despite alleged inaccuracies | work=[[NBC News]] | date=October 10, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fact-checker said that "almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood." <ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/10/fact-checking-president-trumps-usa-today-op-ed-medicare-for-all/ | title=Analysis {{!}} Fact-checking President Trump's USA Today op-ed on 'Medicare-for-All' | first=Glenn | last=Kessler | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>

In 2020, ''USA Today'' endorsed a specific presidential candidate for the first time, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] nominee [[Joe Biden]].

In 1987, Gannett and producer/former [[NBC]] CEO [[Grant Tinker]] began developing a [[news magazine]] series for [[broadcast syndication]] that attempted to bring the breezy style of ''USA Today'' to television.<ref>{{cite news | title=And Now, Folks...

The series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews from critics throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled in undesirable timeslots in certain markets; this was a particular case in [[New York City]], the country's largest [[media market]], where CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WCBS-TV]] (channel 2) aired the program in a pre-dawn early morning slot, before the program was picked up by NBC O&O [[WNBC]] five months into its run; after initially airing it in an equally undesirable 5:30&nbsp;a.m. slot, the series was later moved to a more palatable 9:30&nbsp;a.m. time period, but still did not fare any better on its new station<ref>{{cite news | title='USA Today on TV' Remains a Secret in NYC | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156070337.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083115/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156070337.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 17, 2013 | newspaper=[[Albany Times Union]] | via=HighBeam Research | date=August 21, 1988}}</ref> (in contrast, [[CITY-DT]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] [now the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] of the [[Citytv]] television network], ran it at 5:00&nbsp;p.m.).<ref>{{cite news | title=TV's USA Today served to viewers as a 'side dish' to network news | first=Christopher | last=Michaud | agency=[[Reuters]] | newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] | page=C6 | date=September 12, 1988}}</ref> Although the series was renewed for a second season, these setbacks led to the mid-season cancellation of the TV version of ''USA Today'' in November 1989, after one-and-a-half seasons; the final edition aired on January 7, 1990.<ref>{{cite news | title='USA Today on TV' Axed; Low Ratings Lead Gannett, Tinker to Cancel | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1224653.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117083054/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1224653.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 17, 2013 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | via=HighBeam Research | date=November 23, 1989}}</ref>
