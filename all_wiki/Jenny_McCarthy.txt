In 1993, ''Playboy'' magazine offered McCarthy $20,000 to pose for its October issue. McCarthy became the Playmate of the Month for October 1993. ''Playboy'' publisher [[Hugh Hefner]] cites McCarthy's "wholesome Catholic girl" persona as the unique quality for which she was selected out of 10,000 applicants.<ref name=BiographyChannel>"Jenny McCarthy" ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. [[The Biography Channel]]. December 24, 2007</ref><ref name=NYTimes>{{cite web |last1=Abramowitz |first1=Rachel |title=Jenny McCarthy, The McCarthy Era |url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine4/articles/mccarthy.html |website=New York Times Archive |accessdate=December 6, 2019 |date=1996}}</ref> Her layout emphasized her Catholic upbringing with a schoolgirl theme. According to McCarthy, the pictorial caused an uproar in her Catholic neighborhood, and resulted in her house being pelted with eggs, her sisters being taunted at school, and McCarthy, who counted Catholic nuns among her aunts, being lectured about her future [[damnation]] by those close to her.<ref name=BiographyChannel/> McCarthy was later made the Playmate of the Year, and was paid a $100,000 salary.<ref name=BiographyChannel/><ref name=NYTimes/> In 1994, because of her newfound public attention, McCarthy moved to Los Angeles and, for a time, hosted ''Hot Rocks'', a [[Playboy TV]] show featuring uncensored music videos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abc7.com/archive/8665847/|title=Jenny McCarthy to pose for Playboy again|work=ABC7 Los Angeles|access-date=January 15, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135056/http://abc7.com/archive/8665847/|archive-date=January 16, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1995, when [[MTV]] chose McCarthy to co-host a new dating show called ''[[Singled Out]]'', she left ''Hot Rocks''. Her job as a co-host was a success, and ''Playboy'' wanted her to do more modeling. That same year she also appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) pay-per-view event [[WrestleMania XI]] as a guest valet for villain [[Shawn Michaels]], who faced heroic [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]. She left after the match with the victor, Diesel. McCarthy returned to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, formerly the WWF) on the August 2, 2008 ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXXVI]]'' to thank the fans for supporting [[Generation Rescue]], an [[autism]] advocacy organization. In 1996, she landed a small part in the comedy ''[[The Stupids (film)|The Stupids]]''. In 1997, McCarthy launched two shows. The first one was an MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Jenny McCarthy Show (1997)|The Jenny McCarthy Show]]'', which was sufficiently popular for [[NBC]] to sign her for an eponymous sitcom later that year, ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]''. Also in 1997, she appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of ''Playboy'' (the other cover featured [[Pamela Anderson]]). McCarthy also released an autobiography: ''Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book''.<ref>{{cite book|title = Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book|isbn = 978-0060392338|last1 = McCarthy|first1 = Jenny|last2 = Karlen|first2 = Neal|year = 1997|url = https://archive.org/details/jenxjennymccarth00mcca}}</ref>

In 1998, McCarthy's first major movie role was alongside [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] in the comedy ''[[BASEketball]]''. The following year, she starred in ''[[Diamonds (1999 film)|Diamonds]]''. In 2000, she had a role in the horror movie ''[[Scream 3]]'', and three years later she [[parodied]] that role in horror film spoof ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' along with fellow Playmate and actress Anderson. In 2005, McCarthy produced, wrote, and starred in the film ''[[Dirty Love (film)|Dirty Love]]'', which was directed by her husband at the time, [[John Asher]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1510149/from-pinup-to-pen-pusher-jenny-mccarthy-does-screenwriting-in-dirty-love/|title=From Pinup to Pen Pusher-Jenny McCarthy Does Screenwriting in Dirty Love|work=[[MTV]]|first=Corey|last=Moss|date=September 22, 2005|archive-date=February 23, 2020}}</ref> In March 2006, she was given [[26th Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Awards]] for "Worst Actress", "Worst Screenplay", and "Worst Picture" for her work on ''Dirty Love'', which also earned Asher a Razzie for "Worst Director".<ref>{{cite web|title=26th Annual Golden Raspberry (Razzie©) Award 'Winners'|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|author=John Wilson and The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation|year=2006|access-date=August 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705030031/http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|archive-date=July 5, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition to her early TV fame on MTV and her short-lived, self-titled NBC sitcom, McCarthy has guest-starred in a variety of other television shows, including ''[[Stacked]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' and ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/jenny-mccarthy/credits/190142/|title=Jenny McCarthy|accessdate=April 24, 2019|work=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> She was the voice of Six in the third season of Canadian computer-animated science-fiction cartoon ''[[Tripping the Rift]]''. In 2005, McCarthy hosted a show on [[E!]] called ''Party at the Palms''. The [[reality television|reality show]], which was filmed at [[Palms Casino Resort|The Palms]] Hotel in Las Vegas, featured hotel guests, party goers, and celebrities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jun-06-Mon-2005/living/1997484.html|title=Las Vegas Review-Journal|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>

McCarthy has continued her work with ''Playboy'' over the years, both as a model and in other capacities. She appeared on the cover of the magazine's January 2005 issue wearing a leopard skin version of the company's iconic [[Playboy bunny|"bunny suit"]] and was featured in a pictorial shot at [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] mansion in that same issue. She was the second woman (following [[Carmen Electra]]) and first former Playmate to become a celebrity photographer for the Playboy Cyber Club, where she photographed model Jennifer Madden.

Her younger sister, Amy McCarthy, also has posed for ''Playboy''. She was Cyber Girl of the Week for September 27, 2004, and Cyber Girl of the Month for January 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/girls/cybergirls/month/200501/|accessdate=September 18, 2007|title=Amy McCarthy|publisher=Playboy.com|date=January 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011030807/http://www.playboy.com/girls/cybergirls/month/200501/|archive-date=October 11, 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, McCarthy starred in a five-episode online series, called ''[[In the Motherhood]]'', along with [[Chelsea Handler]] and [[Leah Remini]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthemotherhood.com/ |title=ABC.com – Television Shows & Programming |publisher=Inthemotherhood.com |accessdate=July 18, 2011}}</ref> The show aired on [[MSN]] and was based on being a mother where users could submit their stories to have it made into real webisodes.

She also appeared in two video games: playing the role of Agent Tanya in the video game ''[[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', replacing [[Kari Wührer]], and the fitness video game ''Your Shape Featuring Jenny McCarthy''.<ref name="playboydec">{{cite journal|periodical=Playboy|publisher=Playboy Inc.|title=Playmate News|volume=56|date=December 2009|pages=166–167}}</ref>

On December 31, 2010, McCarthy began her decade-long tenure as correspondent in [[Times Square]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' with [[Ryan Seacrest]]. Until her marriage, McCarthy was known for kissing a member of the U.S. Armed Forces at the stroke of midnight; the kiss was reserved for her husband after her marriage.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2019/10/08/jenny-mccarthy-will-not-co-host-new-years-eve-dick-clark-abc-ryan-seacrest/23831695/ | title=Jenny McCarthy will not co-host New Year's Eve broadcast in Times Square after 10 years on air | work=[[AOL]] | date=October 8, 2019| accessdate=November 26, 2019 | author=Kline, Jennifer}}</ref>

=== Public persona ===

McCarthy's book dealing with autism, ''Louder than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism'', was published September 17, 2007.

In addition to conventional, intensive [[Applied behavior analysis#Efficacy in autism|Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy]], McCarthy tried for her son a [[gluten-free]] and [[casein-free diet]], [[hyperbaric oxygen chamber]]s, [[chelation]], [[aromatherapy|aromatherapies]], [[electromagnetic]]s, spoons rubbed on his body, [[multivitamin]] therapy, B-12 shots, and numerous prescription drugs.

McCarthy's public presence and vocal activism on the [[vaccination-autism controversy]], led, in 2008, to her being awarded the [[James Randi]] Educational Foundation's [[Pigasus Award]], which is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] award granted for contributions to [[pseudoscience]], for the "Performer Who Has Fooled the Greatest Number of People with the Least Amount of Effort". Randi stated in a video on the JREF's website that he did sympathize with the plight of McCarthy and her child, but admonished her for using her public presence in a way that may discourage parents from having their own children vaccinated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/500-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced.html |title=Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]]}}</ref>

In January 2011, McCarthy defended Wakefield, saying that he had listened to parents, reported what they said, and recommended further investigation:

<blockquote>"Since when is repeating the words of parents and recommending further investigation a crime? As I've learned, the answer is whenever someone questions the safety of any vaccines. For some reason, parents aren't being told that this 'new' information about Dr. Wakefield isn't a medical report, but merely the allegations of a single British journalist named Brian Deer."<ref name="ParentsBelieve">{{cite news |url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/vaccine-autism-debate_b_806857.html |author = McCarthy, Jenny | title= Jenny McCarthy: In the Vaccine-Autism Debate, What Can Parents Believe? |date= January 10, 2011 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |accessdate= January 12, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

Having written three books on the subject after her son was diagnosed with the syndrome, "by dint of sheer energy and celebrity, McCarthy became the nation's most prominent purveyor of anti-vaxxer ideology",<ref name=Grove/> and has reiterated that she is not against vaccines. In an earlier October 2013 interview for ''[[TV Guide]]'', McCarthy is quoted as saying:

<blockquote>"It's been three years now since I've even talked about autism or vaccines — I was taken aback when people freaked out that I was going to come on ''The View'' and preach. ... I will clarify my stance, which is still the same: That parents are in charge. Space it out, slow it down and do your homework.

[[Jeffrey Kluger]], senior writer at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', has criticized McCarthy several times. In an open letter article referring to their past conflicts, he reproved her and rejected her denials:

<blockquote>"Jenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S.—most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you—it's just too late to play cute with the things you've said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly antivaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era. Science almost always prefers the simple answer, because that's the one that's usually correct. Your quote trail is far too long—and you have been far too wrong—for the truth not to be obvious."<ref name="Kluger_That_Moment">{{cite magazine|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|title=That Moment When You Must Have a Word With Jenny McCarthy|date=April 12, 2014|url=http://time.com/60416/jenny-mccarthy-anti-vaccine-whitewash/|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=October 26, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

One month later in May 2014, McCarthy published an opinion-editorial addressing her position on vaccines, which specifically mentions Kluger:

<blockquote>"I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine.' ... Blatantly inaccurate blog posts about my position have been accepted as truth by the public at large as well as media outlets (legitimate and otherwise), who have taken those false stories and repeatedly turned them into headlines."<ref name="Vaccine stance">{{Citation |last=McCarthy |first=Jenny |date=May 14, 2014 |title=The Gray Area on Vaccines |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/uncategorized/7/71/195868/jenny-mccarthy-the-gray-area-on-vaccines/ |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226002443/http://chicago.suntimes.com/uncategorized/7/71/195868/jenny-mccarthy-the-gray-area-on-vaccines/ |archive-date=December 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>

During a subsequent ''[[Daily Beast]]'' interview she stated:

<blockquote>"I am not anti-vaccine, ... I'm in this gray zone of, I think everyone should be aware and educate yourself and ask questions. And if your kid is having a problem, ask your doctor for an alternative way of doing the shots. ... The ironic thing is my position has always remained the same. People just never listened to it."<ref name="Grove" /></blockquote>

In a 2015 ''[[Medscape]]'' article about celebrities who "speak out about illness", [[Jeffrey A. Lieberman]] criticized McCarthy and her views on vaccines, [[thimerosal]], and autism. He had this to say about her influence: "She has no idea what she is talking about. What she said is misleading and harmful, and the measles outbreak is a clear indication of the response to the spread of such pseudoscientific myths."<ref name=Lieberman>{{cite web |last=Lieberman |first=Jeffrey |date=March 12, 2015 |title=Should Celebrities Speak Out About Illness? |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/841049 |accessdate=March 17, 2015 }}</ref>

<!-- [[The View (U.S. TV series)#Objections to McCarthy appointment]] links to this section, so don't change the wording of this heading. -->

McCarthy's appointment to ''The View'' called forth many protests. Amy Pisani of [[Every Child By Two]] stated, in a letter to ''The View'''s [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Bill Geddie]], that McCarthy's "unfounded claims that vaccines cause autism have been one of the greatest impediments to public health in recent decades", and that McCarthy's assertions "[have] spread fear among young parents, which has led to an increased number of children who have not received life-saving vaccines."<ref name="levin-2013">{{cite news

[[James Poniewozik]], a television critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, criticized McCarthy's addition to the series and Walters' endorsement of McCarthy, arguing that ''The View'' is largely aimed at parents, on whom the public health system is dependent, and that the credibility that McCarthy's hiring will give her will endanger the public. Poniewozik argued that McCarthy's views, which might be brought up in discussions with the other hosts, would have the effect of framing the issue of whether vaccines cause autism as a matter of opinion, rather than a firmly refuted idea.<ref name="poniewozik-2013">{{cite news| title = Viruses Don't Care About Your View: Why ABC Shouldn't Have Hired Jenny McCarthy| url = http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/15/viruses-dont-care-about-your-view-why-abc-shouldnt-have-hired-jenny-mccarthy/| last = Poniewozik| first = James| work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]

David Freeman, senior science editor for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', wrote about the concerns of [[Bill Nye]], who stated: "I believe Ms. McCarthy's views will be discredited."<ref name=Freeman>{{cite news| title = Bill Nye: Jenny McCarthy's Errant Views On Childhood Vaccines May Be Discredited On 'The View'| url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/15/bill-nye-jenny-mccarthy-childhood-vaccines-autism-the-view_n_3600666.html| last = Freeman| first = David| work=[[The Huffington Post]]

[[Alex Pareene]] also protested and published a letter to ABC in ''[[Salon Magazine]]'', entitled "Anti-vaccine conspiracist and 'View' co-host Jenny McCarthy isn't just quirky—she spreads lies that hurt people."<ref name=Pareene>{{cite web| title = Dear ABC: Putting Jenny McCarthy on "The View" will kill children.

[[Michael Specter]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', stated:

<blockquote>"Jenny McCarthy ... will be the show's first co-host whose dangerous views on childhood vaccination may—if only indirectly—have contributed to the sickness and death of people throughout the Western world. McCarthy, who is savvy, telegenic, and pulchritudinous, is also the person most visibly associated with the deadly and authoritatively discredited anti-vaccine movement in the United States."<ref name="Specter">{{cite web| title = Jenny McCarthy's Dangerous Views| url = https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/07/jenny-mccarthys-dangerous-views.html|last = Specter| first = Michael| work=[[The New Yorker]]| date = July 16, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Brendan Nyhan]], writing in ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', commented: "ABC's announcement yesterday that actress/comedian Jenny McCarthy will become a co-host of ''The View'' brought forth a torrent of condemnation from doctors, science journalists, opinion writers, and even entertainment commentators who oppose giving the anti-vaccine activist a high-profile platform to spread misinformation." After an extensive review of news coverage of the hiring, Nyhan concluded that "[t]here is no perfect way to cover McCarthy's hiring, of course, but giving 'balanced' coverage to fringe beliefs is the worst approach to covering misinformation."<ref name="Nyhan">{{cite web| title = When 'he said,' 'she said' is dangerous.

[[Toronto Public Health]] officially denounced the appointment and "launched a Twitter campaign to get ... McCarthy fired from the ABC show ''The View''", tweeting "Jenny McCarthy's anti-vaccine views = misinformation. Please ask ''The View'' to change their mind", and "Jenny McCarthy cites fraudulent research on vaccines & it's irresponsible to provide her with ''The View'' platform."<ref name="Toronto">{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/07/22/jenny_mccarthy_in_the_crosshairs_toronto_public_health_takes_aim.html|title=Jenny McCarthy in the crosshairs: Toronto Public Health takes aim|last=Dale|first=Daniel|date=July 22, 2013|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

[[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] and Editor of ''[[The Nation]]'', objected to the appointment and wrote about "Jenny McCarthy's Vaccination Fear-Mongering and the Cult of False Equivalence":

<blockquote>"One of the most prominent promoters of this falsehood [that vaccines cause autism] is actress Jenny McCarthy, who was recently named as Elisabeth Hasselbeck's replacement on ABC's hit daytime talk-show, ''The View''. Once she's on air, it will be difficult to prevent her from advocating for the anti-vaccine movement. And the mere act of hiring her would seem to credit her as a reliable source. ... By giving science deniers a public forum, media outlets implicitly condone their claims as legitimate. ... False equivalency is one of journalism's great pitfalls, and in an effort to achieve 'balance', reporters often obscure the truth. What's the merit in 'he said, she said' reporting when he says the world is round and she insists it is flat. Indeed, there is an enormous cost to society when the truth could save lives."<ref name="vandenHeuvel">{{cite journal| title = Jenny McCarthy's Vaccination Fear-Mongering and the Cult of False Equivalence| url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/175388/jenny-mccarthys-vaccination-fear-mongering-and-cult-false-equivalence| last = vanden Heuvel| first = Katrina| journal=[[The Nation]]| date = July 22, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>
McCarthy finished as co-host of the show in 2014, nine months after her debut.
