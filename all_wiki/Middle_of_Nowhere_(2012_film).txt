'''''Middle of Nowhere''''' is a 2012 independent [[feature film]] written and directed by [[Ava DuVernay]] and starring [[Emayatzy Corinealdi]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Omari Hardwick]] and [[Lorraine Toussaint]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/movies/sundance-films-fall-short-of-expectations.html|accessdate=February 24, 2012|date=January 27, 2012|title=Market for Films Signals Good, Not Great, Year for Sundance|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Brooks Barnes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/movies/at-sundance-beasts-of-the-southern-wild-is-standout.html|accessdate=February 24, 2012|date=January 27, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=Manohla Dargis|title=Amazing Child, Typical Grown-Ups}}</ref> The film was the winner of the Directing Award for U.S. Dramatic Film at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]].

==Plot==
Ruby ([[Emayatzy Corinealdi]]) is a [[registered nurse]] in [[Compton, California|Compton]], California, who had been working to become a doctor and now dedicates most of her time to visiting her husband Derek ([[Omari Hardwick]]) in prison and helping him to get paroled early.  Flashbacks during the film depict Derek's arrest and, along with encounters with one of Derek's friends, Rashad ([https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3016543/?ref_=tt_cl_t9 Troy Curvey] III), suggest that Ruby has not been aware of everything that Derek had been doing.  As pressures for Derek's case build, Ruby's life becomes increasingly constricted.  She ultimately distances herself from from her sister Rosie ([[Edwina Findley]]), whose daughter she has often cared for, and from her mother Ruth ([[Lorraine Toussaint|Lorraine Toussaint)]], who is poisonously bitter that her daughters have not lived up to her expectations.  

Ruby's one growing attachment is with Brian, a bus driver ([[David Oyelowo]]), who is clearly attracted to her.  While Ruby feels guilty as they begin to date, she eventually learns that Derek has lied to her more than once and begins to come to terms with how to forge ahead with her own life while remaining true to her convictions.

===Development===

DuVernay explained that when she began to examine what life is like in [[Compton, California|Compton]] and "the texture of the lives of women who live there", the subject of incarceration kept coming up.<ref name="Kaufman">{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-middleofnowherebre8al020-20121121,0,6602974.story|title=In 'Middle of Nowhere,' cast found black characters beyond the stereotypes|last=Kaufman|first=Alexander C.|date=November 21, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref> The director spent months conducting research for the film, including interviewing the wives of felons, before writing a screenplay.<ref name="Kaufman"/> DuVernay revealed that she was exploring the same theme of "lost love and how it affects you when it's gone" in ''Middle of Nowhere'' as she did in her first feature, ''[[I Will Follow (film)|I Will Follow]]'' (2010). The director considered herself fortunate to be able to explore personal themes of interest in her second film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2012-10-11/film-tv/middle-of-nowhere-ava-duvernay/|title=Middle of Nowhere Director (and Former Rapper) Ava DuVernay on the Future of Black Film|last=Hardy|first=Ernest|date=October 11, 2012|newspaper=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref>

Describing her viewpoint, DuVernay told Allison Samuels of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', 
<blockquote>"This is a story I know very well. I'm from Los Angeles and I know countless women who live this kind of life every day, year after year. You see women struggling to keep it all together while a loved one is in jail. But we don't hear about them or their struggles in a way that resonates with others. Their stories are so compelling. It's as if they are in their own little world and no one else sees them. I also wanted to talk about the love between two people in a setting that isn't the norm and how they survive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/13/with-middle-of-nowhere-a-new-light-on-prison-s-toll-on-black-women.html|title=With 'Middle of Nowhere,' a New Light on Prison's Toll on Black Women|last=Samuels|first=Allison|date=October 13, 2012|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

===Filming===
''Middle of Nowhere'' had a budget of $200,000 and was shot in June 2011 over nineteen days, half of the studio average of forty days.<ref name="Rickey">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/movies/ava-duvernay-and-middle-of-nowhere.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=She's a Graduate of an Unusual Film School|last=Rickey|first=Carrie|date=October 5, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Verrier">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/19/entertainment/la-et-ct-onlocation-20120619|title=On Location: 'Middle of Nowhere' finds love in South-Central L.A.|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=June 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=4 December 2012}}</ref> DuVernay told [[IndieWire]]'s Claire Easton that it was difficult filming over a short period of time and thought that she could have used a couple more days.<ref name="Easton"/> She continued "It really would just allow us to have more takes, and explore things more. But ultimately, you know, my first film was shot in 15 days, so I gained 4 days. So, one day maybe I'll get out of the teens!"<ref name="Easton"/>

DuVernay and her crew spent a week filming in a [[South Los Angeles]] neighborhood. A "well-maintained Spanish mission-style duplex" on East 91st Street doubled as Ruby's house in the film.<ref name="Verrier"/> DuVernay said "When people think South-Central or Compton, it's all ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. It's never a house like this. It becomes an assumption that people who live in these communities don't care about their home, don't work as hard for them and don't own their homes. That's one of the reasons why I chose this area. It reminded me of the house I grew up in."<ref name="Verrier"/> Other shooting locations included [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], a federal correction facility in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]], [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles|Leimert Park]], and East Los Angeles.<ref name="Verrier"/> DuVernay wanted to film the movie in places that were authentic to her characters. She also made sure that the locations were used in such a way that they would not detract from the story.<ref name="Verrier"/>

==Release==
''Middle of Nowhere'' had its world premiere at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival]] held in January 2012. The film opened in the United States on October 12, 2012.<ref name="Easton">{{cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/ava-duvernay-and-emayatzy-corinealdi-on-sundance-winning-drama-middle-of-nowhere|title=Ava DuVernay, Sundance Award-Winner for 'Middle of Nowhere,' On Why It's Important That Stories About Black Women Be Told By Black Women|last=Easton|first=Claire|date=October 10, 2012|work=[[IndieWire]]|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>

===Critical response===
{{As of|June 2020}}, the film holds an 83% approval rating on film [[review aggregator|review aggregation]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 50 reviews with an [[average rating]] of 7.78/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/middle_of_nowhere/|title=Middle of Nowhere (2012)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=June 3, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gave ''Middle of Nowhere'' an average rating of 75 based on 19 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/middle-of-nowhere|title=Middle of Nowhere|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 1, 2012}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars and praised Corinealdi's performance, calling it "star-making".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121017/REVIEWS/121019984|title=Middle of Nowhere|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=October 17, 2012|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated "Though ''Middle of Nowhere'' is very much a character piece, it benefits from some intricate plotting, and going where you think it will go is not on this film's mind. When you question everything about yourself, Ruby has to ask, what do you have to hold onto? We don't often have films that ask questions like these or ones that answer them as effectively."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-middle-of-nowhere-review-20121012,0,4320420.story|title=Review: Deft 'Middle of Nowhere' is moving and complex|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=October 11, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=1 December 2012}}</ref> ''Middle of Nowhere'' was named one of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Critics' Pick and [[Manohla Dargis]] commented, "A plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a woman coming into her own, ''Middle of Nowhere'' carries the imprimatur of Sundance, but without the dreary stereotypes or self-satisfied politics that can (at times unfairly) characterize its offerings."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/10/12/movies/middle-of-nowhere-directed-by-ava-duvernay.html?_r=0|title=Small Pleasures, Scattered Amid Struggles|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|date=October 11, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=3 December 2012}}</ref>
