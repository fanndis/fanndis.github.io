'''David Keith Lynch''' (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, guitarist, writer and actor. He is best known for writing and directing films such as ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986), and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), which are often regarded by critics as among the best films of their times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/lynchdavid.htm |title=David Lynch's Acclaimed Films |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/feature/film-critics-pick-the-best-movies-of-the-decade |title=Film Critics Pick the Best Movies of the Decade |website=Metacritic |date=January 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}</ref> and for his television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91, 2017).

Lynch's first feature-length film, the surrealist horror ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977), became a success on the [[midnight movie]] circuit, and he followed that by directing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984), and ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986). Lynch next created his own television series with [[Mark Frost]], the popular murder mystery ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91), which ran for two seasons. He also created the film prequel ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), the road film ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' (1990), and the family film ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic [[non-linear narrative]] structures: ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), and ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' (2006). Lynch and Frost reunited in 2017 for a [[Twin Peaks (season 3)|third season]] of ''Twin Peaks'', which aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Lynch co-wrote and directed every episode,<ref name="SYFYWire">{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Matthew |title=DAVID LYNCH EXPLAINS WHY HE LEFT AND THEN RETURNED TO THE TWIN PEAKS REVIVAL |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/david-lynch-explains-why-he-left-and-then-returned-to-the-twin-peaks-revival |website=SYFY Wire |publisher=SyFy |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> and reprised his onscreen role as Gordon Cole.

Lynch's other artistic endeavours include his work as a musician, encompassing the studio albums ''[[BlueBOB]]'' (2001), ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Big Dream]]'' (2013), as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films (sometimes alongside collaborators [[Alan Splet]],<ref name="FilmDaily">{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Daisy |title=In Heaven: Celebrating the surreal sounds of David Lynch |url=https://filmdaily.co/obsessions/the-surreal-sounds-david-lynch/ |website=Film Daily |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> [[Dean Hurley]],<ref name="FilmDaily" /> and/or [[Angelo Badalamenti]]<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |title='Make it like the wind, Angelo': How the Twin Peaks soundtrack came to haunt music for nearly 30 years |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/24/twin-peaks-soundtrack-david-lynch-angelo-badalamenti |website=The Guardian |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>); painting<ref name="Artland">{{cite web |last1=Wolf |first1=Shira |title=The Other David Lynch – The Paintings of Contemporary Cinema’s Master of Surrealism |url=https://magazine.artland.com/the-other-david-lynch-the-paintings-of-contemporary-cinemas-master-of-surrealism/ |website=Artland Magazine |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> and photography;<ref name="FarOut">{{cite web |last1=Far Out Staff |title=The mysterious world of David Lynch’s photographs of old factories |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/david-lynch-photographs-of-old-factories/ |website=Far Out Magazine |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> writing the books ''[[Images (book)|Images]]'' (1994), ''[[Catching the Big Fish]]'' (2006), ''Room to Dream'' (2018), and numerous other literary works;<ref name="MIU">{{cite web |title=David Lynch's Books |url=https://www.miu.edu/david-lynch/books |website=Maharishi International University |publisher=Maharishi International University |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> and directing several music videos (such as the video for "[[Shot in the Back of the Head]]" by [[Moby]],<ref name="IndieWire">{{cite web |last1=Greene |first1=Steve |title=David Lynch Playlist: The Director’s Favorite Bands and Singers Perfect for ‘Twin Peaks’ |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/david-lynch-favorite-bands-twin-peaks-1201856787/ |website=IndieWire |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> who, in turn, directed a video for Lynch's "[[The Big Dream]]")<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite web |last1=Reed |first1=Ryan |title=Moby Directs Creepy Video for David Lynch’s ‘The Big Dream’ |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/moby-directs-creepy-video-for-david-lynchs-the-big-dream-173932/ |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> as well as advertisements, including the [[Dior]] promotional film ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' (2006).<ref name="FFCJournal">{{cite journal |last1=Berra |first1=John |title=Lady Blue Shanghai: The strange case of David Lynch and Dior |journal=Film Fashion & Consumption |date=December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=233-250 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272147545_Lady_Blue_Shanghai_The_strange_case_of_David_Lynch_and_Dior |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref> An avid practitioner of [[Transcendental Meditation]] (TM), in 2005 he founded the [[David Lynch Foundation]], which seeks to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bigissue.com/latest/how-the-david-lynch-foundation-helps-people-who-have-experienced-homelessness/|title= How the David Lynch Foundation helps people who have experienced homelessness|website= The Big Issue|accessdate= November 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/david-lynch-transcendental-meditation.html|title= David Lynch Is Back … as a Guru of Transcendental Meditation|website= The New York Times Magazine|accessdate= November 22, 2020}}</ref>

David Keith Lynch was born in [[Missoula, Montana]] on January 20, 1946.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 1.</ref> His father, Donald Walton Lynch (1915–2007), was a research scientist working for the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), and his mother, Edwina "Sunny" Lynch (née Sundholm; 1919–2004), was an English language tutor. Two of Lynch's maternal great-grandparents were [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swedish]] immigrants who arrived in the U.S. during the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ng.se/artiklar/david-lynch-%E2%80%9Dden-haer-vaerlden-aer-full-av-hat-och-angest%E2%80%9D|title=David Lynch: "Den här världen är full av hat och ångest"|website=NÖJESGUIDEN}}</ref> He was raised a [[Presbyterian]].<ref name="Williams">{{cite news|author=Williams, Alex|url=http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|title=David Lynch's Shockingly Peaceful Inner Life|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 31, 2007|accessdate=November 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130910174717/http://www.culteducation.com/reference/tm/tm150.html|archive-date=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Sadighian">{{cite news|author=Sadighian, David|url=http://www.globalgoodnews.com/education-news-a.html?art=1128100751793764|title=David Lynch thinks we're all lightbulbs.

Because of this, Lynch, moved with his parents to [[Sandpoint, Idaho]], when he was two months old; two years later, after his brother John was born, the family moved to [[Spokane, Washington]]. Lynch's sister Martha was born there. The family then moved to [[Durham, North Carolina]], [[Boise, Idaho]], and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lynch adjusted to this transitory early life with relative ease, noting that he usually had no issue making new friends whenever he started attending a new school.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 2–3.</ref> Of his early life, he remarked:

{{cquote|I found the world completely and totally fantastic as a child. Of course, I had the usual fears, like going to school&nbsp;... for me, back then, school was a crime against young people. It destroyed the seeds of liberty. The teachers didn't encourage knowledge or a positive attitude.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 14.</ref>}}

[[File:David Lynch (1964 yearbook portrait).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=Photo portrait of a young man in a suit|Lynch's high school senior portrait, 1964]]

Alongside his schooling, Lynch joined the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], although he later said he only "became [a Scout] so I could quit and put it behind me". He rose to the highest rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]. As an Eagle Scout, he was present with other Boy Scouts outside the [[White House]] at [[United States presidential inauguration|the inauguration]] of President [[John F. Kennedy]], which took place on Lynch's 15th birthday.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 05.</ref> Lynch was also interested in painting and drawing from an early age, and became intrigued by the idea of pursuing it as a career path when living in Virginia, where his friend's father was a professional painter.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 8–9.</ref>

At Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Lynch did not excel academically, having little interest in schoolwork, but he was popular with other students, and after leaving he decided that he wanted to study painting at college. He began his studies at the [[Corcoran School of the Arts and Design]] in Washington, D.C., before transferring in 1964 to the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], where he was roommates with musician [[Peter Wolf]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://corcoran.gwu.edu/notable-alumni|title=Notable Alumni &#124; Corcoran School of the Arts & Design &#124; The George Washington University|website=corcoran.gwu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Peter'sBio|url=http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|work=Peter Wolf|publisher=Peter Wolf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|author=Wolf, Peter|year=2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615152715/http://www.peterwolf.com/bio/index2.html|archive-date=June 15, 2012}}</ref> He left after only a year, saying, "I was not inspired AT ALL in that place." He instead decided that he wanted to travel around Europe for three years with his friend [[Jack Fisk]], who was similarly unhappy with his studies at [[Cooper Union]]. They had some hopes that they could train in Europe with Austrian [[expressionism|expressionist]] painter [[Oskar Kokoschka]] at his school. Upon reaching [[Salzburg]], however, they found that Kokoschka was not available; disillusioned, they returned to the United States after spending only two weeks in Europe.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 31–34.</ref>

==Career==
===1960s: Philadelphia and short films===
Back in the United States, Lynch returned to Virginia, but since his parents had moved to [[Walnut Creek, California]], he stayed with his friend Toby Keeler for a while. He decided to move to [[Philadelphia]] and enroll at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], after advice from Fisk, who was already enrolled there. He preferred this college to his previous school in Boston, saying, "In Philadelphia there were great and serious painters, and everybody was inspiring one another and it was a beautiful time there."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 36–37.</ref> It was here that he began a relationship with a fellow student, Peggy Reavey, whom he married in 1967. The following year, Peggy gave birth to their daughter [[Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer]]. Peggy later said, "[Lynch] definitely was a reluctant father, but a very loving one. Hey, I was pregnant when we got married. We were both reluctant."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 31.</ref> As a family, they moved to Philadelphia's [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]] neighborhood, where they bought a 12-room house for the relatively low price of $3,500 due to the area's high crime and poverty rates. Lynch later said:

{{cquote|We lived cheap, but the city was full of fear. A kid was shot to death down the street&nbsp;... We were robbed twice, had windows shot out and a car stolen. The house was first broken into only three days after we moved in&nbsp;... The feeling was so close to extreme danger, and the fear was so intense. There was violence and hate and filth. But the biggest influence in my whole life was that city.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 42–43.</ref>}}

Meanwhile, to help support his family, he took a job printing engravings.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 43.</ref> At the Pennsylvania Academy, Lynch made his first short film, ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'' (1967). He had first come up with the idea when he developed a wish to see his paintings move, and he began discussing doing animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find. Taking one of the Academy's abandoned upper rooms as a workspace, he spent $150,<ref name="The Short Films of David Lynch">{{cite film|title=The Short Films of David Lynch}}</ref>which at the time he felt to be a lot of money, to produce ''Six Men Getting Sick''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 37–38.</ref> Calling the film "57&nbsp;seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played it on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 38.</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 15–16.</ref> This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1,000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478 of that on the second-hand [[Bolex]] camera "of [his] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was a blurred, frameless print. He later said, "So I called up [Wasserman] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.' And he said, 'Don't worry, David, take the rest of the money and make something else for me. Just give me a print.' End of story."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 39.</ref>

With his leftover money, Lynch decided to experiment with a mix of animation and live action, producing the four-minute short ''[[The Alphabet (film)|The Alphabet]]'' (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the [[alphabet]] to a series of images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging blood all over her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken [[Uher (brand)|Uher]] tape recorder to record the sound of Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch found particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch said, "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started ''The Alphabet'' going. The rest of it was just [[subconscious]]."<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 39–40</ref>

Learning about the newly founded [[American Film Institute]], which gave grants to filmmakers who could support their application with a prior work and a script for a new project, Lynch decided to send them a copy of ''The Alphabet'' along with a script he had written for a new short film that would be almost entirely live action, ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch#The Grandmother|The Grandmother]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 42.</ref> The institute agreed to help finance the work, initially offering him $5,000 out of his requested budget of $7,200, but later granting him the additional $2,200. Starring people he knew from both work and college and filmed in his own house,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 44–47.</ref> ''The Grandmother'' featured a neglected boy who "grows" a grandmother from a seed to care for him. The film critics Michelle Le Blanc and Colin Odell wrote, "this film is a true oddity but contains many of the themes and ideas that would filter into his later work, and shows a remarkable grasp of the medium".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 18.</ref>

===1970s: Los Angeles and ''Eraserhead''===
[[File:Eraserhead.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white image of a man with long wild hair standing straight up, as if electrocuted like a cartoon|Theatrical release poster for ''[[Eraserhead]]'']]
In 1971, Lynch moved with his wife and daughter to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the [[AFI Conservatory]], a place he later called "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great&nbsp;... you quickly learned that if you were going to get something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 57–58.</ref> He began writing a script for a proposed work, ''Gardenback'', that had "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, which he reluctantly agreed to do. All the interference on his ''Gardenback'' project made him fed up with the Conservatory and led him to quit after returning to start his second year and being put in first-year classes. AFI dean Frank Daniel asked Lynch to reconsider, believing that he was one of the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create a project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that ''Gardenback'' was "wrecked", he set out on a new film, ''[[Eraserhead]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 58–59.</ref>

''Eraserhead'' was planned to be about 42 minutes long (it ended up being 89 minutes), its script was only 21 pages, and Lynch was able to create the film without interference. Filming began on May 29, 1972, at night in some abandoned stables, allowing the production team, which was largely Lynch and some of his friends, including [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jack Fisk]], cinematographer [[Frederick Elmes]] and sound designer [[Alan Splet]], to set up a camera room, green room, editing room, sets as well as a food room and a bathroom.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 59–60.</ref> The [[American Film Institute|AFI]] gave Lynch a $10,000 grant, but it was not enough to complete the film, and under pressure from studios after the success of the relatively cheap feature film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', it was unable to give him more. Lynch was then supported by a loan from his father and money that he earned from a paper route that he took up, delivering the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 76 and 60.

</ref> Not long into ''Eraserhead''<nowiki/>'s production, Lynch and Peggy amicably separated and divorced, and he began living full-time on set. In 1977, Lynch married Mary Fisk, sister of Jack Fisk.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 60, 80, 110.</ref>

Lynch has said that not a single reviewer of the film understood it in the way he intended. Filmed in black and white, ''Eraserhead'' tells the story of Henry ([[Jack Nance]]), a quiet young man living in a [[dystopia]]n industrial wasteland, whose girlfriend gives birth to a deformed baby whom she leaves in his care. It was heavily influenced by the fearful mood of Philadelphia, and Lynch has called it "my ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|Philadelphia Story]]''".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 56.</ref><ref name = "cehwte">{{cite interview |title=tip Filmjahrbuch Nr. 1 (1985) |trans-title=tip Film Yearbook No. 1 (1985) |url=http://www.davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Herman Weigel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011151810/http://davidlynch.de/tiplynchtrans.html |archive-date=October 11, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Due to financial problems the filming of ''Eraserhead'' was haphazard, regularly stopping and starting again. It was in one such break in 1974 that Lynch created the short film ''The Amputee'', a one-shot film about two minutes long. Lynch proposed that he make ''The Amputee'' to present to AFI to test two different types of film stock{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

''Eraserhead'' was finally finished in 1976. Lynch tried to get it entered into the [[Cannes Film Festival]], but while some reviewers liked it, others felt it was awful, and it was not selected for screening. Reviewers from the [[New York Film Festival]] also rejected it, but it was screened at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], where [[Ben Barenholtz]], the distributor of the [[Elgin Theater]], heard about it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 82–83.</ref> He was very supportive of the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and ''Eraserhead'' subsequently became popular on the [[midnight movie]] underground circuit,<ref name="ReferenceC">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 54.</ref> and was later called one of the most important midnight movies of the 1970s, along with ''[[El Topo]]'', ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' and ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=457414|title=Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream}}</ref> [[Stanley Kubrick]] said it was one of his all-time favorite films.<ref name="lynch77">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 77.</ref>

===1980s: ''The Elephant Man'', ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet''===
After ''Eraserhead''<nowiki/>'s success on the underground circuit, [[Stuart Cornfeld]], an executive producer for [[Mel Brooks]], saw it and later said, "I was just 100 percent blown away&nbsp;... I thought it was the greatest thing I'd ever seen. It was such a cleansing experience."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 88.</ref> He agreed to help Lynch with his next film, ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'', for which Lynch had already written a script. But Lynch soon realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'', a film that he has said is about "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", was not going to be picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script by someone else that he could direct. Cornfeld found four. On hearing the title of the first, ''The Elephant Man'', Lynch chose it.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 90–92.</ref>

''The Elephant Man''<nowiki/>'s script, written by Chris de Vore and [[Eric Bergren]], was based on a true story, that of [[Joseph Merrick]], a severely deformed man in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, who was held in a sideshow but later taken under the care of a London surgeon, [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]]. Lynch wanted to make some alterations that would alter the story from true events but in his view make a better plot,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 95.</ref> but he needed [[Mel Brooks]]'s permission, as Brooks's company, [[Brooksfilms]], was responsible for production. Brooks viewed ''Eraserhead'', and after coming out of the screening theatre, embraced Lynch, declaring, "You're a madman! I love you! You're in."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 92–93.</ref>

''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' starred [[John Hurt]] as John Merrick (the name changed from Joseph) and [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Treves. Filming took place in London. Though surrealistic and in black and white, it has been called "one of the most conventional" of Lynch's films.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 29–30.</ref> ''The Elephant Man'' was a huge critical and commercial success, earning eight [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 104.</ref>

After ''The Elephant Man''<nowiki/>'s success, [[George Lucas]], a fan of ''Eraserhead'', offered Lynch the opportunity to direct the third film in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy, ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''. Lynch refused, arguing that Lucas should direct the film himself as the movie should reflect his own vision, not Lynch's.<ref name = "cehwte" /><ref name="lynch113">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 113.</ref> Soon, the opportunity to direct another big-budget science fiction epic arose when [[Dino de Laurentiis]] of the [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]] asked Lynch to create a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965).<ref name="lynch113"/> Lynch agreed, and in doing so was also contractually obliged to produce two other works for the company. He set about writing a script based upon the novel, initially with both Chris de Vore and Eric Bergren, and then alone when De Laurentiis was unhappy with their ideas.<ref name="lynch115">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 115.</ref> Lynch also helped build some of the sets, attempting to create "a certain look", and particularly enjoyed building the set for the oil planet [[Giedi Prime]], for which he used "steel, bolts, and porcelain".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 118.</ref>

''Dune'' is set in the far future, when humans live in an interstellar empire under a [[feudalism|feudal system]]. The main character, [[Paul Atreides]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), is the son of a noble who takes control of the [[desert planet]] [[Arrakis]], which grows the rare spice [[melange (fictional drug)|melange]], the empire's most highly prized commodity. Lynch was unhappy with the work, later saying, "''Dune'' was a kind of studio film. I didn't have [[final cut privilege|final cut]]. And, little by little, I was subconsciously making compromises" [to his own vision].<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 120.</ref> Much of his footage was eventually removed from the final theatrical cut, dramatically condensing the plot.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 116–117.</ref> Although De Laurentiis hoped it would be as successful as ''Star Wars'', ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984) was a critical and commercial dud; it had cost $45&nbsp;million to make, and grossed $27.4&nbsp;million domestically. Later, [[Universal Studios]] released an "extended cut" for syndicated television, containing almost an hour of cutting-room-floor footage and new narration. It did not represent Lynch's intentions, but the studio considered it more comprehensible than the original version. Lynch objected to the changes and had his name struck from the extended cut, which has [[Alan Smithee]] credited as the director and "Judas Booth" (a pseudonym Lynch invented, reflecting his feelings of betrayal) as the screenwriter.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5JwyKjpH2QC&pg=PA41 |title=The cinema of David Lynch: American dreams, nightmare visions |author1=Erica Sheen |author2=Annette Davison |publisher=Wallflower Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-903364-85-7}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in 1983, he had begun the writing and drawing of a comic strip, ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]'', which featured unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry that it could not move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 to 1992 in the ''[[Village Voice]],'' ''[[Creative Loafing]]'' and other tabloid and alternative publications.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 109.</ref> Around this time Lynch also became interested in photography as an art form, and traveled to northern England to photograph the degrading industrial landscape.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 109–111.</ref>

Lynch was contractually still obliged to produce two other projects for De Laurentiis, the first a planned sequel to ''Dune'', which due to the film's failure never went beyond the script stage.<ref name="lynch115"/> The other was a more personal work, based on a script Lynch had been working on for some time. Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the film, ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', was set in the real town of [[Lumberton, North Carolina]], and revolves around a college student, Jeffrey Beaumont (MacLachlan), who finds a severed ear in a field. Investigating further with the help of friend Sandy ([[Laura Dern]]), he discovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] ([[Dennis Hopper]]), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) and repeatedly rapes her. Lynch has called the story "a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 138.</ref>

Lynch included pop songs from the 1960s in the film, including [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]" and [[Bobby Vinton]]'s "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]", the latter of which largely inspired the film. Lynch has said, "It was the song that sparked the movie&nbsp;... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And the first things I thought about were lawns—lawns and the neighborhood."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 134.</ref> Other music for the film was composed by [[Angelo Badalamenti]], who wrote the music for most of Lynch's subsequent work.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 130–132.</ref> De Laurentiis loved the film, and it received support at some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to mainstream audiences were very negatively received, with most of the viewers hating the film.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 148–149.</ref> Lynch had found success with ''The Elephant Man'', but ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award nomination for Best Director]]. [[Woody Allen]], whose ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], said ''Blue Velvet'' was his favorite film of the year.<ref name="Peary">{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon & Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 0-671-64810-1}}</ref>In the late 1980s, Lynch began to work in television, directing a short piece, ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'', for French television in 1989.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 81.</ref>

===1990s: ''Twin Peaks'', ''Wild at Heart'' ===
[[File:David Lynch at the 1990 Emmy Awards.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lynch at the 1990 [[Emmy Awards]] ceremony]]
Around this time, he met the television producer [[Mark Frost]], who had worked on such projects as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', and they decided to start working together on a biopic of [[Marilyn Monroe]] based on Anthony Summers's book ''The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe'', but it never got off the ground. They went on to work on a comedy script, ''One Saliva Bubble'', but that did not see completion either.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 156–157.</ref><ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 85.</ref> While talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on a lakeshore, and went to work on their third project, initially called ''Northwest Passage'' but eventually ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 157.</ref> A drama series set in a small [[Washington (state)|Washington]] town where popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]] has been murdered, ''Twin Peaks'' featured [[FBI]] [[Dale Cooper|Special Agent Dale Cooper]] (MacLachlan) as the investigator trying to identify the killer, and discovering not only the murder's [[supernatural]] aspects but also many of the townsfolk's secrets; Lynch said, "The project was to mix a police investigation with the ordinary lives of the characters." He later said, "[Mark Frost and I] worked together, especially in the initial stages. Later on we started working more apart." They pitched the series to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which agreed to finance the pilot and eventually commissioned a season comprising seven episodes.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 157–159.</ref>

Soon a second season of 22 episodes went into production. Lynch directed only six episodes of the series, devoting more time to his film ''Wild at Heart'', but carefully chose the other episodes' directors.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 174–175.</ref> He also appeared in several episodes as FBI agent [[Gordon Cole (Twin Peaks)|Gordon Cole]]. The series was a success, with high ratings in the United States and many other countries, and soon spawned a cult following. But ABC executives believed that public interest in the show was decreasing. The network insisted that Lynch and Frost reveal Laura Palmer's killer's identity prematurely, which they grudgingly agreed to do,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 180–181.</ref> in what Lynch has called one of his biggest professional regrets.<ref>"A Slice of Lynch", a featurette included in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD set, October 2007.</ref> After identifying the murderer and moving from Thursday to Saturday night, ''Twin Peaks'' continued for several more episodes, but was canceled after a ratings drop. Lynch, who disliked the direction that writers and directors took in the later episodes, directed the last episode. He ended it with a [[cliffhanger]], later saying, "that's not the ending. That's the ending that people were stuck with."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 182.</ref>

While ''Twin Peaks'' was in production, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] asked Lynch and Badalamenti, who wrote the music for ''Twin Peaks'', to create a theatrical piece to be performed twice in 1989 as a part of the [[New Music America Festival]]. The result was ''[[Industrial Symphony No. 1]]: The Dream of the Broken Hearted'', which starred frequent Lynch collaborators such as [[Laura Dern]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Michael J. Anderson]], and contained five songs sung by [[Julee Cruise]]. Lynch produced a 50-minute video of the performance in 1990.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 55–56.</ref> Meanwhile, he was also involved in creating various [[commercials]] for companies including [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Giorgio Armani]] and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching Twin Peaks for his missing wife.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 211–212.</ref>

{{quote box|width=275px|align=right|quote=1990 was Lynch's annus mirabilis: ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[Cannes]], and the television series ''Twin Peaks'' was proving a smash hit with audiences across the world. The musical/performance piece ''Industrial Symphony No. 1'', which Lynch had staged with Angelo Badalamenti at the Brooklyn Academy of music, had spawned the album ''Floating into the Night'' and launched singer [[Julee Cruise]]. Five one-man exhibitions between 1989 and 1991 emphasized Lynch's roots in fine art and painting, and a rash of ads (including a teaser trailer for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 'Dangerous' tour) confirmed the demand for the Lynch touch&nbsp;...

While Lynch was working on the first few episodes of ''Twin Peaks'', his friend [[Monty Montgomery (producer)|Monty Montgomery]] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be executive producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." The book was [[Barry Gifford]]'s novel ''Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula'', about two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 193.</ref> With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'', a [[crime fiction|crime]] and [[road movie]] starring [[Nicolas Cage]] as Sailor and [[Laura Dern]] as Lula.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/film/2010/01/lynch-prosthetic-god-world|title=His dark materials|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=November 15, 2017}}</ref> Describing its plot as a "strange blend" of "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much of the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 193–194, 198.</ref> Despite a muted response from American critics and viewers, ''Wild at Heart'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1990 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="cannes-1990.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/164/year/1990.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Wild at Heart |accessdate=August 7, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

After ''Wild at Heart''<nowiki/>'s success, Lynch returned to the world of the canceled ''Twin Peaks'', this time without Frost, to create a film that was primarily a prequel but also in part a sequel. Lynch said, "I liked the idea of the story going back and forth in time."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 187.</ref> The result, ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), primarily revolved around the last few days in the life of Laura Palmer, and was much "darker" in tone than the TV series, with much of the humor removed, and dealing with such topics as [[incest]] and murder. Lynch has said the film is about "the loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion and devastation of the victim of incest". The company CIBY-2000 financed ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', and most of the TV series' cast reprised their roles, though some refused and many were unenthusiastic about the project.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 184–187.</ref> The film was a commercial and critical failure in the United States but a hit in Japan, and some critics, such as [[Mark Kermode]], have called it Lynch's "masterpiece".<ref name="Kermode, Mark">{{cite news | last = Kermode | first = Mark | title = David Lynch | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = February 8, 2007 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2011369,00.html | accessdate =October 27, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Lynch worked on some new television shows. He and Frost created the comedy series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'' (1992), which was canceled after three episodes aired, and he and Monty Montgomery created the three-episode [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Hotel Room]]'' (1993) about events that happen in one hotel room on different dates.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 82–84.</ref>

In 1993, Lynch collaborated with Japanese musician [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]] on the video for [[X Japan]]'s song "[[Longing (song)|Longing ~Setsubou no Yoru~]]". The video was never officially released, but Lynch claimed in his 2018 memoir ''Room to Dream'' that "some of the frames are so fuckin' beautiful, you can't believe it."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Room to Dream|last=Lynch, David, 1946–|others=McKenna, Kristine|isbn=9780399589195|edition= First|location=New York, N.Y.|page=327|oclc=1019843510}}</ref>

After his unsuccessful TV ventures, Lynch returned to film. In 1997 he released the non-linear, [[film noir|noiresque]] ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'', which was co-written by Barry Gifford and starred [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. The film failed commercially and received a mixed response from critics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Highway (1997)|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Lost-Highway#tab=summary|website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Highway Reviews|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/lost-highway|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>

Lynch then began work on a film from a script by [[Mary Sweeney]] and [[John E. Roach]], ''[[The Straight Story]]'', based on a true story: that of [[Alvin Straight]] ([[Richard Farnsworth]]), an elderly man from [[Laurens, Iowa|Laurens]], Iowa, who goes on a 300-mile journey to visit his sick brother ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) in [[Mount Zion, Wisconsin]], by [[Riding mower|riding lawnmower]]. Asked why he chose this script, Lynch said, "that's what I fell in love with next", and expressed his admiration of Straight, describing him as "like [[James Dean]], except he's old".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 247, 252.</ref> Badalamenti wrote the music for the film, saying it was "very different from the kind of score he's done for [Lynch] in the past".<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 260.</ref>

Among the many differences from Lynch's other films, ''[[The Straight Story]]'' contains no profanity, sexuality or violence, and is rated G (general viewing) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], which came as "shocking news" to many in the film industry, who were surprised that it "did not disturb, offend or mystify".<ref name="lynch245">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 245.</ref> Le Blanc and Odell write that the plot made it "seem as far removed from Lynch's earlier works as could be imagined, but in fact right from the very opening, this is entirely his film—a surreal road movie".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 69.</ref>

===2000s: ''Mulholland Drive'' and other works===

The same year, Lynch approached [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] again with ideas for a television drama. The network gave Lynch the go-ahead to shoot a two-hour pilot for the series ''Mulholland Drive'', but disputes over content and running time led to the project being shelved indefinitely. But with $7 million from the French [[production company]] [[StudioCanal]], Lynch completed the pilot as a film, ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. The film, a non-linear narrative surrealist tale of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s dark side, stars [[Naomi Watts]], [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]]. It performed relatively well at the box office worldwide and was a critical success, earning Lynch [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] (shared with [[Joel Coen]] for ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'') and Best Director from the New York Film Critics Association.

With the rising popularity of the Internet, Lynch decided to use it as a distribution channel, releasing several new series he had created exclusively on his website, davidlynch.com, which went online on December 10, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|first=Enrique|last=Rivero|url=http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604204833/http://www.hive4media.com/news/html/Product_article.cfm?article_ID=2849|title=Director David Lynch Has Do-It-Himself DVD|website=hive4media.com|archive-date=June 4, 2002|date=March 28, 2002|accessdate=September 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2002, he created a series of online shorts, ''[[DumbLand]]''.

Later, he made his experiments with [[DV|Digital Video]] available in the form of the Japanese-style horror short ''[[Darkened Room]]''. In 2006, Lynch's feature film ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' was released. At three hours, it is the longest of his films. Like ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Lost Highway'', it does not follow a traditional narrative structure. It stars Lynch regulars [[Laura Dern]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Justin Theroux]], with cameos by [[Naomi Watts]] and Laura Harring as the voices of Suzie and Jane Rabbit, and a performance by [[Jeremy Irons]]. Lynch has called ''Inland Empire'' "a mystery about a woman in trouble". In an effort to promote it, he made appearances with a cow and a placard bearing the slogan "Without cheese there would be no ''Inland Empire''".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-02-07/entertainment/17233482_1_inland-empire-bird-feeders-squirrels |title=Lynch dives within |author=Neva Chonin |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}</ref>

=== 2010s: Continued work, ''Twin Peaks'' revival ===
In 2010, Lynch began making guest appearances on the ''[[Family Guy]]'' spin-off ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' as [[Mr. Flippers|Gus the Bartender]]. He had been convinced to appear in the show by its lead actor, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], a fan of Lynch who felt that his whole life had changed after seeing ''Wild at Heart''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Faye | first = Denis | url = http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | title = A Kinder, Gentler Family Guy | publisher = Writers Guild of America, West | accessdate = November 29, 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130153215/http://wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=3802 | archive-date = November 30, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Lady Blue Shanghai]]'' is a 16-minute promotional film that was written, directed and edited by Lynch for [[Dior]]. It was released on the Internet in May 2010.  

Lynch directed a concert by English [[new wave music|new wave]] band [[Duran Duran]] on March 23, 2011. The concert was [[Streaming media|streamed live]] on YouTube from the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles as the kickoff to the second season of ''[[Unstaged: An Original Series from American Express]]''. "The idea is to try and create on the fly, layers of images permeating Duran Duran on the stage", Lynch said.

While doing press for ''Twin Peaks'', Lynch was again asked if he had retired from film and seemed to confirm that he had made his last feature film, responding, "Things changed a lot...

Since the last episode of ''The Return'' aired, there has been speculation about a fourth season. Lynch did not deny the possibility of another season, but said that if it were to happen, it would not air before 2021.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2017/09/15/twin-peaks-season-4-premiere-date-year-2021/ |title=Twin Peaks: David Lynch Lays Out Timetable for Any Potential Season 4 |last1=Mitovich |first1=Matt |date=September 15, 2017 |website=TV Line |accessdate=October 12, 2020}}</ref>

Lynch has said his work is more similar in many respects to that of European filmmakers than American ones, and that most films that "get down and thrill your soul" are by European directors.<ref name="lynch62">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 62.</ref> He has expressed his admiration for such filmmakers as [[Federico Fellini]],<ref name="lynch62"/> [[Werner Herzog]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]],<ref>{{cite interview |subject=David Lynch |interviewer=Diego Schonhals |publication-date=October 13, 2007 |title=David Lynch Favorites Movies and FilmMakers |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1s7EwOeowU }}</ref> [[Roman Polanski]], and [[Jacques Tati]],<ref name="lynch62"/> along with [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Billy Wilder]]. He has said that Wilder's ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) is one of his favorite pictures,<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 71.</ref> as are Kubrick's ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' (1962), Tati's ''[[Monsieur Hulot's Holiday]]'' (1953), Hitchcock's ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), and Herzog's ''[[Stroszek]]'' (1977).<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 21.</ref> He has also cited [[Herk Harvey]]'s ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]]'s ''[[Deep End (film)|Deep End]]'' (1970) as influences on his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|title=Retro Cinema: Carnival of Souls|website=Moviefone|date=October 12, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218064656/https://www.moviefone.com/2007/10/12/retro-cinema-carnival-of-souls/|archive-date=February 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Motifs===
Several themes recur in Lynch's work. Le Blanc and Odell write, "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas".<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. p. 08.</ref> One of the key themes they note is the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure, something they relate to the "surrealist ethos" of relying "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This can be seen in Merrick's dream of his mother in ''The Elephant Man'', Cooper's dreams of the red room in ''Twin Peaks'' and the "dreamlike logic" of the narratives of ''Eraserhead'', ''Mulholland Drive'' and ''Inland Empire''.<ref>[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 8–9.</ref> Of his attitude to dreams, Lynch has said, "Waking dreams are the ones that are important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose&nbsp;... [You can't really get others to experience it, but] right there is the power of cinema."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 15.</ref> His films are known for their use of [[magic realism]]. The motif of dreams is closely linked to his recurring use of drones, real-world sounds and musical styles.<ref>Holly Rogers, "The Audiovisual Eerie: Transmediating Thresholds in the Work of David Lynch", in Transmedia Directors: Artistry, Industry and New Audiovisual Aesthetics, ed. Holly Rogers, Carol Vernallis, Lisa Perrott (Bloomsbury, 2019)</ref>

Another of Lynch's prominent themes is industry, with repeated imagery of "the clunk of machinery, the power of pistons, shadows of oil drills pumping, screaming woodmills and smoke billowing factories", as seen in the industrial wasteland in ''Eraserhead'', the factories in ''The Elephant Man'', the sawmill in ''Twin Peaks'' and the lawnmower in ''The Straight Story''.<ref name="autogenerated9">[[#LeB00|Le Blanc and Odell 2000]]. pp. 9–11.</ref> Of his interest in such things, Lynch has said, "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 110.</ref>

Another theme is the dark underbelly of violent criminal activity in a society, such as [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]]’s gang in ''Blue Velvet'' and the cocaine smugglers in ''Twin Peaks''. The idea of deformity is also found in several of Lynch's films, from ''The Elephant Man'' to the deformed baby in ''Eraserhead'', as well as death from head wounds, found in most of Lynch's films. Other imagery common in Lynch's works includes flickering electricity or lights, fire, and stages upon which a singer performs, often surrounded by drapery.<ref name="autogenerated9"/>

Except ''The Elephant Man'' and ''Dune'', which are set in [[Victorian London]] and [[Duniverse|a fictitious galaxy]] respectively, all of Lynch's films are set in the United States, and he has said, "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 18.</ref> A number of his works, including ''Blue Velvet'', ''Twin Peaks'' and ''Lost Highway'', are intentionally reminiscent of 1950s American culture despite being set in later decades of the 20th century. Lynch has said, "It was a fantastic decade in a lot of ways&nbsp;... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we know we were laying the groundwork for a disastrous future."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 3–5.</ref>

Lynch also tends to feature his leading female actors in "split" roles, so that many of his female characters have multiple, fractured identities. This practice began with his casting [[Sheryl Lee]] as both [[Laura Palmer]] and her cousin [[Maddy Ferguson]] in ''Twin Peaks'' and continued in his later works. In ''Lost Highway'', [[Patricia Arquette]] plays the dual role of Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield; in ''Mulholland Drive'' [[Naomi Watts]] plays Diane Selwyn/Betty Elms and Laura Harring plays Camilla Rhodes/Rita; in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' [[Laura Dern]] plays Nikki Grace/Susan Blue. The numerous alternative versions of lead characters and fragmented timelines may echo and/or reference the [[many worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]] and perhaps Lynch's broader interest in [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>David Lynch on World Peace From the Quantum Level https://www.tm.org/blog/video/world-peace-from-the-quantum-level-david-lynch-and-john-hagelin/</ref> Some have suggested that Lynch's love for Hitchcock's ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', which employs a split lead character (the Judy Barton and Madeleine Elster characters, both portrayed by [[Kim Novak]]) may have influenced this aspect of his work.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cinearchive.org/post/116927300550/david-lynch-watching-vertigo-the-most-studied |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014035038/http://cinearchive.org/post/116927300550/david-lynch-watching-vertigo-the-most-studied |archive-date=October 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Cwik |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/04/9-great-films-influenced-by-alfred-hitchcocks-vertigo-62999/ |title=9 Great Films Influenced By Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' |website=Indiewire.com |date=April 16, 2015 |accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>

His films frequently feature characters with supernatural or omnipotent qualities. They can be seen as physical manifestations of various concepts, such as hatred or fear. Examples include The Man Inside the Planet in ''Eraserhead'', [[Killer BOB|BOB]] in ''Twin Peaks'', The Mystery Man in ''Lost Highway'', The Bum in ''Mulholland Drive'', and The Phantom in ''Inland Empire''. Lynch approaches his characters and plots in a way that steeps them in a dream state rather than reality.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/david-lynch-racial-politics.html|title=What Does David Lynch Have to Say About Race?|last=Guan|first=Frank|work=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=November 15, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Other work==
===Painting===
[[File:Lynch's So This is Love painting.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Lynch's painting ''So This Is Love'', 1992]]
Lynch first trained as a painter, and although he is now better known as a filmmaker, he has continued to paint. Lynch has stated that "all my paintings are organic, violent comedies. They have to be violently done and primitive and crude, and to achieve that I try to let [[nature]] paint more than I paint."<ref name="lynch22">[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 22.</ref> Many of his works are very dark in colour, and Lynch has said this is because

{{cquote|I wouldn't know what to do with [colour]. Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets&nbsp;... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on continuing to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing what you love, and it becomes like a dream.<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. p. 20.</ref>}}

Many of his works also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains:

{{cquote|The words in the paintings are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what else is going on in there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth&nbsp;... sometimes they become the title of the painting.<ref name="lynch22"/>}}

Lynch considers the 20th-century Irish-born British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] to be his "number one kinda hero painter", stating that "Normally I only like a couple of years of a painter's work, but I like everything of Bacon's. The guy, you know, had the stuff."<ref>[[#Lyn05|Lynch and Rodley 2005]]. pp. 16–17.</ref>

Lynch was the subject of a major art retrospective at the [[Fondation Cartier]], Paris from March 3 – May 27, 2007. The show was titled ''The Air is on Fire'' and included numerous paintings, photographs, drawings, alternative films and sound work. New site-specific art [[Installation art|installations]] were created specially for the exhibition. A series of events accompanied the exhibition including live performances and concerts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6412525.stm | work=BBC News | title=David Lynch's dark arts laid bare | date=March 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first=Caroline | last=Wyatt}}</ref>

His alma mater, the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], presented an exhibition of his work, entitled "The Unified Field", which opened on September 12, 2014 and ended in January 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pafa.org/davidlynch|title=David Lynch: The Unified Field|work=pafa.org}}</ref>

Lynch is represented by Kayne Griffin Corcoran in Los Angeles, and has been exhibiting his paintings, drawings, and photography with the gallery since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/09/07/like-dogs-human-head-david-lynch-shows-new-paintings-los-angeles/ |title='I Like Dogs with a Human Head': David Lynch Shows New Paintings in Los Angeles |website=ArtNews.com |date=September 7, 2018 |accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>

His favorite photographers include [[William Eggleston]] (''[[The Red Ceiling]]''), [[Joel-Peter Witkin]], and [[Diane Arbus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/art/david-lynch-interview-there-is-something-so-incredibly-cosmically-magical-about-curtains|title=David Lynch interview: 'There is something so incredibly cosmically magical about curtains'|website=Timeout.com}}</ref>

===Music===
[[File:David Lynch -microphone -10Aug2007-2p (cropped).jpg|thumb|Lynch in August 2007]]
Lynch has also been involved in a number of music projects, many of them related to his films. His album genres switch mainly between [[experimental rock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes and, most recently, avant-garde [[electropop]] music. Most notably he produced and wrote lyrics for [[Julee Cruise]]'s first two albums, ''[[Floating into the Night]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Voice of Love (Julee Cruise album)|The Voice of Love]]'' (1993), in collaboration with [[Angelo Badalamenti]] who composed the music and also produced. Lynch also worked on the 1998 [[Jocelyn Montgomery]] album ''Lux Vivens (Living Light), The Music of Hildegard von Bingen''.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/lux-vivens-the-music-of-hildegard-von-bingen-mw0000600349 Jocelyn Montgomery & David Lynch – Lux Vevens] Allmusic</ref> For his own productions, he composed music for ''Wild at Heart'', ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me'', ''Mulholland Drive'', and ''Rabbits''. In 2001, he released ''[[BlueBob]]'', a rock album performed by Lynch and John Neff. The album is notable for Lynch's unusual guitar playing style. He plays "upside down and backwards, like a lap guitar", and relies heavily on effects pedals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynchnet.com/articles/bug.html |title=BOSS Users Group magazine Vol. 5, No. 1 Summer 2001 |website=Lynchnet.com |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref> Most recently Lynch composed several pieces for ''Inland Empire'', including two songs, "Ghost of Love" and "Walkin' on the Sky", in which he makes his public debut as a singer. In 2009, his new book-CD set ''[[Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse Present: Dark Night of the Soul|Dark Night of the Soul]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/|title=Music – New Music News, Reviews, Pictures, and Videos|access-date=August 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225131420/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/15/danger-mouses-dark-night-of-the-soul-album-threatened-by-lawsuit/|archive-date=February 25, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2008, he started his own record label called David Lynch MC which first released ''Fox Bat Strategy: A Tribute to Dave Jaurequi'' in early 2009. In August 2009, it was announced that he was releasing Afghani/American singer Ariana Delawari's ''Lion of Panjshir'' album in conjunction with [[Manimal Vinyl]] record company.

In November 2010, Lynch released two [[electropop]] music singles, "Good Day Today" and "I Know", through the independent British label [[Sunday Best (music company)|Sunday Best Recordings]]. Describing why he created them, he stated that "I was just sitting and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [Hurley, his engineer] and then these few notes, 'I want to have a good day, today' came and the song was built around that".<ref>{{cite news | last = Topping | first = Alexandra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/28/david-lynch-turns-pop-singer-songwriter?intcmp=239 |title=The latest offbeat experiment from filmmaker David Lynch: pop singles |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 28, 2010 | accessdate=November 30, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The singles were followed by an album, ''[[Crazy Clown Time]]'', which was released in November 2011 and described as an "electronic blues album".<ref name="clowntime">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/arts/music/david-lynchs-album-crazy-clown-time.html | title=Music, Not Movies, But Still Exploring Places of Darkness | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 30, 2012 | first=David | last=Lynch}}</ref> The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by [[Karen O]] of the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15999-david-lynch-crazy-clown-time/ | last=Powell | first=Mike | title=Crazy Clown Time | website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=November 8, 2011 | accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> and composed and performed by Lynch and [[Dean Hurley]].<ref name="clowntime"/> All or most of the songs for ''Crazy Clown Time'' were put into art-music videos, Lynch directing the title song's video.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caWXt9lCVrc|title=YouTube|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDGFZhoVT0|title=YouTube|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IugOfDBWcGc|title=YouTube|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph9o8faQUo|title=YouTube|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> The ''Crazy Clown Time'' song and video are a fantastic minimalistic parody of hip-hop music and videos.

For Record Store Day 2014, David Lynch released ''The Big Dream Remix EP'' which featured four songs from his album remixed by various artists. This included the track "Are You Sure" remixed by [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]]. The band Bastille have been known to take inspiration from David Lynch's work for their songs and music videos, the main one being their song "[[Laura Palmer (song)|Laura Palmer]]" which is influenced by Lynch's television show ''Twin Peaks''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nme.com/news/david-lynch/75997|title=David Lynch collaborates with Moby and Bastille for Record Store Day EP – listen|access-date=April 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426214824/http://www.nme.com/news/david-lynch/75997|archive-date=April 26, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On November 2, 2018, a collaborative album by Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti, titled ''[[Thought Gang]]'', was released on vinyl and on compact disc. The album was recorded around 1993 but was unreleased at the time.

===Design===
Lynch designed and constructed furniture for his 1997 film ''Lost Highway'', notably the small table in the Madison house and the VCR case. In April 1997, he presented a furniture collection at the prestigious [[Milan Furniture Fair]] in Italy. "Design and music, art and architecture – they all belong together."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cityofabsurdity.com/furniture.html|title=The City of Absurdity: David Lynch's Furniture|website=Cityofabsurdity.com}}</ref>

Working with designer Raphael Navot, architectural agency Enia and light designer Thierry Dreyfus, Lynch has conceived and designed a nightclub in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2011/09/07/silencio-by-david-lynch/|title=Silencio by David Lynch|date=September 7, 2011|website=Dezeen.com}}</ref> "Silencio" opened in October 2011, and is a private members' club although is free to the public after midnight. Patrons have access to concerts, films and other performances by artists and guests. Inspired by the club of the same name in his 2001 film ''Mulholland Drive'', the underground space consists of a series of rooms, each dedicated to a certain purpose or atmosphere. "Silencio is something dear to me. I wanted to create an intimate space where all the arts could come together. There won't be a Warhol-like guru, but it will be open to celebrated artists of all disciplines to come here to programme or create what they want."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/31/david-lynch-disco-paris?fb=native&CMP=FBCNETTXT9038/|title=Inside David Lynch's Paris nightclub|first=Fiachra|last=Gibbons|date=August 31, 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

===Literature===
In 2006, Lynch authored a short book describing his creative processes, stories from throughout his career, and the benefits he had realized through his practice of [[Transcendental Meditation]] called ''[[Catching the Big Fish|Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity]]''. He describes the metaphor behind the title in the introduction:

{{cquote|Ideas are like fish.

If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.

Down deep, the fish are more powerful and more pure. They're huge and abstract. And they're very beautiful.}}

The book weaves a non-linear autobiography with descriptions of Lynch's cognitive experiences during Transcendental Meditation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lynch|first1=David|title=Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity|date=2006|publisher=The Penguin Group|isbn=978-1-58542-540-2|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQqitBgFpOkC|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}</ref> All author's royalties will be donated to the [[David Lynch Foundation]].

Together with [[Kristine McKenna]], Lynch, in June 2018, published the book ''Room to Dream''. The book is a hybrid of biography and memoir. The book gives the reader a look into his personal and creative life through his own words and through those of his colleagues, family and friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bookmarks.reviews/reviews/room-to-dream/|title=Book Marks reviews of Room to Dream by David Lynch and Kristine McKenna|website=bookmarks.reviews|language=en-US|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref>

Lynch was working for the building and establishment of seven buildings, in which 8,000 salaried people would practice advanced meditation techniques, "pumping peace for the world". He estimates the cost at US$7 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].

In 2019, British contemporary artist [[Alexander de Cadenet]] interviewed David Lynch about his views on enlightenment and Transcendental Meditation.

===Website===
Lynch designed his personal website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his [[absurdism|absurdist]] series ''[[Dumbland]]'', plus interviews and other items.
