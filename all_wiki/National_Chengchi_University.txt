==History==
[[File:Former Gate of National Chengchi University in Nanjing 2011-12.JPG|Heritage Campus Gate of National Central University of Governance in Nanjing|thumb]]
[[File:Main gate nccu.jpg|Campus Gate of National Chengchi University in Taipei|thumb]]

The school was established in 1927 in [[Nanjing]], which was the capital city of China, as the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party of China]]'s '''Central School of Party Affairs'''. In 1929, it was renamed to '''Central School of Governance''', after the Kuomintang reunified China in the [[Northern Expedition]] campaign. The school was built on the basis of [[Nanjing University|National Central University in Nanjing]], which was the highest academic institution of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]. In 1946, it merged with the '''Central School of Cadre''', which was founded in 1944 by the Youth Corps of [[Three People's Principles]] in [[Chongqing]]. The merged school was named the '''National Central University of Governance''', based in [[Nanjing]]. When the [[Nationalist government]] lost control of mainland China in 1949, the university's activities were suspended.

The university was reopened in 1954 as '''National Chengchi University''' in [[Taipei]] by the [[Executive Yuan]], in order to meet the needs of civil service and the growing demands of higher education in [[Taiwan]]. Initially only graduates students were admitted, later in 1955, the school started to offer places to undergraduate students. In 1960, the university awarded the very first [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degree in the Republic of China. In 1964, the school initiated the first-ever [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-based Chinese [[Master of Business Administration]] program in the world.

Traditionally, as a modern institution training for public servants, NCCU is considered one of the leading institutions of the [[Republic of China]]. Today, the school is one of the top universities in Taiwan, and it also has been elected as the "Aim for the Top University Project" sponsored school of the [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]].

In 2014, the [[Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association|Embassy of Japan in Taiwan]] listed NCCU as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.<ref>交流, No.879, p.6. A total of 5 public universities and 2 private universities were selected: [[National Taiwan University|NTU]], [[National Cheng Kung University|NCKU]], [[National Tsing Hua University|NTHU]], [[National Chiao Tung University|NCTU]], NCCU, [[Fu Jen Catholic University|Fu Jen Catholic]] and [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]].</ref>

In December 2019, NCCU has established its first overseas office in Bangkok, Thailand.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nccu.edu.tw/p/405-1000-6994,c87.php | title=News | website=National Chengchi University (in Chinese) | access-date=2020-06-14}}</ref>
