* Actress [[Finty Williams]], who plays Lady Bracknell as a young dancer, is the daughter of Dame [[Judi Dench]], who plays the older Lady Bracknell.
* The [[Scene (film)|scenes]] where Rupert Everett slaps Colin Firth on his rear end and where Everett kisses Firth's cheek were [[ad lib]]bed. Director Parker thought Firth's stunned reaction was so humorous he decided to leave it in.
* The business with 'Ernest's' bill at the Savoy, and with the money collectors coming to Jack's country home, are taken from material Wilde cut from the play prior to its publication.
* Though cut from the revised version, the [[gardener]] Molton can be seen in the background of many scenes.
