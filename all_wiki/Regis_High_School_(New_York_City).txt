'''Regis High School''' is a [[independent school|private]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[secondary school]] for [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] boys located on [[Manhattan|Manhattan's]] [[Upper East Side]].<ref>[http://www.regis.org/section/?ID=1 "Regis High School, About Regis"], retrieved April 18, 2010</ref> In 2017, Regis was ranked as the top Catholic High School in the US by [[Town & Country (magazine)|''Town and County'' ''Magazine'']].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dangremond|first=Sam|date=2017-08-14|title=These Are the Top 10 Catholic High Schools in the Country|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/a12008388/best-catholic-high-schools/|access-date=2020-09-13|website=Town & Country|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
Regis High School was founded in 1914, through the financial bequest of a single formerly anonymous benefactress: [[Julia M. Grant]], the widow of Mayor [[Hugh J. Grant]]. She stipulated that her gift be used to build a [[Jesuit]] high school providing a free education for Catholic boys with special consideration given to those who could not otherwise afford a Catholic education.<ref name="Bahrampour">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/13/nyregion/at-regis-academic-rigor-and-service-all-free.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=At Regis, Academic Rigor and Service, All Free | first=Tara | last=Bahrampour | date=March 13, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> The school continues that policy and does not charge tuition.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Connell|first1=Christopher|title=Donors Keep Tuition-Free N.Y.

Following the death of her husband in 1910, Julia Grant met with Father David W. Hearn, S.J. and, with a stipulation of strict anonymity, gave him an envelope with the money needed to start a school to educate Catholic boys. After Mrs. Grant died, her children took over the funding of the school. The last surviving member of the family, Lucie Mackey Grant, a daughter-in-law of Julia Grant, died in 2007. Since the 1960s, Regis has relied primarily on the Grant endowments and alumni donations to keep the school tuition free. Following Lucie Mackey Grant's death, at an auction of her estate, Regis bid successfully for the original golden [[chalice]] used during Mass when the school was founded in 1914.<ref name=auction>{{cite web|title=The Collection of Hugh J. Grant and Lucie Mackey Grant|url=http://www.doylenewyork.com/pr/asian_art/09AS02/default.htm|work=Doyle News|publisher=Doyle New York|accessdate=January 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202312/http://www.doylenewyork.com/pr/asian_art/09AS02/default.htm|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The identity of the school's founding benefactor was officially kept secret for decades, though the large portrait in the school's first floor conference room titled "Julia Grant" contradicted the official policy. The online announcement, of an auction that included items related to the school's founding, did so as well.<ref name=auction/> Finally, on October 26, 2009, a documentary film revealed her identity and detailed the circumstances of her gift.

The school building was designed by [[Maginnis & Walsh]].<ref>{{cite aia5|page=453}}</ref>

On Saturday, May 14, 2011, a two-alarm fire destroyed the school's principal gymnasium and caused some peripheral damage. The school re-opened the following Tuesday.<ref>NBC New York: [http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fire-Tears-Through-Regis-High-School-121852704.html "Fire Tears Through Regis High School," May 16, 2011], accessed May 17, 2011</ref>
