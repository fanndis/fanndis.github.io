'''Mr. Potato Head''' is an American [[toy]] consisting of a [[plastic]] model of a [[potato]] which can be decorated with a variety of plastic parts that can attach to the main body. These parts usually include ears, eyes, shoes, a hat, a nose, pants and a mouth. The toy was invented and developed by [[George Lerner]] in 1949 and first manufactured and distributed by [[Hasbro]] in 1952.<ref name="VAC">{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofchildhood.org.uk/collections/construction-toys/mr-potato-head/ |title=Mr Potato Head |work=Museum of Childhood website |publisher=V&A Museum of Childhood |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Mr. Potato Head was the first toy [[Television advertisement|advertised on television]]<ref name=WTToys /><ref name="historyofhasbro">{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=ci_history_mph |title=About Mr. Potato Head |accessdate=2008-08-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925085901/http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=ci_history_mph |archive-date=September 25, 2008}}</ref> and has remained in production since its debut. The toy was originally produced as separate plastic parts with pushpins that could be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable. However, due to complaints regarding rotting vegetables and new government safety regulations, Hasbro began including a plastic potato body within the toy set in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures of MR.

Over the years, the original toy was joined by Mrs. Potato Head and supplemented with accessories such as a car and a boat trailer. The Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head characters appeared in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]], voiced by [[Don Rickles]] and [[Estelle Harris]]. Additionally, in 1998, ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]'' aired but was short-lived, with only one season being produced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315688/ |title=The Mr. Potato Head Show |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> As one of the prominent marks of Hasbro, a Mr. Potato Head balloon has also joined others in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1862565,00.html |work=Time |first=Claire |last=Suddath |title=Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade |date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> Today, Mr. Potato Head can still be seen adorning hats, shirts, and ties.

==History==
In the early 1940s, Brooklyn-born toy inventor [[George Lerner]] came up with the idea of inserting small, pronged body and face parts into fruits and vegetables to create a "funny face man". Some speculate he got the idea from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden.<ref name=WTToys>{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Tim |title=Timeless Toys: Classic Toys and the Playmakers Who Made Them |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-7407-5571-4}}</ref> Lerner would often take potatoes from his mother's garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as facial features, he would make dolls with which his younger sisters could play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed, potato-headed dolls became the principal idea behind the plastic toy which would later be manufactured.

In the beginning, Lerner's toy proved controversial. With [[World War II]] and food rationing a recent memory for most Americans, the use of fruits and vegetables to make toys was considered irresponsible and wasteful. Toy companies rejected Lerner's creation.<ref name=WTToys /> After several years of trying to sell the toy, Lerner finally convinced a food company to distribute the plastic parts as premiums in [[breakfast cereal]] boxes. He sold the idea for $5,000. However, in 1951, Lerner showed the idea to Henry and Merrill Hassenfeld, who conducted a small school supply and toy business called Hassenfeld Brothers (later changed to [[Hasbro]]). Realizing the toy was quite unlike anything in their line, they paid the cereal company $2,000 to stop production and bought the rights for $5,000. Lerner was offered an advance of $500 and a 5% royalty on every kit sold. The toy was dubbed Mr. Potato Head and went into production.<ref name=WTToys />

Mr. Potato Head was "born" on May 1, 1952. The original toy cost $0.98, and contained hands, feet, ears, two mouths, two pairs of eyes, four noses, three hats, eyeglasses, a pipe, and eight felt pieces resembling facial hair. The original Mr. Potato Head kit did not come with a potato "body", so parents had to provide their own potato into which children could stick the different pieces. Shortly after the toy's initial release, an order form for 50 additional pieces was enclosed in every kit.<ref name=WTToys />

On April 30, 1952, Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised on television. The [[Advertising campaign|campaign]] was also the first to be aimed directly at children; before this, commercials were only targeted at adults, so toy advertisements had always been pitched to parents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Mr Potato Head to blame for 'pester power' ads?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17871107|accessdate=May 1, 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=April 30, 2012}}</ref> This commercial revolutionized marketing, and caused an industrial boom. Over one million kits were sold in the first year.<ref name=WTToys /> In 1953, Mrs. Potato Head was added, and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam completed the Potato Head family with accessories reflecting the affluence of the 1950s that included a car, a boat trailer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICGrjmJouWA |title=Vintage Original Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head commercial 1960s |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> a kitchen set, a stroller, and pets called Spud-ettes. Although originally produced as separate plastic parts to be stuck into a real potato or other vegetable, a plastic potato was added to the kit in 1964.<ref name="VAC"/>

In the 1960s, government regulations forced the Potato Head parts to be less sharp, leaving them unable to prick vegetables easily. By 1964, the company was therefore forced to include a plastic potato "body" in its kit. Small children were also choking on the small pieces and cutting themselves with the sharp pieces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|title=The 1960s|website=Mrpotatohead.net|accessdate=2011-05-23 |url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528001857/http://www.mrpotatohead.net/1960/1960.htm|archive-date=2011-05-28}}</ref> About this time, Hasbro introduced Oscar the Orange and Pete the Pepper, a plastic orange and green pepper with attachable face parts similar to Mr. Potato Head's. Each came with Mr. Potato Head in a separate kit. Female characters Katie the Carrot and Cooky the Cucumber also made an appearance. Hasbro also made a fast food based line called Mr. Potato Head's Picnic Pals. Some characters were Mr. Soda Pop Head and Frankie Frank. The friends and pals were later discontinued, but [[Funko]] revived Oscar and Pete as [[bobbleheads]] (along with a Mr. Potato Head bobblehead) in 2002.

In 1975, the main potato part of the toy doubled in size and the dimensions of its accessories were similarly increased. This was done mainly because of new toy child safety regulations that were introduced by the U.S. government. This change in size also increased the market to younger children, enabling them to play and attach the facial pieces easily. Hasbro also replaced the holes with flat slats, which made it impossible for users to put the face pieces and other body parts the wrong way around. In the 1980s, Hasbro reduced the range of accessories for Mr. Potato Head to one set of parts. The company did, however, reintroduce round holes in the main potato body, and once again parts were able to go onto the toy in the wrong locations.

In 1985, Mr. Potato Head received four postal votes in the run for mayor of [[Boise, Idaho]] in the "most votes for Mr. Potato Head in a political campaign" as verified by [[Guinness World Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/the-eyes-have-it-in-idaho-where-mr-potato-head-is-running-for-mayor-of-boise-vol-24-no-19/|title=The Eyes Have It in Idaho, Where Mr. Potato Head Is Running For Mayor of Boise|publisher=Peoples Magazine|date=1985-11-04|accessdate=2020-05-03}}</ref>

In 1987, Mr. Potato Head became "Spokespud" for the annual [[Great American Smokeout]] and surrendered his pipe to Surgeon General [[C. Everett Koop]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="VAC"/>

In 1995, he made his film debut with a leading role in the Disney/Pixar animated feature ''[[Toy Story]]'',<ref name="VAC"/> with the voice provided by comedian [[Don Rickles]].

In 1995, Mr. Potato Head Pals was made. This box has hats, mouths, and pairs of shoes in different colors. It also has four bodies and eight hands while the eyes and nose are the same and four cards and every card has each name and a spinner is also included.

In 2000, Mr. Potato Head was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, NY]].

In 2006, Hasbro also began to sell sets of pieces without bodies for customers to add to their collections. Some of these themed sets included Chef, Construction Worker, Firefighter, Halloween, King, Mermaid, Police Officer, Pirate, Princess, Rockstar, and Santa Claus. In the same year, Hasbro introduced a line called "Sports Spuds"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-spuds.com/ |title=PPW Toys |publisher=Sports-spuds.com |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref> with a generic plastic potato (smaller than the standard size) customized to a wide variety of professional and collegiate teams.

In 2020, Hasbro announced an sustainable version of Mr. Potato Head which is sold exclusively at both [[Amazon.com| Amazon]] and [[Whole Foods Market]], known as '''Mr. Potato Head Goes Green'''. This version of Mr. Potato Head is entirely made from oil coming from a [[Sugarcane]] plant.

==In popular culture==

Mr. Potato Head's popularity has led to some appearances in films and television. In 1985, Mr. Potato Head played a supporting role in ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'', his first dramatic television appearance. From 1998 to 1999, he had his own short-lived [[Fox Kids]] series ''[[The Mr. Potato Head Show]]''. In addition to film and television, the character has been the subject of a comic strip created by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]]. Cartoonist [[Gary Larson]] included the character in several of his ''[[The Far Side]]'' cartoons. In commercial for [[Bridgestone]] tires during [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.

Mr. Potato Head has also acted as spokesman for several causes. In 1987, Mr. Potato Head surrendered his pipe to become the spokesperson for the American Cancer Society's annual "Great American Smokeout" campaign. He performed the role for several years.

Larger-than-life versions of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head are "guests" in the 1980s section of [[Pop Century Resort]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida.

In 1991, the sketch comedy show ''[[In Living Color]]'' parodied the toy and entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] and his penchant for [[plastic surgery]], offering children a multitude of different noses to represent different stages in Jackson's career. Jackson's skin bleaching was also mocked when one child says the toy doesn't look quite right and then peels it, revealing white skin underneath.

Starting in the 2000s, Mr. and Mrs Potato Head also starred in commercials for other brands. An example is an ad for [[Lay's|Lay's Potato Chips]] where Mr. Potato Head comes home to see Mrs. Potato Head eating them despite being a potato herself. At the end Mr. Potato Head joins in and tells her to keep it their "little secret".

A spoof named Mr. Zucchini Head appeared as a proposed new toy in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[The King Is Dead (Family Guy)|The King Is Dead]]." Another spoof named Mr. Carrot Head appeared in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Angry Dad: The Movie]]."
