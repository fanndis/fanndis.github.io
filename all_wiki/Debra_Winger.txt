Winger's first acting role was as "Debbie" in the 1976 [[sexploitation film]] ''[[Slumber Party '57]]''. Her next role was as Diana Prince's younger sister Drusilla ([[Wonder Girl]]) in three episodes of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s TV series, ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''.

This was followed by a guest role in Season 4 of the TV drama ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'' in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0676403/|title=Battered Teachers|date=January 1, 2000|via=IMDb|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031053231/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0676403/|archivedate=October 31, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1982 she co-starred with [[Nick Nolte]] in ''[[Cannery Row (film)|Cannery Row]]'' and with [[Richard Gere]] in ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Winger was going to play Peggy Sue in ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' but was forced to back out just before production began when she injured her back in a bicycle accident. The injury affected her ability to work for several months afterward. She was cast in the lead role in ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' but dropped out and was replaced by [[Geena Davis]]. It was later reported that the main reason Winger chose to leave the film was her refusal to work with singer/actress [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/09/04/penny-marshall-debra-winger-dropped-out-of-league-because-of-madonna|title=Penny Marshall: Debra Winger Dropped out of "League" Because of Madonna|date=September 4, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065012/http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/09/04/penny-marshall-debra-winger-dropped-out-of-league-because-of-madonna|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other starring roles during this period included ''[[Legal Eagles]]'', ''[[Made in Heaven (1987 film)|Made in Heaven]]'', ''[[Everybody Wins (film)|Everybody Wins]]'', ''[[The Sheltering Sky (film)|The Sheltering Sky]]'', ''[[Leap of Faith (film)|Leap of Faith]]'', ''[[Black Widow (1987 movie)|Black Widow]]'', ''[[Betrayed (1988 film)|Betrayed]]'', ''[[Wilder Napalm]]'' and ''[[A Dangerous Woman (1993 film)|A Dangerous Woman]]''.

In 1995 Winger decided to take a hiatus from acting. In 2002 she said, "I wanted out for years. I got sick of hearing myself say I wanted to quit. It's like opening an interview with 'I hate interviews!' Well, get out! I stopped reading scripts and stopped caring. People said, 'We miss you so much.' But in the last six years, tell me a film that I should have been in.
