Google was founded in September 1998 by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while they were Ph.D. students at [[Stanford University]] in [[California]]. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through [[Preferred stock|supervoting]] stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02474131-5043839|title=Business Entity Filing|date=October 7, 2002|website=Business Search|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814022055/https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=02474131-5043839|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live|access-date=August 14, 2019}}</ref> An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the  [[Googleplex]]. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate called [[Alphabet Inc.]] Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. [[Sundar Pichai]] was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company's rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine ([[Google Search]]). It offers services designed for work and productivity ([[Google Docs]], [[Google Sheets]], and [[Google Slides]]), email ([[Gmail]]), scheduling and time management ([[Google Calendar]]), cloud storage ([[Google Drive]]), instant messaging and video chat ([[Google Duo|Duo]], [[Hangouts]], [[Google Chat|Chat]], and [[Google Meet|Meet]]), language translation ([[Google Translate]]), mapping and navigation ([[Google Maps]], [[Waze]], [[Google Earth]], and [[Street View]]), podcast hosting ([[Google Podcasts]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]]), blog publishing ([[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]), note-taking ([[Google Keep]] and [[Jamboard|Google Jamboard]]), and photo organizing and editing ([[Google Photos]]). The company leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile operating system, the [[Google Chrome]] web browser, and [[Chrome OS]], a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] devices, and it released multiple hardware products in October 2016, including the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]] line of smartphones, [[Google Home]] smart speaker, [[Google Wifi (router)|Google Wifi]] mesh wireless router, and [[Google Daydream]] virtual reality headset. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier ([[Google Fiber]], [[Google Fi]], and [[Google Station]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|title=Google Station is a new platform that aims to make public Wi-Fi better|last=Byford|first=Sam|date=September 27, 2016|website=The Verge|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903210758/https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13070922/google-station-public-wi-fi-india|archive-date=September 3, 2017|access-date=May 22, 2018}}</ref>

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.<ref>{{cite web |first=James |last=Glanz |title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2011 |access-date=March 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312053616/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |archive-date=March 12, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it will power all of its data centers, as well as all of its offices, from 100% renewable energy. The commitment will make Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy". Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that "since the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day, we'll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day". Additionally, the project will "help support communities" around the world, as the purchase commitments will "result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally", and will "generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/ |title=We're set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it's just the beginning |last=Hölzle |first=Urs |date=December 6, 2016 |website=The Keyword Google Blog |access-date=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208102229/https://www.blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/ |archive-date=December 8, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852004/google-data-center-oklahoma-renewable-energy-climate-change |title=Google just notched a big victory in the fight against climate change |last=Statt |first=Nick |date=December 6, 2016 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |access-date=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208001307/http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852004/google-data-center-oklahoma-renewable-energy-climate-change |archive-date=December 8, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/google-says-it-will-hit-100-renewable-energy-by-2017/ |title=Google says it will hit 100% renewable energy by 2017 |last=Etherington |first=Darrell |date=December 7, 2016 |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |access-date=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207164915/https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/google-says-it-will-hit-100-renewable-energy-by-2017/ |archive-date=December 7, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>
