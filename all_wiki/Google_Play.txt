'''Google Play''', formerly '''Android Market''', is a [[digital distribution]] service operated and developed by [[Google]]. It serves as the official [[app store]] for certified devices running on the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018, and it offered music and podcasts as part of Google Play Music until December 2020 when the service was replaced with [[YouTube Music]] and [[Google Podcasts]].<ref name=":2" />

Applications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications utilizing hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name="3.5 million apps"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.

Google Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], and formerly included [[Google Play Music]] before being discontinued in favour of [[YouTube Music]] and [[Google Podcasts]] in December 2020, [[Google Play Newsstand]] before it was phased out in November 2018, and [[Google TV|Google Play Movies & TV]] before being renamed to Google TV in September 2020. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.

== App monetization ==
Google states in its Developer Policy Center that "Google Play supports a variety of monetization strategies to benefit developers and users, including paid distribution, in-app products, subscriptions, and ad-based models", and requires developers to comply with the policies in order to "ensure the best user experience". It requires that developers charging for apps and downloads through Google Play must use Google Play's payment system. In-app purchases unlocking additional app functionality must also use the Google Play payment system, except in cases where the purchase "is solely for physical products" or "is for digital content that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g. songs that can be played on other music players)."<ref>{{cite web |title=Monetization and Ads |url=https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ |website=Developer Policy Center |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> Support for paid applications was introduced on February 13, 2009 for developers in the United States and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Chu |title=Android Market update: support for priced applications |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2009/02/android-market-update-support-for.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=February 13, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref> with support expanded to an additional 29 countries on September 30, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Chu |title=More Countries, More sellers, More buyers |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/09/more-countries-more-sellers-more-buyers.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref> The in-app billing system was originally introduced in March 2011.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Chu |title=In-App Billing on Android Market: Ready for Testing |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2011/03/in-app-billing-on-android-market-ready.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref> All developers on Google Play are required to feature a physical address on the app's page in Google Play, a requirement established in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Google Will Now Require All App Publishers With Paid Apps Or In-App Purchases To Have An Address On File And Displayed Publicly In Google Play [Update] |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/09/18/google-will-now-require-all-app-publishers-with-paid-apps-or-in-app-purchases-to-have-an-address-on-file-in-google-play/ |website=Android Police |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

Developers can target specific hardware components (such as [[compass]]), software components (such as [[Software widget|widget]]), and Android versions (such as [[Android Nougat|7.0 Nougat]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Device Compatibility |url=https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/compatibility.html |website=Android Developers |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> [[Mobile network operator|Carriers]] can also ban certain apps from being installed on users' devices, for example [[tethering]] applications.<ref>{{cite web |first=Terrence |last=O'Brien |title=Carriers crack down on Android tethering apps, rain on our mobile hotspot parade |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/02/carriers-crack-down-on-android-tethering-apps-rain-on-our-mobil/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] (a division of [[Verizon Communications]]) |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref>

There is no requirement that Android applications be acquired using the Play Store.

=== Installation history ===
The Play Store app features a history of all installed apps. Users can remove apps from the list, with the changes also synchronizing to the Google Play website interface, where the option to remove apps from the history does not exist.<ref>{{cite web |first= Jason |last= Cipriani |title= Delete downloaded app history from Google Play |url= https://www.cnet.com/how-to/delete-downloaded-app-history-from-google-play/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref>

=== Compatibility ===
Google publishes the [[source code]] for Android through its "Android Open Source Project", allowing enthusiasts and developers to program and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. However, not all these modified versions are compatible with apps developed for Google's official Android versions. The "Android Compatibility Program" serves to "define a baseline implementation of Android that is compatible with third-party apps written by developers". Only Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements may install and access Google's Play Store application. As stated in a help page for the Android Open Source Project, "Devices that are "Android compatible" may participate in the Android ecosystem, including Android Market; devices that don't meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem. In other words, the Android Compatibility Program is how we separate "Android compatible devices" from devices that merely run derivatives of the source code. We welcome all uses of the Android source code, but only Android compatible devices—as defined and tested by the Android Compatibility Program—may participate in the Android ecosystem."<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://source.android.com/faqs.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523025416/http://source.android.com/faqs.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 23, 2010 |website=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Some [[original equipment manufacturer|device manufacturers]] choose to use their own app store instead of or in addition to the Play Store.

== Google Play Services ==
{{Main|Google Play Services}}
In 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of its Android operating system (particularly its core applications) so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components, [[Google Play Services]], is a [[Proprietary software|closed-source]] system-level process providing [[Application programming interface|API]]s for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running [[Android Froyo|Android 2.2 "Froyo"]] and higher. With these changes, Google can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Balky carriers and slow OEMs step aside: Google is defragging Android |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/balky-carriers-and-slow-oems-step-aside-google-is-defragging-android/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref> As a result, [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.2 and 4.3 "Jelly Bean"]] contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=Review: Android 4.3's multitude of minor changes future-proofs the platform |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/review-android-4-3-future-proofs-the-platform-with-multitude-of-minor-changes/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=August 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref>

== Google Play Awards and yearly lists ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: GP Awards 2018.png|thumb|alt=Google Play Awards 2018 logo|The 2018 logo for Google Play Awards]] -->
In April 2016, Google announced the Google Play Awards, described as "a way to recognize our incredible developer community and highlight some of the best apps and games". The awards showcase five nominees across ten award categories, and the apps are featured in a dedicated section of Google Play. Google stated that "Nominees were selected by a panel of experts on the Google Play team based on criteria emphasizing app quality, innovation, and having a launch or major update in the last 12 months", with the winners announced in May.<ref>{{cite web |first=Purnima |last=Kochikar |title=The Google Play Awards coming to Google I/O |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/04/the-google-play-awards-coming-to-google.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=April 21, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Google showcases the best Android apps for its first-ever Google Play Awards |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/22/google-showcases-the-best-android-apps-for-its-first-ever-google-play-awards/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

Google has also previously released yearly lists of apps it deemed the "best" on Google Play.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Goldman |title=The best apps of 2015 ... according to Apple and Google |url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/12/10/technology/best-apps-2015-apple-google/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 10, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Victor |last=Luckerson |title=Google Says These Are 2014's Best Android Apps |url=http://time.com/3611709/best-android-google-play-apps-2014/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=December 1, 2014 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

On March 6, 2017, five years after Google Play's launch, Google released lists of the best-selling apps, games, movies, music, and books over the past five years.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=The top-selling Google Play Store content of all time is exactly what you think it is |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14829514/google-play-store-top-selling-content-fifth-anniversary |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 6, 2017 |accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Nieva |title=At 5, Google Play calls out Adele, Candy Crush as most popular |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-play-store-top-apps-adele-candy-crush-the-interview/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 6, 2017 |accessdate=March 6, 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017, Google introduced "Android Excellence", a new editorial program to highlight the apps deemed the highest quality by the Google Play editors.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Google Play introduces 'Android Excellence' collections that showcase editorially selected top apps and games |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/google-play-introduces-android-excellence-collections-that-showcase-editorially-selected-top-apps-and-games/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 13, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dani |last=Deahl |title=Google Play's new Android Excellence collections highlight the very best in apps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15794786/google-play-android-excellence-collections |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 13, 2017 |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref>

In 2020, Google Play awarded the [[Disney+]] emerged as the top app of the year for users in the US, and  SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off taking the honors in the gaming category.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.engadget.com/google-play-awards-disney-plus-genshin-impact-080149376.html|title=Disney+ is the best app of the year, according to Google Play users|accessdate=1 December 2020|website=Engadget}}</ref>

==Application approval==
Google places some restrictions on the types of apps that can be published, in particular not allowing sexually explicit content, child endangerment, violence, bullying & harassment, hate speech, gambling, illegal activities, and requiring precautions for user-generated content.<ref>{{cite web |title=Let's build the world's most trusted store for apps and games |url=https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/ |website=Developer Policy Center |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2015, Google disclosed that over the past few months, it had been begun using a combination of automated tools and human reviewers to check apps for [[malware]] and terms of service violations before they are published in the Play Store. At the same time, it began rolling out a new age-based ratings system for apps and games, based on a given region's official ratings authority (for example, [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] in the US).<ref>{{cite web |first=Eunice |last=Kim |title=Creating Better User Experiences on Google Play |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/03/creating-better-user-experiences-on.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=App Submissions On Google Play Now Reviewed By Staff, Will Include Age-Based Ratings |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/17/app-submissions-on-google-play-now-reviewed-by-staff-will-include-age-based-ratings/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=Google Play apps and updates are now subject to a review process |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/03/google-play-apps-and-updates-are-now-subject-to-a-review-process/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref>

In October 2016, Google announced a new detection and filtering system designed to provide "additional enhancements to protect the integrity of the store". The new system is aimed to detect and filter cases where developers have been attempting to "manipulate the placement of their apps through illegitimate means like fraudulent installs, fake reviews, and incentivized ratings".<ref>{{cite web |first=Kazushi |last=Nagayama |title=Keeping the Play Store trusted: fighting fraud and spam installs |url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2016/10/keeping-the-play-store-trusted-fighting-fraud-and-spam-installs.html |website=Android Developers Blog |date=October 31, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Google gets better at flagging apps trying to fake their way into the Play Store's top charts |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/31/google-gets-better-at-flagging-apps-trying-to-fake-their-way-into-the-play-stores-top-charts/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 31, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/10/31/google-rolling-improved-fraud-spam-detection-play-store/ |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Google rolling out improved fraud and spam detection in the Play Store |website=Android Police |date=October 31, 2016 |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}</ref>

In April 2019, Google announced changes to the store's app review process, stating that it would take several days to review app submissions from new and less-established developers. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Improving the update process with your feedback|url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-update-process-with-your.html|access-date=2020-08-21|website=Android Developers Blog|language=en}}</ref> The company later clarified that, in exceptional cases, certain apps may be subject to an expanded review process, delaying publication by seven days or longer. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Publish an app - Play Console Help|url=https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6334282|access-date=2020-08-21|website=support.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-30|title=[Update 2: Up to 7 Days or Longer] Google Play Store approval for new apps will now take more time|url=https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-store-approval-new-apps-time/|access-date=2020-08-21|website=xda-developers|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Application bans ===
Some [[Mobile network operator|mobile carriers]] can block users from installing certain apps. In March 2009, reports surfaced that several [[tethering]] apps were banned from the store.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Krazit |title=Google bans tethering app from Android Market? |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-bans-tethering-app-from-android-market/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref> However, the apps were later restored, with a new ban preventing only [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] subscribers from downloading the apps. Google released a statement:<ref>{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Krazit |title=Google restores tethering app for Android users outside U.S. |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-restores-tethering-app-for-android-users-outside-u-s/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref>

{{cquote|On Monday, several applications that enable tethering were removed from the Android Market catalog because they were in violation of T-Mobile's terms of service in the US. Based on Android's Developer Distribution Agreement (section 7.2), we remove applications from the Android Market catalog that violate the terms of service of a carrier or manufacturer.

In April 2011, Google removed the [[Grooveshark]] app from the store due to unspecified policy violations.

== Application security ==
In February 2012, Google introduced a new automated [[Antivirus software|antivirus]] system, called Google Bouncer, to scan both new and existing apps for [[malware]] (e. g. [[spyware]] or [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]).<ref>{{cite web |first=Hiroshi |last=Lockheimer |title=Android and Security |url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.no/2012/02/android-and-security.html |website=Google Mobile Blog |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Chloe |last=Albanesius |title=Google 'Bouncer' Now Scanning Android Market for Malware |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/apps/66697/news/google-bouncer-now-scanning-android-market-for-malware |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 2, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2017}}</ref> In 2017, the Bouncer feature and other safety measures within the Android platform were rebranded under the umbrella name Google Play Protect, a system that regularly scans apps for threats.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Fingas |title=Google Play protects your Android phone against rogue apps |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/17/google-play-protect/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 17, 2017 |accessdate=May 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Android 8.0 Oreo, thoroughly reviewed |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/android-8-0-oreo-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h1 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 4, 2017 |accessdate=November 9, 2017}}</ref>

Android apps can ask for or require certain permissions on the device, including access to body sensors, calendar, camera, contacts, location, microphone, phone, SMS, storage, WI-FI, and access to Google accounts.<ref>{{cite web |title=App permissions for Android 6.0 and up |url=https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602 |website=Google Play Help |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2017, Google described a new security effort called "peer grouping", in which apps performing similar functionalities, such as calculator apps, are grouped together and attributes compared. If one app stands out, such as requesting more device permissions than others in the same group, Google's systems automatically flag the app and security engineers take a closer inspection. Peer grouping is based on app descriptions, [[metadata]], and statistics such as download count.<ref>{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Google is using machine learning to sort good apps from bad on the Play Store |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15958372/google-machine-learning-ai-app-store-malware-security |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 12, 2017 |accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Hildenbrand |title=Google is using deep learning and data analysis to curate the Play Store |url=https://www.androidcentral.com/google-using-deep-learning-and-data-analysis-curate-play-store |website=Android Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |date=July 12, 2017 |accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

=== Security issues ===
In early March 2011, DroidDream, a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] [[rootkit]] exploit, was released to the then-named Android Market in the form of several free applications that were, in many cases, [[Copyright infringement|pirated versions]] of existing priced apps. This exploit allowed hackers to steal information such as [[International Mobile Equipment Identity|IMEI]] and [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]] numbers, phone model, user ID, and service provider. The exploit also installed a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] that allowed the hackers to download more code to the infected device.<ref name="ap-droiddream">{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Gingrich |title=The Mother Of All Android Malware Has Arrived: Stolen Apps Released To The Market That Root Your Phone, Steal Your Data, And Open Backdoor |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/ |website=Android Police |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> The exploit only affected devices running Android versions earlier than 2.3 "Gingerbread".<ref>{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=Google vanishes 'DroidDream' malware from citizen phones |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/03/07/google_remotely_kills_android_malware_apps/ |website=[[The Register]] |publisher=Situation Publishing |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> Google removed the apps from the Market immediately after being alerted,<ref name="ap-droiddream2">{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Gingrich |title=[Update: Plug The Hole Yourself] Malware Monster: DroidDream Is An Android Nightmare, And We've Got More Details |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/02/update-on-the-malware-monster-droiddream-is-an-android-nightmare-and-weve-got-more-details/ |website=Android Police |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> but the apps had already been downloaded more than 50,000 times, according to ''Android Police''{{'}}s estimate.<ref name="ap-droiddream"/> ''Android Police'' wrote that the only method of removing the exploit from an infected device was to reset it to a factory state, although community-developed solutions for blocking some aspects of the exploit were created.<ref name="ap-droiddream2"/> A few days later, Google confirmed that 58 malicious apps had been uploaded to Android Market, and had been downloaded to 260,000 devices before being removed from the store.<ref name="tc-droiddream"/> Google emailed affected users with information that "As far as we can determine, the only information obtained was device-specific (IMEI/IMSI, unique codes which are used to identify mobile devices, and the version of Android running on your device)" as opposed to personal data and account information.<ref name="tc-droiddream"/> It also announced the then-new "remote kill" functionality, alongside a security update, that lets Google remotely remove malicious apps from users' devices.<ref name="tc-droiddream">{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Kincaid |title=Google Responds To Android Malware, Will Fix Infected Devices And 'Remote Kill' Malicious Apps |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/03/05/android-malware-rootkit-google-response/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=March 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> However, days later, a malicious version of the security update was found on the Internet, though it did not contain the specific DroidDream malware.<ref>{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Gingrich |title=PSA: Infected "Android Market Security Tool March 2011" App Floating Around |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/09/psa-infected-android-market-security-tool-march-2011-apk-floating-around/ |website=Android Police |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> New apps featuring the malware, renamed DroidDream Light, surfaced the following June, and were also removed from the store.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=DroidDream Light a malware nightmare, booted from Android Market |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/06/droiddream-light-a-malware-nightmare-booted-from-android-market-encumbered-boobies-out-of-android-marketdroiddream-light-an-malware-nightware-booted-from-android-market/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

At the [[Black Hat Briefings|Black Hat]] security conference in 2012, security firm Trustwave demonstrated their ability to upload an app that would circumvent the Bouncer blocker system. The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that "We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that "As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer". Trustwave reached out to Google to share their findings, but noted that more manual testing of apps might be necessary to detect apps using malware-masking techniques.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ellen |last=Messmer |title=Black Hat demo: Google Bouncer malware detection can be beaten |url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/2617648/application-security/black-hat-demo--google-bouncer-malware-detection-can-be-beaten.html |website=[[InfoWorld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Black Hat: Researchers find way to "bounce" malware into Google app store |url=https://www.scmagazine.com/black-hat-researchers-find-way-to-bounce-malware-into-google-app-store/article/542351/ |website=SC Magazine |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

According to a 2014 research study released by [[RiskIQ]], a security services company, malicious apps introduced through Google Play increased 388% between 2011 and 2013, while the number of apps removed by Google dropped from 60% in 2011 to 23% in 2013.

== Patent issues ==
Some developers publishing on Google Play have been sued for [[patent infringement]] by "patent trolls", people who own broad or vaguely worded patents that they use to target small developers. If the developer manages to successfully challenge the initial assertion, the "patent troll" changes the claim of the violation in order to accuse the developer of having violated a different assertion in the patent. This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system, which can have substantial economic costs, prompting some developers to settle.<ref name="patent troll">{{cite web |first=Kris |last=Carlon |title=You can be sued simply for uploading an app to Google Play |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/patent-troll-suing-app-developers-uploading-app-google-play-697544/ |website=Android Authority |date=June 9, 2016 |accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref> In February 2013, Austin Meyer, a flight simulator game developer, was sued for having used a copy-protection system in his app, a system that he said "Google gave us!
