==History==
[[File:Oxfam plaque Old Library University Church Oxford.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating first meeting of Oxfam in the Old Library, the University Church, [[Oxford]]]]
Founded at 17 Broad Street, [[Oxford]], as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief by a group of [[Quaker]]s, social activists, and Oxford academics in 1942 and registered in accordance with UK law in 1943, the original Oxford Committee for Famine Relief was a group of concerned citizens including Henry Gillett (a prominent local [[Quaker]]), [[Dick Milford|Theodore Richard Milford]], [[Gilbert Murray]] and his wife Mary, [[Cecil Jackson-Cole]] and Alan Pim. The Committee met in the Old Library of [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]], Oxford, for the first time in 1942, and its aim was to help [[Great Famine (Greece)|starving citizens of occupied Greece]], a famine caused by the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval blockades and to persuade the British government to allow food relief through the blockade. The Oxford committee was one of several local committees formed in support of the National [[Famine Relief]] Committee.<ref>Black, (1992)</ref>

Oxfam's first paid employee was [[Joe Mitty]], who began working at the Oxfam shop on [[Broad Street, Oxford]] on 9 November 1949. Engaged to manage the accounts and distribute donated clothing, he originated the policy of selling anything which people were willing to donate, and developed the shop into a national chain.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7024049.stm |title=Oxfam shop founder dies aged 88 | publisher =BBC News | work = News |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=26 February 2012 }}</ref>

By 1960, it was a major international [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental aid organization]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
The first overseas committee was founded in Canada in 1963, and in 1965 the organization changed its name to its [[telegraphic address]], OXFAM. The Oxford committee became known as Oxfam Great Britain or [[#Oxfam GB|Oxfam GB]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
In 1995 Oxfam International was formed by a group of independent non-governmental organizations. Their aim was to work together for a greater impact on the international stage to [[poverty reduction|reduce poverty]] and [[social injustice|injustice]]. Stichting Oxfam International was registered as a non-profit foundation at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stitching Oxfam International|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC019279|publisher=Companies House}}</ref>

==Oxfam's work==
===Mission and values===
In November 2000, Oxfam adopted the [[Rights-based approach to development|rights-based approach]] as the framework for all the work of the Confederation and its partners. Oxfam recognizes the universality and indivisibility of human rights and has adopted these overarching aims to express these rights in practical terms:
* the right to a sustainable livelihood
* the right to basic social services
* the right to life and security
* the right to be heard
* the right to an identity<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/oi_strategic_plan_2007_0.pdf |title=Oxfam International Strategic Plan 2007–2012: Demanding Justice |access-date=21 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123195144/http://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/oi_strategic_plan_2007_0.pdf |archive-date=23 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Oxfam believes that poverty and powerlessness are avoidable and can be eradicated by human action and political will. It believes in the right to a sustainable livelihood, and the right and capacity to participate in societies and make positive changes to people's lives as basic human needs and rights which can be met. Oxfam believes that peace and substantial arms reduction are essential conditions for development and that inequalities can be significantly reduced between both rich and poor nations and within nations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Oxfam has restructured their donation process and ''supporter-facing digital'' in response to a fall in fundraising.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charitydigitalnews.co.uk/2019/05/17/oxfam-digital-offerings-combat-fall-in-fundraising/|title=Oxfam digital offerings combat fall in fundraising|date=17 May 2019|website=Charity Digital News|language=en-GB|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref>

Oxfam works on [[trade justice]], [[fair trade]], [[education]], [[debt]] and [[International aid|aid]], [[sustenance|livelihood]]s, [[health]], [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[gender equality]], [[War|conflict]] (campaigning for an international [[arms industry|arms trade]] treaty) and [[natural disaster]]s, [[democracy]] and [[human rights]], and [[climate change]]. Through programmes like "Saving for Change", Oxfam helps communities become more self-sufficient financially. The Saving for Change initiative is a programme whereby communities are taught how to form collective, informal credit groups. Through these mutually beneficial groups, members—who tend to be mostly women—pool their savings into a fund which is used to give loans for activities such as paying for medical care and paying school fees, in addition to using the loans to fund small-scale business ventures. Ultimately, the goal of the programme is to leave the community with a self-sustaining organization where people who otherwise would not qualify for formal bank loans can go for financial assistance. In doing so, borrowers can start businesses which benefit not only themselves but also their communities.<ref>{{cite web | first = Tjarda | last = Muller | date = 1 October 2010 | title = A Source of Income, Funded by Savings | publisher = Oxfam | place = America | accessdate = 26 December 2014 | url = http://www.oxfamamerica.org/articles/a-source-of-income-funded-by-savings | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031165125/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/articles/a-source-of-income-funded-by-savings/ | archive-date = 31 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Campaigns===
The [[Make Trade Fair]] campaign organized by Oxfam International focuses on the elimination of trade practices, like [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm#|title=Rigged Rules – Dumping|accessdate=29 January 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209051849/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm|archive-date=9 February 2006}}</ref> Another practice Oxfams opposes is the setting of [[tariffs]], where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|title=Rigged Rules – Market Access|accessdate=29 January 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040624/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|archive-date=21 February 2006}}</ref> unbalanced [[labour rights]] for women, who often earn lower wages than their male counterparts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|title=Rigged Rules – Labour Rights|accessdate=29 January 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162419/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|archive-date=24 December 2005}}</ref> and stringent [[patent]] issues that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. [[Gene patent]]s, [[Chemical patent]]s, and [[Software patent]]s) from being lowered. Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|title=Rigged Rules – Patents|accessdate=29 January 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322075359/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|archive-date=22 March 2006}}</ref>

===Shops===
{{See also|Oxfam bookshops}}
[[File:First Oxfam shop crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Original Oxfam shop at 17 [[Broad Street, Oxford]]]]

Oxfam has shops all over the world, which sell many fair-trade and donated items since their first charity shop opened in 1948,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what-we-do/about-us/history-of-oxfam|title=History of Oxfam|publisher=Oxfam}}</ref> although trading began in 1947. The proceeds from these are used to further Oxfam's mission and relief efforts around the globe. Much of their stock comes from public donations but as of 2012 they still sold fair trade products from developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America, including handcrafts, books, music CDs and instruments, clothing, toys, food and ethnic creations. These objects are brought to the public through fair trade to help boost the quality of life of their producers and surrounding communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamshop.org.au/|title=Fair Trade Products, Homeware, Gifts & Jewellery from|work=Shop|publisher=Oxfam|location=AU|accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>

As of 2010, Oxfam had over 1,200 shops worldwide.<ref>{{Citation|title=Annual Report|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxfam}}</ref> More than half of them were in the UK with around 750 Oxfam GB shops including specialist shops such as books, music, furniture and bridal wear. Oxfam Germany has 45 shops including specialist book shops; Oxfam France shops sell books and fair trade products and Oxfam Hong Kong has 2 shops selling donated goods and fair trade products. Oxfam Novib, Oxfam Australia (with over 20 fair trade shops), Oxfam Ireland and Oxfam in Belgium also raise funds from shops.

Of the 750 Oxfam charity shops around the UK, around 100 are specialist bookshops or book and music shops. Oxfam is the largest retailer of [[used book|second-hand books]] in Europe, selling around 12 million per year. In 2008, Oxfam GB worked with over 20,000 [[volunteering|volunteers]] in shops across the UK, raising £17.1&nbsp;million for Oxfam's programme work.<ref name="AnnualReportAccounts">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/accounts/annual_report_accounts.html|title=Trustee's Report 2007–08|publisher=Oxfam|place=[[United Kingdom|UK]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130061044/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/accounts/annual_report_accounts.html|archive-date=30 January 2009}}</ref>

===Fundraising===
Oxfam has several successful fundraising channels in addition to its shops. Over half a million people in the UK make a regular financial contribution to its work. In April 2017 the Information Commissioner's Office fined 11 charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors' personal data. Oxfam was fined £6,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2017/04/ico-fines-eleven-more-charities/ |title=fines eleven more charities |publisher=ICO |date=5 April 2017 |accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>

===Oxfam Germany===
[[File:Oxfam, Friedrichstraße 25, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|An Oxfam outlet in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Germany]].]]

Oxfam Germany has its beginnings in an initiative by private citizens who in 1986 opened a secondhand shop in [[Bonn]] modelled on the idea of the British charity shops. While not officially associated with Oxfam, the shop was staffed by volunteers and sold donated goods, with all proceeds given to projects run by Oxfam GB. A second shop, following the same model, was opened in Cologne in 1991.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=21032002122721.htm | type = history | publisher = Oxfam Germany | title = Make Trade Fair | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314135920/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=21032002122721.htm | archive-date = 14 March 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Oxfam officially came to Germany in 1995 with the foundation of the charitable Oxfam Deutschland e.

===Oxfam Hong Kong===
Oxfam Hong Kong began in 1976, when volunteers came together, opened a second-hand shop, and raised funds for anti-poverty projects around the world. Some of the first actions in the 1970s and '80s were to advocate for justice in the Vietnamese Boat People/Refugee crisis in Hong Kong, and to help save lives in Ethiopia during the 1984 famine. To date, Oxfam Hong Kong has assisted poor people in more than 70 countries/states around the world.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oxfam.org.hk/en/aboutoxfam.aspx |title=Oxfam Hong Kong – About Us | accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref>

===Oxfam India===
Oxfam's involvement in India began when money was granted in 1951 to fight famine in Bihar.  Bihar at the time was one of the poorest and most populated states in India.

Oxfam had launched an appeal that led to the first report of Oxfam's work in the House of Commons in UK. On 31 May 1951, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations had commended the Bihar appeal, stating "the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (then name of Oxfam) has made an appeal for donations and I hope individuals will reply to that generously". Among the many donations received was one for 100 British pounds from an Indian Rajah in appreciation of what Oxfam was doing for the hungry of his country.<ref>The Oxfam Story, page 11, Pergamon Press Ltd (1964) Library of Congress Card No. 64-17726</ref>

Bihar and famine would bring Oxfam back to [[India]] in 1965 to address drought due to bad monsoons.  Bihar held a population of 53 million, of which 40 million relied on subsistence farming to live.{{Sfn | Black | 1992}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =November 2012}} This would compound for India in the future; production of food had not been parallel to its exploding population.  It is estimated that, over the course of the droughts and famines, 2,400 tons of milk was bought by Oxfam and at the height of this was feeding over 400,000 starving children and mothers.<ref name="London, Macdonald 1970">{{Cite book | title = Drops in the ocean: the work of Oxfam 1960–1970 | place = London | publisher = Macdonald & Co | year = 1970 | isbn=0-356-03568-9}}</ref> In 1968 Oxfam's first field director in India, Jim Howard, created the Oxfam Gramdan Action Programme, or OGAP.<ref name="London, Macdonald 1970"/> This was the first joint rural development programme in Oxfam history and the first step to a new 'operational' Oxfam.  Oxfam India was established on 1 September 2008 under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 as a non-profitable organization with its head office in Delhi and is now a member of Oxfam International Confederation.

===Oxfam Ireland===
{{see also|Ireland as a tax haven}}
Oxfam Ireland is a registered charity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with headquarters in Dublin and Belfast. Funds are raised via shops, the government and donors. There are 51 shops throughout Ireland selling goods donated by the public. The Irish government allocated over €3.7m to Oxfam work in 2008–2009. Supporters donate regularly via direct debit or to special appeals. Oxfam Ireland is the public title of the two legal bodies registered in the respective jurisdictions as Oxfam Northern Ireland and Oxfam Republic of Ireland. Oxfam Ireland operates coherently on an all-island basis by means of a single management structure and shared membership of associations and councils.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Oxfam Novib is the Dutch affiliate of the international Oxfam organization. The organization is based in The Hague. Oxfam Novib was founded under the name Novib in 1956. Novib, an abbreviation standing for ''Nederlandse Organisatie Voor Internationale Bijstand'' (Dutch organization for international aid), was later changed to ''Nederlandse Organisatie voor Internationale Ontwikkelingssamenwerking'' (Dutch organization for international development cooperation) due to a change in the approach of the organization's development work.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1994, Novib became an affiliate of Oxfam and the organization changed its name in 2006 to Oxfam Novib.

==Criticism==
===Political neutrality===
In 2005, Oxfam Great Britain was criticised by other [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]] for becoming too close to [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|New Labour]] government in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Quarmby |first=Katharine |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200505300004 |title=Why Oxfam Is Failing Africa |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=30 May 2005}}</ref>

===Internal structures and political role===
[[File:Oxfam East Africa - An Oxfam cholera prevention float.jpg|thumb|An Oxfam cholera awareness-raising campaign in Mbandaka, [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].]]

In October 2005, the magazine ''[[New Internationalist]]'' described Oxfam as a "Big International Non-Government Organisation (BINGO)", having a corporate-style, undemocratic internal structure, and addressing the symptoms rather than the causes of international poverty – especially by acquiescing to [[neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] and even taking over roles conventionally filled by national governments.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://newint.org/features/2005/10/01/keynote/ | title = The Big Charity Bonanza | type = keynote | work = [[New Internationalist]] | date = 1 October 2005}}</ref> Similar criticism came from ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine in July 2005<ref>{{Citation | title = The New Scramble for Africa | journal = [[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]] |date=July 2005}}</ref> and Katherine Quarmby in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in May 2005.<ref>{{Citation | first = Katherine | last = Quarmby | title = How Oxfam is Failing Africa| url =https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/176/32064.html| work = [[New Statesman]]|date=30 May 2005}}</ref> The latter article detailed growing rifts between Oxfam and other organisations within the [[Make Poverty History]] movement.

In a 2011 ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' article, journalist Karen Rothmyer accused NGOs in general and Oxfam in particular of being unduly influenced by the priorities of the media, of providing inaccurate information to the press ("stories featuring aid projects often rely on dubious numbers provided by the organisations") and of perpetuating negative stereotypes which "have the potential to influence policy". She drew on earlier work by journalist Lauren Gelfand, who had taken a year away from journalism to work for Oxfam: "A lot of what Oxfam does is to sustain Oxfam"; and Linda Polman, author of the Crisis Caravan: "Aid organisations are businesses dressed up like Mother Theresa".<ref name="CJR">{{cite journal | url=https://www.cjr.org/reports/hiding_the_real_africa.php?page=all | title=Hiding the Real Africa; Why NGOs Prefer Bad News | author=Rothmyer, Karen | journal=Columbia Journalism Review | date=March–April 2011}}</ref>
In 2015, Omaar and de Waal, in ''Food and Power in Sudan'', commented, "the 1990s have seen growing pressure for humanitarian institutions to become more accountable. There has been a succession of reviews of major operations, growing in independence and criticism."<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Omaar | last2 = de Waal | title = Food and Power in the Sudan: A Critique of Humanitarianism |publisher=African Rights |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-899477-13-5}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> They quote an [[OECD]] report, "The Joint Evaluation of Emergency Operations in Rwanda", which stated that its team "came across examples of Agencies telling, if not falsehoods, then certainly half-truths" and noted "a remarkable lack of attempts by agencies to seek the views of beneficiaries on the assistance being provided".<ref>{{Citation | title = The Joint Evaluation of Emergency Operations in Rwanda | publisher = [[OECD]] | year = 1994}}</ref>

Oxfam and others launched the [[Sphere Project]] in response, an initiative which aims to "improve the quality of assistance provided to people affected by disasters", to "develop a set of minimum standards in core areas of humanitarian assistance" and to introduce an element of accountability which had previously been lacking.

===Conflict with Starbucks on Ethiopian coffee, 2006===
On 26 October 2006, Oxfam accused [[Starbucks]] of asking the [[National Coffee Association]] (NCA) to block a [[United States trademark law|US trademark]] application from [[Ethiopia]] for three of the country's coffee beans, [[Ethiopian Sidamo (coffee)|Sidamo]], [[Ethiopian Harar|Harar]] and [[Irgachefe|Yirgacheffe]].<ref name=BBCStarbucks>{{cite news | location = UK | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6086330.stm |date= 26 October 2006 |work= BBC News |title= Starbucks in Ethiopia coffee row |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> They claimed this could result in denying [[Coffee production in Ethiopia|Ethiopian coffee]] farmers potential annual earnings of up to [[pound sterling|£]]47m. Ethiopia and Oxfam America urged Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement with Ethiopia to help boost prices paid to farmers. At issue was Starbucks' use of Ethiopia's coffee brands—Sidamo, Yirgacheffe and Harar—that generate high margins for Starbucks and cost consumers a premium, yet generated very low prices to Ethiopian farmers.  Robert Nelson, the head of the NCA, added that his organization initiated the opposition for economic reasons, "For the U.S. industry to exist, we must have an economically stable coffee industry in the producing world&nbsp;... This particular scheme is going to hurt the Ethiopian coffee farmers economically." The NCA claimed the Ethiopian government was being badly advised and this move could price them out of the market.<ref name=BBCStarbucks />

Facing more than 90,000 letters of concern, [[Starbucks]] had placed pamphlets in its stores accusing Oxfam of "misleading behavior" and insisting that its "campaign need[s] to stop". On 7 November, ''[[The Economist]]'' derided Oxfam's "simplistic" stance and Ethiopia's "economically illiterate" government, arguing that Starbucks' (and [[Illy]]'s) standards-based approach would ultimately benefit farmers more.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/businessview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8129387 |title=Oxfam versus Starbucks: And this time, Oxfam may be wrong |newspaper=The Economist |date=7 November 2006 |accessdate=2 November 2009}} {{Subscription}}</ref> 
In June 2007, Ethiopian Government representatives and senior leaders from Starbucks Coffee Company worked out an agreement regarding distribution, marketing and licensing that recognized the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee designations without disclosing financial terms.  Starbucks was set to market Ethiopian coffee during two promotional periods in 2008. An Oxfam spokesman said the deal sounds like a "useful step" as long as farmers are benefiting, and a big step from a year prior when Starbucks "wasn't engaging directly (with) Ethiopians on adding value to their coffee".<ref name=bucks>{{Cite news |author=Craig Harris |title = Starbucks chairman, Ethiopia talk beans |publisher=Seattle PI |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Starbucks-chairman-Ethiopia-talk-beans-1257087.php |date = 28 November 2007 |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>

===Fair trade coffee===
On 28 April 2007 an Australian conservative [[think tank]], the [[Institute of Public Affairs]], lodged a complaint with the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] accusing Oxfam of misleading or deceptive conduct under the [[Trade Practices Act]] in its promotion of Fairtrade coffee.<ref>{{cite news | first=Caroline | last= Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington| title= Oxfam coffee 'harms' poor farmers |date= 28 April 2007 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/oxfam-coffee-harms-poor-farmers/story-e6frg6nf-1111113428712 | newspaper = The Australian | accessdate = 15 September 2010|publisher=News Limited}}</ref> They claimed that high certification costs and low wages for workers undermine claims that Fairtrade helps to lift producers out of poverty.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
In October 2009, Oxfam was accused by Israeli [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Regavim (NGO)|Regavim]] of aiding [[Palestinians]] in illegal activities in [[Kiryat Arba]], including [[water theft]]. Oxfam has denied its participation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/NGO-Oxfam-aids-illegal-Palestinian-deeds |title=NGO: Oxfam aids illegal Palestinian deeds |last1=Lazaroff |first1=Tovah |last2=Lappin |first2=Yaakov |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Oxfam UK has partnered{{When|date=October 2019}} with the Board of Deputies who represent the Jewish community of the UK. The project, Grow-Tatzmiach, includes sending 25 people to an activist training programme to help fight global hunger. In exchange for partnering, Oxfam has agreed not to "call for a boycott of Israeli goods or to support groups that do so, and will not partner with organizations that advocate violence or oppose a two-state solution to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]". Despite this agreement, there are still those on both sides who object to this project.<ref name="timesofisrael.com" />

In response to a 2012 Oxfam report which laid the blame for poor economic development in the [[Palestinian territories]] solely with Israel, a spokesman for the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israel embassy in the UK]] said, "Oxfam's latest report on the situation in the Palestinian territories puts a clearly political agenda above any humanitarian concern. Far from advancing peace, such an approach undermines the prospects of reaching a negotiated resolution to the conflict."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18693709|title=Israeli settlements 'jeopardising' Palestinian prosperity|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

On 17 January 2014 Oxfam UK cancelled an exhibition, "Gaza: Through my Eyes", which had been due to take place at [[East London Mosque]] after [[Left Foot Forward]] presented information to the charity detailing homophobic and potentially anti-semitic comments by one of the organizers, Ibrahim Hewitt.

In February 2015, Israeli NGO [[Regavim (NGO)|Regavim]] released a report stating that the European Union had illegally funded the construction of houses; Oxfam and other NGOs participated in the project. Oxfam defended the construction "on humanitarian grounds."

In March 2020, the ambassador of Israel in the United Kingdom, [[Mark Regev]], protested the selling of antisemitic books on Oxfam website, notably the [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]. After the protest, the Oxfam GB chief executive apologized and removed the books from sale.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/13/oxfam-removes-antisemitic-books-sale-israels-uk-ambassador-tweets/|title=Oxfam removes antisemitic books from sale after Israel's UK ambassador tweets condemnation|date=13 March 2020}}</ref>

===Confrontation with Population Matters===
In December 2009 Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam, attempted to discredit the [[PopOffsets]] initiative of [[Population Matters]] (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), under which individuals can [[Carbon offset|offset their carbon emissions]] by funding [[family planning]] services in the developing world. Green wrote in an op-ed in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that assumptions such as those in the OPT report equating [[human overpopulation|population growth and environmental degradation]] are a "gross oversimplification".<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Duncan Green |date=10 December 2009 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2009/12/climate-population-women | magazine = [[New Statesman]] | title =Blaming the victims: Does climate change require women in poor countries to stop 'popping them out'? |accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>

In response, OPT described the response of parts of the development lobby to the initiative as "frankly disgraceful", adding: "The world badly needs a grown-up, rational discussion of the population issue&nbsp;... without blame, abuse and hysteria."<ref>{{Cite press release|date=9 December 2009 |publisher=Optimum population |url=http://www.optimumpopulation.org/releases/opt.release17Dec09.htm |title=Development lobby "disgrace" on population |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709230836/http://www.optimumpopulation.org/releases/opt.release17Dec09.htm |archive-date=9 July 2010 }}</ref>

Network wrote a reply to an Oxfam study from January 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2015-01-19/richest-1-will-own-more-all-rest-2016|title=Richest 1% will own more than all the rest by 2016 – Oxfam International|publisher=Oxfam|date= 19 January 2015}}</ref> on inequality stating that the richest 1% at the end of 2016 will own more than half of the world's assets. However, Time pointed out that the data were based on a study from Credit Suisse. In this study, The Global Wealth Databook 2015, personal assets were calculated in [[net worth]], meaning wealth would be negated by having any mortgages.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://time.com/money/3675142/oxfam-richest-1-wealth-flawed/|title=Yes, Oxfam, the Richest 1% Have Most of the Wealth.

=== Staff sexual misconduct in Haiti and Chad  ===
In February 2018 an investigation by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A 2011 confidential report by Oxfam had found "a culture of impunity" among some staff in [[Haiti]] and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oxfam Haiti allegations: How the scandal unfolded|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43112200|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=BBC|date=21 February 2018|quote=Among the male staff accused of sexual misconduct is Oxfam's then-director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren.

Oxfam's chief executive at the time, [[Barbara Stocking|Dame Barbara Stocking]], offered Hauwermeiren "a phased and dignified exit" because sacking him risked "potentially serious implications" for the charity's work and reputation.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-oxfam-staff-paid-haiti-quake-survivors-for-sex-mhm6mpmgw|title=Minister orders Oxfam to hand over files on Haiti prostitute scandal|last=Chief&nbsp;Reporter|first=Sean O’Neill|date=9 February 2018|work=The Times|access-date=9 February 2018|language=en|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

Oxfam did not report any of the incidents to the Haitian authorities, because "it was extremely unlikely that any action would be taken".<ref name=":0" /> Although Oxfam disclosed details of the incident to the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]], the Commission revealed after ''The Times'' investigation that it had never received Oxfam's final investigation report and Oxfam "did not detail the precise allegations, nor did it make any indication of potential sexual crimes involving minors". A spokesperson for the Commission commented that: "We will expect the charity to provide us with the assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-43004360|title=Oxfam denies 'Haiti prostitute' cover-up|date=9 February 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=9 February 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> Oxfam later explained it had not given details to the Commission beyond "inappropriate sexual behaviour" because using prostitutes in Haiti was not illegal.<ref name=telegraph-20180704>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/07/03/oxfam-did-not-tell-regulator-use-prostitutes-haiti-not-illegal/ |title=Oxfam did not tell regulator about use of prostitutes in Haiti because it was not illegal, says Barbara Stocking |last=Hope |first=Christopher |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=4 July 2018 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>

In response to the revelations, [[Elizabeth Truss|Liz Truss]], the chief secretary to the Treasury, described the reports as "shocking, sickening and depressing". Oxfam issued a statement in which it asserted "Oxfam treats any allegation of misconduct extremely seriously. As soon as we became aware of a range of allegations – including of sexual misconduct – in Haiti in 2011 we launched an internal investigation. The investigation was announced publicly and staff members were suspended pending the outcome". The statement also added that the allegations "that under-age girls may have been involved were not proven".<ref name=":0" /> Speaking on the [[BBC|BBC's]] ''[[The Andrew Marr Show|Andrew Marr Show]]'', the [[Secretary of State for International Development|international development secretary]], [[Penny Mordaunt]], said Oxfam had failed in its "moral leadership" over the "scandal". Mordaunt also said that Oxfam did "absolutely the wrong thing" by not reporting the detail of the allegations to the government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43020875|title=Oxfam 'failed in moral leadership'|date=11 February 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=11 February 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> The incident led the International Development Committee of the UK Parliament to issue a report about sexual harassment and abuse in the humanitarian sector on 31 July 2018.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Oxfam had been aware that Van Hauwermeiren while director of Oxfam's relief operation in [[Chad]] in 2006 and other staff had repeatedly used prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/10/oxfam-faces-allegations-staff-paid-prostitutes-in-chad|work=[[The Observer]]|title=Oxfam: fresh claims that staff used prostitutes in Chad|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Ben|last2=Quinn|date=11 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43027631|work=BBC News|title=Oxfam: Deputy resigns over sex claims amid crisis talks|date=12 February 2018}}</ref> Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that "(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon".<ref name=BBC/> New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.<ref>Smout, Alistair.
