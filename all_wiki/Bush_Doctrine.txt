The '''Bush Doctrine''' refers to multiple interrelated [[foreign policy]] principles of the 43rd [[President of the United States]], [[George W. Bush]]. These principles include [[unilateralism]] and the use of [[preemptive war]].

[[Charles Krauthammer]] first used the phrase in June 2001 to describe the Bush Administration's "unilaterally withdrawing from the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|ABM treaty]] and rejecting the [[Kyoto protocol]]."<ref name="krauthammer2008">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html  |title=Charlie Gibson's Gaffe |first=Charles |last=Krauthammer |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 13, 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-31}} According to Charles Krauthammer, who was the first to use it in June 2001, the phrase has had four distinct meanings, each one succeeding another over the eight years of the George W. Bush presidency:  firstly, unilateralism, i.e., unilaterally withdrawing from the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] and rejecting the [[Kyoto Protocol]]; secondly, after 9-11-2001, the "with us or against us" policy on terror; thirdly, a doctrine of pre-emptive war, e.g., Iraq; and fourthly, the idea that the fundamental mission of American foreign policy is to spread democracy throughout the world.</ref> After the [[9/11]] attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States had the right to secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 [[Operation Enduring Freedom|war in Afghanistan]].<ref name="krauthammer2008"/><ref name=NYT_Weisman_20020413>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/editorial-observer-president-bush-and-the-middle-east-axis-of-ambiguity.html |title=Editorial Observer; President Bush and the Middle East Axis of Ambiguity |first=Steven R. |last=Weisman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 13, 2002}}</ref> The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq in 2003]].<ref>{{cite news |title=War policy undone by real war; After Iraq, the 'Bush doctrine' has lost its appeal |last=Polman |first=Dick |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=May 23, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Why the Bush Doctrine is dead |last=White |first=Hugh |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=October 3, 2003}}</ref><ref name="OldWorldOrder">{{cite news|title=Old World Order |last=Traub |first=James |work=The New York Times |date=November 12, 2006}}</ref>

Different pundits have attributed different meanings to the Bush Doctrine. It was used to describe specific policy elements, including a strategy of "preemptive strikes" as a defense against an immediate or perceived future threat to the security of the United States. This policy principle was applied particularly in the [[Middle East]] to counter international terrorist organizations and to justify the invasion of Iraq.

Generally, the Bush Doctrine was used to indicate a willingness to [[unilaterally]] pursue U.S. military interests.<ref name=Time_Allen_20070502>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1616724,00.html |title=Edwards Rejects the 'War on Terror' |first=Mike |last=Allen |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=May 2, 2007}}</ref><ref name=NationalReview_Levin_20060816>{{cite journal |url=http://levin.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzQyNjBmZjA2M2IzMDgzYjI1MWJiNTNjZmFjY2M5YzI= |title=...and another thing: First Things First |first=Mark |last=Levin |author-link=Mark Levin |journal=National Review |date=August 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004112734/http://levin.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzQyNjBmZjA2M2IzMDgzYjI1MWJiNTNjZmFjY2M5YzI%3D |archive-date=October 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=USAtoday_Page_20030317>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/educate/iraq/war7-article.htm |title=Confronting Iraq |first=Susan |last=Page |work=USA Today Education |date=March 17, 2003}}</ref> Some of these policies were codified in a [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] text entitled the ''National Security Strategy of the United States'' published on September 20, 2002.<ref name=NSS_September2002>{{cite book|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2002/index.html |title=The National Security Strategy of the United States |author=National Security Council |publisher=The White House|date=September 2002 |author-link=United States National Security Council}}</ref>

The phrase "Bush Doctrine" was rarely used by members of the Bush administration. The expression was used at least once, though, by Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], in a June 2003 speech in which he said, "If there is anyone in the world today who doubts the seriousness of the Bush Doctrine, I would urge that person to consider the fate of the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan, and of [[Saddam Hussein's Iraq|Saddam Hussein's regime]] in Iraq."<ref name="Cheney use of term">[http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=28921 Vice President Tells West Point Cadets "Bush Doctrine" Is Serious], ''American Forces Press Service'', June 2, 2003</ref>

The main elements of the Bush Doctrine were delineated in a document, the ''[[National Security Strategy of the United States]]'', published on September 17, 2002.<ref>[http://fs6.depauw.edu:50080/~jeremyanderson/teach/213_2002nssIntro.pdf Introduction - The National Security Strategy 2002]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}, PDF</ref> This document is often cited as the definitive statement of the doctrine.<ref name=NYT_Opinion_20030413>{{cite news |last=[[Editorial|Opinion]] |title=Aftermath; The Bush Doctrine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/opinion/aftermath-the-bush-doctrine-237710.html?sq=%22bush+doctrine%22&scp=4&st=cse |work=The New York Times |date=April 13, 2003| accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref><ref name=NYT_Opinion_20020922>{{cite news |last=Opinion |title=The Bush Doctrine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/the-bush-doctrine-998672.html?sq=bush+doctrine&scp=9&st=cse |work=The New York Times |date=September 22, 2002| accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref><ref name=MotherJones_Gitlin_200301>{{cite journal|last=Gitlin |first=Todd |journal=Mother Jones |title=America's Age of Empire: The Bush Doctrine |url=https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/columns/2003/01/ma_205_01.html |date=January–February 2003 |accessdate=2008-09-12}}</ref> It was updated in 2006<ref name=NSS_March2006>{{cite book|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2006/print/index.html |title=The National Security Strategy of the United States |author=National Security Council |publisher=The White House|date=March 2006 |author-link= United States National Security Council}}</ref> and is stated as follows:<ref name=NSS_March2006_sectionV>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nss/2006/print/sectionV.html|chapter=Summary of National Security Strategy 2002|title=The National Security Strategy of the United States|author=National Security Council|publisher=The White House|date=March 2006}}</ref>

{{quote|The security environment confronting the United States today is radically different from what we have faced before. Yet the first duty of the United States Government remains what it always has been: to protect the American people and American interests. It is an enduring American principle that this duty obligates the government to anticipate and counter threats, using all elements of national power, before the threats can do grave damage. The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction – and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. There are few greater threats than a terrorist attack with WMD.

To forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, act preemptively in exercising our inherent right of self-defense. The United States will not resort to force in all cases to preempt emerging threats. Our preference is that nonmilitary actions succeed. And no country should ever use preemption as a pretext for aggression.}}

Out of the ''National Security Strategy'', four main points are highlighted as the core to the Bush Doctrine: 1.) Preemption, 2.) Military Primacy, 3.) New Multilateralism, and 4.) the Spread of Democracy.<ref name="USForeignPolicyAgenda_Lieber-Lieber_200212">{{cite journal|author=Lieber, Keir A. and Robert J.

We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few," and required "defending the United States, the American people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders."<ref name=ChicagoTribune>{{cite news|work=Chicago Tribune|title=The Bush Doctrine|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-bush-doctrinesep12,0,6804685.story|author=Tribune Staff|date=September 12, 2008|access-date=September 12, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915013217/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-bush-doctrinesep12,0,6804685.story|archive-date=September 15, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] remarked thus in 2006, in a statement taken to reflect his view of the Doctrine's efficacy: "If I were rating, I would say we probably deserve a D or D+ as a country as how well we're doing in the battle of ideas that's taking place. I'm not going to suggest that it's easy, but we have not found the formula as a country."<ref name="infowaridea"/>

In his 2010 memoir ''[[Decision Points]]'', President Bush articulates his discrete concept of the Bush Doctrine. He stated that his doctrine consisted of four "prongs," three of them practical, and one idealistic. They are the following: (In his words)
# "Make no distinction between terrorists and the nations that harbor them — and hold both to account."
# "Take the fight to the enemy overseas before they can attack us again here at home."
# "Confront threats before they fully materialize."
# "Advance liberty and hope as an alternative to the enemy's ideology of repression and fear."

===Unilateralism===
Unilateral elements were evident early in Bush's presidency. Conservative [[Charles Krauthammer]], who coined the term "Bush Doctrine," deployed "unilateralism," in February 2001 to refer to Bush's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding his decision to [[Abm treaty#US withdrawal|withdraw from the ABM treaty]].<ref name=CNN_Krauthammer_20010305>{{cite news | last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |title=The Bush doctrine: In American foreign policy, a new motto: Don't ask.

There is some evidence that Bush's willingness for the US to act unilaterally came even earlier. The ''International Journal of Peace Studies'' 2003 article "The Bush administration's image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity" states:<ref name="eubushadm">{{cite journal |url=http://www.gmu.edu/academic/ijps/vol8_1/David%20and%20Ramel.htm |title=The Bush Administrations's Image of Europe: From Ambivalence to Rigidity|journal=International Journal of Peace Studies|volume=8 |issue=1 |first=Charles-Philippe |last=David |author2=Frédéric Ramel |date=Spring–Summer 2003 |accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref>

{{quote|The [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican Party]]'s platform in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential elections]] set the administration's tone on this issue. It called for a dramatic expansion of [[NATO]] not only in [[Eastern Europe]] (with the [[Baltic States]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Albania]]) but also, and most significantly, in the [[Middle East]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]]. The purpose is to develop closer cooperation within NATO in dealing with geopolitical problems from the Middle East to [[Eurasia]]. The program therefore takes a broad and rather fuzzy view of Europe.

It would be premature at this stage to say that the Bush administration has had a fundamental change of heart and shed its long-ingrained reflexes in dealing with [[Russia]].

When it comes to the future of Europe, both Americans and Europeans differ on key issues. Those differences seem to point toward three fundamental values which underpin the Bush administration's image of Europe. The first is [[unilateralism]], of which the [[missile shield]] is a particularly telling example. The American position flies in the face of the European approach, which is based on [[ABM treaty|ABM talks]] and [[multilateralism]]. An opposition is taking shape here between the leading European capitals, which want to deal with the matter by judicial means, and the Americans, who want to push ahead and create a [[fait accompli]].}}

The doctrine was developed more fully as an executive branch response following the [[September 11 attacks]].

The stance of the Bush administration was that the harsh measures to spread the democracy worldwide are inevitable and efficacious, in which for instance, liberating Iraq will plant democracy in the area and enable it to flourish in the rest of the Middle East.<ref>Jervis, Robert (Fall, 2003). "Understanding the Bush Doctrine". The Academy of Political Science, ''Political Science Quarterly''</ref>

Two distinct schools of thought arose in the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] regarding how to handle countries such as [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], and [[North Korea]] (the so-called "[[axis of evil|Axis of Evil]]"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/bush.speech.txt/ |publisher=CNN |title=Bush State of the Union address |date=January 29, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> states). [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], as well as [[U.S. Department of State]] specialists, argued for what was essentially the continuation of existing U.S. foreign policy. These policies, developed after the [[Cold War]], sought to establish a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] consensus for action (which would likely take the form of increasingly harsh sanctions against the problem states, summarized as the [[policy of containment]]). The opposing view, argued by Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and a number of influential [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] policy makers like [[Paul Wolfowitz]] and [[Richard Perle]], held that direct and unilateral action was both possible and justified and that America should embrace the opportunities for democracy and security offered by its position as sole remaining superpower.

===Democratic regime change===
In several speeches between late 2001 and 2002, Bush expanded on his view of the US foreign policy and global intervention, declaring that the US should actively support [[democracy|democratic]] governments around the world, especially in the [[Middle East]], as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the nation had to act unilaterally in its own security interests, without approval of international bodies like the [[United Nations]].<ref name=Time_Allen_20070502/><ref name="NationalReview_Levin_20060816" /><ref name="USAtoday_Page_20030317" /> This represented a departure from the [[Cold War]] policies of [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]] and [[containment]] under the [[Truman Doctrine]] and post–Cold War philosophies such as the [[Powell Doctrine]] and the [[Clinton Doctrine]].

In his 2003 [[State of the Union Address]], Bush declared:<ref name="union28jan03">{{cite news |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/01/print/20030128-19.html |title=President Delivers "State of the Union"  |publisher=[[The White House]] |first=George W. |last=Bush |author-link=George W.

After his second inauguration, in a January 2006 speech at [[National Defense University]], Bush said: "The defense of freedom requires the advance of freedom."

[[Neoconservative]]s and the Bush Doctrine held that the hatred for the West and the United States particularly exists not because of actions perpetrated by the US, but rather because the countries from which terrorists emerge are in social disarray and do not experience the freedom that is an intrinsic part of democracy.<ref name="kaufmandef"/><ref name="infowaridea"/> The Bush Doctrine holds that enemies of the US use terrorism as a war of ideology against the nation.

Neoconservatives are widely known to long have supported the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]] in Iraq, and on January 26, 1998, the [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) sent a public letter to then-President Bill Clinton stating:

{{quote|As a result, in the not-too-distant future we will be unable to determine with any reasonable level of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons. Such uncertainty will, by itself, have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East. It hardly needs to be added that if Saddam does acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction, as he is almost certain to do if we continue along the present course, the safety of American troops in the region, of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states, and a significant portion of the world's supply of oil will all be put at hazard. As you have rightly declared, Mr. President, the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how we handle this threat.}}

Among the signatories to PNAC's original statement of Principals is George H. W. Bush's Vice President [[Dan Quayle]], George W. Bush's defense secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]], his deputy defense secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]], his Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], and his brother [[Jeb Bush]].<ref name="PNACSOP" />

PNAC member and the chairman of the [[Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee]] (DPBAC), Neoconservative [[Richard Perle]], later expressed [[Richard Perle#Iraq policy regret and Bush criticism|regret over the Iraq invasion]] and ultimately put the blame for the invasion on President George W. Bush.<ref name="neostab">{{cite news |title=Neocons turn on Bush for incompetence over Iraq war |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1939471,00.html |work=The Guardian | first=Julian |last=Borger |date=November 4, 2006 |location=London}}</ref>

Other Bush cabinet members who are thought to have adopted neoconservative foreign policy thinking include Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]].<ref name="neoconverg" />

The Bush Doctrine, in line with long-standing neoconservative ideas, held that the United States is entangled in a global war of ideas between the western values of freedom on the one hand, and extremism seeking to destroy them on the other; a war of ideology where the United States must take responsibility for security and show leadership in the world by actively seeking out the enemies and also change those countries who are supporting enemies.<ref name="kaufmandef" /><ref name="infowaridea" /><ref name="winwter" /><ref name="podhoretzpraise">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ourjerusalem.com/opinion/story/opinion20020904a.html |title=In Praise of the Bush Doctrine |first=Norman |last=Podhoretz |author-link=Norman Podhoretz |journal=Our Jerusalem |date=September 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926001712/http://www.ourjerusalem.com/opinion/story/opinion20020904a.html |archive-date=2008-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Bush Doctrine, and neoconservative reasoning, held that containment of the enemy as under the Realpolitik of Reagan did not work, and that the enemy of United States must be destroyed pre-emptively before they attack—using all the United States' available means, resources and influences to do so.<ref name="kaufmandef" /><ref name="infowaridea" /><ref name="winwter" />

On the book ''Winning the War on Terror'' Dr. James Forest, U.S. Military Academy Combating Terrorism Center at [[West Point]], comments: "While the West faces uncertainties in the struggle against [[militant Islam]]'s armies of darkness, and while it is true that we do not yet know precisely how it will end, what has become abundantly clear is that the world will succeed in defeating militant Islam because of the West's flexible, democratic institutions and its all-encompassing ideology of freedom."<ref name="winwter" />

===Natan Sharansky===
{{Further|Democratic peace theory}}
Another part of the intellectual underpinning of the Bush Doctrine was the 2004 book ''[[The Case for Democracy]]'', written by [[Israeli people|Israeli]] politician and author [[Natan Sharansky]] and Israeli Minister of Economic Affairs in the United States [[Ron Dermer]], which Bush has cited as influential in his thinking.<ref name=Time_Dickerson_20050110>{{cite journal|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/01/10/bush.readinglist.tm/ |title=What the president reads |first=John F. |last=Dickerson |journal=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=January 10, 2005}}</ref> The book argues that replacing dictatorships with democratic governments is both morally justified, since it leads to greater freedom for the citizens of such countries, and strategically wise, since democratic countries are more peaceful, and breed less terrorism than dictatorial ones.

===Expanding United States influence===
[[Princeton University]] research fellow Dr. Jonathan Monten, in his 2005 ''[[International Security]]'' journal article "The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy",<ref name="ispowerstruggle">{{cite journal |title=The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy |journal=[[International Security]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |first=Jonathan |last=Monten |pages=112–156 |date=Spring 2005|doi=10.1162/isec.2005.29.4.112 |s2cid=57570914 }}</ref> attributed the Bush administration's activist democracy promotion to two main factors: the expansion of material capabilities, and the presence of a nationalist domestic ideology. He claims that the Bush Doctrine promotion of democracy abroad was held as vital by the Bush administration to the success of the United States in the "[[war on terror]]". It was also a key objective of the administration's [[grand strategy]] of expanding the political and economic influence of the United States internationally. He examines two contending approaches to the long-term promotion of democracy: "''exemplarism,''" or leadership by example, and "''vindicationism,''" or the direct application of United States power, including the use of coercive force. Whereas exemplarism largely prevailed in the 20th century, vindicationism has been the preferred approach of the Bush administration.

Feaver, who worked on the Bush national security strategy as a staff member on the National Security Council, said he has counted as many as seven distinct Bush doctrines. One of the drafters of the National Security Strategy of the United States, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as the "Bush Doctrine," demurred at investing the statement with too much weight. "I actually never thought there was a Bush doctrine," said [[Philip D. Zelikow]], who later served as State Department counselor under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. "Indeed, I believe the assertion that there is such a doctrine lends greater coherence to the administration's policies than they deserve."

Anti-war critics have claimed that the Bush Doctrine was strongly polarizing domestically, had estranged allies of the United States,<ref name="makingsense"/> and belied Bush's stated desire to be a "uniter, not a divider".<ref name="polarizer">{{cite journal |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/02/bush_insists_us_is_stronger_si.html |title=Bush Insists U.S. Is Stronger Since He Took Office |journal=[[Roll Call]] |first=Mort |last=Kondracke |author-link=Mort Kondracke |date=February 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref>

===Compassionate belief and religious influence===
Bush often talked about his belief in [[compassionate conservatism]]<ref name="idecompassionate">{{cite book |title=George W. Bush : Portrait of a Compassionate Conservative |first=Arthur Frederick |last=Ide |publisher=Monument Press |date=November 1, 2000 |isbn=978-0-930383-50-3 |oclc=44803063}}</ref><ref name="weisberg">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2008/09/12/BL2008091201471.html?hpid=opinionsbox1|work=The Washington Post|title=What Is the Bush Doctrine, Anyway? |first=Dan |last=Froomkin|date=September 12, 2008}}</ref> and liberty as "God's gift".<ref name="union28jan03"/> In his [[Claremont Institute]] article ''Democracy and the Bush Doctrine'',<ref name="kesler">{{cite journal |url=http://www.claremont.org/article/democracy-and-the-bush-doctrine/ |title=Democracy and the Bush Doctrine |first=Charles R. |last=Kesler |author-link=Charles R. Kesler |publisher=[[Claremont Institute]] |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> [[Charles R. Kesler]] wrote, "As he begins his second term, the president and his advisors must take a hard, second look at the Bush Doctrine. In many respects, it is the export version of compassionate conservatism."

===Sociopsychological strategy and effects===
There is also criticism on Bush Doctrine practices related to their [[social psychology|sociopsychological]] effects saying they create a [[culture of fear]].<ref name="terrorinvite">{{cite book |title=Invitation to Terror: The Expanding Empire of the Unknown |first=Frank |last=Furedi |author-link=Frank Furedi |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |date=October 30, 2007|isbn=978-0-8264-9957-8 |oclc=156830963}}</ref><ref name="fearculture">{{cite book |title=Politics of Fear: Beyond Left and Right |first=Frank |last=Furedi |author-link=Frank Furedi |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |date=October 6, 2005|isbn=978-0-8264-8728-5 |oclc=238727258}}</ref><ref name="shockdoctrine">{{cite book |title=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism |first=Naomi |last=Klein |author-link=Naomi Klein |date=June 24, 2008 |isbn=978-0-312-42799-3 |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]] |oclc=182737600 |url=https://archive.org/details/shockdoctriner00unse }}</ref><ref name="fearpolitics">{{cite journal |url=http://nplusonemag.com/politics-fear-part-i-whatever-happened-war-terror |title=The Politics of Fear, Part 1 |first=Alex |last=Gourevitch |journal=[[n+1]] |issue=6 |date=December 2, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731072734/http://nplusonemag.com/politics-fear-part-i-whatever-happened-war-terror |archive-date=July 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[Naomi Klein]] wrote in her book ''[[The Shock Doctrine]]'' about a recurrent metaphor of shock, and she claimed in an interview that the Bush administration continued to exploit a "window of opportunity that opens up in a state of shock", followed by a comforting rationale for the public, as a form of [[social control]].<ref name="naomiinterview">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSP37XQd0Zs|title=The Shock Doctrine: Naomi Klein on C-SPAN |date=October 8, 2007|publisher=[[C-SPAN]] |work=[[After Words]]|first=Naomi |last=Klein |author-link=Naomi Klein |author2=Franklin Foer |accessdate=2008-09-15|author2-link=Franklin Foer }}</ref>

===Democratization===
Some commentators argue that the Bush Doctrine has not aimed to support genuine democratic regimes driven by local peoples, but rather US-friendly regimes installed by diplomats acting on behalf of the United States, and intended only to seem democratic to U.S. voters.<ref name="Kolhatkar-Ingalls2007">{{cite book|last=Kolhatkar|first=S. |author2=J. Ingalls|year=2007 |title=Bleeding Afghanistan: Washington, Warlords and the Propaganda of Silence|isbn=978-1-58322-731-2}}</ref> For example, in the case of Afghanistan, it is argued that parliamentary democracy was downplayed by the US and power concentrated in the hands of the Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]], a US ally.<ref name=Kolhatkar2007_Ch4>{{harvnb|Kolhatkar & Ingalls|2007|chapter=Chapter 4: A Client "Democracy", pp. 117–166}}</ref> The election of Karzai has been described as the result of manipulation on the parts of the US government and US policy maker [[Zalmay Khalilzad]]. At the same time, these commentators draw attention to the number of unpopular (but US-friendly) warlords achieving "legitimating" positions under US supervision of the elections. Some commentators interpreted voter turnout figures as evidence of "large-scale fraud".<ref name=NYT_Krugman_20041001>{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul |title=America's lost respect |work=The New York Times |date=October 1, 2004}}</ref> Sonali Kolhatkar and James Ingalls have written, "It remains to be seen if U.S. policy makers will ever allow anything approaching democracy to break out in Afghanistan and interfere with their plans."<ref name=Kolhatkar2007_p166>{{harvnb|Kolhatkar & Ingalls|2007|p=166}}</ref>

Of the elections in Afghanistan, [[Sima Samar]], former Afghan Minister for Women's Affairs, stated, "This is not a democracy, it is a rubber stamp. Everything has already been decided by the powerful ones."<ref name="BBC-2002-12">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2039665.stm |title=Tempers Flare At Loya Jirga |publisher=BBC News online |date=June 12, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

Most studies of [[List of United States military history events|American intervention]] have been pessimistic about the history of the United States exporting democracy. John A. Tures examined 228 cases of American intervention from 1973 to 2005, using [[Freedom House]] data.<ref name="tures">{{cite journal|first=John A.|last=Tures|year=2005|title=Operation Exporting Freedom: The Quest for Democratization via United States Military Operations|journal=The Whitehead Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations|issue=Winter/Spring|pages=97–111|url=http://blogs.shu.edu/projects/diplomacy/archives/09_tures.pdf|access-date=2010-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630200643/http://blogs.shu.edu/projects/diplomacy/archives/09_tures.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-30|url-status=dead}}.</ref> While in 63 cases a country did became more democratic, in 69 instances the country became ''less'' democratic - and the plurality of interventions, 96, caused no change in the country's democracy.<ref name="tures" />
