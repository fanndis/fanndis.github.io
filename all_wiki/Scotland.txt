The [[Kingdom of Scotland]] emerged as an independent [[sovereign state]] in the [[European History|European]] [[Early Middle Ages]] and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, [[James VI of Scotland]] became king of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], thus forming a [[personal union]] of the [[Union of the Crowns|three kingdoms]]. Scotland subsequently entered into a [[political union]] with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref name=Keay/><ref name=Mackie/> The union also created the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], which succeeded both the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (in 1922, the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|officially renamed]] the United Kingdom of Great Britain and [[Northern Ireland]] in 1927).<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament and Ireland|publisher=The Houses of Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/legislativescrutiny/parliamentandireland/|location=London |access-date=26 December 2016}}</ref>

Within Scotland, the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The [[Scots law|legal system within Scotland]] has also remained separate from [[English law|those of England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]]; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law.<ref>Collier, J.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of Scotland}}

"Scotland" comes from ''[[Scoti]]'', the Latin name for the [[Gaels]]. [[Philip Freeman]] has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an [[Indo-European root]], *''skot'', citing the parallel in Greek ''skotos'' (σκότος), meaning "darkness, gloom".<ref>P. Freeman, ''Ireland and the Classical World'', Austin, 2001, pp. [https://books.google.be/books?id=ZSHhfOM-5AEC&pg=PA93 93].</ref> The [[Late Latin]] word ''[[Scotia]]'' ("land of the Gaels") was initially used to refer to Ireland,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RlF7sq48n4C&pg=PA16 |title=The History Of Ireland|access-date=17 September 2014|isbn=9781113155177|last1=Gwynn|first1=Stephen|date=July 2009}}</ref> and likewise in early [[Old English language|Old English]] ''Scotland'' was used for Ireland.<ref>Lemke, Andreas: [https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-86395-189-4/GSEP8_lemke.pdf?sequence=1 The Old English Translation of Bede’s ''Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum'' in its Historical and Cultural Context], Chapter II: The ''OEHE'': The Material Evidence; page 71 (Universitätsdrucke Göttingen, 2015)</ref> By the 11th century at the latest, ''Scotia'' was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the [[River Forth]], alongside ''Albania'' or ''Albany'', both derived from the Gaelic ''[[Alba]]''.<ref name="Brewer">{{cite book | last = Ayto | first = John |author2=Ian Crofton | title = Brewer's Britain & Ireland: The History, Culture, Folklore and Etymology of 7500 Places in These Islands | publisher=WN | isbn = 978-0-304-35385-9 | year = 2005 }}</ref> The use of the words ''Scots'' and ''Scotland'' to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]].<ref name=Keay/>

== Prehistory ==
{{Main|Prehistoric Scotland}}
{{see also|Timeline of prehistoric Scotland}}Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the [[Mesolithic period]]. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the [[Last glacial period|last glaciation]].<ref>The earliest known evidence is a flint arrowhead from [[Islay]]. See Moffat, Alistair (2005) ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History''. London. Thames & Hudson. Page 42.</ref> At the time, Scotland was covered in forests, had more bog-land, and the main form of transport was by water.<ref name="Forsyth" />{{rp|9}} These settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of [[Skara Brae]] on the mainland of [[Orkney]] dates from this period. [[Neolithic]] habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Francis|title=Britain BC|publisher=HarperPerennial|year=2003|isbn=978-0-00-712693-4|location=London|pages=98–104 & 246–250|author-link=Francis Pryor}}</ref> Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the [[Callanish Stones]] on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] and the [[Maes Howe]] on Orkney, which were built in the third millennium BC.<ref name="short" />{{rp|38}}

[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|The exposed interior of a house at [[Skara Brae]]]]
The first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor [[Pytheas]], who called the northern tip of Britain "Orcas", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.<ref name="Forsyth" />{{rp|10}} During the first millennium BC, the society changed dramatically to a chiefdom model, as consolidation of settlement led to the concentration of wealth and underground stores of surplus food.<ref name="Forsyth" />{{rp|11}}

The [[Antonine Wall]] was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor [[Antoninus Pius]] ({{Reign|138|161}}), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the [[Firth of Clyde]] and the [[Firth of Forth]]. The successful [[Roman invasion of Caledonia 208–210]] was undertaken by emperors of the imperial [[Severan dynasty]] in response to the breaking of treaty by the Caledonians in 197,<ref name=":4" /> but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by the death of the senior emperor [[Septimius Severus]] ({{Reign|193|211}}) while on campaign at [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), and the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210–211.<ref name=":4" /> Forts erected by [[Roman army]] of the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the [[glens]] in the Highlands.<ref name=":4" />

To the Roman historians [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]], the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the area north of the [[River Forth]] was called [[Caledonia]].<ref name=":4" /> According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the [[Caledonians]] and the [[Maeatae]].<ref name=":4" /> Other ancient authors used the adjective "Caledonian" to pertain to anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooden hills ({{Lang-la|saltus}}) which the 2nd-century AD Roman philosopher [[Ptolemy]], in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']], described as being south-west of the [[Beauly Firth]].<ref name=":4" /> The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of [[Dunkeld]], [[Rohallion]], and [[Schiehallion]].<ref name=":4" />

The [[Great Conspiracy]] against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, in which the [[Scoti]] participated, was defeated by the [[Comes Theodosius|''comes'' Theodosius]]. The formation of a new province, called [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]] after the reigning emperor [[Valens]] ({{Reign|364|378}}), which may have been in Scotland, resulted.<ref name=":8" /> Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] and the immigration of the [[Saxons]] to southern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.<ref name=":8" />

With trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with [[Colonial America]].

The deposed [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Stuart]] claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-[[Presbyterian]]s, including Roman Catholics and [[Episcopalian Protestants]]. However, two major Jacobite risings launched in [[Jacobite rising of 1715|1715]] and [[Jacobite rising of 1745|1745]] failed to remove the [[House of Hanover]] from the British throne.

After prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|General Assembly]] and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr [[Thomas Chalmers]], known as the Great [[Disruption of 1843]]. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]].<ref name=Robb1990>G.

Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.<ref name=Devine2001p91-100>T.

Scotland played a major role in the [[History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|British effort]] in the [[First World War]]. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.<ref>Richard J. Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914–2000'' (2006), pp 1–33</ref> With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.<ref>R. A. Houston and W. W. J. Knox, eds. ''The New Penguin History of Scotland'' (2001) p 426.[https://books.google.com/books?id=VI5nAAAAMAAJ&q=casualties] [[Niall Ferguson]] points out in "The Pity of War" that the proportion of enlisted Scots who died was third highest in the war behind Serbia and Turkey and a much higher proportion than in other parts of the UK.[https://books.google.com/books?ei=AJtPTtinKseKhQfUufnzBg&ct=result&id=QrYhAQAAIAAJ&dq=niall+ferguson&q=enlisted] [http://news.scotsman.com/worldwarone/39Savage-Scots39-wish-you-weren39t.6487746.jp]</ref> [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Douglas Haig|Sir Douglas Haig]] was Britain's commander on the Western Front.

The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "[[Red Clydeside]]" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] stronghold, the industrial districts switched to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] by 1922, with a base among the [[Irish Catholic]] working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)</ref>

The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead, a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment.<ref>Finlay, ''Modern Scotland 1914–2000'' (2006), pp 34–72</ref> Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the [[Second World War]].<ref>Richard J. Finlay, "National identity in Crisis: Politicians, Intellectuals and the 'End of Scotland', 1920–1939", ''History'', June 1994, Vol. 79 Issue 256, pp 242–59</ref>

Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when [[Rudolf Hess]] flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the [[Duke of Hamilton]].<ref>J. Leasor ''Rudolf Hess: The Uninvited Envoy'' (Kelly Bray: House of Stratus, 2001), {{ISBN|0-7551-0041-7}}, p. 15.</ref> Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, [[Karlheinz Pintsch]], a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British.

Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.<ref name=Buchanan2003p51/> Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25% and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition.

=== Geology and geomorphology ===

{{Main|Geology of Scotland}}[[File:South over the Quiraing, Isle of Skye - 2.jpg|thumb|Looking South over the [[Quiraing]] on the [[Isle of Skye]]|alt=]]The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.

The [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].

[[File:The Cuillins on a still morning (9878281443).jpg|thumb|The [[Scottish Highlands]], located in the north west of Scotland|alt=|left]]

A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.

The [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.

The [[Southern Uplands]] are a range of hills almost {{convert|200|km|mi|0}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |title=Southern Uplands |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date=16 November 1990 |access-date=11 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128062644/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |archive-date=28 November 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |title=Education Scotland – Standard Grade Bitesize Revision – Ask a Teacher – Geography – Physical – Question From PN |publisher=BBC |access-date=11 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="Scotland Today » ITKT">{{cite web|url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |title=Scotland Today " ITKT |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com |date=28 December 2006 |access-date=11 June 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archive-date = 6 January 2007}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400–500&nbsp;million years ago.

The head of state of the United Kingdom is the monarch, currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (since 1952). The monarchy of the United Kingdom continues to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal coat of arms]] used in Scotland together with its associated [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]], royal titles including that of [[Duke of Rothesay]], certain [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]], the [[chivalric order|chivalric]] [[Order of the Thistle]] and, since 1999, reinstating a ceremonial role for the [[Crown of Scotland]] after a 292-year hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.scot/newsandmediacentre/100237.aspx|publisher=Scottish Parliament|title=Opening of Parliament: Procession of the Crown of Scotland|access-date=9 July 2016}}</ref> Elizabeth II's [[regnal number]]ing caused [[List of titles and honours of Elizabeth II#Royal titles and styles|controversy]] in 1953 because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland.

Scotland has limited [[self-government]] within the United Kingdom, as well as representation in the British Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] in Edinburgh since 1999.

The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the British Parliament by passing a [[Legislative Consent Motion]] if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the UK. For instance, university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.<ref>BBC Scotland News Online "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4845260.stm Scotland begins pub smoking ban]", ''BBC Scotland News'', 26 March 2006.

The relationships between the central government of the UK and devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are based on the extra-statutory principles and agreements with the main elements being set out in a ''Memorandum of Understanding'' between the British government and the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The MOU lays emphasis on the principles of good communication, consultation and co-operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/devolution-of-powers-to-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland |title=Devolution of powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland |publisher=GOV.UK |access-date=1 August 2018}}</ref>

Since devolution in 1999, Scotland has devolved stronger working relations across the two other devolved governments, the [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various events such as the British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that are devolved to each government.<ref name="gov.scot">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/topics/archive/About-Archive/11556 |title=Scottish/UK relations |publisher=Gov.scot |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802011321/https://www.gov.scot/topics/archive/About-Archive/11556 |archive-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Scotland, along with the Welsh Government, British Government as well as the Northern Ireland executive, participate in the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which allows each government to discuss policy issues together and work together across each government to find solutions. The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the British Government and the other devolved administrations.<ref name="gov.scot"/>

In the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union in 2016, the Scottish Government has called for there to be a joint approach from each of the devolved governments. In early 2017, the devolved governments met to discuss Brexit and agree on Brexit strategies from each devolved government<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38670128 |title=Devolved administrations hold 'difficult' Brexit talks |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2017 |access-date=1 August 2018}}</ref> which lead for [[Theresa May]] to issue a statement that claims that the devolved governments will not have a central role or decision making process in the Brexit process, but that the central government plans to "fully engage" Scotland in talks alongside the governments of Wales and Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-devolved-government-scotland-northern-ireland-wales-eu-negotiation-talks-article-50-a7552421.html |title=Devolved governments won't get decisive role in Brexit talks Theresa May confirms |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 January 2017 |access-date=1 August 2018}}</ref>

The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports [[Scottish independence]], was first elected to form the Scottish Government in [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007]].

Historical subdivisions of Scotland included the [[mormaerdom]], [[stewartries|stewartry]], [[earldom]], [[burgh]], [[Civil parishes in Scotland|parish]], [[Counties of Scotland|county]] and [[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions and districts]]. Some of these names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 constituencies. Until 2013, the Scottish fire brigades and police forces were based on a system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.

Scots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 October 2009, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the [[High Court of Justiciary]] and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the [[Lawnmarket]]. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.<ref>[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp "Court Information"] www.scotcourts.gov.uk. Retrieved 26 September 207. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320151120/http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp |date=20 March 2015 }}</ref> [[District Courts of Scotland|District courts]] were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims.

For three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: "guilty", "not guilty" and "''[[not proven]]''".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article431121.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1|title=The case for keeping 'not proven' verdict|website=Timesonline.co.uk|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref> Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an [[acquittal]], typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of [[double jeopardy]]. There is, however, the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to [[Perverting the course of justice|pervert the course of justice]] – see the provisions of the [[Double jeopardy#Scotland|Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011]]. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. [[Manslaughter]], in England and Wales, is broadly similar to [[culpable homicide]] in Scotland, and arson is called [[wilful fire raising]]. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scotland-s-unique-15-strong-juries-will-not-be-abolished-1-1037747 |title=Scotland's unique 15-strong juries will not be abolished |work=The Scotsman |date=11 May 2009 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>

Health care in Scotland is mainly provided by [[NHS Scotland]], Scotland's public health care system.

Scotland has a Western-style [[Open economy|open]] [[mixed economy]] closely linked with the rest of the UK and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy was dominated by [[heavy industry]] underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and [[steel making|steel industries]]. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of [[North Sea oil]] have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service]]-oriented economy.

Scotland had a long military tradition predating the [[Treaty of Union]] with England; the [[Scots Army]] and [[Royal Scots Navy]] were (with the exception of the [[Atholl Highlanders]], Europe's only legal [[private army]]) merged with their English counterparts to form the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[British Army]], which together form part of the [[British Armed Forces]]. 

Numerous [[Scottish regiment|Scottish regiments]] have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the [[Scots Guards]], the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]] and the [[154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC]], an [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]] regiment of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]]. In 2006, as a result of the ''[[Delivering Security in a Changing World]]'' [[white paper]], the Scottish infantry regiments in the [[Scottish Division]] were amalgamated to form the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]. As a result of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition]]'s [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Scottish regiments of the line in the [[British Army]] [[Infantry of the British Army|infantry]], having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] in 2017.

Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine]] as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of [[Game (food)|game]], dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of [[spice]]s from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. [[Irn-Bru]] is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as "Scotland's other national drink" (after whisky).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/30/scotlandsothernationaldrink |title=Scotland's other national drink |first=Libby |last=Brooks |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 May 2007 |access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> During the [[Late Middle Ages]] and [[early modern era]], [[French cuisine]] played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the "[[Auld Alliance]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historichighlanders.com/auldfood.htm |title=The Auld Alliance and its Influence on Scottish Cuisine |author=Gail Kilgore |access-date=29 July 2006}}</ref> especially during the reign of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

[[File:Craig Levein issues instructions (5575660382).jpg|thumb|left|[[Scotland national football team]] in competition against Brazil, 2011]]

The world's first official international association football match was held in 1872 and was the idea of [[C. W.

The match was between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] and resulted in a 0–0 draw. Following this, the newly developed football became the most popular sport in Scotland. The [[Scottish Cup]] was first contested in 1873. [[Queen's Park F.C.]], in Glasgow, is probably the oldest association football club in the world outside England.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[Scottish Football Association]] (SFA), the second-oldest national football association in the world, is the main [[sport governing body|governing body]] for Scottish association football, and a founding member of the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB) which governs the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]].

Scotland has five international airports operating scheduled services to Europe, North America and Asia, as well domestic services to England, Northern Ireland and Wales.

* [[Aberdeen Airport]]
* [[Edinburgh Airport]]
* [[Glasgow Airport]]
* [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]]
* [[Inverness Airport]]

[[Highlands and Islands Airports]] operates eleven airports across the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and the [[Western Isles]], which are primarily used for short distance, public service operations, although Inverness Airport has a number of scheduled flights to destinations across the UK and mainland Europe.

Edinburgh Airport is currently Scotland's busiest airport handling over 13 million passengers in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/|title=Datasets – UK Civil Aviation Authority|website=Caa.co.uk|access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref> It is also the UK's 6th busiest airport.

[[British Airways]], [[easyJet]], [[flybe]], [[Jet2.com|Jet2]], and [[Ryanair]] operate the majority of flights between Scotland and other major UK and European airports.

Four airlines are based in Scotland:

The [[East Coast Main Line|East Coast]] and [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]] main railway lines connect the major cities and towns of Scotland with each other and with the rail network in England. [[London North Eastern Railway]] provides inter-city rail journeys between [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]] to London. Domestic rail services within Scotland are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. During the time of [[British Rail]], the West Coast Main Line from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]] was electrified in the early 1970s, followed by the East Coast Main Line in the late 1980s. British Rail created the [[ScotRail (brand)|ScotRail brand]]. When British Rail existed, many railway lines in Strathclyde were electrified. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive was at the forefront with the acclaimed "largest electrified rail network outside London". Some parts of the network are electrified, but there are no electrified lines in the Highlands, Angus, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Dundee or Aberdeen, or Perth & Kinross, and none of the islands has a rail link (although the railheads at [[Kyle of Lochalsh]] and [[Mallaig]] principally serve the islands).

The East Coast Main Line crosses the [[Firth of Forth]] by the [[Forth Bridge]]. Completed in 1890, this [[cantilever bridge]] has been described as "the one internationally recognised Scottish landmark".<ref>Keay, J. & Keay, J. (1994) ''Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland''.
