The '''governor of Texas''' is the [[head of state]], [[head of government]] and [[chief executive]] of [[Texas]]. The governor directs the legislative branch and the executive branch of the state government and is the commander in chief of the [[Texas Military Department|Texas military forces]]. The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] has the power to either approve or [[veto]] [[Bill (law)|bills]] passed by the [[Texas Legislature]], and to convene the legislature. The governor may grant [[pardon]]s in cases other than [[impeachment]] (but only when recommended by the [[Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles|Board of Pardons and Paroles]]) or in the case of [[treason]], with permission by the legislature. The current governor is [[Greg Abbott]] who took office in 2015.

==History==
The state's first constitution in 1845 established the office of governor, to serve for two years, but no more than four years out of every six (essentially a limit of no more than two ''consecutive'' terms).<ref>1845 Const. Art V sec 4</ref> The 1861 secessionist constitution set the term start date at the first Monday in the November following the election.<ref>1861 Const. art V sec 12</ref> The 1866 constitution, adopted just after the [[American Civil War]], increased terms to 4 years, but no more than 8 years out of every 12, and moved the start date to the first Thursday after the organization of the legislature, or "as soon thereafter as practicable".<ref>1866 Const. art V sec 4</ref> The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]-era constitution of 1869 removed the limit on terms,<ref>1869 Const. Art IV sec 4</ref> Texas remains one of 14 states<ref>[http://www.nga.org/files/pdf/BOS4-9.pdf Executive Branch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023725/http://www.nga.org/files/pdf/BOS4-9.pdf |date=2011-06-29 }} retrieved 23-October-2008</ref> with no gubernatorial [[Term limits in the United States|term limits.]] The present constitution of 1876 shortened terms back to two years,<ref>TX Const. Art IV sec 4</ref> but a 1972 amendment increased it again to four years.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_3_1.html Texas Politics - The Executive Branch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211001255/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_3_1.html |date=2009-02-11 }}.

The gubernatorial election is held every four years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and does not coincide with the presidential elections. The governor is sworn in on the third Tuesday of January every four years along with the [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|lieutenant governor]], so Abbott and current lieutenant governor [[Dan Patrick (politician)|Dan Patrick]] both took office on January 20, 2015.

Despite the lack of term limits, no Texas governor in the 19th or 20th centuries ever served more than seven and a half consecutive years in office ([[Allan Shivers]]) or eight years total service ([[Bill Clements]], in two non-consecutive four-year terms). Former governor [[Rick Perry]], who served from 2000 to 2015, has now surpassed both these records, becoming the first Texas governor to serve three consecutive four-year terms. When Perry won the [[2010 Texas gubernatorial election|general election on November 2, 2010]], he joined Shivers, [[Price Daniel]], and [[John Connally]] as the only Texas governors elected to 3 terms (the terms served by governors Shivers, Daniel, and Connally were 2 year terms). In case of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.<ref>TX Const. art IV sec 16 graf d</ref> This rule was added only in a 1999<ref>The Texas Constitution, Article 4, Section 16; https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.4.htm</ref> amendment, prior to which the lieutenant governor only acted as governor, except during the time of the 1861 constitution, which said that the lieutenant governor would be styled "Governor of the State of Texas" in case of vacancy.<ref>1861 Const art V sec 12</ref>

== Presidential campaigns ==
*One governor of Texas won his party's nomination and was elected [[President of the United States]]:
**[[George W. Bush]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]])
*Two governors actively sought the nomination of their party, but were unsuccessful:
**[[John Connally]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], although Connally was elected Governor as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]])
**[[Rick Perry]] in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]])
