==History==
===Founding===
In 1909–1956, the first steps, constructing a model, [[Eugène Schueller|Eugène Paul Louis Schueller]], a 
young [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] of [[Germans|German]] [[Ancestry|descent]],<ref>.[http://thefashionfoot.com/2013/02/18/eugene-schueller-founder-of-loreal/ The Fashion Foot.]</ref> developed a [[Hair coloring|hair dye]] formula called ''Oréale''. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.
On 31 July 1919, [[Eugène Schueller|Schueller]] registered his company,<ref>[https://prezi.com/a2vt6eplmrmn/corporate-financial-reporting/ Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi]. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2015.</ref> the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the team was 100 strong; by 1984 was 1,000 and is roughly 88,000 today (in 2020) .

Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Oréal headquarters. [[La Cagoule]] was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning and an anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=28 March 2011 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=5 May 2012 }}</ref> L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corrèze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by Israeli historian [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''Bitter Scent''.

L'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, [[Hairstyle|hair styling]], body and skincare, [[cleanser]]s, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to hyper - and supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.


===Research and development facilities===
L'Oréal has six worldwide [[research and development]] centres: two in [[France]]: [[Aulnay-sous-Bois|Aulnay]] and [[Chevilly-Larue|Chevilly]]; one in the [[United States|U.S.]]: [[Clark, New Jersey|Clark]], [[New Jersey]]; one in [[Japan]]: [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] ; in 2005 one was established in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and one in [[India]]. A future facility in the US will be in [[Berkeley Heights, New Jersey]].

===Media===
From 1988 to 1989, L'Oréal controlled the film company [[Paravisión|Paravision]], whose properties included the [[Filmation]] and [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|De Laurentiis]] libraries. [[StudioCanal]] acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.

==Acquisitions==
L'Oréal purchased Synthélabo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synthélabo merged with [[Sanofi]] in 1999 to become [[Sanofi-Synthélabo]]. Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with [[Aventis]] in 2004 to become [[Sanofi-Aventis]].

L'Oréal's [[advertising slogan]], "Because I'm worth it", was created by a 23-year-old English art director and introduced in 1973 by the model and actress Joanne Dusseau.<ref>Malcom Gladwell, « Annals of Advertising, True Colors », The New Yorker, no 36340, 22 mars 1999</ref> In the mid-2000s, this was replaced by "Because you're worth it". In late 2009, the slogan was changed again to "Because we're worth it" following motivation analysis and consumer psychology research of Dr Maxim Titorenko. The shift to "we" was made to create stronger consumer involvement in L'Oréal philosophy and lifestyle and provide more consumer satisfaction with L'Oréal products. L'Oréal also owns a Hair and Body product line for kids called [[L'Oréal Kids]], the slogan for which is "Because we're worth it too".

In 2009, L'Oréal declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/23/loreal-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-water-consumption-and-waste-by-50/|title= L'Oreal to Reduce GHG Emissions, Water Consumption and Waste by 50%|work= Environmental Leader|date= 23 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref> – a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/L-Oreal-wants-to-cut-its-CO2-emissions-in-half-by-2015,60830.html#.UimqX9K8Bag|title= L'Oréal wants to cut its CO2 emissions in half by 2015|website= Fashionmag.com|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref> In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% reduction in C02 Emissions, a 24% reduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by [[Climate Counts]] for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/34964-L-Or-al-Recognized-by-Climate-Counts-as-Sector-Leader-for-Managing-Reporting-and-Reducing-its-Carbon-Emissions| title= L'Oréal Recognized by Climate Counts as Sector Leader for Managing, Reporting and Reducing its Carbon Emissions |work= CSR Wire|date= 5 December 2012|accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>
In 2014, L'Oréal made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.<ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-reiterates-sustainability-importance-with-zero-deforestation-commitment| title= L'Oréal reiterates sustainability importance with ‘zero deforestation' commitment |website= Cosmetics design-europe.com|date= 15 January 2014|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> The group was included in the Corporate Knights "Global 100" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.<ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope/>

====Position on animal testing====
Since the 80s, L'Oréal has invested €900 million in researching [[alternatives to animal testing]] for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, such as the Episkin model<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities |title=L'Oreal builds on skin testing capabilities|accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> at their research centres in Gerland, France, and [[Pudong]], China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://answers.loreal.com/animaltesting/en/our-position/|title=Our Position|work=L'Oréal Answers|accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>

Nevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,<ref name=bweekchina>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-21/china-animal-testing-complicates-l-oreal-s-expansion-retail|title=China Animal Testing Complicates L'Oreal's Expansion|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> where animal testing of all cosmetics for human use is mandatory.{{cn|date=June 2020}} Cosmetics by brands such as [[The Body Shop]], which refuses to do [[animal testing]], are thus not sold in China.

In 2013, L'Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/animal-testing-talk-about-medical-research|title=Animal testing – it's time to talk about it again|author=Bibi van der Zee|work=The Guardian|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>

===Community involvement and awards===
In 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the [[The Brand Trust Report|Brand Trust Report]] 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |title=India's Most Trusted Brands 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502221904/http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |archivedate= 2 May 2015 }}</ref>

In 2008, L'Oréal was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trendence.de/fileadmin/pdf/ESB_2008.pdf|title=The European Student Barometer 2008}}</ref>  a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.

The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and carry a grant of US$100,000 for each laureate.

The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to US$40,000 in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14633&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html/ |title=UNESCO/L'ORÉAL Co-Sponsored Fellowships for Young Women in Life Sciences |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010122943/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D14633%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archive-date=10 October 2014 |website=Portal.unesco.org}}</ref>

L'Oréal organises the yearly L'Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 46 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, the second prize of $5,000 and the third prize of $2500.

L'Oréal is also a founding member of the "Look Good...Feel Better" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.

In 2015, [[Standard Ethics Aei]] gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403113833/http://standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |archivedate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

==Research and innovation==

===Episkin===
Episkin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Oréal France to provide an alternative to animal testing.<ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests">{{cite news| url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Animal%20Testing/SkinReplacesAnimTests.htm | work= Animal Liberation Front|title= Human Skin to Replace Animal Tests|date=12 June 2013}}</ref> Human [[skin cells]] leftover from breast surgery <ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests" /> are developed under [[in vitro]] laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.<ref name="Build on Animal Testing">{{cite news| url= http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities | work=Cosmetic Design Europe| title=L'Oréal Builds on Skin Testing Capabilities| date=12 June 2013}}</ref> This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colors, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.<ref name="Build on Animal Testing" />
In 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading [[tissue engineering]] company.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.euroinvestor.fr/actualites/2006/02/28/loreal-episkin-subsidiary-of-loreal-acquires-skinethic-leader-in-tissue-engineering/9331794 | work=Euro Investor| title=L´OREAL : EPISKIN, SUBSIDIARY OF L´OREAL, ACQUIRES SKINETHIC, LEADER IN TISSUE ENGINEERING| date=12 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, L'Oréal announced its intention to build a ''Research and Innovation Center'' in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]. Estimated at 30 million euros (70,000,000 reals), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-a-new-research-and,3682| work=Premium Beauty News| title=L'Oréal: a new research and innovation centre in Rio| date=20 December 2011}}</ref>

===Human skin 3D printing===
L'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup [[Organovo]] to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. "We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with," said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-18/l-oreal-s-plan-to-start-3d-printing-human-skin| work=Bloomberg| title=L'Oreal's Plan to Start 3D Printing Human Skin| date=18 May 2015}}</ref>

==Controversy==

===Discrimination===
On 11 August 2005, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that former L'Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], and remanded the case for trial.<ref name="autogenerated1">'' Yanowitz v. L'Oréal USA, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/36C4t1028.htm 36 Cal. 4th 1028] (2005).</ref> The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a "sexy" blonde-haired woman and said, "God damn it, get me one that looks like that."  Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Oréal USA at the end of 2006.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

The company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and [[institutional racism]]. In July 2007, the [[Garnier]] division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, "Fructis Style".<ref>{{cite web|title=L'Oreal found guilty of racism|url=http://www.soxfirst.com/50226711/loreal_found_guilty_of_racism.php|accessdate=31 July 2010|work=Sox First}}</ref> L'Oréal is reported as saying the decision was "incomprehensible",<ref>{{cite web|author=Rasta Livewire|date=30 August 2007|title=L'Oreal Tells Women of Color to Take a Hike|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=425:loreal-tells-women-of-color-to-take-a-hike&catid=136:race&Itemid=351|accessdate=31 July 2010|website=AfricaResource}}</ref> and would challenge the measure in court.

L'Oreal continues to sell skin whitening products, which have been criticized as "capitalising on women's insecurities due to [[colourism]]." They advertise these controversial products, which have been criticised for promoting a colonial attitude as well as having safety concerns,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Khan|first=Coco|date=2018-04-23|title=Skin-lightening creams are dangerous – yet business is booming.

====Racism Against Munroe Bergdorf====
{{Main|Munroe Bergdorf race row incident}}
In August 2017, L'Oréal dismissed [[Munroe Bergdorf]], a [[mixed-race]] [[transgender]] model, after she responded to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] by stating in a [[Facebook]] post: "Honestly I don't have the energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people"; the post was also quoted as saying that "[white people] existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour", "racism isn't learned, it's inherited and [...] passed down through privilege" and that "white people" ought to "begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tan |first1=Emily |title=L'Oréal drops model Munroe Bergdorf after her Facebook rant |url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/loreal-drops-model-munroe-bergdorf-facebook-rant/1443431 |website=Campaign |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref> Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Oréal released a statement claiming their commitment to "[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were "at odds with those values".<ref name="theguardianonthelorealcismrow">{{cite news|last1=Iqbal|first1=Nosheen|date=4 September 2017|title=Munroe Bergdorf on the L’Oréal racism row: ‘It puzzles me that my views are considered extreme’|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/04/munroe-bergdorf-on-the-loreal-racism-row-it-puzzles-me-that-my-views-are-considered-extreme|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref><ref name="nytimeslorealdropstransgendermodel">{{cite news|last1=Fortin|first1=Jacey|date=2 September 2017|title=L’Oréal Drops Transgender Model Over Comments on Race|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/business/munroe-bergdorf-loreal-transgender.html?mcubz=1&_r=0|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>

===Involvement in conflicts===
[[Eugène Schueller]], the company's founder, was an alleged [[Nazi]] sympathizer.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/03/18/cz_sh_0318oreal_bill05.html | work=Forbes | title=Father's Past Haunts French Billionaire | date=18 March 2005 | first=Suzanne | last=Hoppough}}</ref> L'Oréal concedes that Schueller was an [[anti-Semitic]] [[fascist]].<ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's">{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157348,00.html | work=Time | title=Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's | date=24 June 2001}}</ref>  He was also a member of [[La Cagoule]], which supported the [[Vichy regime]], and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organisation.  Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of [[La Cagoule]] were held at L'Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.<ref name="André Bettencourt">{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570119/Andre-Bettencourt.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=André Bettencourt | date=22 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="Pascal">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/loreal-took-my-home-by-monica-waitzfelder-translated-by-peter-bush-432358.html |title= L'Oreal Took My Home, by Monica Waitzfelder, translated by Peter Bush| location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julia | last=Pascal | date=16 January 2007}}</ref>

Other controversy arose when [[Jean Frydman]], a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Oréal executives. [[André Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française. La Terre Française was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, "I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them."<ref name="André Bettencourt"/> André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.<ref name="Pascal"/> It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Oréal's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].<ref name=" Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"/>

Further controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Oréal a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Oréal stole my house!'', details how L'Oréal, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.<ref name="Gentleman">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Oréal profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}</ref>  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, "All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Oréal should be any different from the others." A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.  As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].<ref name="Pascal"/><ref name="Gentleman"/>

===Animal testing===
L'Oréal began ''in vitro'' tissue testing in 1979, and does not test any of its products or ingredients on animals anywhere in the world since 1989—14 years before it was required by regulation.<ref>https://inside-our-products.loreal.com/our-approach/our-alternative-methods-animal-testing#:~:text=L'Or%C3%A9al%20has%20been%20at, strictly%20follows%20this%20global%20policy.</ref> Controversy came from the fact that L'Oréal sells products in China, whose regulators conduct animal testing on cosmetics to be sold within its territory. Even though a ban on animal testing in China came into effect in January 2020, Chinese authorities still perform this practice for imported "ordinary" cosmetics.<ref>https://ethicalelephant.com/understanding-china-animal-testing-laws/</ref> <ref>https://chinabizlawyers.com/2019/10/china-ends-cosmetic-animal-testing-from-1st-of-january-2020/#:~:text=New%20regulations%20drafted%20by%20China's,1st%20of%20January%2C%202020.</ref>

Following L'Oréal's 2006 purchase of [[The Body Shop]], which does not support [[animal testing]], The Body Shop's founder [[Anita Roddick]] was forced to defend herself against allegations of "abandoning her principles" over L'Oréal's involvement on animal testing.

===False advertising===
In May 2007, L'Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme)<ref>{{Cite news|last=Costello|first=John|date=9 May 2007|title=Beauty and the publicity beast|work=The Evening Herald|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163157135.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=14 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111142231/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163157135.html|archive-date=11 November 2012}}</ref> ordered by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the [[wrinkle (skin)|wrinkle]] removal capabilities of their products.<ref>{{cite news|date=7 May 2007|title=Wrinkle creams are a rip-off|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21682971-36557,00.html|accessdate=20 July 2007}}</ref>

In the UK, L'Oréal has faced criticism from [[OFCOM]] regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its "Telescopic" [[mascara]], featuring [[Penélope Cruz]], stating, "it will make your [[eyelash]]es 60% longer." In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelash]]es.<ref>{{cite web|date=25 July 2007|title=L'Oréal (UK) Ltd|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_42910.htm|accessdate=31 July 2010|website=Asa.org.uk}}</ref>

In July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Oréal, banning two airbrushed [[Lancôme]] advertisements in the UK featuring actress [[Julia Roberts]] and supermodel [[Christy Turlington]]. The agency issued the ban after British politician [[Jo Swinson]] argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.<ref>{{cite news|date=29 July 2011|title=Britain bans airbrushed Julia Roberts make-up ad|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/28/airbrushed.advertisements.ban/index.html?&hpt=hp_c2|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>

In June 2014 the company reached an agreement with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as "false and unsubstantiated".

L'Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to [[Facebook]] every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/05/facebook-future-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg A Facebook of the Future: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg Show Us Their New Content, New Algorithms, and New Alliances | Vanity Fair<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
