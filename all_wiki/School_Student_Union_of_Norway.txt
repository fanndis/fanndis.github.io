'''School Student Union of Norway''' ({{lang-no|Elevorganisasjonen}}, SSUN or EO) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[student rights]] organisation. The organization is politically independent and has (as of May 2014) around 400 member schools, in which there are over 170,000 students. It is organized by 18 county boards, all operated by students themselves. It is currently the only organization of its kind in Norway and has the slogan "By, with and for students".

SSUN was founded in 1959 and is responsible for the [[Operation_Day's_Work#Norway|Operation Day's work]] campaign in Norway. It has been held since 1964.
