[[File:The Old Providence Bank.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Providence Bank around the time of its founding in 1791. The building still stands on South Main Street.]]

Fleet was founded in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] in 1791 as the '''Providence Bank''' by Rhode Island businessman [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]].  It joined the national banking system in 1865 as Providence National Bank.  In 1951, it bought Union Trust Company to form Providence Union Bank and Trust Company. Three years later, it bought Industrial Trust Company to form Industrial National Bank. In 1968, it became the leading subsidiary of Industrial National Corporation.

Industrial began diversifying into non-bank financial services in the mid-1970s. To reflect this, it changed its name to Fleet Financial Group in 1982, with the banking subsidiary becoming Fleet National Bank. It then began an aggressive buying spree of banks outside Rhode Island, most notably the [[Bank of New England]] in 1991. In 1988, Fleet merged with Albany, New York-based Norstar Bancorp to form Fleet/Norstar Financial Group. The bank continued to operate as Norstar in New York until 1992, when the company readopted the Fleet Financial Group name.

Fleet was already one of the three largest banks in New England, together with '''Shawmut National Corporation''' and its largest affiliate Shawmut Bank, and Bank of Boston. Despite this, state and federal regulators allowed Fleet to merge with Shawmut in 1995. The merger created the largest bank in New England, with over 30 percent of the region's deposits. It was also the ninth largest in the United States.<ref>Kenrick Ou, [http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xix/2.24.95/news/fleet.html "Fleet Bank to acquire Shawmut"], ''The Yale Herald'', 24 February 1995. Accessed 12 January 2008.</ref>  Although Fleet was the surviving company, the merged bank was based at Shawmut's old headquarters at [[One Federal Street]] in Boston.

As a result of the merger with Shawmut, Fleet acquired the [[naming rights]] to the newly built Shawmut Center, a sports arena that was to replace the old [[Boston Garden]]. The arena therefore opened as the FleetCenter in 1995. After FleetBoston's sale to Bank of America in 2004, the bank chose to give up its naming rights and an announcement was made on March 3, 2005 that the arena would be renamed TD Banknorth Garden (now simply the [[TD Garden]]). It is home to the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[Boston Bruins]] of the [[National Hockey League]].

In 1996, Fleet acquired the [[National Westminster Bank USA|US branch network]] (in New York and New Jersey) of the British [[National Westminster Bank]].

In 1998, Fleet acquired Quick & Reilly discount brokerage and their deep-discount, online subsidiary [[Suretrade]].<ref>Niamh Ring, [https://web.archive.org/web/20121026143336/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20395822.html "Quick & Reilly shareholders agree to Fleet's terms"], American Banker'', January 26, 1998. Accessed 19 September 2009.</ref>

Fleet's biggest merger came in 1999, when it acquired [[BankBoston]] (which was itself the fruit of a 1996 merger between Bank of Boston and BayBank). The new FleetBoston was the culmination of a series of Boston-area bank mergers that combined several smaller banks into a single large institution. FleetBoston was the seventh-largest bank in the [[United States]], as measured by assets ([[United States dollar|US$]]197 billion in 2003). It had almost 50,000 employees, over 20 million customers worldwide and revenues of $12 billion per year. The banking subsidiary operated under the Fleet name, but used BankBoston's stylized eagle logo. Corporate headquarters moved to BankBoston's former headquarters at [[100 Federal Street]].  As a condition for merger, regulators required Fleet to divest 306 New England branches, including  28 to community banks.<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REQUIRES FLEET FINANCIAL AND BANKBOSTON TO DIVEST 306 BRANCHES IN FOUR NEW ENGLAND STATES  |url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/atr/public/press_releases/1999/3027.htm |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]|date=1999-09-02|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Order Approving the Merger of Bank Holding Companies |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/bhc/1999/19990907/19990907.pdf |publisher=[[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]]|date=1999-09-07 |access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>

In 2000, it acquired New Jersey-based [[Summit Bancorp]] (which was actually United Jersey Bank (aka UJB Financial), which had acquired Summit back in 1996). The same year, it sold 278 of its New England branches to [[Sovereign Bank]] as a part of the divestiture plan required by regulators to allow the 1999 acquisition of [[BankBoston]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sovereign Bank Seals Deal With Fleetboston |url=http://articles.philly.com/2000-03-01/business/25604450_1_jay-s-sidhu-sovereign-bank-branch-network|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Sovereign Bank New England Announces Acquisition of Fleet/BankBoston Branches |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sovereign-bank-new-england-announces-acquisition-of-fleetbankboston-branches-74266987.html |location=[[Philadelphia]] and [[Boston]] |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |date=1999-09-07|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>

FleetBoston faced a class-action suit over a "[[bait and switch]]" scam where it promised a no-annual fee credit card, only to impose a fee months later.<ref>Shannon P. Duffy, [http://membrane.com/lawtomation/dmlaw/class/credit_card_fees.html "3rd Circuit Deals Blow to Banks Over Credit Card Fee Changes"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210084059/http://membrane.com/lawtomation/dmlaw/class/credit_card_fees.html |date=2007-02-10 }}, ''The Legal Intelligencer'', February 8, 2003. Accessed 12 January 2008.</ref> When [[Bank of America]] acquired Fleet in 2004, its overall [[Customer Satisfaction Index]] (as measured by the [[University of Michigan]]), was lowered from 74 to 72. Bank of America devoted considerable resources to improving its New England branches' reputation for customer service, establishing customer call centers and hiring more tellers per branch.<ref>Edward Mason, [http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2005/02/28/newscolumn2.html "Survey: Fleet's low-care reputation drags B of A scores"], ''Boston Business Journal'', 25 February 1995. Accessed 12 January 2008.</ref> Fleet's former headquarters now serves as the base for Bank of America's New England operations.
