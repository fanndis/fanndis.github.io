'''Square, Inc.'''  is an American [[financial services]], [[merchant account provider|merchant services aggregator]], and [[mobile payment]] company based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The company markets software and hardware payments products and has expanded into small business services. The company was founded in 2009 by [[Jack Dorsey]] and [[Jim McKelvey]] and launched its first app and service in 2010. It has been traded as a public company on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] since November 2015 with the ticker symbol SQ.

==History==
The original inspiration for Square occurred to [[Jack Dorsey]] in 2009 when [[Jim McKelvey]] (a friend of Dorsey) was unable to complete a $2,000 sale of his glass faucets and fittings because he could not accept credit cards.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 11, 2010 |title=Square Brings Credit Card Swiping to the Mobile Masses, Starting Today |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1643271/square-brings-credit-card-swiping-mobile-masses-starting-today |access-date=September 19, 2011 |website=Fast Company}}</ref>

Co-founders Dorsey—who also co-founded [[Twitter]]—and McKelvey began developing the company out of a small office in St. Louis.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-09-15 |title=Why Square's New Office Is A Really Big Deal for St. Louis |url=https://www.stlmag.com/news/why-square-new-office-is-a-really-big-deal-for-st-louis/ |publisher=stlmag.com}}</ref>

The name "Square" derives from the company's square-shaped card readers.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-05-26 |title=Square's name and design were changed by a lunch at Apple |url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/05/26/squares-name-and-design-were-changed-by-a-lunch-at-apple/ |access-date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=thenextweb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=May 26, 2011 |title=Square Was Almost Named Squirrel Until Dorsey Talked To Apple |url=http://pulse2.com/2011/05/26/square-was-almost-named-squirrel-until-dorsey-talked-to-apple/ |access-date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=pulse2.com}}</ref>

In October 2020, Square put approximately 1% of their total assets ($50 million) in [[bitcoin]], citing "potential to be a more ubiquitous currency in the future" as their main reasoning.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Business |first=Oliver Effron, CNN |title=Square just bought $50 million in bitcoin |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/business/square-bitcoin-crypto-investment/index.html |access-date=2020-10-22 |website=CNN}}</ref>

===Devices===

====Square Reader====
[[File:Square (4439682573).jpg|thumb|350px|In 2010, the Square device communicated with the Square app through the phone's audio jack.]]

The Square Reader was the firm's first product. It accepts credit card payments by connecting to a mobile device's audio jack. The original version consisted of a simple read head directly wired to a 3.5&nbsp;mm audio jack, through which unencrypted, analog card information was fed to smartphones for amplification and digitization.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside the Square Reader |url=http://proteanpayment.org/?p=45 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822034147/http://proteanpayment.org/?p=45 |archive-date=August 22, 2012 |publisher=Protean Payment |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In April 2012, rival payment company [[Verifone]] claimed that the Square system at the time was insecure and that a reasonably skilled programmer could write a replacement app which could use the Square device to [[Automated teller machine#Card fraud|skim]] a credit card and return its details, because of the lack of encryption. VeriFone posted a demonstration video and sample skimming app to its web site.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hsu, Tiffany |date=March 9, 2011 |title=Square's mobile credit card reader easily hacked, says VeriFone |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/squares-mobile-credit-card-reader-easily-hacked-says-verifone.html |access-date=March 11, 2011}}</ref> Dorsey called VeriFone's claims "neither fair nor accurate", noting that all card data can also be compromised by visually examining the card and that even if there were a compromise, card issuers offered fraud protection.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Olivarez-Giles, Nathan |date=March 10, 2011 |title=Square answers VeriFone's accusations on security of mobile credit card reader |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/square-answers-verifones-accusations-on-security-of-mobile-credit-card-reader.html |access-date=March 11, 2011}}</ref>

Square now uses [[Strong cryptography|strong encryption]] on its devices,<ref name="squareup1">{{Cite web |title=Square - Security |url=https://squareup.com/security |access-date=September 19, 2011 |publisher=Squareup.com}}</ref> and neither card numbers, nor magnetic stripe data, nor security codes are stored on Square client devices.<ref name="squareup1" /> The current technology is Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ([[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI]]) compliant and [[Verisign]] certified.<ref name="squareup1" />

In July 2014, ahead of the October 2015 [[EMV]] liability shift, the firm announced a card reader that would accept [[Smart card|chip cards]] and contactless cards to supplement the standard Reader's support of traditional [[magnetic stripe card]] transactions.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Marcus Wohlsen |date=July 30, 2014 |title=Square Bets Big on Next-Gen Credit Card Tech |work=Wired |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/07/exclusive-square-bets-big-on-next-gen-credit-card-tech}}</ref> In June 2015, Apple announced Square would release a new Reader capable of also accepting [[Apple Pay]] and other contactless payments.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Natt Garun |date=June 8, 2015 |title=Square will launch its Apple Pay-compatible wireless reader this fall |work=Next Web |url=https://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2015/06/08/square-will-launch-its-apple-pay-compatible-wireless-reader-this-fall/}}</ref> In August 2018, Square released a version of its [[Magnetic stripe card|magstripe]] reader with a [[lightning (connector)|Lightning]] connector, allowing it to be used on [[iPhone]]s without a headphone jack.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fingas |first=Jon |date=29 August 2018 |title=Square finally has a Lightning card reader for newer iPhones |work=[[Engadget]] |url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/29/square-finally-has-a-lightning-card-reader-for-newer-iphones/ |access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref>

===Business model===
As of March 2013, Square provided its magnetic stripe card readers to users for free.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Free Credit Card Reader |url=https://squareup.com/reader |access-date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> Square charges $99 for Square Stand and $29 for its chip-based Square Reader.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lunden |first=Ingrid |title=Square Eschews Free, Starts $29 Pre-Orders For Chip-Based Card Readers |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/square-emv/ |access-date=November 12, 2014 |publisher=Techcrunch}}</ref> The Square app is also freely downloadable from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and the [[Google Play]] Store.

There are no monthly fees or set-up costs.

For example, with Square Payroll, Square charges sellers a monthly fee of $20 plus $5 for each employee paid.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Spector |first=Nicole |title=Square Launches Payroll, Expanding Suite of Services for Small Businesses |url=http://streetfightmag.com/2015/07/02/square-launches-payroll-service-expanding-suite-of-services-for-smbs/ |access-date=July 2, 2015 |publisher=Street Fight}}</ref>

===Growth===
At the [[TechCrunch]] Disrupt conference in May 2011, Square announced the release of two new apps, Square Card Case (later rebranded as Square Wallet)<ref>{{Cite news |last=Harrison Weber |date=June 13, 2013 |title=Square Wallet for iPhone gets redesigned with a visually-driven UI and streamlined payments |publisher=The Next Web |url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/06/13/square-wallet-for-iphone-gets-redesigned-with-a-visually-driven-ui-and-streamlined-payments/ |access-date=March 11, 2014}}</ref> and Square Register. Square Wallet, before it was removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2014, allowed customers to set up a [[invoice|tab]] and pay for their order by providing their name (or a [[QR code|barcode]]) using a stored credit, debit, or gift card.

In August 2012, [[Starbucks]] announced it would use Square to process transactions with customers who pay via debit or credit card.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Claire Cain |date=2012-08-08 |title=Starbucks and Square to Team Up |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/technology/starbucks-and-square-to-team-up.html |access-date=2020-05-21 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In February 2014, [[Whole Foods Market]] announced it would use Square Register in select stores' sandwich counters, pizzerias and coffee, juice, wine and beer bars.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Whole Foods signs on to use Square |language=en-US |work=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/whole-foods-signs-on-to-use-square/2014/02/14/888f7b4c-933e-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html |access-date=2020-05-21 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

==Reception==

===In the media===
''[[Business Insider]]'' praised the product for its "ease of use, simplicity and elegance". ''Business Insider'' favorably compared Jack Dorsey with [[Steve Jobs]] for what they called his "entrepreneurial vision and charisma".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dan Frommer |date=June 7, 2011 |title=Jack Dorsey, Apple CEO?

==Banning firearms==
In May 2013, Square announced it would no longer allow firearms-related transactions to be performed using its devices or software. The company amended its terms of service for retailers to ban sales of "firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or&nbsp;... weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury". The company denied that this move was related to the increased debate over gun control.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sperry |first=Todd |date=May 13, 2013 |title=Mobile-payment service Square blocks gun sales |publisher=CNN |url=https://money.cnn.com/2013/05/13/technology/square-guns/ |access-date=December 5, 2013}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In June 2019, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Square inadvertently sends transaction receipts to the wrong email address, leading to adverse consequences such as outing one woman's impending divorce.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rudegeair |first=Peter |title=Square Sends Millions of Digital Receipts, Sometimes to the Wrong Person |work=The Wall Street Journal |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/square-sends-millions-of-digital-receipts-sometimes-to-the-wrong-person-11559640601}}</ref>

A Canadian [[food truck]] which sold Cuban coffee faced a loss of C$14,000 because transactions were processed through a Canadian subsidiary of [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], contracted by Square to handle its Canadian accounts. As the parent company is governed by US laws, the bank would have been subject with charges of trafficking in prohibited Cuban goods if it had processed the fund transactions.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rubin |first=Josh |date=2 October 2019 |title=T.O. food truck caught up in Trump's battle with Cuba |work=Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/10/02/toronto-food-truck-caught-up-in-trumps-battle-with-cuba.html |access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

Square is known to arbitrarily freeze or hold 20-30% of the funds of its merchants<ref>{{Cite news |last=Keyes |first=Daniel| work=Business Insider |title=Square is under fire for withholding funds from merchants|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/square-withholding-money-from-merchants-amid-pandemic-2020-6?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ray |first=Siladitya |work=Forbes |title= Square Is Withholding Up To 30% Of Payments Made To Some Merchants| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2020/06/23/square-is-withholding-up-to-30-of-payments-made-to-some-merchants/?sh=40eff67d4130}}</ref>, which leaves them unable to withdraw all their funds. Its justification for this is to prevent chargebacks from merchants deemed high risk, which its merchants have disputed based on their chargeback history.

The firm reserves the right to deactivate customer account and this decision is normally final and customers cannot make an [[appeal]] request. When this happens the firm normally keeps hold of the balance for three months and then deposit the money to customer account.  
In 2020, some customers on [[Instagram]] page of the firm reported that the firm refused to return the money after three months.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} Unlike [[PayPal]] the firm does not have any customer service agent outside the United States and in case of dispute, customers do not have any method of communication with a live person. The [[call center]] redirects clients to recorded messages.
