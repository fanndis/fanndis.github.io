SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, rape women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and [[iPhone]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Kazeem|first=Yomi|title=Young Nigerians are leading protests yet again to disband a rogue police unit|url=https://qz.com/africa/1915472/endsars-young-nigerian-protest-rogue-police-unit/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=Quartz Africa|language=en}}</ref> Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in [[kidnapping]], murder, theft, rape, torture, [[False arrest|unlawful arrests]], humiliation, [[False imprisonment|unlawful detention]], [[extrajudicial killing]]s and [[extortion]] of Nigerian citizens.

== Background ==
The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was a branch of the [[Nigeria Police Force]] under the [[State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department]] (SCIID). It was founded in late 1992 as one of the 14 units in the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, which was established to detain, investigate, and prosecute people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Paquette|first=Danielle|title=Nigeria abolishes special police squad after nationwide protests|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/nigeria-sars-police-robbery-end-sars/2020/10/10/999e2400-0a48-11eb-991c-be6ead8c4018_story.html|access-date=2020-10-12|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The squad was created as a masked police unit to perform undercover operations against violent crimes like [[Robbery|armed robbery]], car snatching, [[kidnapping]], [[Cattle Rustling|cattle rustling]], and the bearing and use of illegal firearms.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Projectstore|date=2020-10-11|title=Brief History Of How ENDSARS Campaign Started In Nigeria|url=http://projectstore.com.ng/brief-history-of-how-endsars-campaign-started-in-nigeria/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Free Student Project Topics|language=en-US}}</ref>

SARS had been accused of several human rights violations, illegal "stop and searches", illegal arrests and detentions, extrajudicial killings, sexual harassment of women and brutalising of young male Nigerians. The human rights abuses were documented in trending videos on social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ujene |first1=Ikem Godspower |last2=Orji-Egwu |first2=Agatha Obiangeri |title=INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AS A TOOL FOR SOCIAL CONTROL: A STUDY OF NIGERIA'S #ENDSARS |journal=Journal of Human Capital Development (JHCD) |date=1 June 2018 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=1–16 |issn=1985-7012 }}</ref>

In 2017, Nigerian activists, youth and celebrities across the nation took to the streets in a peaceful protest to spread awareness of SARS brutality and extortions and to demand its disbanding. The protests also moved to social media using the hashtag #EndSARS.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ogundipe |first1=Samueel |title=#EndSARS: Nigeria Police threaten leader of campaign against notorious anti-robbery squad {{!}} Premium Times Nigeria |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/251453-endsars-nigeria-police-threaten-leader-of-campaign-against-notorious-anti-robbery-squad.html |access-date=10 October 2020 |publisher=Premium Times |date=5 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=":2"/><ref>{{cite news |last1=CNN |first1=Stephanie Busari, Orji Sunday and Aisha Salaudeen |title=Nigerians take to the streets in protests against controversial police unit accused of brutality |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/09/africa/nigeria-police-sars-police-brutality-intl/index.html |work=CNN}}</ref>

A 2016 report by [[Amnesty International]], indicted SARS maintaining that the squad was responsible for human rights abuses, cruelty, degrading treatment of Nigerians in their custody, and other widespread torture.

On Saturday 3 October 2020, a video showing a SARS police officer shooting a young Nigerian in front of Wetland Hotel, [[Ughelli]], [[Delta State]] trended on the Internet.

On Thursday 8 October 2020, nationwide protests on ENDSARS started after weeks of outrage and anger with videos and pictures showing police brutality, harassment and extortion in Nigeria.

=== Five demands ===
On Sunday, 11 October 2020, the protestors made a list of five demands to be met by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The demands which were signed by 'A Nigerian Youth' demanded for the immediate release of all arrested during the protests as well as justice and compensation for all who died through police brutality in Nigeria. They also demanded that an independent body be set up within 10 days to investigate and prosecute all reports of police misconduct. The protestors also asked for the psychological evaluation and retraining of SARS operatives before they are deployed to any other police unit. Lastly, they asked for adequate increase in the salaries for officers of the Nigerian police.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-12|title=Five demands from #EndSARS protesters|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/10/five-demands-from-endsars-protesters/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Vanguard News|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Nigerian Government response ===
In response to the public outcry on police brutality, the Inspector-General of Nigeria Police banned the FSARS, Special Tactical Squad (STS), Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Anti-Cultism Squad and other tactical units from mounting of roadblocks, checkpoints, stop-and-search and other routine and patrols. Similar bans had been announced multiple times over the previous four years, causing citizens of Nigeria to question whether the bans would actually be upheld. There were further reports of SARS officers involved in killings across the country.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Adediran |first1=Ifeoluwa |last2=Ayitogo |first2=Nasir |title=#EndSARS: Police ban SARS, STS, others from Nigerian roads |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/418413-just-in-endsars-police-ban-sars-sts-others-from-nigerian-roads.html |access-date=10 October 2020 |agency=Premium Times |publisher=Premium Times |date=4 October 2020}}</ref>

=== Central bank freezes account of protesters ===

On Tuesday, 20 October 2020, the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] and its Governor, [[Godwin Emefiele]] obtained an exparte motion to freeze the accounts of notable participants in the End SARS protest. In an exclusive report by [[Peoples Gazette]], court documents showed that the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] failed to give any justification for the freezing order.

The protesters, in retaliation, took the fight back to where the thugs converged at the museum ground in King's Square ([[Ring Road]]) where they engaged in a brawl.

I extend condolences to the victims of the attacks, including those who lost their lives and others who were injured by the thugs. It is disheartening that anyone would attack a peaceful assembly of young people who are expressing genuine concerns over [[police brutality]] and intimidation in their own country.
