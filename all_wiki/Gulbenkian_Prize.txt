'''Gulbenkian Prize''' is a series of prizes awarded annually by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]. The main Gulbenkian Prize was established in 1976 as the '''Gulbenkian Science Prize''' awarded to Portuguese individuals and organizations. 

Starting 2012, the Foundation started giving a special international Prize funded by an annual award of €100,000 each in the field of human rights called '''Calouste Gulbenkian Prize on Human Rights'''. 

The Gulbenkian Science Prize has now been restructured and is known as '''Gulbenkian Prizes on Cohesion, Knowledge and Sustainability''' and three prizes are awarded in each of the fields
