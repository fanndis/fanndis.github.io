The '''National Eisteddfod of Wales''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru}}'') is the most important of several [[eisteddfod]]au that are held annually, mostly in [[Wales]]. Its eight days of competitions and performances are considered the largest music and poetry festival in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Sian|authorlink=Sian Williams|title=Druids, bards and rituals: What is an Eisteddfod?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> Competitors typically number 6,000 or more, and overall attendance generally exceeds 150,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Oliver|last2=Else|first2=David|last3=Atkinson|first3=David|title=Discover Great Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a8qi9lWrrbYC&q=National+Eisteddfod+of+Wales+6%2C000+comeptitors+150%2C000+visitors&pg=PA272|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|year=2010|page=272|isbn=978-1-74179-993-4}}</ref> The 2018 Eisteddfod was held in [[Cardiff Bay]] with a fence-free '[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'.

==History==
[[File:Grand National Eisteddfod, Caernarvon 1877.jpg|thumb|left|160px|An advertisement for the Grand National Eisteddfod at Caernarvon, 1877]] The [[National Museum of Wales]] says that "the history of the Eisteddfod may [be] traced back to [[1176 Cardigan eisteddfod|a bardic competition]] held by the [[Lord Rhys]] in Cardigan Castle in 1176",<ref name="museum1">{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/ |title=History of the Welsh Eisteddfodau |publisher=National Museum Wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> and local Eisteddfodau have certainly been held for many years prior to the first national Eisteddfod. There have been multiple Eisteddfodau held on a national scale in Wales, such as the Gwyneddigion Eisteddfod of {{Start date and age|1789|df=y}}, the Provincial Eisteddfodau from 1819 to 1834,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/provincial/ |title=The Provincial Eisteddfodau 1819-1834 |publisher=National Museum Wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> and the Abergavenny Eisteddfodau of 1835 to 1851,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/abergavenny/ |title=The Abergavenny Eisteddfod &#124; National Museum Wales |publisher=Museum.wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/Eisteddfod.html|title=Welsh National Eisteddfodau|publisher=Genuki|date=23 February 2013|accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/eisteddfod/history/|title=History of the Welsh Eisteddfodau|publisher=National Museum Wales|accessdate=8 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614060527/http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/eisteddfod/history/|archive-date=14 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> and The Great Llangollen Eisteddfod of 1858,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://museum.wales/collections/eisteddfodau/national/llangollen-1858/ |title=The Great Llangollen Eisteddfod, 1858 &#124; National Museum Wales |publisher=Museum.wales |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> but the National Eisteddfod of Wales as an organisation traces its history back to the first event held in 1861, in [[Aberdare]].<ref name="venues-list">{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |title=Past locations |publisher=National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=8 April 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729214952/http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |archivedate=July 29, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |title=The Eisteddfod: 1861–1885 |publisher=National Eisteddfod of Wales |accessdate=8 April 2013 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729214952/http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/english/about-us/our-history/past-locations/ |archivedate=July 29, 2014 }}</ref>
One of the most dramatic events in Eisteddfod history was the award of the 1917 chair to the poet Ellis Humphrey Evans, [[bardic name]] [[Hedd Wyn]], for the poem ''Yr Arwr'' (The Hero). The winner was announced, and the crowd waited for the winner to stand up to accept the traditional congratulations before the chairing ceremony, but no winner appeared. It was then announced that Hedd Wyn had been killed the previous month on the battlefield at [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]] in Belgium. These events were portrayed in the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]''.

In 1940, during the [[Second World War]], the Eisteddfod was not held, for fear that it would be a bombing target. Instead, the BBC broadcast an Eisteddfod radio programme, and the Chair, Crown and a Literature Medal (as opposed to the usual Prose Medal) were awarded.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/canrif/1940.shtml| title=Lleoliad yr Eisteddfod: Eisteddfod Radio| publisher=BBC| accessdate=16 August 2012|language=cy}}</ref>

In 1950 a new rule was created that required all competitions to be held in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref name=loophole>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date= |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>

In recent years efforts have been made to attract more non-Welsh speakers to the event, with the official website stating "everyone is welcome at the Eisteddfod, whatever language they speak". The Eisteddfod offers bilingual signage and simultaneous-translation of many events though wireless headphones. There is also a Welsh-learners area called Maes D. These efforts has helped increase takings, and the 2006 Eisteddfod reported a profit of over £100,000, despite costing £2.8m to stage. The Eisteddfod attracts some 160,000 people annually. The National Eisteddfod in Cardiff (2008) drew record crowds, with over 160,000 visitors attending.

It was proposed that the [[2018 Cardiff National Eisteddfod|2018 National Eisteddfod in Cardiff]] would use permanent buildings to host events rather than in the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]] site and tents. This was due partially to a lack of suitable land that could be repaired affordably after the festival. It was billed as an "Eisteddfod with no fence" in the media and was held at Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801233456/https://eisteddfod.wales/2018-eisteddfod/2018-eisteddfod |archivedate=2017-08-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Eryl Crump |url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/hundreds-parade-2018-national-eisteddfod-13235195 |title=Hundreds parade for 2018 National Eisteddfod proclamation |publisher=Daily Post |date=2017-06-25 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Huw |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-33813043 |title=National Eisteddfod considers ditching the Maes in 2018 |work=BBC News |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref> The 2019 Eisteddfod in [[Llanrwst]] returned to the traditional [[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]].

The 2020 Eisteddfod was postponed for 12 months because of the international [[Covid-19 pandemic]]. This was the first year an Eisteddfod hadn't taken place since 1914, when the event was cancelled at short notice because of the outbreak of the [[Great War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/how-another-crisis-century-ago-18022491 |title=How another crisis a century ago postponed the National Eisteddfod for the only other time in its history |work=North Wales Live |date=18 April 2020 |accessdate=2020-07-07 }}</ref>

== Overview ==
[[File:Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, Glynebwy, 1958.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Chairing of the Bard|chairing]] ceremony of the 1958 National Eisteddfod; the victorious poet was [[T. Llew Jones]]]]
[[File:Gwawr - solar vehicle.jpg|thumb|250px|The solar-powered car ''Gwawr'' ("Dawn"), the Welsh entry in the October 2007 Darwin-Adelaide Trans-Australia competition, is an example of what can be exhibited on the Eisteddfod ''Maes'' (''Arena''). (Mold, 2007)]]
[[File:Y Lle Celf.JPG|thumb|250px|'[[Y Lle Celf]]' (Blaenau Gwent, 2010)]]
The National Eisteddfod is traditionally held in the first week of August, and the competitions are all held in the [[Welsh language]]. However, settings of the [[Mass (music)|mass]] in Latin are allowed and this has been controversially used to allow concerts featuring international soloists.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhodri Clark |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/eisteddfod-latin-in-language-loophole-2198426 |title=Eisteddfod Latin in language loophole |publisher=Wales Online |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2017-10-15}}</ref>

The venue is officially proclaimed a year in advance, at which time the themes and texts for the competitions are published. The organisation for the location will have begun a year or more earlier, and locations are generally known two or three years ahead. The [[Eisteddfod Act]] of 1959 allowed local authorities to give financial support to the event. Traditionally the Eisteddfod venue alternates between north and south Wales; the decision to hold both the 2014 and 2015 Eisteddfodau in South Wales was thus seen as controversial,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but the decision was later reversed and Montgomeryshire named as host county for 2015.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/eisteddfod/2011/sites/news/pages/eisteddfod_2016.shtml Site for the Eisteddfod until 2016] at BBC Wales, 8 July 2010</ref> Occasionally the Eisteddfod has been held in England, although the last occasion was in 1929.<ref name="venues-list" />

Hundreds of tents, pavilions and booths are erected in an open space to create the ''[[Maes (eisteddfod)|Maes]]'' (field). The space required for this means that it is rare for the Eisteddfod to be in a city or town: instead it is held somewhere with more space. Car parking for day visitors alone requires several large fields, and many people camp on the site for the whole week.

The festival has a quasi-[[Gorsedd|druidic]] flavour, with the main literary prizes for poetry and prose being awarded in colourful and dramatic ceremonies under the auspices of the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards of the Island of Britain, complete with prominent figures in Welsh cultural life dressed in flowing druidic costumes, flower dances, trumpet fanfares and a symbolic [[cornucopia|Horn of Plenty]]. However, the [[Gorsedd]] is not an ancient institution or a pagan ceremony but rather a romantic creation by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 1790s, which first became a formal part of the Eisteddfod ceremonial in 1819.<ref name="museum1"/> Nevertheless, it is taken very seriously, and an award of a crown or a chair for poetry is a great honour. The [[Chairing of the Bard|Chairing]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|Crowning]] ceremonies are the highlights of the week, and are presided over by the [[Archdruid]]. Other important awards include the {{illm|Prose Medal|cy|Medal Ryddiaith}} (first introduced in 1937) and [[Welsh Learner of the Year]] award (first introduced in 1983).

If no stone circle is there already, one is created out of [[Gorsedd stones]], usually taken from the local area. These stone circles are icons all across Wales and signify the Eisteddfod having visited a community. As a cost-saving measure, the 2005 Eisteddfod was the first to use a temporary "fibre-glass stone" circle for the druidic ceremonies instead of a permanent stone circle. This also has the benefit of bringing the Gorsedd ceremonies onto the ''maes'': previously they were often held many miles away, hidden from most of the public. 
 
As well as the main pavilion with the main stage, there are other venues through the week. Some are fixtures every year, hosting gigs (Maes B/Llwyfan y Maes/Caffi Maes B). Other fixtures of the ''maes'' are the ''Pabell Lên'' (literature pavilion), the ''Neuadd Ddawns'' (dance hall), the ''Pabell Wyddoniaeth a Thechnoleg'' (science and technology pavilion), ''Maes D'' (learners' pavilion), at least one theatre, ''Y Cwt Drama'' (the drama hut), ''Tŷ Gwerin'' (folk house), ''[[Y Lle Celf]]'' ("the Art Place") and hundreds of ''stondinau'' (stands and booths) where groups, societies, councils, charities and shops exhibit and sell. Since 2004, alcohol has been sold on the ''maes''; previously there was a no-alcohol policy.

==Poetry awards==
The Eisteddfod's most well-known awards are those for poetry.
