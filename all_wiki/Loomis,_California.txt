'''Loomis''' (formerly, '''Pine''',<ref name=gnis/> '''Pino''',<ref name=gnis/> '''Smithville''',<ref name=CGN/> and '''Placer'''<ref name=CGN/>) is an [[List of cities in California|incorporated town]] in [[Placer County, California|Placer County]], [[California]], United States. It is part of the [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]&ndash;[[Arden-Arcade, California|Arden-Arcade]]&ndash;[[Roseville, California|Roseville]] [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The town's population was reported as 6,430 in the 2010 United States Census. It shares borders with the city of [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]] and the Census-Designated Places [[Penryn, California|Penryn]] and [[Granite Bay, California|Granite Bay]].

==History==
The Placer post office opened on the site in 1861, changed its name to Smithville in 1862, then changed it to Pino in 1869, and in 1890 the Southern Pacific Railroad finally decided on Loomis.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|516}}</ref> The railroad and Post Office found that Pino was confused with the town of Reno, hence the name change to Loomis.<ref>Erwin, Gudde (2004). ''California Place Names: The origin and etymology of current geographical names''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. p. 215.</ref> The name Smithville honors L.G. Smith, who was one of the town's most prominent leaders.<ref name=CGN/>

Loomis takes its name from one of the town's pioneers, James Loomis. At one time, James Loomis was the whole town—saloon keeper, railroad agent, express agent, and postmaster.<ref name=CGN/>
In the early part of the 20th century, Loomis was the second largest fruit-shipping station in Placer County, Newcastle California, just {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Loomis, was considered the largest.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yI2-Ax9b9gMC&q=newcastle+fruit+shipping+early+1900&pg=PA40|title=Placer County|author=Sommers, Arthur|isbn=9780738571539|date=2010-01-01}}</ref>

Loomis remained part of unincorporated Placer County until December 17, 1984, when the Town of Loomis officially incorporated. The Town was in danger of being annexed by its neighbor [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]] and the residents voted to incorporate to preserve local control, partly on the issue of preserving the "small town" character and historic structures such as the High Hand and Blue Goose fruit packing sheds which sit between Taylor Road (a segment of historic [[U.S. Route 40 (California)|Highway 40]]) and the [[Union Pacific]] [[Railroad]] tracks.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|7.27|sqmi}}, all of it land. Stream drainages are Antelope Creek and [[Secret Ravine]].

==Climate==
Loomis has a [[Mediterranean climate#hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') that is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. As with the rest of cities in the northern Central Valley, Loomis has hot summers with a lack of rainfall and plenty of sunshine. Winters are cool and bring plenty of rain. Average daily high temperatures range from 53&nbsp;°F (12&nbsp;°C) in January to 94&nbsp;°F (34&nbsp;°C) in July with August remaining nearly as hot. Daily low temperatures range from 39&nbsp;°F in winter to 61&nbsp;°F in summer (4 to 16&nbsp;°C). Snowfall is almost non-existent in Loomis.
