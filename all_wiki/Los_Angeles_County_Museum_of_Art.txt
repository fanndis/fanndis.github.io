The '''Los Angeles County Museum of Art''' ('''LACMA''') is an [[art museum]] located on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] vicinity of Los Angeles. LACMA is on Museum Row, adjacent to the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] (George C. Page Museum).

LACMA was founded in 1961, splitting from the [[Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art]]. Four years later, it moved to the Wilshire Boulevard complex designed by [[William Pereira]]. The museum's wealth and collections grew in the 1980s, and it added several buildings beginning in that decade and continuing in subsequent decades. In 2020, four buildings on the campus were demolished to make way for a reconstructed facility designed by [[Peter Zumthor]]. His design drew strong community opposition and was lambasted by architectural critics and museum curators, who objected to its reduced gallery space, poor design, and exorbitant costs.<ref name="Demolition NYRB">{{cite news |last1=Giovannini |first1=Joseph |title=The Demolition of LACMA: Art Sacrificed to Architecture |url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/10/02/the-demolition-of-lacma-art-sacrificed-to-architecture/ |access-date=5 October 2020 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=2 October 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="NYT Zumthor approval">{{cite news |last1=Finkel |first1=Jori |title=Lacma’s $650 Million Building by Peter Zumthor Is Approved |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/design/lacma-design-peter-zumthor.html |access-date=5 October 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="LAT shrinking">{{cite news |last1=Knight |first1=Christopher |author-link1=Christopher Knight (art critic) |title=LACMA, the Incredible Shrinking Museum: A critic’s lament |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-lacma-shrinking-20190402-story.html |access-date=5 October 2020 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2 April 2019}}</ref>

LACMA is the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] art museum in the western United States.

In addition to [[Art exhibition|art exhibits]], the museum features film and concert series.

==History==

===Early years===
[[File:Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard, 1965.jpg|thumb|550px|center|<center>[[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the Art Museum in 1965.</center>]]
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was established as a museum in 1961. Prior to this, LACMA was part of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art]], founded in 1910 in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] near the [[University of Southern California]]. [[Howard F. Ahmanson, Sr.]], [[Anna Bing Arnold]] and [[Bart Lytton]] were the first principal patrons of the museum. Ahmanson made the lead donation of $2 million, convincing the museum board that sufficient funds could be raised to establish the new museum. In 1965 the museum moved to a new Wilshire Boulevard complex as an independent, art-focused institution, the largest new museum to be built in the United States after the [[National Gallery of Art]].

===William Pereira Buildings===
The museum, built in a style similar to [[Lincoln Center]] and the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], consisted of three buildings: the Ahmanson Building, the Bing Center, and the [[Bart Lytton|Lytton]] Gallery (renamed the Frances and [[Armand Hammer]] Building in 1968). The board selected LA architect [[William Pereira]] over the directors' recommendation of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] for the buildings.<ref name="LACMAartspaces">{{Citation | last = Hackman | first = William | author-link = William Hackman | title = Los Angeles County Museum of Art: Art Spaces | publisher = Scala Publishers Limited | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-85759-481-2}}</ref> According to a 1965 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' story, the total cost of the three buildings was $11.5 million.<ref name="LACMA then, now and in the future">Doug Stevens (April 10, 2015), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-g-lacma-campus-20150410-htmlstory.html LACMA then, now and in the future] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> Construction began in 1963, and was undertaken by the [[Del E.

When the museum opened, the buildings were surrounded by reflecting pools, but they were filled in and covered over when tar from the adjacent La Brea Tar Pits began seeping in.<ref name="LACMA then, now and in the future"/>

===1980s===

Money poured into LACMA during the boom years of the 1980s, a reportedly $209 million in private donations during director Earl Powell's tenure.<ref>William Wilson (July 3, 1986), [https://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-03/entertainment/ca-1180_1_county-museum New Building Plan For County Museum Of Art] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>  To house its growing collections of modern and contemporary art and to provide more space for exhibitions, the museum hired the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates to design its $35.3-million,<ref>Christopher Knight (April 29, 1992), [https://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-29/entertainment/ca-852_1_modern-art The Impact of County Art Museum's Earl Powell] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> 115,000-square-foot [[Robert O.

The museum's [[Pavilion for Japanese Art]], designed by maverick architect [[Bruce Goff]], opened in 1988, as did the [[B. Gerald Cantor]] Sculpture Garden of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] [[bronze]]s.

In 1999, the Hancock Park Improvement Project was complete, and the LACMA-adjacent park (designed by landscape architect [[Laurie Olin]]) was inaugurated with a free public celebration. The $10-million renovation replaced dead trees and bare earth with picnic facilities, walkways, viewing sites for the [[La Brea Tar Pits|La Brea tar pits]] and a 150-seat red granite amphitheater designed by artist [[Jackie Ferrara]].<ref>[[Suzanne Muchnic]] (July 17, 1999), [https://articles.latimes.com/1999/jul/17/entertainment/ca-56785 Museums Rediscover Beauty, Right in Their Own Backyard] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

Also in 1994, LACMA purchased the adjacent [[May Company Building (Wilshire, Los Angeles)|former May Company department store building]], an impressive example of [[Streamline Moderne|streamline moderne]] architecture designed by [[Albert C. Martin Sr.]] LACMA West increased the museum's size by 30 percent when the building opened in 1998.<ref name=lat-1998oct22>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/22/local/me-34973 |title=May Co.

===Renzo Piano Buildings===
In 2004 LACMA's Board of Trustees unanimously approved a plan for LACMA's transformation by architect [[Rem Koolhaas]], who had proposed razing all the current buildings and constructing an entirely new single, tent-topped structure,<ref>{{Citation | last=Singely | first=Paulette | author-link=Paulette Singely | title=LACMA on fire | date=April 2005 | url=http://www.laforum.org/programs/pub/online/lacma/the_curator_against | publisher=Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215034254/http://laforum.org/programs/pub/online/lacma/the_curator_against | archive-date=February 15, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="latimesZumthor">{{Citation | last=Hawthorne | first=Christopher | title=Peter Zumthor, Michael Govan plot LACMA's future | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=December 7, 2009 | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/12/for-those-of-you-keeping-score-at-home-were-up-to-three-architectural-saviors-for-the-los-angeles-county-museum-of-art.html }}</ref> estimated to cost $200 million to $300 million.<ref name="Muchnic">Suzanne Muchnic (December 3, 2002), [https://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/03/entertainment/et-muchnic3 LACMA finds itself in two funding worlds] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> Kohlhaas edged out French architect [[Jean Nouvel]], who would have added a major building while renovating the older facilities.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">[[Suzanne Muchnic]] (December 6, 2001), [https://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/06/news/mn-12222 L.A.

However, the project soon stalled after the museum failed to secure funding.<ref>Christopher Reynolds (December 26, 2002), [https://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/26/local/me-lacma26 The Rise and Stall of LACMA's Planned Reinvention] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> In 2004 LACMA's Board of Trustees unanimously approved plans to transform the museum, led by architect [[Renzo Piano]]. The planned transformation consisted of three phases.

Phase I started in 2004 and was completed in February 2008. The renovations required demolishing the parking structure on Ogden Avenue and with it LACMA-commissioned [[graffiti art]] by street artists [[Margaret Kilgallen]] and [[Barry McGee]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Chang | first = Jade | author-link = Jade Chang | title = Art/Shop/Eat Los Angeles | publisher = [[Somerset Books]] | year = 2005 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/artshopeatlosang0000chan/page/90 90–98] | isbn = 1-905131-06-2 | url = https://archive.org/details/artshopeatlosang0000chan/page/90 }}</ref> The entry pavilion is a key point in architect Renzo Piano's plan to unify LACMA's sprawling, often confusing layout of buildings. The BP Grand Entrance and the adjacent [[Broad Contemporary Art Museum]] (BCAM) comprise the $191 million (originally $150 million) first phase of the three-part expansion and renovation campaign. BCAM is named for [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edy Broad]], who gave $60 million to LACMA's campaign; Eli Broad also serves on LACMA's board of directors.<ref>{{Citation|last=Boehm |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Boehm |title=BP gives $25 million to LACMA: The BP donation will go toward a solar entrance that the British oil firm hopes will invoke energy innovation. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 6, 2007 |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/printedition/calendar/cl-et-lacma6mar06,0,1254648.story?coll=cl-calendar |format=– <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3ABoehm+intitle%3ABP+gives+%2425+million+to+LACMA%3A+The+BP+donation+will+go+toward+a+solar+entrance+that+the+British+oil+firm+hopes+will+invoke+energy+innovation.&as_publication=&as_ylo=2007&as_yhi=2007&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> BCAM opened on February 16, 2008, adding {{convert|58000|sqft|m2}} of exhibition space to the museum. In 2010 the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion opened to the public, providing the largest purpose-built, naturally lit, open-plan museum space in the world.

The second phase was intended to turn the May building into new offices and galleries, designed by SPF Architects. As proposed, it would have had flexible gallery space, education space, administrative offices, a new restaurant, a gift shop and a bookstore, as well as study centers for the museum's departments of costume and textiles, photography and prints and drawings, and a roof sculpture garden with two works by [[James Turrell]]. However, construction of this phase was halted in November 2010.<ref name="ConstHalt">Rachel Lee Harris (November 25, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/arts/design/26arts-CONSTRUCTION_BRF.html?ref=losangelescountymuseumofart Construction Has Halted at Los Angeles Museum] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Phase two and three were never completed.

In October 2011, LACMA entered into an agreement with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] under which the Academy will establish its [[Academy Museum of Motion Pictures]], in the May building. The redesign and additions are designed by Renzo Piano as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacma.org/sites/default/files/LACMA.AMPAS%20announcement%2010.4.11.pdf |title=Historic Alliance Opens Door to Academy Museum at LACMA |format=PDF |access-date=2013-05-10}}</ref> Construction of the renovated building is ongoing and the Academy Museum is set to open by 2021.

===Watts Towers===
In 2010 LACMA partnered with the [[City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department]] in an effort to ensure the preservation of the [[Watts Towers]], offering its staff, expertise, and fundraising assistance.<ref>[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/36132/lacma-steps-in-to-preserve-las-leaning-tower-of-folk-art/ LACMA Steps in to Preserve L.A.'s Leaning Tower of Folk Art] (October 25, 2010), ''ARTINFO''.</ref> As of 2018, LACMA is working with Los Angeles County to develop a site at the Earvin "Magic" Johnson Park, which is close to Watts Towers.<ref name="Deborah Vankin 2018">Deborah Vankin (July 3, 2018), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-lacma-building-project-update-20180703-story.html At LACMA, new urgency to finish raising $650 million for the new museum building] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

===South Los Angeles Wetlands Park site===
In 2018, LACMA secure a 35-year lease on an 80,000-square-foot, city-owned former Metro maintenance and storage yard from 1911 in the South Los Angeles Wetlands Park area.<ref name="Deborah Vankin 2018"/> In 2020, it was reported that LACMA was in violation of the terms of its no-rent 35-year lease for the site.<ref>[https://esotouric.com/lacma-satellite/ South L.A.

===Zumthor proposal===
Specifics about the third phase, which initially was to involve renovations to older buildings, long remained undisclosed.<ref name="ConstHalt" /> In November 2009, plans were made public that LACMA's director Michael Govan was working with Swiss architect and [[Pritzker Prize]] laureate [[Peter Zumthor]] on plans for rebuilding the eastern section of the campus, the Perreira Buildings between the two new Renzo Piano buildings and the tar pits.<ref name="latimesZumthor"/><ref>{{Citation|last=Lifson |first=Edward |title=A Bolt of Zumthor |newspaper=[[The Architect's Newspaper]] |date=November 24, 2009 |url=http://archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4084 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107094527/http://www.archpaper.com/e-board_rev.asp?News_ID=4084 |archive-date=January 7, 2011 }}</ref> Architecture firm [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]] collaborated with Zumthor on the building's design.<ref>Carolina A.

In June 2014, the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] approved $5 million for LACMA to continue its proposed plans to tear down the structures on the east end of its campus for a single museum building.<ref name="latimes.com">Mike Boehm (June 25, 2014), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-county-arts-budget-grand-park-20140625-story.html Supervisor Molina starts new foundation to oversee Grand Park] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> Later that year, they approved in concept a plan that would provide public financing and $125 million toward the $600-million project.<ref>Mike Boehm (November 6, 2014), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-cm-lacma-county-20141106-story.html L.A.

On April 8, 2019, the Zumthor-designed building was approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. The final approved building designed was scaled back from the original {{convert|387500|sqft}} to {{convert|347500|sqft}}, with gallery space shrinking from {{convert|121000|sqft}} to {{convert|110000|sqft}}. The new proposal also dropped the black form aesthetics, reducing it to a one-level, aboveground, glass-enclosed, sand-colored concrete building, to save costs. The design still calls for an arm above Wilshire Boulevard.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/los-angeles-county-board-of-supervisors-approves-usd650m-lacma-building-project |title = Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approves $650m Lacma building project}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/arts/design/lacma-design-peter-zumthor.html | title=Lacma's $650 Million Building by Peter Zumthor is Approved| newspaper=The New York Times| date=10 April 2019| last1=Finkel| first1=Jori}}</ref>

The total cost was estimated to be at $650 million, with LA county providing $125 million in funds and the rest raised by fundraising. Per reports LACMA has raised $560 million total since December 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-new-lacma-zumthor-architecture-renderings-20190329-story.html |title = In a new redesign LACMA experiences shrinkage — and shapeshifts yet again|date = 29 March 2019}}</ref> The re-designed final building was criticized by some local architects, including the LA times editorial architect [[Christopher Knight (art critic)|Christopher Knight]], calling the plans "half baked".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-11-14/lacma-new-building-fundraising-costs | title=Commentary: Fundraising for LACMA's new building has stalled as costs balloon| date=14 November 2019}}</ref> [[Los Angeles City]] owns air rights above Wilshire, so the city council must give approval to the project, since part of the structure goes over the street.

===Modern and Contemporary Art===
{{distinguish|text=[[The Broad]], another contemporary art museum funded by the Broads, in Downtown Los Angeles}}
The Modern Art collection is displayed in the Ahmanson Building, which was renovated in 2008 to have a new entrance featuring a large staircase, conceived as a gathering place similar to Rome's [[Spanish Steps]]. Filling the atrium at the base of the staircase is Tony Smith's massive sculpture ''Smoke'' (1967).<ref name="latimes02032008">{{Citation | last=Muchnic | first=Suzanne | author-link=Suzanne Muchnic | title = Broad Ambitions | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = February 3, 2008 | pages = F1, F8 }}</ref> The plaza level galleries also house African art and a gallery highlighting the Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies.

The modern collection on the plaza level displays works from 1900 to the 1970s, largely populated by the [[Henri Lazarof|Janice and Henri Lazarof Collection]]. In December 2007, Janice and [[Henri Lazarof]] gave LACMA 130 mostly modernist works estimated to be worth more than $100 million.<ref name="nytimes01082008" /> The collection includes 20 works by [[Picasso]], watercolors and paintings by [[Paul Klee]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and a considerable number of sculptures by [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Archipenko]], and [[Jean Arp|Arp]].<ref name="nytimes12132007">{{Citation | last = Wyatt | first = Edward | title = For Los Angeles Museum, a 'Transformative' Gift of Modernists | newspaper = New York Times | date = December 13, 2007 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E7D71339F930A25751C1A9619C8B63&scp=1&sq=lazarof+lacma}}</ref><ref name="latimes12122007">{{Citation|last=Muchnic |first=Suzanne |author-link=Suzanne Muchnic |title=Huge gift helps LACMA enter the modern age |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=December 12, 2007 |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/la-et-lacma12dec12,0,3227885.story |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213171234/http://www.calendarlive.com/la-et-lacma12dec12%2C0%2C3227885.story |archive-date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref>

The Contemporary Art collection is displayed in the {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM), opened on February 16, 2008. BCAM's inaugural exhibition featured 176 works by 28 artists of postwar Modern art from the late 1950s to the present. All but 30 of the works initially displayed came from the collection of Eli and Edythe Broad (pronounced "brode").<ref name="latimes02152008" /> Long-time trustee Robert Halff had already donated 53 works of contemporary art in 1994. Components of that gift included [[Joan Miró]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Lari Pittman]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Richard Serra]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Matthew Barney]], and [[Jeff Koons]]. It also provided LACMA with its first drawings by [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Cy Twombly]].<ref>Suzanne Muchnic (January 6, 2005), [https://articles.latimes.com/2005/jan/06/local/me-halff6 Robert Halff, 96; Ad Exec, Museum Donor] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

''Back Seat Dodge ’38'' (1964), by [[Edward Kienholz]], is a sculpture portraying a couple engaged in sexual activity in the back seat of a truncated 1938 Dodge automobile chassis. The piece won Kienholz instant celebrity in 1966 when the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] tried to ban the sculpture as pornographic and threatened to withhold financing from LACMA if it included the work in a Kienholz retrospective. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture's car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children were present in the gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, ''Back Seat Dodge ’38'' has drawn crowds.<ref name="dodgenytimes">{{Citation | last = Wyatt | first = Edward | title = In Sunny Southern California, a Sculpture Finds Its Place in the Shadows | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = October 2, 2007 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/arts/design/02dodg.html?ex=1349928000&en=924d5cd6d7aea227&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink}}</ref>

===American and Latin American art===
The Art of the Americas Building has American, Latin American, and pre-Columbian collections displayed on the second floor and temporary exhibition space on the first floor. Formerly known as the Anderson Building, the Art of the Americas Building comprises galleries for art from North, Central, and South America.<ref name="Spreading the riches">Suzanne Muchnic (August 19, 2007), [https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/19/entertainment/ca-cisneros19 Spreading the riches] ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''</ref>

LACMA's Latin American Art galleries reopened in July 2008 after several years renovation. The Latin American collection includes pre-Columbian, Spanish Colonial, Modern, and contemporary works. Many recent additions to the collection were financed by sales of works from an 1,800 piece holding of 20th century Mexican art compiled by dealer-collectors [[Bernard Lewin|Bernard and Edith Lewin]] and given to the museum in 1997.<ref name="LatimesLatinJuly262008"/>

The [[pre-Columbian]] galleries were redesigned by [[Jorge Pardo (installation artist)|Jorge Pardo]], a Los Angeles artist who works in sculpture, design, and architecture.<ref name="LatimesLatinJuly262008">{{Citation | last = Muchnic | first = Suzanne | title = LACMA remaps Latin America | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = July 26, 2008 | url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-lacma26-2008jul26,0,903730.story | access-date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> Pardo's display cases are built from thick, stacked sheets of medium-density fiberboard (MDF), with spacing of equal thickness in between the 70-plus layers. The laser-cut organic forms undulate and swell out from the walls, sharply contrasting to the rectangular display cases found in most art museums.<ref name="LatimesLatinAug12008"/>

The museum's pre-Columbian collection began in the 1980s with the first installment of a 570-piece gift from Southern California collector [[Constance McCormick Fearing]] and the purchase of about 200 pieces from L.A. businessman [[Proctor Stafford]]. The holdings recently jumped from about 1,800 to 2,500 objects with a gift of Colombian ceramics from [[Camilla Chandler Frost]], a LACMA trustee and the sister of [[Otis Chandler]], former ''Los Angeles Times'' publisher, and [[Stephen Munoz-Kramer|Stephen and Claudia Muñoz-Kramer]] of Atlanta, whose family built the collection.<ref name="LatimesLatinJuly262008"/> A sizable portion of LACMA's pre-Columbian collection was excavated from burial chambers in Colima, [[Nayarit]] and other regions around Jalisco in modern-day Mexico.<ref name="LatimesLatinAug12008"/> LACMA boasts one of the largest collections of [[Latin American art]] due to the generous donation of more than 2,000 works of art by [[Bernard Lewin]] and his wife Edith Lewin in 1996. In 2007 the museum signed an agreement with the Fundación Cisneros for a loan of 25 colonial-style works, later extended until 2017.<ref name="Spreading the riches"/>

The Spanish Colonial collection includes work from 17th and 18th century Mexican artists [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[José de Páez]], and [[Nicolás Rodriguez Juárez]]. The collection has galleries for [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. The Latin American contemporary gallery highlights works [[Francis Alÿs]].<ref name="LatimesLatinAug12008">{{Citation | last = Knight | first = Christopher | title = Jorge Pardo's Pre-Columbian art installation at LACMA | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = August 1, 2008 | url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-pardo1-2008aug01,0,7921951.story | access-date=August 1, 2008}}</ref>

===Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art===
The second floor of the Ahmanson Building has Greek and Roman Art galleries. A large portion of the museum's ancient Greek and Roman art collection was donated by [[William Randolph Hearst]], the publishing magnate, in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

===Islamic art===

The museum's Islamic galleries include over 1700 works from ceramics and inlaid metalwork to enameled glass, carved stone and wood, and arts of the book from manuscript illumination to [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The collection is especially strong in Persian and Turkish glazed pottery and tiles, glass, and arts of the book. The collection began in earnest in 1973 when the [[Nasli Heeramaneck|Nasli M. Heeramaneck Collection]] was gifted to the museum by philanthropist [[Joan Palevsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Art|url=http://www.lacma.org/islamic_art/intro.htm|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|access-date=23 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091248/http://www.lacma.org/islamic_art/intro.htm|archive-date=March 8, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He supplied about a third of the 300 objects displayed in a 2004–05 LACMA exhibit, "The Arts and Crafts Movement in Europe and America: 1880–1920" and in 2009, the museum presented "The Arts and Crafts Movement: Masterworks From the Max Palevsky and Jodie Evans Collection".<ref name="palevskyLAtimes">{{Citation | last = Woo | first = Elaine | title = Max Palevsky dies at 85; computer magnate and philanthropist | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = May 6, 2010 | url = https://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-0506-max-palevsky-20100506,0,5194658,full.story | access-date = May 6, 2010}}</ref> With a single acquisition in 2009, LACMA became a major center for the study and display of 18th- and 19th-century European clothing when it bought the holdings of dealers Martin Kamer of London and Wolfgang Ruf of Beckenried, Switzerland—about 250 outfits and 300 accessories created between 1700 and 1915, including men's three-piece suits, women's dresses, children's garb, and a vast array of shoes, hats, purses, shawls, fans, and undergarments.<ref>Suzanne Muchnic (January 2, 2009), [https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/02/entertainment/et-lacmagift2 LACMA fashions a new reputation] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

===Permanent art installations===
Los Angeles sculptor [[Robert Graham (sculptor)|Robert Graham]] created the towering, bronze ''Retrospective Column'' (1981, cast in 1986) for the entrance of the Art of the Americas Building. A new contemporary sculpture garden was opened directly east of the museum's Wilshire Boulevard entrance in 1991, including large-scale outdoor sculptures by [[Alice Aycock]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Henry Moore, and others. The centerpiece of the garden is [[Alexander Calder]]'s three-piece mobile ''Hello Girls'', commissioned by a women's museum-support group for the museum's opening in 1965. Situated in a curving reflecting pool, the mobile has brightly colored paddles that are moved by jets of water.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1991-05-02/news/we-1295_1_sculpture-garden Miracle Mile: Sculpture Garden to Open] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 2, 1991.</ref><ref>Christopher Knight (May 12, 2009), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/05/calder-lacma.html Alexander Calder's 1964 'Hello Girls' back on view at LACMA] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

LACMA's film program was founded by Phil Chamberlin in the late 1960s.<ref>David Ng (September 11, 2009), [https://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/11/entertainment/et-birnie11 Ian Birnie sees encouraging signs from turmoil at LACMA], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> In 2009 LACMA announced plans to cancel its 41-year-old film series, citing declining attendance and funding. The decision drew widespread criticism from cinephiles, including film director [[Martin Scorsese]], who wrote an open protest letter that was published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, the museum expanded its movie offerings and partnered with Film Independent to launch a new series. In 2011 LACMA and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] announced partnership plans to open a movie museum within three years in the former May Co. building.<ref>Reed Johnson (May 25, 2012), [https://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/25/entertainment/la-ca-lacma-film-20120527 That 'Look of Love' between LACMA and Hollywood], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

==Acquisitions and donors==

===Individual donors===
In 2014, LACMA received a $500 million donation of art from businessman [[Jerry Perenchio]]. The 47-piece collection contains works by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, René Magritte, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, and Pablo Picasso. LACMA executive director Michael Govan said it was the biggest gift in the museum's history, and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "conceivably one of the greatest art gifts ever, to any museum".<ref name=Soraya>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/07/meet-jerry-perenchio-the-man-who-just-bequeathed-the-l-a-museum-half-a-billion-dollars-worth-of-art/|last=McDonald|first=Soraya Nadia|title=Jerry Perenchio, a Very Private Man, Just Publicly Bequeathed the L.A.

The $54 million Resnick Pavillon was made possible by a $45 million gift from the philanthropists for whom it is named.<ref>Robert L. Pincus (September 9, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/arts/design/12pincus.html?ref=losangelescountymuseumofart] ''New York Times''.</ref> On March 6, 2007, [[BP]] announced a $25 million donation to name the entry pavilion under construction as part of LACMA's renovation campaign the "BP Grand Entrance". The $25 million gift matches [[Disney|Walt Disney Co.'s]] 1997 gift for [[Disney Hall]] as the biggest corporate donation to the arts in Southern California. Previously, in 2006, LACMA had announced that the new entrance would be called the "[[Lynda Resnick|Lynda]] and [[Stewart Resnick]] Grand Entrance Pavilion", in honor of their $25 million gift.

On January 8, 2008 Eli Broad revealed plans to retain permanent control of his roughly 2,000 works of modern and contemporary art in the independent Broad Art Foundation, which loans works to museums, rather than giving the art away. Broad, as recently as a year prior, had said that he planned to give most of his holdings to one or several museums, one of which was assumed to be LACMA. However, LACMA remains the "preferred" museum to receive works from the Foundation.<ref name="latimes01152008">{{Citation | last = Reynolds| first = Christopher | title = Finding the silver lining Moving on to Plan B | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = January 15, 2008 | url = https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/arts/la-et-govan15jan15,1,5071836.story?coll=la-entnews-arts&ctrack=2&cset=true}}</ref>

Broad, previously vice chairman of LACMA's board of directors, financed the $56-million Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) building at LACMA; he also provided an additional $10 million to buy two works of art to be displayed in it. BCAM displayed 220 pieces borrowed from Broad and his Broad Art Foundation when it opened in February 2008. In 2001 LACMA was criticized for hosting a major exhibition of Broad's collection without having secured a promised gift of the works, an act that is prohibited at many prominent art institutions because it can increase the market value of the collection.<ref name="nytimes01082008">{{Citation | last = Wyatt | first = Edward | title = An Art Donor Opts to Hold on to His Collection | newspaper = New York Times | date = January 8, 2008 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/arts/design/08muse.html?scp=1&sq=broad+lacma}}</ref>

In 2002 the [[Annenberg Foundation]] gave the museum $10 million to establish a special endowment fund to support exhibitions, art acquisitions and educational programs at the discretion of its director. In recognition of the gift, LACMA named its leadership position the Wallis Annenberg directorship. In 2001 Wallis Annenberg endowed a curatorial fellowship program with a $1-million gift. In 1991, the foundation contributed $10 million to LACMA's endowment and in 1999 it donated $100,000 to provide arts education training for Los Angeles elementary school teachers.<ref name="Muchnic"/>

In 2001 the museum lost out on the modern art collection of Nathan and Marian Smooke, a former museum trustee and industrial real-estate developer whose heirs sold much of his collection at auction rather than donating it.<ref>Carol Vogel (November 6, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/06/nyregion/first-art-auction-of-season-indicates-a-healthy-market.html First Art Auction of Season Indicates a Healthy Market] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref><ref>Suzanne Muchnic (November 5, 2011), [https://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/05/entertainment/ca-488 The Imperfect Pursuit of Collections] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

In 1996 the museum suffered yet another serious blow when the [[Gilbert Collection]] of Italian mosaics and other decorative objects, promised as an eventual bequest, and parts of which had been on display for decades, was withdrawn. The would-be donor claimed that the Museum had reneged on a written agreement to provide more exhibit space for it.<ref>Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles, California: September 4, 2001.  pg. B.11</ref><ref>DIANE HAITHMAN. Los Angeles Times (pre-1997 Fulltext). Los Angeles, California: June 13, 1996.  pg. 2</ref> The collection is considered one of the finest in the world of its kind.  Moreover, unlike the Hammer and Simon collections, it did not remain in the Los Angeles area but was removed to the United Kingdom.

[[Armand Hammer]] was a LACMA board member for nearly seventeen years, beginning in 1968, and during this time continued to announce the museum would inherit his whole collection. Hammer's collection included works from [[Van Gogh]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Edgar Degas]], and [[Paul Cézanne]]. When LACMA was offered a collection of works by [[Honoré Daumier]], Hammer bought the works on the promise that he would give them to the museum. To LACMA's surprise, Hammer instead founded the [[Hammer Museum]], built adjacent to [[Occidental Petroleum|Occidental]]'s headquarters in Los Angeles.<ref name="Time1991">{{Citation | last = Hughes | first = Robert | author-link = Robert Hughes (critic) | title = America's Vainest Museum | newspaper = Time Magazine | date = January 28, 1991 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972206,00.html}}</ref>

Between 1972 and 2020, the Ahmanson Foundation spent about $130 million to finance the museum's acquisitions of 99 artworks, including masterpieces like ''[[Magdalene with the Smoking Flame]]'' by [[Georges de La Tour]], others by [[Rembrandt]], [[Watteau]] and [[Bernini]], and a suite of 42 French oil sketches. The donations were not made with any contractual stipulations that the works remain on view.<ref name="Jori Finkel 2020">Jori Finkel (February 25, 2020), [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/arts/design/lacma-ahmanson-foundation-suspends-donations.html Major LACMA Donor Suspends Longtime Acquisition Program] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> In 2020, the foundation suspended the acquisition program.<ref name="Jori Finkel 2020"/>

In the early 1970s [[Norton Simon]], the chairman of Norton Simon, Inc., which owned Avis Car Rental, Hunt's Foods, Max Factor Cosmetics, Canada Dry Corp., and McCall's Publishing, among other interests, agreed to take the financial responsibility of the troubled Pasadena Museum of Art. [[Norton Simon Museum]] He subsequently donated his extensive collection to the new entity, now the Norton Simon Museum of Art. He had earlier  made some indication of donating the work to LACMA.<ref name="nytimes01082008" /><ref name="latimes01152008" />

From 1946 to his death in 1951, [[William Randolph Hearst]] was LACMA's largest benefactor. He remains the largest donor to the museum in number of objects. His donations formed the museum's collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, medieval and early Renaissance sculptures, and much of the collection of European decorative arts.<ref name="LACMAartspaces" />

===Art councils===
Over the course of the LACMA's history, ten art councils—each supporting a specific area of the collection—have acquired or helped acquire nearly 5,000 works of art for the museum. The art councils comprise groups of art enthusiasts and professionals who pay a minimum of $400 a year in dues and organize projects to raise money for a favorite department.<ref>Jori Finkel (November 28, 2012), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-lacma-council-change-20121129,0,4250533.story Outcry as Los Angeles County Museum of Art raises patron fees] ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> Founded in 1952, the Art Museum Council is LACMA's first volunteer support council and supports the whole of the museum's endeavors.

===Collectors Committee===
Each year a distinguished group of donors contributes directly to the enrichment of LACMA's permanent collection through participation in the Collectors Committee, creating a fund to spend on art through purchasing tickets ranging between $15,000 and $60,000<ref name="Deborah Vankin 2014">Deborah Vankin (April 27, 2014), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-lacma-collectors-committee-2014-20140426,0,2703518.story LACMA curators lobby for new pieces at Collectors Committee event] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> for the event.<ref>Jori Finkel (April 19, 2011), [https://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/19/entertainment/la-et-lacma-acquisitions-20110419 LACMA hits the market] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> Once a year, the Collectors Committee members meet at the museum to hear acquisition proposals from the various curators.

==Programs==
In 1966 Maurice Tuchman, then curator of modern art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, introduced the Art and Technology (A&T) program.

===Board of trustees===
LACMA is governed by a Board of Trustees which sets policy and determines the museum's strategic direction. Board membership is one of the few concrete ways to measure philanthropy in the museum world. LACMA costs $100,000 to join; each board member commits to donating or raising at least another $100,000 a year for the nonprofit museum.<ref>Mike Boehm (November 2, 2009) [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/11/songwriter-carole-bayersager-and-two-others-join-lacmas-board.html Songwriter Carole Bayer Sager and two others join LACMA's board] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> The museum currently has over 50 active board members; 30 of them have joined since 2006, including [[Barbra Streisand]], songwriter [[Carole Bayer Sager]], collector [[Dasha Zhukova]], TV journalist [[Willow Bay]], producer [[Brian Grazer]], Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman [[Michael Lynton]], and TV presenter [[Ryan Seacrest]].<ref>Jori Finkel (October 28, 2010), [https://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/28/entertainment/la-et-art-museums-hollywood-20101028 Museums roll out the red carpet for Hollywood] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref><ref>David Ng (June 16, 2014), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-ryan-seacrest-trustees-lacma-20140616-story.html Ryan Seacrest, Ann Ziff among new trustees at LACMA] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> Since 2015, the board has been co-chaired by [[Elaine Wynn]] and [[Tony Ressler]].<ref>David Ng (June 18, 2015), [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-lacma-elaine-wynn-antony-ressler-20150618-story.html LACMA names new co-chairs Elaine Wynn, Antony Ressler] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>
