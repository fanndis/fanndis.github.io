At a 2017 event at [[Georgetown University]], she stated that religion "is not a women-friendly institution" and "has been used to justify oppressions that are based on the idea that women are not equal human beings."<ref>{{cite web |title=Award-Winning Author Adichie Explores Faith, Feminism at Georgetown Event |url=https://www.georgetown.edu/news/award-winning-author-adichie-explores-faith-feminism-at-georgetown-event/ |publisher=[[Georgetown University]] |access-date=29 January 2020 |date=17 March 2017}}</ref> She has called for Christian and Muslim leaders in Nigeria to preach messages of peace and togetherness.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Shariatmadari |first1=David |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie: religious leaders must help end Nigeria violence |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-nigeria-leaders |access-date=29 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2012}}</ref>

In 2017 and again in 2020, Adichie was criticised by some as [[transphobic]] — initially for saying that "we should not conflate the gender experiences of [[transgender]] women with that of [[womyn-born womyn|women born female]]",<ref name="Vox 2017-03-15"/><ref name="guard-2018-April"/> and secondly for defending [[JK Rowling]]'s heavily scrutinized essay on separating women's from transgender issues.<ref name="guard-2018-April"/> One of the critics was Nigerian author [[Akwaeke Emezi]], who had graduated from Adichie's [[writing workshop]].<ref name="Voice 2020-11-18"/> Adichie expressed concern that the trans debate is being used as an excuse to take away [[freedom of speech]] by labelling and aggressively trying to silence people who may not agree with trans activism, and that the trans movement wishes an erosion of women as a political and biological class.<ref name="YNaija"/> In 2020, she weighed into "all the noise" sparked by Rowling's article on sex and gender,<ref name="Guardian 2020-11-14"/> and defended Rowling's essay as being "a perfectly reasonable piece".<ref name="YNaija"/>

Adichie criticised "[[cancel culture]]", saying: "There's a sense in which you aren't allowed to learn and grow. Also forgiveness is out of the question. I find it so lacking in compassion."<ref name="Guardian 2020-11-14"/> 

==Writing career==
Ngozi Adichie's original and initial inspiration came from [[Chinua Achebe]], after reading his 1958 novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', at the age of 10;<ref name="newyorker1"/> Adichie was inspired by seeing her own life represented in the pages.<ref name="Ezebuiro"/> She has also named [[Buchi Emecheta]] as a Nigerian literary precursor, on whose death Adichie said: "Buchi Emecheta.

Adichie published a collection of poems in 1997 (''Decisions'') and a play (''For Love of Biafra'') in 1998.

Adichie's third book, ''[[The Thing Around Your Neck]]'' (2009), is a collection of 12 stories that explore the relationships between men and women, parents and children, Africa and the United States.

In 2010 she was listed among the authors of ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s "20 Under 40" Fiction Issue.<ref name="newyorker2"/> Adichie's story "Ceiling" was included in the 2011 edition of ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]''.

Adichie's short story, "My Mother, the Crazy African" discusses the problems that arise when facing two cultures that are complete opposites from each other. On one hand, there is a traditional [[Culture of Nigeria|Nigerian culture]] with clear gender roles, while in America there is more freedom in how genders act, and less restrictions on younger people. Ralindu, the protagonist, faces this challenge with her parents as she grew up in Philadelphia, while they grew up in Nigeria. Adichie dives deep into gender roles and traditions and what problems can occur because of this.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adichie |first1=Chimamada |title=My Mother, the Crazy African |url=http://www.webdelsol.com/InPosse/adichie_anthology.htm |website=Web Del Sol |publisher=Spectrum Publishers |access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>

In a 2014 interview, Adichie said on [[feminism]] and writing: "I think of myself as a storyteller but I would not mind at all if someone were to think of me as a feminist writer...

==Lectures==
Adichie spoke on "The Danger of a Single Story" for [[TED (conference)|TED]] in 2009.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|author=TEDGlobal 2009 |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story.html |title=Chimamanda Adichie: "The danger of a single story", TED, July 2009 |access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref> It has become one of the top ten most-viewed TED Talks of all time with more than fifteen million views.<ref name=":3"/> On 15 March 2012, she delivered the "Connecting Cultures" [[Commonwealth Foundation|Commonwealth Lecture]] 2012 at [[the Guildhall, London]].<ref name="commonwealth"/> Adichie also spoke on being a feminist for TEDxEuston in December 2012, with her speech entitled, "We should all be feminists".<ref name=FeministsYoutube>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc |title=We should all be feminists&nbsp;– Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at TEDxEuston |via=YouTube |date=12 April 2013 |access-date=30 August 2013}}</ref> It initiated a worldwide conversation on feminism and was published as a book in 2014.<ref name=":3"/> It was [[sampling (music)|sampled]] for the 2013 song "[[Flawless (Beyoncé Knowles song)|***Flawless]]" by American performer [[Beyoncé]], where it attracted further attention.

=== "The Danger of a Single Story" ===
Adichie spoke in a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk entitled "The Danger of a Single Story", posted in July 2009.<ref name=":0"/> In it, she expressed her concern for under-representation of various cultures.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story/transcript|title=Transcript of 'The danger of a single story'|last=Adichie|first=Chimamanda Ngozi|access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> She explained that as a young child, she had often read American and British stories where the characters were primarily of [[White people|Caucasian]] origin. At the lecture, she said that the under-representation of cultural differences could be dangerous: "Now, I loved those American and British books I read. They stirred my imagination and opened up new worlds for me. But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature."<ref name=":1"/>

Throughout the lecture, she used personal anecdotes to illustrate the importance of sharing different stories. She briefly talked about the houseboy that was working for her family whose name is Fide and said the only thing she knew about him was how poor his family was. However, when Adichie's family visited Fide's village, Fide's mother showed them a basket that Fide's brother had made, making her realize that she created her opinion about Fide based on only one story of him. Adichie said, "It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something. All I had heard about them was how poor they were, so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor. Their poverty was my single story of them."<ref name=":1"/> She also said that on leaving Nigeria to go to [[Drexel University]], she encountered the effects of the under-representation of her own culture. Her American roommate was surprised that Adichie was fluent in English and that she did not listen to tribal music.<ref>{{Cite web|last=TED|title=The danger of a single story {{!}} Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|date=7 October 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg|access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref> She said of this: "My roommate had a single story of Africa: a single story of catastrophe. In this single story, there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way, no possibility of feelings more complex than pity, no possibility of a connection as human equals."<ref name=":1"/>

Adichie concluded the lecture by noting the significance of different stories in various cultures and the representation that they deserve. She advocated for a greater understanding of stories because people are complex, saying that by understanding only a single story, one misinterprets people, their backgrounds and their histories.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Danger of a Single Story|url=https://lanetwork.facinghistory.org/the-danger-of-a-single-story-2/|last=Brown|first=Annie|website=lanetwork.facinghistory.org|language=en-us|date= 2 May 2013|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref>

==="We should all be feminists"===
In 2012, Adichie gave a [[TEDx]] talk entitled: "We should all be feminists", delivered at TedXEuston in London, which has been viewed more than five million times.<ref name=FeministsYoutube/> She shared her experiences of being an African feminist, and her views on gender construction and sexuality. Adichie said that the problem with gender is that it shapes who we are.<ref name=FeministsYoutube/> She also said: "I am angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. We should all be angry. Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change, but in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better."<ref>[http://vialogue.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/ted-we-should-all-be-feminists-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-at-tedxeuston-transcript/ "TED | We should all be feminists&nbsp;– Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at TEDxEuston (transcript)"]. Vialogue, 30 December 2013.</ref>

===="Flawless" song====
{{Listen|pos=right|filename=Beyonce - Flawless.ogg|title="Flawless"|description="Flawless" contains samples of Beyoncé's song "Bow Down / I Been On", and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's speech "We should all be feminists".|format=[[Ogg]]|}}

Parts of Adichie's TEDx talk were sampled in [[Beyoncé]]'s song "[[Flawless (Beyoncé song)|Flawless]]" in December 2013.<ref>Raymer, Miles (4 September 2014), [http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/09/04/beyonce-flawless-billboard-hot-100/ "'Billboard' Hot 100 recap: Beyonce's 'Flawless' finally hits the chart"], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.</ref>
[[HarperCollins#Imprints|Fourth Estate]] published an essay based on the speech as a standalone volume, ''[[We Should All Be Feminists]]'', in 2014. Adichie later said in an [[NPR]] interview that "anything that gets young people talking about feminism is a very good thing."<ref name="NPR"/> She later qualified the statement in an interview with the Dutch newspaper ''[[De Volkskrant]]'': "Another thing I hated was that I read everywhere: now people finally know her, thanks to Beyoncé, or: she must be very grateful. I found that disappointing. I thought: I am a writer and I have been for some time and I refuse to perform in this charade that is now apparently expected of me: 'Thanks to Beyoncé, my life will never be the same again.' That's why I didn't speak about it much."<ref name="volkskrant.nl"/>

Adichie has clarified that her particular feminism differs from Beyoncé's, particularly in their disagreements about the role occupied by men in women's lives, saying: "Her style is not my style but I do find it interesting that she takes a stand in political and social issues since a few years. She portrays a woman who is in charge of her own destiny, who does her own thing, and she has girl power. I am very taken with that."<ref name="volkskrant.nl"/> Nevertheless, she has been outspoken against critics who question the singer's credentials as a feminist and said that "Whoever says they're feminist is bloody feminist."<ref name="clutch"/>
