==History==

Agence France-Presse has its origins in the [[Agence Havas]], founded in 1835 in Paris by [[Charles-Louis Havas]], making it the world's oldest news service.<ref name="Toal">{{Cite book |last=Toal |first=Gerard |editor1-first=Nigel |editor1-last=Thrift |editor2-first=Adam |editor2-last=Tickell |editor3-first=Steve |editor3-last=Woolgar |editor4-first=William H. |editor4-last=Rupp |year=2014 |title=Globalization in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATwTDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA199 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=199 |isbn=978-0199212620}}</ref><ref name="Broderick">{{cite book |author1=James F.

In 1940, when [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German forces occupied France during World War II]], the news agency was taken over by the authorities and renamed "[[Office français d'information]]" (French Information Office); only the private advertising company retained the name [[Havas]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25728734|title = L'Office Français d'Information (1940-1944)|journal = Revue d'Histoire de la Deuxième Guerre Mondiale|volume = 26|issue = 101|pages = 19–40|last1 = Palmer|first1 = M. B.|year = 1976}}</ref> On 20 August 1944, as [[Liberation of Paris|Allied forces moved on Paris]], a group of journalists in the [[French Resistance]] seized the offices of the FIO and issued the first news dispatch from the liberated city under the name of Agence France-Presse.

Established as a [[state enterprise]], AFP devoted the post-war years to developing its network of international correspondents. One of them was the first Western journalist to report the death of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] on 6 March 1953.
AFP was keen to shake off its semi-official status, and on 10 January 1957, the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]] passed a law establishing its independence. Since that date, the proportion of the agency's revenues generated by subscriptions from government departments has steadily declined. Such subscriptions represented 115 million Euros in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/budget/plf2012/a3806-tvii.asp#P115_11426 |title=N° 3806 tome VII – Avis de M. Michel Françaix sur le projet de loi de finances pour 2012 (n°3775) |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>

In 1982, the agency began to decentralize its editorial decision-making by setting up the first of its five autonomous regional centres, in Hong Kong, then a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Crown colony]]. Each region has its own budget, [[Administration (business)|administrative director]] and [[Editor-in-chief|chief editor]]. In September 2007, the AFP Foundation was launched to promote higher standards of journalism worldwide.

In 1991, AFP set up a joint venture with [[Extel]] to create a financial news service, [[AFX News]].<ref>AFP and Financial Wires Encroach on Original Market : Reuters News: Clients Defect.

In October 2008, the [[Government of France]] announced moves to change AFP's status, including the involvement of outside investors. On  27 November of that year, the main trade unions represented in the company's home base of France – the [[CGT (France)|CGT]], [[Force Ouvrière]], [[Syndicat national des journalistes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snj.fr/ |title=Bienvenue sur le site du SNJ |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref> [[Union syndicale des journalistes CFDT]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journalistes-cfdt.fr/ |title=Actualités |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref> and SUD, launched an online petition to oppose what they saw as an attempt to [[privatise]] the agency.

On 10 December 2009, the French Culture Minister [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] announced that he was setting up a Committee of Experts under former AFP CEO Henri Pigeat to study plans for the agency's future status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sos-afp.org/en/experts_committee |title=December 2009: Government Sets up Committee to Study Agency's Future |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116221320/http://www.sos-afp.org/en/experts_committee |archive-date=16 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On February 24, 2010, Pierre Louette unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as CEO by the end of March, and move to a job with [[France Télécom]].

In November 2013, AFP and [[Getty Images]] were ordered to pay $1.2 million compensation to freelance photojournalist Daniel Morel for using his images posted on [[Twitter]] related to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] without his permission, in violation of copyright and Twitter's terms of service.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/22/us-media-copyright-twitter-idUSBRE9AL16F20131122|title=Photographer wins $1.2 million from companies that took pictures off Twitter|last=Ax|first=Joseph|date=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict|title=Getty Images disappointed at $1.2m Morel verdict|last=Laurent|first=Olivier|date=November 24, 2013|work=British Journal of Photography|publisher=Incisive Media|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126170747/http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/2308888/getty-images-disappointed-at-usd12m-morel-verdict|archivedate=November 26, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2013}}</ref>

==Statutes==
AFP operates under a 1957 law as a commercial business independent of the [[Politics of France|French government]]. AFP is administered by a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and a board comprising 15 members:
* Eight representatives of the French [[Mass media|press]];
* Two representatives of the AFP personnel;
* Two representatives of the government-owned radio and television;
* Three representatives of the government. One is named by the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], another by the [[Minister of Finance (France)|minister of finance]], and a third by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|minister of foreign affairs]].

The mission of AFP is defined in its [[statute]]:<ref name="afp-statutes">{{cite web |url=http://www.sos-afp.org/en/statutes |title=Full Text of AFP's Statutes in English |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref>
* Agence France-Presse may under no circumstances take account of influences or considerations liable to compromise the exactitude or the objectivity of the information it provides; it may under no circumstances fall under the control, either de facto or de jure, of any ideological, political or economic grouping;
* Agence France-Presse must, to the full extent that its resources permit, develop and enhance its organisation so as to provide French and foreign users with exact, impartial and trustworthy information on a regular and uninterrupted basis;
* Agence France-Presse must, to the full extent that its resources permit, ensure the existence of a network of facilities giving it the status of a worldwide information service.

The board elects the CEO for a renewable term of three years. The AFP also has a council charged with ensuring that the agency operates according to its statutes, which mandate absolute [[independence]] and neutrality. Editorially, AFP is governed by a network of senior journalists.

The primary client of AFP is the French government, which purchases subscriptions for its various services. In practice, those subscriptions are an indirect [[subsidy]] to AFP. The statutes of the agency prohibit direct government subsidies.
