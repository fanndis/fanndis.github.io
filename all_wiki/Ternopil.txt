Until 1944, it was known mostly as '''Tarnopol'''. Ternopil is one of the major cities of Western Ukraine and the historical regions of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Podolia]]. It is served by [[Ternopil Airport]]. 
In 2020, the population of Ternopil was estimated at {{Ua-pop-est2020|223,462}}

==Administrative status==
The city is the [[administrative center]] of [[Ternopil Oblast]] ([[Oblasts of Ukraine|region]]), as well as of the surrounding [[Ternopil Raion]] ([[Raions of Ukraine|district]]) within the oblast. However, Ternopil is a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of regional significance]], thus being subject directly to the oblast authorities rather than to the raion administration which is housed in the city as well.

The city's coat of arms is based on the Tarnowski family [[Leliwa coat of arms]].

In 1544 the [[Tarnopol Castle]] was completed and repelled the first [[Tatars|Tatar]] attacks. On 20 January 1548, Tarnopol was granted legal rights by the King of Poland [[Sigismund I the Old]] which allowed the town to hold three fairs annually, and the weekly trades on Mondays.<ref name=500ofTern/> Tarnopol received [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg city rights]] two years later from Jan Tarnowski, regulating the duties of town residents.<ref name=500ofTern/> In 1548 the King of Poland also gave permission to create a pond near the Tarnopol suburb of Kutkovets.<ref name=500ofTern/> In 1549 the city managed to survive a Tatar siege by efforts of the Polish Duchess Eudokia Czartoryska (see [[House of Czartoryski]]).<ref name=500ofTern/> After the death of the Crown Hetman in 1561, Tarnopol became the property of his son [[Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski]],<ref name=500ofTern/> who died childless in 1567.

With the ongoing 1648–1654 [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], many residents of the city joined the ranks of the Khmelnytsky forces particularly during the 1649 [[Siege of Zbarazh]] that is located just {{convert|20|km|miles|abbr=on}}.<ref name=hvacukr>[http://ukrssr.com.ua/ternop/viniknennya-mista-ternopil Establishment and development of the Ternopil city (Виникнення і розвиток міста Тернопіль)].</ref> In September 1655 the united army of Muscovite and Ukrainian Cossack forces occupied Ternopil among other cities as it was moving towards Lwow ([[Lviv]]).<ref name=hvacukr/>

During the [[Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676)|1672–1676 Polish–Ottoman War]], Tarnopol was almost completely destroyed by Turkish forces of Ibrahim Shishman Pasha in 1675 and rebuilt by [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]] but did not recover its previous glory until it passed to [[Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d'Arquien|Marie Casimire]], the wife of king [[John III Sobieski]] in 1690. The city was later sacked for the last time by Tatars in 1694, and twice by [[Russians]] in the course of the [[Great Northern War]] in 1710 and the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1733. In 1747 [[Józef Potocki]] invited the [[Dominican Order|Dominicanes]] and founded the beautiful late-[[baroque]] Dominican Church (today the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Ternopil|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of The Blessed Virgin Mary]] of the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Ternopil–Zboriv|Ternopil-Zboriv archeparchy]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]). The city was looted during the [[Confederation of Bar]] (1768–1772) by the confederates, the king's army, and by the Russians. In 1770 it was devastated by an outbreak of [[smallpox]].<ref name=hvacukr/>

In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city came under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] rule. In 1809, after the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], the city came under Russian rule, incorporated into the newly created ''Ternopol krai''. In 1815 the city (then with 11,000 residents) returned to Austrian rule in accordance with the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In 1820 [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] expelled from [[Polotsk|Polatsk]] by the Russians established a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Tarnopol. In 1843 the last city's owner Jerzy Michal of Turkul sold the city to its residents for 175,000 [[florin]]s.<ref name=500ofTern/> In 1870 the [[Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis]] connected Tarnopol with [[Lemberg]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], accelerating the city's growth. At that time Tarnopol had a population of about 25,000.

In 1920 the exiled [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] of [[Symon Petliura|Symon Petlura]] accepted Polish control of Tarnopol and of the entire area after receiving the assurance of [[Józef Piłsudski]], the Lithuanian born Field Marshal of the Polish Army, that there would be no peace with the Russians without creating a Ukrainian state. In July and August 1920 the [[Red Army]] captured Tarnopol in the course of the [[Polish–Soviet War|Polish-Soviet War]]. The city then served as the capital of the [[Galician Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Although the Poles and their Ukrainian allies badly defeated the Russians on the battle field and the Russians had offered to cede Ukraine and Belarus, Polish politicians in Warsaw refused to honor Piłsudski's promise. By the terms of the [[Riga treaty]], the Soviets and Poles effectively partitioned Ukraine. For the next 19 years, the ethnically mixed Ternopol area remained in Polish control.

From 1922 to September 1939, Tarnopol served as the capital of the [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]] that consisted of 17 [[powiat]]s.

===Invasion of Poland===
[[File:Tarnopolskie.gif|thumb|upright|[[Tarnopol Voivodeship]]]]

At the onset of World War II, the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] began on September 17, 1939. The Red Army entered eastern Poland in furtherance of the secret [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and contrary to the [[Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]. Tarnopol was captured, renamed Ternopol, and incorporated into the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] under [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopol Oblast]]. The Soviets made it their first priority to decimate Polish intelligentsia and destroy Polish culture. Ukrainian nationalist leaders were imprisoned. Mass arrests, torture and executions of Ukrainians and Poles and Jews followed. The Soviets also carried out mass deportations of the "enemies of the working class" to [[Kazakhstan]]. In practice, this translated into members of the former state administration, police, border service and land and business owners, Christians and Jews alike.<ref name="sztetl.org">{{cite web | url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/pl/article/tarnopol/5,historia/?action=view&page=2 | title=Tarnopol | publisher=[[Virtual Shtetl]] (Wirtualny Sztetl) | work=Historia - Społeczność żydowska przed 1989 | date=2015 | access-date=31 July 2015 | author1=Robert Kuwałek | author2=Eugeniusz Riadczenko | author3=Adam Dylewski | author4=Justyna Filochowska | author5=Michał Czajka | pages=3–4 of 5 | language=pl}}</ref>

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, the ethnic Polish population of Tarnopol and its region was [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|forcibly deported to postwar Poland]] and settled in, and near [[Wrocław]] (among other locations), as part of Stalinist ethnic cleansing in the [[Soviet Ukraine]].<ref name="Ciesielski">{{cite book |author1=Włodzimierz Borodziej |author2=Ingo Eser |author3=Stanisław Jankowiak |author4=Jerzy Kochanowski |author5=Claudia Kraft |author6=Witold Stankowski |author7=Katrin Steffen |title=Przesiedlenie ludności polskiej z Kresów Wschodnich do Polski 1944–1947 |trans-title=Resettlement of Poles from Kresy 1944–1947 |year=1999 |editor=Stanisław Ciesielski |pages=29, 50, 468 |publisher=Neriton |location=[[Warsaw]] |isbn=83-86842-56-3 |language=pl |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qsUqAAAAMAAJ&q=Ukrainy}}</ref> In the following decades, Ternopol was rebuilt in a typical Soviet style and only a few buildings were reconstructed.

=== Jewish Ternopil ===
[[File:Old synagogue in Ternopil, western Ukraine.gif|thumb|200px|Tarnopol Synagogue prior to destruction during [[World War II]]]]
[[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] settled in Ternopil beginning at its founding and soon formed a majority of the population. During the 16th and 17th centuries there were 300 Jewish families in the city. The Great Synagogue of Ternopil was built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] Survival style between 1622 and 1628.<ref>Sergey R. Kravtsov, "Gothic Survival in [[Synagogue architecture|Synagogue Architecture]] of Ruthenia, Podolia and Volhynia in the 17th–18th Centuries," ''Architectura. Zeitschrift für Geschichte der Baukunst/ Journal of the History of Architecture'', vol. 1 (2005), 70.</ref>

After the [[first partition of Poland]], Ternopil came under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] domination. Nevertheless, [[Joseph Perl]] was able to continue his efforts to improve the condition of the Jews, which he had begun under the Russian rule. In 1813 he established a Jewish school which had as its chief object the instruction of Jewish youth in [[German language|German]] as well as in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and in various other subjects. Controversy between the traditional Hasidim and the modernising [[Haskalah|Maskilim]] which this school caused, resulted four years later in a victory for the latter, whereupon the institution received official recognition and was placed under communal control. Starting in 1863, the school policy was gradually modified by Polish influences, and very little attention was given to instruction in German. The ''[[Tempel für Geregelten Gottesdienst]]'', opened by [[Perl]] in 1819, also caused dissensions within the community, and its rabbi, [[Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport]], was forced to withdraw. This dispute also was eventually settled in favour of the Maskilim. As of 1905, the Jewish community numbered 14,000 in a total population of 30,415. Jews took control of the active import/export trade with Russia conducted through the border city of [[Pidvolochysk]]. In 1939, the Jewish population was 18,500.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Tarnopol |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/tarnopol |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>

====The Holocaust====
In 1941, soon after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], 2,000 Jews were killed in a pogrom.<ref name="sztetl.org"/>

In September 1941, the Germans announced the creation of the [[Tarnopol Ghetto]] for Jews still remaining in the city. In the winter of 1941–42, 
mortality in the ghetto escalated to such a degree that the ''[[Judenrat]]'' was forced to bury the dead in a common grave. Between August 1942 to June 1943 there were 5 "selections" that depleted the Jewish population of the ghetto by sending the Jews to [[Belzec extermination camp]]. A few hundred Jews from Tarnopol and its vicinity attempted to survive by hiding within the town limits. Many were denounced to the Germans, including some 200 people shortly before the Soviets liberated the area. A number of Jews [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|survived by hiding with the Poles]].<ref name="yadvashem">{{cite web |title=Tarnopol Historical Background |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/historical_background/tarnopol.asp |publisher=Yad Vashem |access-date=9 March 2014}}</ref> A monument in memory of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims was built at Petrikovsky Yar in 1996.<ref name=eajc>{{cite web |script-title=ru:В Тернополе осквернили памятник жертвам Холокоста |language=ru |url=http://eajc.org/page16/news33362.html |publisher=Евроазиатский Еврейский Конгресс |date=2012-09-25 |access-date=27 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Fc62w6kH?url=http://eajc.org/page16/news33362.html |archive-date=3 April 2013 }}</ref> On September 19, 2012, the monument was desecrated, in what seems to be an [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] act.<ref name=eajc />

====After WWII====

[[File:Тернопіль. Знак при в'їзді з боку Великої Березовиці.jpg|Welcome sign at southern entrance to the city|thumb]]
Following [[Potsdam Conference]] in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|borders were redrawn]] and Tarnopol (then again, Терно́поль) was incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Polish population was [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|resettled to new Poland]] before the end of 1946. Following the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Ternopil has become part of the independent [[Ukraine]].

In 2013 the mayor of the city [[Serhiy Nadal]] issued an order which announced the 2013 year as the year of [[Jan Tarnowski (1550–1605)|Jan Tarnowski]], the Crown Hetman and Voivode.<ref>Larysa Osadchuk.
