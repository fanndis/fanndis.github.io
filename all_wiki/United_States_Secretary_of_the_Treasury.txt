The '''Secretary of the Treasury''' is the head of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]],<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|31|301}}</ref> which is concerned with all financial and monetary matters relating to the federal government, and, until 2003, also included several major federal law enforcement agencies. The Secretary of the Treasury is the principal economic advisor to the [[President of the United States]] and plays a critical role in policy-making by bringing an economic and government financial policy perspective to issues facing the federal government. The Secretary of the Treasury is a member of the [[United States Cabinet]], and is nominated by the [[President of the United States]]. Nominees for Secretary of the Treasury undergo a confirmation hearing before the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance]], prior to a vote by the [[United States Senate]].

The Secretary of the Treasury, the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] are generally regarded as the four most important Cabinet officials, due to the size and importance of their respective departments.<ref>''Cabinets and Counselors: The President and the Executive Branch'' (1997). [[Congressional Quarterly]]. p. 87.</ref> The Secretary of the Treasury is a non-statutory member of the [[United States National Security Council]] and is fifth in the [[United States presidential line of succession]].

The secretary along with the [[treasurer of the United States]] must sign [[Federal Reserve notes]] before they can become legal tender.{{elucidate|date=April 2017}} The secretary also manages the [[United States Emergency Economic Stabilization fund]].

Most of the department's [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] such as the [[U.S. Customs Service]], the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives]] (ATF), and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] were reassigned to other departments in 2003 in conjunction with the creation of the [[Department of Homeland Security]].

Secretary of the Treasury is a [[Executive Schedule|Level I position in the Executive Schedule]] and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level (currently [[US Dollar|US$]]210,700).<ref name="UnitedStatesCode|5|5312"/>
