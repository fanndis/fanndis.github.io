In the United States, a '''special counsel''' (formerly called '''special prosecutor''' or '''independent counsel''') is a [[lawyer]] appointed to [[Criminal investigation|investigate]], and potentially [[prosecution|prosecute]], a particular case of suspected wrongdoing for which a [[conflict of interest]] exists for the usual prosecuting authority. Other jurisdictions have similar systems.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-idUSKBN16D0EC|first=Ju-min |last=Park|title=South Korea prosecutor paves way for charges against Park if impeachment upheld|date=March 6, 2017 |work=Reuters|access-date=March 14, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About Special Prosecutors|url=http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/criminal-justice/bc-prosecution-service/about/special-prosecutors |publisher=British Columbia government|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> For example, the investigation of an [[allegation]] against a sitting [[President of the United States|president]] or [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] might be handled by a special prosecutor rather than by an ordinary prosecutor who would otherwise be in the position of investigating their own superior. Investigations into other persons connected to the government but not in a position of direct authority over the prosecutor, such as cabinet secretaries or election campaigns, have also been handled by special prosecutors.

While the most prominent special prosecutors have been those appointed since the 1870s to investigate presidents and those connected to them, the term can also be used to refer to any prosecutor appointed to avoid a conflict of interest or appearance thereof. The concept originates in state law: "state courts have traditionally appointed special prosecutors when the regular government attorney was disqualified from a case, whether for incapacitation or interest."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Federal Special Prosecutor in American Politics|last=Harriger|first=Katy|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=1992|isbn=0-7006-0535-5|location=Lawrence, KS|pages=3}}</ref> Because district attorneys' offices work closely with police, some activists argue that cases of police misconduct at the state and local level should be handled by special prosecutors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.justiceinpolicing.com/policy-reforms/independent-oversight/policy-11-special-or-independent-prosecutors/|title=Policy 11: Special or Independent Prosecutors {{!}} Justice in Policing Toolkit|website=www.justiceinpolicing.com|language=en-US|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref>

==Terminology==
The terms 'special prosecutor', 'independent counsel', and 'special counsel' have the same fundamental meaning, and their use (at least at the federal level in the U.S.) is generally differentiated by the time period to which they are being applied. The term 'special prosecutor' was used throughout the Watergate era, but was replaced by the less confrontational 'independent counsel' in the 1983 reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Jim|last=Mokhiber |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/history.html|title=The Office - A Brief History Of The Independent Counsel Law {{!}} Secrets Of An Independent Counsel |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> Those appointed under that act after 1983 are generally referred to as 'independent counsels'. Since the independent counsel law expired in 1999, the term 'special counsel' has been used. This is the term used in the current U.S. government regulations concerning the appointment of special counsels, such as [[Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Title 28 CFR]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=e-CFR: TITLE 28—Judicial Administration|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=28f9a33cf15632118467b6a4974270e0&mc=true&node=pt28.2.600&rgn=div5|language=en-US|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref>

While the term 'special prosecutor' is sometimes used in historical discussions of such figures before 1983, the term 'special counsel' appears to have been frequently used as well, including, for example, in contemporary newspaper accounts<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/12/10/79262594.pdf|title=THE WHISKY RING FRAUDS.; THE PROSECUTIONS IN ST.

==United States appointment at the federal level==
===History of appointments===
====Pre-Watergate====
The first federal special prosecutor, [[John B. Henderson]], was appointed by [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] in 1875 to investigate the [[Whiskey Ring]] scandal. After attempting to stifle Henderson's investigation of the president's personal secretary, Grant fired Henderson on the basis that Henderson's statements to a grand jury regarding Grant were impertinent.<ref name="govinfo.library.unt.edu">{{Cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/oic/SMALTZ/speeches/GTLJ.htm|title=OIC Smaltz: Speeches and Articles: Georgetown Law Journal: A View From Inside|website=govinfo.library.unt.edu|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> Following criticism, Grant appointed a new special prosecutor, [[James Broadhead]], to continue the investigation.

[[James A. Garfield|James Garfield]] appointed the next special prosecutor, William Cook, in 1881 to investigate the [[Star route scandal]]. Cook continued his investigation into the [[Chester A. Arthur|Chester Arthur]] administration. Under the [[Theodore Roosevelt]] administration, special prosecutors were appointed to investigate two scandals. In 1903, Roosevelt appointed two special prosecutors (a Democrat and a Republican) to investigate allegations of bribery at the Post Office Department. In 1905, Roosevelt's attorney general, [[Philander C. Knox|Philander Knox]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations|last=Greenberg|first=Gerald|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|isbn=0-313-30735-0|location=Westport, CT|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl0000unse/page/164 164–166]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl0000unse/page/164}}</ref> appointed [[Francis J. Heney|Francis Heney]] special prosecutor to investigate the [[Oregon land fraud scandal]].

[[Calvin Coolidge]] appointed two special counsels, [[Atlee Pomerene]] and [[Owen Roberts]] to investigate the [[Teapot Dome scandal]]. This appointment was unique in that it was mandated under a special Congressional joint resolution, and was subject to approval in the Senate, similarly to a cabinet appointment.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/teapotdome.htm|first=Leslie E. |last=Bennett|title=A summary of the Teapot Dome scandal from the Brookings Institution|website=academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> This process was unique in the history of federal special prosecutors.

In 1952, [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] appointed [[Newbold Morris]] "special assistant to the Attorney General" to investigate the corruption at the Bureau of Internal Revenue following Congressional pressure and calls for a special prosecutor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations|last=Greenberg|first=Gerald|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2000|isbn=0-313-30735-0|location=Westport, CT|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl0000unse/page/231 231–233]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl0000unse/page/231}}</ref> After Morris submitted a lengthy questionnaire on personal finances to be completed by all senior executive officers, he was fired by Attorney General [[J. Howard McGrath|Howard McGrath]], who was in turn fired by the president. Following the appointment of a new attorney general, the investigation was continued through regular channels.

====Watergate====
Before his May 25, 1973, appointment as [[Richard Nixon]]'s attorney general, [[Elliot Richardson|Elliott Richardson]] had agreed at his Senate confirmation hearing to appoint a [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] special prosecutor, and so immediately on taking office appointed [[Archibald Cox]] under a special one-time regulation.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43112.pdf|accessdate=April 26, 2019|title=Independent Counsels, Special Prosecutors, Special Counsels, and the Role of Congress|last=Maskell|first=Jack|date=June 20, 2013|work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] }}</ref> As part of his investigation, in July of that year, Cox first requested and then subpoenaed the [[Nixon White House tapes]]; secret recordings Nixon had made of conversations in the Oval Office and elsewhere. The Nixon administration refused to produce the tapes citing [[executive privilege]], and the dispute was fought in court until October.

After a Court of Appeals instructed the president to comply with the special prosecutor's subpoena, Nixon ordered the special prosecutor fired. In a [[constitutional crisis]] that became known as the [[Saturday Night Massacre]], both the attorney general and deputy attorney general (who had both made promises regarding the special prosecutor in their Senate confirmation hearings) resigned rather than carry out the order to fire Cox. [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] [[Robert Bork]], who was third in line at the Department of Justice, then fired Cox. Initially, the Nixon White House announced that the office of the special prosecutor had been abolished, but after public outcry Nixon instead had Bork appoint [[Leon Jaworski]] as the second Watergate special prosecutor. The firing was ruled illegal in the case of ''Nader v. Bork'', but, as a new special prosecutor had already been appointed, the case was already moot when decided, and the decision was never appealed past the [[United States district court|district court]].<ref name="Nader v. Bork">{{Cite news |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/366/104/1502657/|title=Nader v. Bork, 366 F. Supp. 104 (D.D.C. 1973)|work=Justia Law|access-date=March 14, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Jaworski continued Cox's pursuit of the White House tapes, but Nixon resisted. He raised [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] questions under the U.S. Constitution. Since the special counsel is a member of the [[Executive Branch|executive branch]], Nixon argued that the special counsel is ultimately answerable to the president and that the president could not be compelled by a subpoena issued by his own subordinate. The tapes were ultimately released following the Supreme Court decision in ''[[United States v. Nixon]]''. Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, and Jaworski resigned about two and a half months later, to be replaced by his (and Cox's) deputy, Henry Ruth Jr.—who in turn resigned in 1975, leaving [[Charles Ruff]] the fourth and final Watergate special prosecutor.

Acting under his existing appointment as Watergate special prosecutor, Ruff conducted an unrelated investigation into whether Gerald Ford had misused campaign funds while a congressman, clearing the new president of any wrongdoing.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Gerald |year=2000 |title=Historical Encyclopedia of U.S. Independent Counsel Investigations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOgCthdaJqIC&pg=PA293 |location=Westport, CT |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-313-30735-0 |oclc=918095805 |pages=293–295}}</ref>

====Ethics in Government Act====
Inspired in part by Watergate, in 1978 Congress passed the [[Ethics in Government Act]]. Title VI of this act was known as the Special Prosecutor Act and later renamed the Independent Counsel Act, which established formal rules for the appointment of a special prosecutor. The appointment of special prosecutors varied in important ways from appointments made before and since. Majorities of either party within the House or Senate Judiciary Committee could formally request the attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor on a particular matter, but the decision of whether or not to appoint the independent counsel remained with the attorney general and was not reviewable in court. If the attorney general decided not to appoint an independent counsel in response to such a request, they were only required to respond in writing with the reasons.<ref name=":3" /> Although the decision to appoint a special prosecutor was still made by the attorney general, the actual selection of the special prosecutor was made by a three-judge panel called the Special Division, selected from the Courts of Appeals.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/special.html|title=The Office - What Is The Special Division? {{!}} Secrets of an Independent Counsel |work=FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> The law did not allow special prosecutors to be removed except under specific circumstances such as wrongdoing or incapacitation. The special prosecutor provisions in the bill were temporary but were reauthorized by Congress in 1983 and 1987, expiring five years later in 1992; they were reinstated for another five years in 1994 before expiring again in 1999. The [[constitutionality]] of the law was affirmed by a 7–1 decision of the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Morrison v. Olson]]''.

Roughly twenty special prosecutors (called independent counsels after 1983) were appointed under the Ethics in Government Act and its reauthorizations<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/office/chart.html|title=The Office - Independent Counsel Investigations, 1978 To The Present {{!}} Secrets of an Independent Counsel |work=FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> during the [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]] administrations. These include significant investigations into the [[Iran–Contra affair]] and the [[Whitewater controversy]], the latter of which ultimately led to the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] over the [[Lewinsky scandal]]. Numerous smaller investigations into cabinet secretaries for relatively minor offenses, such as drug use, were also carried out by independent counsels during this period.

====Whitewater Scandal====

During the period 1992–1994 when the independent counsel provisions were not in force, Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] appointed [[Robert B. Fiske|Robert Fiske]] special counsel to investigate Whitewater. When the law was reauthorized in 1994, Reno invoked it to order an independent counsel be appointed to investigate Whitewater, and suggested Fiske continue in that role. Instead, [[Ken Starr]] was given the job by the three-judge panel. Starr resigned and was replaced by [[Robert Ray (prosecutor)|Robert Ray]] in 1999 just before the expiration of the independent counsel statute.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Starr's Chosen Successor Draws Praise, Criticism |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/17/news/mn-23285 |agency=From ''The Washington Post'' |date=1999-10-17 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=March 14, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Ray formally concluded the Whitewater investigation in 2003.

===Current regulations===
Since the expiration of the independent counsel statute in 1999, there has been no federal statutory law governing the appointment of a special counsel. Upon the law's expiration in 1999, the Justice Department, under Attorney General Janet Reno, promulgated procedural regulations governing the appointment of special counsels.

====Waco siege====
In 1999, these regulations were used by Reno to appoint [[John Danforth]] special counsel to investigate the FBI's handling of the [[Waco siege]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/ag/speeches/1999/agwaco9999.htm|title=09-09-99: PRESS CONFERENCE WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL JANET RENO RE: APPOINTMENT OF FORMER SENATOR JOHN DANFORTH TO HEAD WACO PROBE|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref>

====Plame affair====
In 2003, during the [[George W. Bush]] administration, [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] was appointed special counsel to investigate the [[Plame affair]] by [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[James Comey]] after the [[Judicial disqualification|recusal]] of Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]].

On May 17, 2017, former [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] was appointed special counsel to take over the previous FBI investigation of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election]] by Deputy Attorney General [[Rod Rosenstein]] after the recusal of Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]].<ref name="Appointment of Special Prosecutor">{{cite web|title=Appointment of Special Prosecutor|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/appointment-special-counsel|website=Department of Justice|publisher=Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Legal authority==
In 1999, the [[Department of Justice (United States)|Department of Justice]] under Attorney General Janet Reno promulgated regulations for the future appointment of special counsels. As of 2018, these regulations remain in effect in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28, part 600 (28 CFR §600).<ref name=":0" /> The regulations restrict the power to fire the special counsel into the hands of the attorney general alone, and they forbid the firing of the special counsel without good cause. They are internal Department of Justice regulations deriving their power from various acts of Congress, such as U.S. Code, Title 28, section 510 (28 U.S.C. 510).<ref>{{cite web |title=28 U.S. Code § 510 - Delegation of authority |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/510 |website=Cornell Law School |accessdate=November 8, 2018|quote=The Attorney General may from time to time make such provisions as he considers appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, employee, or agency of the Department of Justice of any function of the Attorney General.}}</ref> Congress has the power to directly limit the firing of special counsels or to delegate that power to the Attorney General. An agency regulation promulgated within the authority granted by statute has the force and effect of law, is binding upon the body that issues it, and can't be arbitrarily revoked.<ref name="Nader v. Bork"/>

The existence of a law or regulations specifying the process to appoint a special counsel has not stopped the attorney general (or acting attorney general) from using their statutory authority to appoint a special counsel by other means, as has happened twice. Despite the passage of the Ethics in Government Act the previous year, [[Paul J. Curran|Paul Curran]] was appointed to investigate Jimmy Carter's peanut business in 1979 under the attorney general's statutory authority (and was selected by him rather than by a three-judge panel as under the law), ostensibly because the alleged wrongdoing preceded the passage of the act.<ref name="govinfo.library.unt.edu"/> Patrick Fitzgerald's appointment as special counsel in 2003 was specifically not made under the 28 CFR 600 regulation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/archive/osc/documents/2006_03_17_exhibits_a_d.pdf|title=December 30, 2003 Letter from Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey to Patrick J. Fitzgerald|date=December 30, 2003|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The special counsel regulations specify that a special counsel must be a lawyer from outside the US government, while Fitzgerald was already a federal prosecutor at the time of his appointment.

===Initiating a special counsel investigation===
The decision to appoint a special counsel rests with the attorney general (or acting attorney general). The current special counsel regulations specify that:<ref name=":0" />

{{quote|The Attorney General, or in cases in which the Attorney General is recused, the Acting Attorney General, will appoint a Special Counsel when he or she determines that criminal investigation of a person or matter is warranted and—
{{plainlist|
*(a) That investigation or prosecution of that person or matter by a United States Attorney's Office or litigating Division of the Department of Justice would present a conflict of interest for the Department or other extraordinary circumstances; and
*(b) That under the circumstances, it would be in the public interest to appoint an outside Special Counsel to assume responsibility for the matter.}}}}

The attorney general sets the subject jurisdiction of the special counsel:

{{quote|The jurisdiction of a Special Counsel shall be established by the Attorney General. The Special Counsel will be provided with a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated. The jurisdiction of a Special Counsel shall also include the authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses; and to conduct appeals arising out of the matter being investigated and/or prosecuted.}}

The choice of whom to appoint is to be made by the attorney general with the following guidelines:

{{quote|An individual named as Special Counsel shall be a lawyer with a reputation for integrity and impartial decisionmaking, and with appropriate experience to ensure both that the investigation will be conducted ably, expeditiously and thoroughly, and that investigative and prosecutorial decisions will be supported by an informed understanding of the criminal law and Department of Justice policies. The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States Government. Special Counsels shall agree that their responsibilities as Special Counsel shall take first precedence in their professional lives, and that it may be necessary to devote their full time to the investigation, depending on its complexity and the stage of the investigation.}}

===Terminating a special counsel investigation===
Generally, the special counsel him or herself decides when an investigation will terminate, with or without formal charges being pursued. The special counsel typically issues a final report on their investigation at this time. The current special counsel regulations specify that<ref name=":0" /> "At the conclusion of the Special Counsel's work, he or she shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel."

====Firing the special counsel====
The current special counsel regulations specify that:<ref name=":0" />

{{quote|The Special Counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney General may remove a Special Counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies. The Attorney General shall inform the Special Counsel in writing of the specific reason for their removal.}}

===Role of the legislative and judicial branches===
Since the expiration of the independent counsel provisions in the Ethics in Government Act in 1999, as was the case before 1978, neither Congress nor the courts have any official role in the appointment of a special counsel; however Congress can use other powers to pressure an administration into appointing a special counsel. This happened, for example, in the appointment of Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox; senators secured a promise from Attorney General nominee Richardson to appoint a Watergate special prosecutor as a condition of his confirmation. Congress also has independent authority to investigate the president and their close associates through Congressional hearings as part of its government oversight role.<ref name=":3" />

==At the state level==
Special prosecutors are appointed in state court with greater frequency than federal, and most often in cases where a conflict of interest arises or to avoid even the appearance such a conflict exists. In local state governments, special prosecutors are appointed by a judge, government official, organization, company or group of citizens to prosecute violations of law committed by one or more governmental agents and procure indictments for actions taken under color of state law.<ref>[[Black's Law Dictionary]] (8th ed. 2004) ''Prosecutor.''</ref> Unlike in courts having federal jurisdiction, where the terms "special counsel" and "independent counsel" have a uniform definition, in state court meanings of legal terms continually vary, but with "special prosecutor" referencing the appointment of an attorney (supra) in contemplation of representation and prosecution of one or more government agent(s) for unlawful conduct.
