== Summary ==
<!-- DO NOT POST LYRICS - it is against Wikipedia copyright policy -->
The theme song and opening sequence set the premise of the show. Will Smith is a street-smart [[teenager]], [[West Philadelphia]] "born and raised". While playing [[street basketball]], Will misses a shot and the ball hits a group of gang members, causing a confrontation that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his wealthy aunt and uncle in the opulent neighborhood of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]].

Will's [[working class]] background ends up clashing in various humorous ways with the [[African-American upper class|upper class]] world of the Banks family – Will's uncle Phil and aunt Vivian and their children, Will's cousins: spoiled Hilary, entitled Carlton, and impressionable Ashley.

From top left: [[Karyn Parsons]], [[Joseph Marcell]], [[Janet Hubert|Janet Hubert-Whitten]], [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. From bottom left: [[Tatyana Ali|Tatyana M. Ali]], [[James Avery]], [[Will Smith]].]]
In 1990, music manager [[Benny Medina]], along with his business partner, real estate mogul [[Jeff Pollack]], decided to market a TV story based on Medina's life. Medina had grown up poor in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] but his life changed when he befriended a rich white teenager, whose family lived in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and allowed Medina to live with them. Medina decided to use this part of his life as the main focus of the show. However, given that by then a black character living with a white family was a concept that had been done multiple times on TV, Medina decided to change the rich white family to a rich black family. "That way we could explore black-on-black prejudice as well as black class differences", Medina said in an interview for ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MsDAAAAMBAJ&q=Rozzell+Sykes&pg=PA1 |title=Ebony Magazine |date=April 1991 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company |pages=34, 38}}</ref>

Medina pitched the idea to [[Quincy Jones]], who had just signed a TV deal with [[WarnerMedia|Time-Warner]]. Jones was impressed by the idea and arranged a meeting with [[NBC]] chief [[Brandon Tartikoff]]. [[Will Smith]] was well known by then as his music career as [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]] had put him on the mainstream radar, but he had come into debt after failing to pay taxes. At the suggestion of his then-girlfriend, Smith went to a taping of ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' where he met Medina by chance. Medina pitched the idea to Smith, but Smith was reluctant, having never acted before. Medina invited Smith to meet Jones at a party that Jones was throwing at his house in December 1989. There, Jones handed Smith a script for a failed [[Morris Day]] pilot that he had produced and challenged Smith to audition for Tartikoff on the spot. Smith did so, and the first contract for the show was drawn up that night in a limo outside. Three months later, the pilot was shot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Will Smith Says He Became The Fresh Prince of Bel Air After Getting in Trouble with the IRS |url=https://people.com/tv/will-smith-how-became-fresh-prince-bel-air/ |website=people.com |access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>

[[Andy Borowitz]] and his wife, [[Susan Borowitz|Susan]], are credited as the series' creators. Andy Borowitz, who was on a contract with NBC, was selected by Tartikoff to write the pilot. He based Will's cousins on Quincy Jones's daughters, and named Carlton after his friend [[Carlton Cuse]]. In 2015, he remarked that "It was written and taped in about three weeks, start to finish, and somehow it worked.

The theme song "[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (song)|Yo Home to Bel Air]]" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]]. The music was composed by [[Quincy Jones]], who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.

==Crossovers and other appearances==
During the fall 1991–1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (''[[Blossom (TV series)|Blossom]]'' aired immediately after ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air''). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in the ''Blossom'' episode "I'm with the Band" as himself under his rap [[stage name]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince|The Fresh Prince]]. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in the ''Blossom'' episode "Wake Up Little Suzy" as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcom ''[[Out All Night (TV series)|Out All Night]]'' as Hilary.

''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'' and ''Fresh Prince'' were both executive-produced by Winifred Hervey, David Salzman and Quincy Jones. During the second season's first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as their ''Fresh Prince'' characters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode "Dog Catchers". Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode "Love on a One-Way Street".

In the Season 4 episode "My Pest Friend's Wedding", James Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (the second Vivian Banks) guest starred as Dr. Maxwell Stanton's parents (Stanton was played by Ribeiro). Both Avery and Reid portrayed the parents of Ribeiro's ''Fresh Prince'' character. Joseph Marcell, who played the wisecracking Geoffrey Butler on ''Fresh Prince'', appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.
