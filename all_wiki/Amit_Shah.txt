He served as the [[List of Presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party|President]] of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) from 2014 to 2020. He was elected to the lower house of Parliament, [[Lok Sabha]], in the [[2019 Indian general elections]] from [[Gandhinagar (Lok Sabha constituency)|Gandhinagar]]. Earlier, he had been elected as a member of the upper house of Parliament, [[Rajya Sabha]], from [[Gujarat]] in 2017.

During his college days, Shah was a member of the [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad|ABVP]], the student wing of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. At the age of 18, he secured a position in the ABVP and joined the BJP in 1987. Shah was first elected in Gujarat as the [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] for a seat partly covering [[Ahmedabad]], [[Sarkhej (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Sarkhej]] in 1997 (a by-election). He continued to hold it in the 1998, 2002 and 2007 elections until the seat's dissolution in 2008; he then got elected from the nearby [[Naranpura (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Naranpura]] in [[2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election|2012]]. As a close associate of Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]], he held executive portfolios in the [[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat state government]].

Shah was the BJP's in-charge for India's largest and politically most crucial state, [[Uttar Pradesh]], during the [[2014 Lok Sabha elections]]. The BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats. As a result, Shah rose to national prominence and was appointed as the party's national president in July 2014.<ref name="IT_new_2015">{{cite news |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20140728-rahul-kanwal-on-the-man-behind-the-reputation-amit-shah-bjp-804608-2014-07-17 |title=Inside the mind of Amit Shah: All eyes on new BJP chief as party gears up for battle in five states |date=17 July 2014 |work=India Today }}</ref>

He has played an organizing and membership-promotional role in the elections of many states since 2014. In his initial two years, the BJP achieved success in Legislative Assembly elections in [[2014 Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election|Maharashtra]], [[2014 Haryana Legislative Assembly election|Haryana]], [[2014 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election|Jammu & Kashmir]], [[2014 Jharkhand Legislative Assembly election|Jharkhand]] and [[Assam]] but lost ground in [[2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly election|Delhi]] and the large eastern state of [[2015 Bihar Legislative Assembly election|Bihar]] in 2015.

Shah was involved with the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) since childhood; he participated in the neighbourhood ''shakhas'' (branches) as a boy. He formally became an RSS ''swayamsevak'' (volunteer) during his college days in Ahmedabad.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> He first met Narendra Modi in 1982 through the Ahmedabad RSS circles.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind">{{cite news |url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/his-master-s-mind |title=His Master's Mind |publisher=Open |author=PR Ramesh |date=11 April 2014 }}</ref> At that time, Modi was an RSS ''pracharak'' (propagator), working as in-charge of youth activities in the city.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/>

== Early political career ==

=== Entry into politics ===
Shah started his political career as a leader of the student wing of the RSS, the [[Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad]], in 1983.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/><ref name="NDTV_2013_who">{{cite news |title = Who is Amit Shah? |url=https://www.ndtv.com/people/who-is-amit-shah-525154 |publisher=NDTV |date=12 June 2013}}</ref> He joined BJP in 1987, one year before Modi joined the party.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> He became an activist of the BJP's youth wing, [[Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha]] (BJYM), in 1987. He gradually rose in the BJYM hierarchy, in which he held various posts including ward secretary, [[taluka]] secretary, state secretary, vice-president and general secretary.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> He became known for his management skills when he was the election campaign manager for [[Lal Krishna Advani]] in Gandhinagar during the [[1991 Indian general election|1991 Lok Sabha elections]].<ref name="IE_2014_prepares"/><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bjp-union-home-ministry-amit-shah-1539468-2019-05-31 | title=From sticking bills for BJP to managing Union home ministry: Rise and rise of Amit Shah | work=India Today | first=Prabhash K |last=Dutta | date=31 May 2019 | access-date=16 June 2019}}</ref>

In 1995, the BJP formed its first government in Gujarat, with [[Keshubhai Patel]] as Chief Minister. At that time, the [[Indian National Congress]], the BJP's main rival, was highly influential in rural Gujarat. Modi and Shah worked together to eliminate Congress in the rural areas. Their strategy was to find the second-most influential leader in every village and get them to join the BJP. They created a network of 8,000 influential rural leaders who had lost elections to the ''pradhan'' (village chief) post in various villages.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/>

Modi and Shah used the same strategy to reduce Congress' influence over the state's powerful [[co-operative]]s, which played an important role in the state's economy. In 1999, Shah was elected as the president of the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank (ADCB), the biggest cooperative bank in India. In Gujarat, such elections had traditionally been won on [[Indian caste system|caste]] considerations, and the co-operative banks had traditionally been controlled by [[Patel]]s, [[Gaderia]]s and [[Kshatriya]]s. Despite not belonging to any of these castes, Shah won the election. At that time, the bank was on the verge of collapse, as they had accumulated losses of {{INR}}36 [[crores]]. Shah turned around the bank's fortune within a year; the following year, the bank registered a profit of {{INR}}27 crores. By 2014, its profit had increased to around {{INR}}250 crores.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> Shah also ensured that 11 of the bank's 22 directors were BJP loyalists.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/>

Modi and Shah also sought to reduce Congress' hold over sports bodies in the state.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> Shah served as the president of the Gujarat State Chess Association.<ref name="NDTV_2013_who"/> In 2009, he became the vice-president of the profitable [[Gujarat Cricket Association]] (GCA), while Modi served as its president.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> In 2014, after Modi became [[Prime Minister of India]], Shah became the president of GCA.

Modi, who had become a general secretary in the party's state unit by the early 1990s, used his influence to get bigger roles for Shah. He convinced Patel to appoint Shah as the chairman of the [[Gujarat State Financial Corporation]], a public sector financial institution that finances small and medium-scale enterprises. After [[Shankersinh Vaghela]] and some other leaders complained about Modi's growing popularity in the Gujarat government, the party leadership moved Modi out of Gujarat to the BJP headquarters in Delhi. During this time (1995–2001), Shah served as Modi's confidante in Gujarat.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/>

In 1997, Modi lobbied to get Shah a BJP ticket for the [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly]] by-election in [[Sarkhej]].<ref name="MM_2014_importance">{{cite news |url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/The-importance-of-Amit-Shah/articleshow/33378596.cms |title=The importance of Amit Shah |newspaper=Mumbai Mirror |date=7 April 2014 }}</ref> Shah became an MLA in February 1997 after winning the by-election.<ref name="Andy2014">{{cite book |author=Andy Marino |title=Narendra Modi: A Political Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ylIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT76 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India |isbn=978-93-5136-218-0 |pages=76–}}</ref> He retained his seat in the 1998 Assembly elections.<ref name="rediff_1998_Sarkhej"/>

=== Gujarat state government===
[[File:PM Modii addresses a BJP National Council Meet.jpg|thumb|PM Modi addresses a BJP National Council Meeting.]]
In October 2001, the BJP replaced Keshubhai Patel with Narendra Modi as the chief minister of Gujarat after allegations of inefficient administration. Over the next few years, Modi and Shah gradually sidelined their political rivals.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/>

Shah contested the [[2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election|2002 Assembly election]] from the Sarkhej constituency in Ahmedabad. He won by the highest margin among all candidates, with 158,036 votes. He improved his margin of victory in the [[2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election|2007 Assembly election]], in which he won from Sarkhej again. <ref name="NDTV_2013_who"/>

During Modi's twelve-year tenure as the Gujarat CM, Shah emerged as one of the most powerful leaders in Gujarat. After winning the 2002 elections, he became the youngest minister in the Modi government and was given multiple portfolios.<ref name="IE_2014_prepares">{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2013/jul/07/In-UP-Shah-prepares-for-Modi-ahead-of-2014-battle-494331.html |title=In UP, Shah prepares for Modi ahead of 2014 battle |date=7 July 2013 |newspaper=The Indian Express |author=Subhash Mishra and Pratul Sharma}}</ref> At one time, he held 12 portfolios: Home, Law and Justice, Prison, Border Security, Civil Defence, Excise, Transport, Prohibition, Home Guards, Gram Rakshak Dal, Police Housing and Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014">{{cite news|last=Joshi|first=Poornima|date=1 April 2014|title=The Organiser|publisher=Caravan|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/organiser|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In 2004, the Congress-led government announced its intention to repeal the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|Prevention of Terrorism Act]], which they called regressive. Shah piloted the [[Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Act|Gujarat Control of Organised Crime]] (Amendment) Bill through the Gujarat State Assembly amid an opposition walk-out.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/gujarat-keeps-a-terror-law-spare/cid/737976 | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Gujarat keeps a terror law spare | date=3 June 2004}}</ref>

Shah also played an important role in convincing the Modi government to pass the [[Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill]], which made religious conversions difficult in the state of [[Gujarat]].<ref name="Open_2014_Mind" />

===Rise in national politics===

Venkaiah Naidu administering the oath as Member, Rajya Sabha to Shri Amit Shah]]
After Modi became the prime-ministerial candidate of the BJP, Shah's influence also increased in the party. They had been accused of sidelining other BJP leaders, such as Lal Krishna Advani, [[Sushma Swaraj]], [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] and [[Jaswant Singh]].<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> By this time, Shah had gained recognition as an excellent election campaign manager and was dubbed a "modern-day [[Chanakya]] and master strategist".<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-set-for-bigger-role-if-bjp-wins/article5903327.ece Amit Shah set for a bigger role if BJP wins], Vinay Kumar, 12 April 2014</ref> Shah was appointed as a BJP general secretary and given charge of Uttar Pradesh (UP). He was chosen not by Modi, but by Rajnath Singh, who had been impressed by the skills Shah displayed in wresting control of various Congress-controlled organizations in Gujarat.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> The decision did not go down well with many of the party members, who saw him as a liability owing to the criminal charges against him. Political analysts such as [[Shekhar Gupta]] termed the decision as a blunder.<ref name="Shekhar2014">{{cite book |author=Shekhar Gupta |title=Anticipating India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TipIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT369 |date=8 April 2014 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers India |isbn=978-93-5136-256-2 |page=369 }}</ref>

===Uttar Pradesh general elections===
Shah's political career, which had declined after his arrest in 2010, revived after the BJP's victory in the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 general election]]. In Uttar Pradesh, where Shah was the in-charge, the BJP and its allies won 73 out of 80 seats. Shah had been made in-charge of the BJP's campaign in Uttar Pradesh on 12 June 2013, less than a year before the elections.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> Since February 2012, Shah had spent considerable time in Uttar Pradesh, where he tried to understand the reasons for the [[Samajwadi Party]]'s victory in the [[2012 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election|2012 UP Assembly elections]]. Shah realized the voters were dissatisfied with the Samajwadi Party, which he believed had failed to keep its election promises after the win. He also took advantage of the [[Other Backward Classes|OBC]] voters' displeasure with the UP government's decision to create a 4.5% [[reservation in India|reservation]] for the minorities within the 27% OBC quota in government jobs and education.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/>

Shah oversaw the candidate selection, emphasizing the candidate's local popularity and winning potential as the only criteria for selection, as opposed to the candidate's party loyalty or ideology. His team estimated that only 35% of the BJP's traditional supporters had voted in the UP elections. Therefore, he focused on door-to-door campaigning at the [[voting booth|booth]]-level. He set up a 7-to-10 member management committee for each of the 140,000 voting booths in the state. For each booth, his team collated lists of voters and reached out to them.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> Shah's team used 450 GPS-enabled mobile vans (video [[Ratha|raths]]) to reach out to the masses in remote areas, where media reach was negligible.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/140518/commentary-op-ed/article/sunday-interview-amit-shah |title=Sunday Interview: We had 450 video raths with GPS and I'd get feedback on my mobile, says Amit Shah |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle | date=18 May 2014 |author=Yojna Gosai }}</ref> Shah covered 76 out of the 80 Lok Sabha constituencies. He also insisted on Modi contesting election from [[Varanasi]].<ref name="Outlook_2014_Feast">{{cite news |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Judgement-Day-Feast-For-The-Shah-Of-Shahs/290749 |title=Judgement Day Feast For The Shah Of Shahs |author=Prarthna Gahilote |work=Outlook |date=26 May 2014 }}</ref>

Shah convinced Modi to utilize RSS volunteers for grassroots campaigning, which proved highly beneficial for the BJP.<ref name="Outlook_2014_Feast"/> Although the RSS officially were not involved in electioneering, Shah used its volunteers to mobilize and monitor the campaigners. For example, the RSS volunteers would cross-check a BJP worker's claims of having targeted a given number of households.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> Shah also helped organize "mega rallies" for Modi. Like other major political parties, the BJP provisioned one van per village to transport people to the rally venue. However, unlike others, Shah decided that the BJP would not provide money for hiring these vehicles. Instead, he declared that the party workers organizing the transportation would be the leaders of the BJP units in their villages. This strategy ensured several local village leaders developed a stake in Modi's victory.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/>

Critics accused Shah of trying to polarize the UP voters along the religious lines. While visiting [[Ayodhya]] for a meeting with the party's local committee, he raised the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. The BJP fielded three candidates accused of inciting violence during the [[2013 Muzaffarnagar riots]]. These were seen as attempts to target the party's [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] base.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> An [[First Information Report|FIR]] was registered against Shah for a speech in Muzaffarnagar, where he urged the voters to seek "revenge" through their votes.<ref name="MM_2014_importance"/> He also took advantage of Shia Muslim antipathy towards Sunni Muslims in [[Lucknow]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21627719-narendra-modi-relies-most-two-men-who-could-hardly-be-less-alike-enablers|title=The enablers: Narendra Modi relies most on two men who could hardly be less alike|journal=The Economist|date=24 October 2014|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Shah also played an important role in the BJP's election campaigning strategy outside Uttar Pradesh. He focused on building Modi's image as a strong leader. At times, he opposed even Modi on several strategic campaigning issues. For example, when Modi praised his opponent and prospective post-poll ally [[Mamata Banerjee]], Shah insisted that the BJP must not divert from the "Modi-versus-all" tactic.<ref name="Outlook_2014_Feast"/> Shah was also responsible for forging the BJP's alliances with regional parties like [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]].<ref name="MM_2014_importance"/>

In September 2019, Shah talked about how India needs one unifying language; he said the Hindi language should be spoken to unite the country and represent India in the world. In a tweet, he also appealed the Indians to increase the use of the Hindi language.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/country-should-come-together-to-promote-hindi-says-amit-shah/article29415438.ece|title=Only Hindi can work to unite country, says Amit Shah|newspaper=The Hindu|date=14 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/nation-needs-one-unifying-language-amit-shah-bats-for-hindi-as-india-s-identity-1599035-2019-09-14|title=Nation needs one unifying language: Amit Shah bats for Hindi as India's identity|first1=India Today Web Desk New|last1=DelhiSeptember 14|first2=2019UPDATED|last2=September 14|first3=2019 14:44|last3=Ist|website=India Today}}</ref>

In December 2019, he introduced the [[Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019]], which grants Indian citizenship to religiously persecuted minority communities who migrated to the country before 2015 from the Muslim-majority countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. In [[Northeast India]], the act raised concerns about the impact of immigration on local culture and politics, which caused people to protest against the Act. Elsewhere, the opposition parties criticized the Act's exclusion of Muslims as detrimental to India's pluralism. Shah insisted the bill was not anti-Muslim, because it did not change their existing path to citizenship.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/india-parliament-passes-citizenship-bill-1.5392455 |title=India's parliament passes contentious citizenship bill |publisher=CBC News |date=20 December 2019 }}</ref>

==Controversies==
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Shauryanjali, a commemorative exhibition on the 1965 war.jpg|thumb|PM Modi visits Shauryanjali, a commemorative exhibition on the 1965 war.]]
Shah was accused of sidelining the police officers who testified against the Gujarat government in cases related to the fake encounters and the [[2002 Gujarat violence|2002 riots]].<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> Shah has also been accused of manipulating the electoral constituency delimitation exercise in Gujarat to favour the BJP.<ref name="MM_2014_importance"/>

===Sohrabuddin case===
[[File:Amit Shah and Udit Raj.jpg|thumb|Amit Shah and Udit Raj]]
In 2010, Shah was accused of having orchestrated the extrajudicial killings of [[Sohrabuddin Sheikh]], his wife Kauser Bi and his criminal associate [[Tulsiram Prajapati]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/who-was-sohrabuddin-sheikh-424777|title = Who was Sohrabuddin Sheikh| publisher=NDTV.com | date = 27 July 2010 }}</ref> According to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), Sheikh had been harassing some [[marble]] traders of Rajasthan by demanding [[protection racket|protection]] money. The CBI claimed that two of these marble traders paid Shah to eliminate Sheikh, along with police officers [[Deputy inspector general of police|DIG]] [[D. G. Vanzara|D.G.

The CBI presented phone call records, which showed that Shah had been in touch with the accused police officers when the victims were in their custody. It also presented videotapes of Patel brothers' conversations with two of Shah's associates at the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank (ADCB).<ref name="IBNLive_2010_proof">{{cite news |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cbi-proof-against-shah-sohrabuddin-tapes/127540-37.html |title=CBI 'proof' against Shah: Sohrabuddin tapes |date=26 July 2010 |author=Bhupendra Chaubey |publisher=CNN-IBN }}</ref> The Patel brothers, who had several criminal cases against them, also spoke against Shah.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/he-(amit-shah)-smiled-and-said-sohrabuddin-had-himself-closed-the-option-of-keeping-himself-alive.../658769/0 |title=He (Amit Shah) smiled and said Sohrabuddin had himself closed the option of keeping himself alive... |date=24 November 2011 |newspaper=The Indian Express }}</ref>

Shah dismissed all the accusations against him as politically motivated. He pointed out that during his tenure as Home Minister, Gujarat was one of the states with a small number of police encounters in the country. He stated that he kept in touch with the police officers on the phone in the normal course of his duties as Home Minister.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-11-14/news/44075365_1_sadiq-jamal-ishrat-jahan-amit-shah |title=CBI to file crucial charge-sheets in Gujarat fake encounters' case |author=Aman Sharma |newspaper=The Economic Times |date=14 November 2013 }}</ref> He accused Congress of misusing the CBI and claimed that only the cases in Gujarat were being scrutinized, while the rest of the country had witnessed around 1,500 encounters during the same period.<ref name="rediff_2013_waiting">{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-exclusive-amit-shah-interview-people-are-waiting-to-vote-for-modi/20131008.htm#3 |title=Encounter cases are politically motivated; non-Gujarat encounters are never scrutinized |date=8 October 2013 |author=Sheela Bhatt |publisher=Rediff.com }}</ref> He said if the CBI had any solid evidence against him, it would have been able to frame charges against him.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> In 2010, Police Commissioner Geeta Johri, who first investigated the case, claimed that the CBI was pressurizing her to falsely implicate Shah in the Sohrabuddin case.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-putting-pressure-on-me-geeta-johri/article599990.ece |title=CBI putting pressure on me: Geeta Johri |author=J. Venkatesan |newspaper=The Hindu |date=29 August 2010 }}</ref>

D.G. Vanzara was also accused in the [[Ishrat Jahan]] fake encounter case, but the CBI did not charge Shah.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/CBI-clean-chit-for-Amit-Shah-in-Ishrat-Jahan-encounter-case/articleshow/34784569.cms |title=CBI clean chit for Amit Shah in Ishrat Jahan encounter case |date=7 May 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India }}</ref>

Shah was arrested on 25 July 2010 in connection with the Sohrabuddin case. At one time, Shah was considered one of the main contenders for Gujarat Chief Minister. However, his political career was hurt by the arrest; many leaders in the Gujarat government distanced themselves from him. His fellow ministers considered him an autocratic person, who did not have good relations with his colleagues.<ref name="NDTV_2013_who"/>

When Shah applied for bail, the CBI raised concerns that he would use his political power to prevent justice from taking its course.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> On 29 October 2010, the [[Gujarat High Court]] granted him bail three months after his arrest. However, the next day, when the courts were closed, Justice [[Aftab Alam (judge)|Aftab Alam]] took a petition at his residence to bar him from entering Gujarat.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> Shah was thus forcibly exiled from the state from 2010 to 2012.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> He and his wife moved to a room in Gujarat Bhavan, Delhi.<ref name="Open_2014_Mind"/> Later, the Supreme Court canceled his bail on a CBI plea. In September 2012, the Supreme Court granted him bail and allowed him to return to Gujarat. He then contested and won the 2012 Assembly election from the [[Naranpura (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Naranpura]] constituency.<ref name="NDTV_2013_who"/> (The Sarkhej constituency had ceased to exist after delimitation.)

===Snoopgate===
In 2013, Shah was accused of having ordered illegal surveillance on a woman in 2009 during his tenure as a home minister. The investigative websites [[Cobrapost]] and Gulail released a set of taped audio conversations between Shah and police officer GL Singhal. The tapes had been submitted to the CBI in the [[Ishrat Jahan case]] and were leaked to these portals. The calls detail how the state machinery was used to surveil the woman and the IAS officer Pradeep Sharma (who was suspended by the Gujarat government). In the recordings, both Singhal and Shah repeatedly refer to a higher authority as ''Saheb'', which is believed to be Chief Minister Narendra Modi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cobrapost.com/index.php/news-detail?nid=3969&cid=23 |title=News Detail |publisher=Cobrapost.com |access-date=4 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231084530/http://www.cobrapost.com/index.php/news-detail?nid=3969&cid=23 |archive-date=31 December 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Shah denied all the accusations against him; he called them political propaganda by his opponents.<ref name="Caravan_Organiser_2014"/> The BJP's political opponents demanded a probe in the ''Snoopgate'' case. However, in May 2014, the woman approached the Supreme Court and stated that the surveillance on her was based on a "personal request",<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Law of Renaming: The Need for Mandatory Public Consultation|url=https://thewire.in/law/the-law-of-renaming-mandatory-public-consultation|access-date=2020-06-20|website=The Wire}}</ref> and she was thankful to the Gujarat government for ensuring her safety.

=== Hindutva and religious polarization ===
During his time as a general secretary of the BJP, party members credited Shah with promoting [[Hindutva]], encouraging Hindu voters to reject "protectors of minorities", and opposing Modi's attempts to reconcile with the Muslim community.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vij Aurora|first=Bhavna|date=7 April 2014|title=Spreading the Hindutva agenda: BJP's Amit Shah unlikely to lower his 'revenge' tenor|website=[[The Economic Times]]|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/spreading-the-hindutva-agenda-bjps-amit-shah-unlikely-to-lower-his-revenge-tenor/articleshow/33351012.cms?from=mdr|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref> Shah convinced the Modi government in Gujarat to pass the [[Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act]] in 2003, which requires [[religious conversion]]s in the state – most of which are from [[Hinduism]] to other religions<ref name="TOI conversions">{{cite web|title=In Gujarat, 94.4% of those seeking to convert are Hindu|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/In-Gujarat-94-4-of-those-seeking-to-convert-are-Hindu/articleshow/51419977.cms|website=[[The Times of India]]|date=16 March 2016|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref> – to be approved by a [[district magistrate]].<ref name="Open_2014_Mind" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Shimron |first1=Yonat |title=A Dalit community looks to escape the caste system by converting to Buddhism |url=https://religionnews.com/2017/05/11/a-dalit-community-looks-to-escape-the-caste-system-by-converting-to-buddhism/ |website=[[Religion News Service]] |access-date=17 November 2020 |date=11 May 2017}}</ref> Shah protrayed the bill as a measure against [[forced conversions]], although critics claimed that the bill undermined the [[Indian Constitution]].<ref name="Open_2014_Mind" /> Between 2011 and 2016, approximately half of the applications for religious conversion in Gujarat were declined by the local government.<ref name="TOI conversions" />

In December 2019, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) asked the US administration to consider imposing sanctions against Shah if the Indian parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. USCIRF in its statement said: "CAB is a dangerous turn in the wrong direction; it runs counter to India's rich history of secular pluralism and the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law regardless of faith." The commission said that the CAB "enshrines a pathway to citizenship for immigrants that specifically excludes Muslims, setting a legal criterion for citizenship based on religion". The external affairs ministry issued a counter-statement in response to USCIRF by saying it was not based on facts and the bill was to grant citizenship to persecuted religious minorities who arrived in India and does not aim to strip citizenship.<ref name="Sanctions on Amit Shah">{{cite news|date=11 December 2019|title=Sanctions against Amit Shah over CAB|newspaper=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sanctions-against-amit-shah-over-cab-rajnath-singh-jaishankar-may-take-up-issue-in-washington-dc/articleshow/72465942.cms|access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>
