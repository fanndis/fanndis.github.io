==Career==

===1989–2003: Beginnings and acting debut===
Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was a name ambiguous enough to disallow any biases.<ref name="Times Online"/><ref name="The Independent">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/jamie-foxx-king-of-the-castle-394166.html|title=Jamie Foxx: King of the castle|date=October 2, 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=February 23, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> He chose his surname as a tribute to the black comedian [[Redd Foxx]].<ref name="The Independent"/> Foxx joined the cast of ''[[In Living Color]]'' in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, [[LaWanda Page]].

Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]''. His first dramatic role came in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1999 film ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,<ref name="actors" /> partly because of his own football background.<ref name="actors" /> In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in [[Michael Mann]]'s biographical drama [[Ali (film)|''Ali'']]. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'' alongside [[Tom Cruise]], for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].<ref name="actors" />

In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] record label) entitled ''[[Peep This]]'', which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in [[Benzino]]'s music video for "Would You", which features [[LisaRaye McCoy]] and [[Mario Winans]].
