'''Mount Vernon''' is a residential area in the east end of the city of [[Glasgow]], Scotland. It directly borders [[Sandyhills]] and [[Foxley, Glasgow|Foxley]] to the west, while [[Barlanark]] is the closest neighbourhood to the north, [[Barrachnie]] and [[Baillieston]] to the east and [[Carmyle]] to the south, although Mount Vernon is separated from these by areas of open land, including Early Braes public park<ref>[https://secretscotland.wordpress.com/tag/early-braes-park/ Early Braes Park is back in circulation], Secret Scotland</ref> and the former [[Kenmuir]] farm.<ref>[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/councillorsandcommittees/viewSelectedDocument.asp?c=P62AFQDN2U0GZ30GDX Baillieston Broomhouse Carmyle Community Growth Area: Report by New City Vision (Carmyle) Ltd & AS Carmyle Ltd], Glasgow Community Planning Partnership, 26 April 2018</ref>

==History==
The area was originally part of the [[Parishes of Scotland|Parish]] of Old Monkland, and also of the Barony and Regality of Glasgow. From at least the [[Middle Ages]], the rental book of the Diocese of Glasgow records it as Windy Edge or variations thereof – ''AD 1526, Jame Browyn rentalit in vs xd land in the Wyndy Hege''. 
In 1742 a Glasgow merchant named Robert Boyd purchased the 'Old Extent of Windyedge' and renamed it Mount Vernon,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://groups.msn.com/Bailliestonnet/mountvernonname.msnw |title=Mount Vernon: The True Origin of the name |access-date=23 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310183626/http://groups.msn.com/Bailliestonnet/mountvernonname.msnw |archive-date=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in honour of [[Edward Vernon|Admiral Edward Vernon]] of the Royal Navy who was famous at that time for his expedition against the [[Spanish Main]]. Another [[Glasgow]] merchant, George Buchanan, whose family had extensive 
interests in [[Tobacco Lords|tobacco trade]] purchased the land in 1758 and built an extension to the existing house re-modelling it as a country mansion.<ref name=ochogg>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/smihou/smihou076.htm LXXVI. Mount Vernon], John Guthrie Smith and John Oswald Mitchell, 187, The old country houses of the old Glasgow gentry]</ref>

The Mount Vernon of the early 21st century is generally affluent and suburban in character; administratively, the area forms part of the [[Shettleston (ward)|Shettleston ward]] of [[Glasgow City Council]].<ref>[https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=9105&p=0 City Ward Factsheets 2017: Ward 19 - Shettleston], [[Glasgow City Council]]</ref>
