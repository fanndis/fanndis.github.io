'''''Cheek to Cheek''''' is a collaborative album by American singers [[Tony Bennett]] (his fifty-eighth studio album in general) and [[Lady Gaga]] (her fourth studio album in general). It was released on September 19, 2014 by [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] and [[Columbia Records]]. Bennett and Gaga first met at the [[Robin Hood Foundation|Robin Hood Foundation gala]] in New York City in 2011. After the two later recorded together a rendition of "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]", they began discussing plans for working on a [[Jazz music|jazz]] project. ''Cheek to Cheek'' consists of [[jazz standards]] by popular composers such as [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Irving Berlin]]. It was inspired by Bennett and Gaga's desire to introduce the songs to a younger generation, since they believed that these tracks had universal appeal.

In January 2013, the album was announced by both artists and started its recording process after Gaga recovered from a hip surgery. It was recorded in New York City, where Bennett and Gaga were accompanied by a live band and jazz musicians associated with both artists. Gaga deviated from her previous contemporary [[pop music|pop]] albums as she wanted instead to create a jazz record. The release date of the album was delayed multiple times, and the final date was announced by Bennett and Gaga on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]''. The full-length track listing and cover artwork was released thereafter; including the track lists for many alternate editions. The artists promoted ''Cheek to Cheek'' through multiple performances in and around New York, a "behind the scenes" program detailing the recording of the album on the [[Home Shopping Network]] (HSN), and a televised concert titled ''[[Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!]]'', which aired on [[PBS]] in October 2014. The album was preceded by the release of two [[Single (music)|single]]s: "[[Anything Goes (Cole Porter song)#Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga version|Anything Goes]]" and "[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby#Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga version|I Can't Give You Anything but Love]]", which both reached number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Jazz Digital Songs Chart in the United States.

''Cheek to Cheek'' received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising Gaga's vocals. At the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]], the album won [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]]. ''Cheek to Cheek'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 131,000 copies sold in its first week according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], and has since sold 773,000 copies in the United States. The album became Bennett's second number-one album and Gaga's third consecutive number-one in the US; Gaga became the first female artist in the country to have three number-one albums in the 2010s decade, while Bennett extended his record as the oldest artist to achieve a number-one album on the chart. The album also reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

In January 2013, Evans confirmed that he would have a fairly significant part in the making of the album, stating "I don't know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I'm sure we'll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands.

Bennett said that Gaga had written an original song for the album titled "Paradise". It also contained solo performances along with the duets; Gaga later clarified that the album contained only [[Jazz standard|standards]]. The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the [[Great American Songbook]] including "[[Anything Goes (Cole Porter song)#Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga version|Anything Goes]]", a Porter song, "[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]" and "[[Sophisticated Lady]]" by [[Duke Ellington]], "[[Lush Life (jazz song)|Lush Life]]" by [[Billy Strayhorn]], and the [[Cheek to Cheek|title track]] by Berlin.<ref name="press"/>

==Recording and composition==
Although the project was in development and discussions were taking place as early as September 2012, the recording did not start until the Spring of 2013, being delayed by Gaga's hip surgery and cancellation of her [[Born This Way Ball]] tour.<ref name="rsrelease"/> The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz [[trumpet]]er [[Brian Newman]], a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album with his New York City based jazz [[quintet]]. [[Tenor saxophone|Tenor saxophonist]] [[Joe Lovano]] and [[flautist]] [[Paul Horn (musician)|Paul Horn]] were also enlisted as musicians.<ref name="press"/>

According to Gaga, Bennett wanted her to sing different songs and was impressed by her vocals during "Lush Life", referring to the [[Billy Strayhorn]] written standard that has been recorded by everyone from [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]] and [[Sarah Vaughan]] to [[Donna Summer]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]].<ref name="rsrelease"/> Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett.

In ''Cheek to Cheek'', Gaga sings solo on "Lush Life", "[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]" and "[[Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye]]", while Bennett's solo includes "Don't Wait Too Long" and "Sophisticated Lady". According to Gaga, "Lush Life" and "Sophisticated Lady" complemented each other; for Bennett, the complement came from the fact that [[Duke Ellington]] wrote "Sophisticated Lady" and later collaborated with Strayhorn for "Lush Life".<ref name="tracklist"/> Gaga sang "Lush Life" in her school choir, but it was only later she understood the lyrical interpretation of the track, about failure and heartache. While recording ''Cheek to Cheek'' she was emotionally upset about her professional and personal conflicts encountered during the ''[[Artpop]]'' era; Bennett had to support and guide her through the process.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://parade.com/335908/dotsonrader/tony-bennett-and-lady-gaga-talk-about-their-new-album-and-close-friendship-he-saved-my-life-she-says/|title=Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga Talk About Their New Album and Close Friendship: 'He Saved My Life', She Say|last=Rader|first=Dotson|date=September 10, 2014|accessdate=September 11, 2014|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118032353/http://parade.com/335908/dotsonrader/tony-bennett-and-lady-gaga-talk-about-their-new-album-and-close-friendship-he-saved-my-life-she-says/|archivedate=November 18, 2014}}</ref> Newman recalled that "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" was recorded during the taping of the duo's show at Lincoln Center.

The first song, "Anything Goes", was recorded by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with [[Count Basie]] and his Orchestra, ''[[Strike Up the Band (Tony Bennett and Count Basie album)|Strike Up the Band]]'', and Gaga first came to know about it when she was 13 years old.

Bennett had confirmed that he and Gaga would tour jazz festivals in 2015, supporting ''Cheek to Cheek''.<ref name="tonybday"/> According to him, Gaga was tired from playing bigger venues, and wanted to have the tour visit smaller venues for at least three-four days, or for three-six weeks. Bennett also explained that he was accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had been looking at such options. "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [Gaga's] finding places where we could work for three or four days, or three or four weeks, in one place at a time.
