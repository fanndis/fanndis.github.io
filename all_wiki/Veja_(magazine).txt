The magazine supports [[free market economy]], more toughness on crime and the promotion of [[individual liberty]]. Well-known contributors to the magazine include [[Reinaldo Azevedo]], [[Stephen Kanitz]] and [[Lya Luft]].

During its early days, ''Veja'' was known for publishing [[hoax]]es as facts. In 1975 it declared that the [[Loch Ness Monster]] was real before ultimately recognizing the news were fake.<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/30anos/p_114.html ''Veja'']</ref> In 1983, it re-published an [[April Fools' Day]] prank from the British magazine ''New Science'' as real.

On 2005, as part of its growing right-wing agenda, ''Veja'' defended the rejection of [[Brazilian firearms and ammunition referendum, 2005|the prohibition of firearms in that year's referendum]]. According to ''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]'' columnist Barbara Gancia, ''Veja'' tried to mislead its readers presenting the referendum as a proposition of the ruling Workers' Party (PT) and its owners had a [[conflict of interest]] in campaigning against banning firearms; ''Veja'''s publishing company Editora Abril was a business partner of the Birmann family, owner of the Brazilian Cartridge Company. During the same year it was responsible for several news stories about the [[Mensalão scandal]].

''Veja'' had a circulation of 1,086,200 copies in 2010.<ref name=brab/> In April 2012, the editor of the magazine Policarpo Júnior was accused by its rival ''[[CartaCapital]]'', based on information revealed by the [[Federal Police (Brazil)|Federal Police]], of being a close acquaintance of casino owner Carlinhos Cachoeira ([[gambling]] is illegal in Brazil). Cachoeira was then arrested for money laundering. According to ''CartaCapital'', Cachoeira was responsible for arranging and filming the bribery meeting in the [[Correios]] which resulted in the Mensalão scandal. Júnior and Cachoeira had exchanged over 200 phone calls during the period investigated. The circulation of the magazine was 1,071,500 copies in 2012.<ref name=brab>{{cite news|title=Print Media Industry in Brazil|url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/print-media-industry-in-brazil|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=The Brazil Business}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In its 25 May 2007 issue, ''Veja'' ran a story on then-[[Brazilian Senate|Senate]] president, [[Renan Calheiros]], accusing him of accepting funds from a [[lobbyist]] to pay for the child support of a daughter from an extramarital affair with journalist Monica Veloso.<ref>Romero, Simon [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/world/americas/brazils-power-dynamics-shifting-amid-legislative-scandals.html?_r=0 Brazil’s Power Dynamics Shifting Amid Political Scandals] ''New York Times''. 11 July 2015</ref> During a speech in his defense given in the Senate floor, Calheiros accused [[Grupo Abril]], ''Veja'''s parent company, of having violated Brazilian corporate law in relation to its sale of 30% of the capital from its publishing arm to South African media group [[Naspers]].<ref name=NOBLAT>[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/noblat/post.asp?cod_Post=72177&a=118 ''Depoimento de Renan Calheiros, dis 04 de setembro'']</ref> Abril responded to Calheiros in a press release in which they denied all charges.<ref name=ABRILc>[http://www.abril.com.br/br/imprensa/conteudo_250004.shtml Nota da Abril - 4 de setembro].

In August 2010, the [[Superior Electoral Court]] punished ''Veja'' for pro-[[José Serra]] bias during its coverage of the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]]. The magazine published a claim made by Serra's vice-presidential candidate [[Antônio Pedro de Siqueira Indio da Costa|Índio da Costa]] that the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT) had ties with the [[Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia]]. ''Veja'' was forced to publish a [[Right of reply|rebuttal]] note from PT.<ref>Braga, Isabel.

''O Globo''. 2 August 2010.</ref> Prior to the second round of the 2014 presidential election, ''Veja'' anticipated its weekly edition to publish a story claiming that both President [[Dilma Rousseff]] and her predecessor [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] were aware of a misappropriation scheme inside the state oil company [[Petrobras]].<ref>[http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/eleicoes-2014/noticia/2014/10/revista-antecipa-edicao-com-suposta-delacao-de-doleiro-4627789.html Noticias] October 2014</ref> The magazine headquarters was attacked by pro-PT protestors.<ref>[http://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2014/noticia/2014/10/predio-da-editora-abril-e-pichado-em-protesto-contra-revista-veja.html Globo] October 2014.</ref> Once again ''Veja'' was forced by the Supreme Electoral Court to publish a rebuttal from PT.<ref>[http://www.cartacapital.com.br/blogs/carta-nas-eleicoes/veja-publica-direito-de-resposta-de-coligacao-de-dilma-rousseff-8970.html CartaCapital]</ref>

In July 2015 the magazine published a story claiming that federal contractor Léo Pinheiro would offer a [[plea bargaining]] claiming that Lula was aware and benefited from the aforementioned corruption case. However, Pinheiro published an article claiming that the statements attributed to him were fake.<ref>[http://www.cartacapital.com.br/blogs/midiatico/lula-processa-revista-veja-por-201cfarsa201d-epoca-deve-ser-a-proxima-8068.html CartaCapital]</ref> As such, Lula decided to sue ''Veja'' for moral damages.<ref>[http://noticias.r7.com/brasil/ex-presidente-lula-aciona-a-justica-contra-materia-de-revista-semanal-29072015 Noticias]</ref><ref>[http://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/politica/noticia/4188204/lula-entra-com-acao-judicial-contra-revista-veja-pede-reparacao Info Money]</ref> On the same issue, the magazine accused former soccer player and Senator [[Romário]] of having a bank account in the [[tax haven]] country of Switzerland.
