'''Kettering University''' (formerly '''General Motors Institute of Technology''') is a private university in [[Flint, Michigan]]. It offers bachelor's and master's degrees in STEM ([[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics]]) and business fields. Kettering University undergraduate students are required to complete at least five co-op terms to graduate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kettering.edu/content/undergraduate-application-graduate/undergraduate-graduation-requirements-and-information |title=Undergraduate Graduation Requirements and Information - Kettering University |publisher=Kettering.edu |accessdate=2017-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127193218/http://www.kettering.edu/content/undergraduate-application-graduate/undergraduate-graduation-requirements-and-information |archivedate=2015-11-27 }}</ref> Students gain paid work experience in a variety of industries with Kettering's more than 550 corporate partners, and graduate with professional experiences accompanying their degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kettering.edu/experiential-learning/co-op-experience |title=Major in Experience - Kettering University |publisher=Kettering.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref>

Kettering University is named after inventor and former head of research for [[General Motors]], [[Charles F. Kettering]]. Along with his distinguished career that included his development of the automatic cash register and automobile self-starter, as well as research on magnetism and solar energy, Kettering was a proponent of cooperative education. This concept included professional experience to supplement instruction in classrooms and labs.<ref name="kettering.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.kettering.edu/about/our-history-archives/collections/charles-f-kettering |title=Charles F. Kettering - Kettering University |publisher=Kettering.edu |date=1998-01-01 |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref> Kettering University's belief in experiential education is based on Charles Kettering's foundational belief in the power of combining theory with practice.<ref name="kettering.edu"/>

===Establishment===
Founded as The School of Automotive Trades by [[Albert Sobey]] under the direction of the Industrial Fellowship of Flint on October 20, 1919, Kettering University has a long legacy with the [[automotive industry]]. The university became known as the Flint Institute of Technology in 1923 before being acquired by [[General Motors]] in 1926. It was renamed as the General Motors Institute of Technology and eventually the General Motors Institute in 1932.{{ref_label|stats|2|2}}

Once referred to as the "[[West Point]] of the Automobile industry," GMI focused on creating business and industry leaders through the unique co-op model (following the development of this program at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1907).<ref>{{cite news |author= Beata Mostafavi |url= http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2010/07/kettering_university_graduates.html |title= Kettering graduates have 10th highest salary potential |newspaper= Flint Journal |date=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref> GMI also pioneered freshman-level manufacturing courses (Production Processes I & II), and automotive degree specialties. A fifth-year thesis requirement was added in 1945, and the Institute was granted the ability to award degrees. The first bachelor's degree was awarded on August 23, 1946.{{ref_label|stats|2|2}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:C kettering.jpg|thumbnail|left|Charles F. Kettering in his Solar Energy Research Lab.]] -->

The co-op program required applicants to find a GM division to be their sponsor. Work and school were mixed in six-week rotations, dividing the student body into A-section and B-section. At any given time, when A-section was in school, B-section was at work. After six weeks, B-section would go back to school and so on. This resulted in students moving eight times per year and a 48-week school/work year. Because General Motors used the school to train its engineers, tuition was partially subsidized. In June 1979 (the Class of 1984) co-op rotations were expanded to twelve weeks.

===Split from GM===
After GM reduced operations in Flint, the company and the university separated on July 1, 1982. The name of the institution became "GMI Engineering & Management Institute" and the letters "GMI" were retained to allow easy identification with the old General Motors Institute. The university began charging full tuition as an independent private university. The university kept the cooperative education model, expanding the number of co-op employers for students. The university also began offering graduate programs for both on- and off-campus students.{{ref_label|stats|2|2}}

===Name change and expansion of programs===
The university's name was formally changed to Kettering University on January 1, 1998, in honor of [[Charles Kettering]].<ref>[http://www.kettering.edu/visitors/about/charles_kettering.jsp Charles Kettering biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522152907/http://www.kettering.edu/visitors/about/charles_kettering.jsp |date=2008-05-22 }}</ref> The name change allowed the university to create a separate identity from General Motors as well as publicize the fact that academic programs were expanding beyond just automotive-related offerings.

The university launched a physics program in 1995, and had the first ABET-accredited applied physics program in the world in 2013.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=http://www.kettering.edu/news/applied-physics-engineering-physics-receive-abet-accreditation |title=Physics program receives ABET accreditation - Kettering University |publisher=Kettering.edu |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref> A chemical engineering program as well as a pre-med course of study were launched in 2008.<ref name="mlive1">{{cite web |author= Ryan Garza, at ''The Flint Journal'' |url= http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2011/06/pipeline_from_kettering_univer.html |title=Pipeline from Kettering to medical school grows |publisher=MLive.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref> The chemical engineering program received ABET accreditation in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kettering.edu/news/kettering-chemical-engineering-program-receives-accreditation |title=Chemical Engineering program receives ABET accreditation - Kettering University |publisher=Kettering.edu |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref> The computer science program received ABET accreditation in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kettering.edu/academics/departments/computer-science |title=Kettering University Computer Science |publisher=Kettering.edu |accessdate=2017-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106100937/http://www.kettering.edu/academics/departments/computer-science |archivedate=2015-11-06 }}</ref> The university added an applied biology program in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/12/kettering_university_brings_bi.html |title=Kettering looking beyond engineering with new biology program |publisher=MLive.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref>

===Greek life===
Greek Life on the Kettering/GMI campus begin in 1921.

However, because during this time GMI was not accredited, no national/international recognized fraternities appeared on campus. When GMI did receive accreditation in 1962, the university would require all local fraternities to join a national/international fraternity. Many of the current fraternities on campus came from that transition.<ref name=":0" /> Currently, Kettering University has an active [[Greek letter organization|Greek system]], which is recognized as an excellent source of service opportunities and leadership training. More than 40 percent of the student body is currently involved in a fraternity or sorority.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://my.kettering.edu/current-students/student-life/greek-life-0/history-our-greek-community |title=Kettering University History of Greek Life |publisher=My.kettering.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-10-06}}</ref>

IFC, NPC, and NPHC each have a school-wide council with representatives from each member organization. These councils are designed to facilitate communication between the different groups, and to facilitate relations with the university on matters such as school-wide events and membership.
