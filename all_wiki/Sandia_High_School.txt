__TOC__

==History==
The school opened in school year of 1958-1959.  The originally proposed mascot name was the Sandia Satans, which prompted negative reactions from the surrounding community.  Thereafter, the mascot name was changed to [[Matadors]].  A matador sculpture was placed in the student commons area in 1961.

In the late 1970s, the school reached a record student population for the state of New Mexico.
This led to the approval and construction of a newer facility, [[La Cueva High School]], in the early 1980s.
