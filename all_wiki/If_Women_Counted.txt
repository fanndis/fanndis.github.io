'''''If Women Counted''''' (1988) is a book by New Zealand academic and former politician [[Marilyn Waring]], that is regarded as the "founding document" of the discipline of [[feminist economics]].<ref name="bloomberg" /> The book is a groundbreaking and systematic critique of the system of [[national accounts]], the international standard of measuring economic growth, and the ways in which women's [[unpaid work]] as well as the value of [[Nature]] have been excluded from what counts as productive in the economy.

The book "persuaded the [[United Nations]] to redefine [[gross domestic product]], inspired new accounting methods in dozens of countries, and became the founding document of the discipline of [[feminist economics]]."<ref name="bloomberg">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html |title=Women Unaccounted for in Global Economy Proves Waring Influence |last1=Langeland |first1=Terje |date=18 June 2013 |work= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HU4a0KMl?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-18/women-unaccounted-for-in-global-economy-proves-waring-influence.html |access-date=18 June 2013 |archive-date=19 June 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> A widely cited book, it made the analysis of this topic known to a large audience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beneria|first=Lourdes|authorlink=Lourdes Benería|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92706-4|page=132}}</ref>

==Reception==

According to [[Julie A. Nelson]], 
:"Marilyn Waring's work woke people up.  She showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems, and the damage this causes. Her book [...] encouraged and influenced a wide range of work on ways, both numerical and otherwise, of valuing, preserving, and rewarding the work of care that sustains our lives. By pointing to a similar neglect of the natural environment, she also issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability that have only grown more pressing over time. In recent decades, the field of feminist economics has broadened and widened to encompass these topics and more."<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Julie A.|authorlink=Julie A.
