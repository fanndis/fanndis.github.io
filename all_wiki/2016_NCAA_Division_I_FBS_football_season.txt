The '''2016 NCAA Division I FBS football season''' was the highest level of [[college football]] competition in the United States organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). The regular season began on August 26, 2016 and ended on December 10, 2016. The postseason concluded on January 9, 2017 with the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]], where the [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]] defeated the [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] to claim their second national title in school history. The championship game was a rematch of the [[2016 College Football Playoff National Championship|2016 edition]] won by Alabama.

==Rule changes==
The following rule changes were voted on by the NCAA Football Rules Committee for the 2016 season:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/news/football/article/2016-02-11.football-rules-committee-approves-proposals-enhance-player-safety|title=Football Rules Committee Approves Proposals to Enhance Player Safety|author=ncaa.org|work=ncaa.org|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=February 11, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

* Requiring replay officials to review all aspects of targeting penalties, including the option to call a targeting foul missed by the on-field officials if the foul is deemed egregious. After several hits during the early part of the season that resulted in concussions that should have been targeting, the NCAA Rules Committee reinforced this rule for replay officials and also clarified the "crown of the helmet" (to determine targeting penalties) as the area above the facemask to the dome of the helmet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17679366/ncaa-issues-two-rules-interpretations-targeting-fouls-clarifies-definition-crown-helmet|title=NCAA issues two rules interpretations on targeting fouls|author=espn.com |work=espn.com |date=October 1, 2016|access-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref>
* Allowing electronic devices to be used for coaching purposes in the press box and locker room during the game. Electronic devices will still be prohibited on the field and sideline.
* Coaches can now be ejected after receiving two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in one game, the same as players.
* A ball carrier who "gives himself up" (''e.g.'', by sliding) will now be considered a defenseless player.
* Deliberate tripping of a ball carrier with the leg is now a 15-yard penalty.
* Players who leave the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] are now prohibited from blocking below the waist toward the initial position of the ball.
* An exception to a rule introduced for the 2015 season regarding low hits to passers (''i.e.'', at or below the knee) was eliminated. Previously, a defensive player would not have been penalized for such a hit if making a bona fide attempt at a tackle.
* Teams attempting a scrimmage kick (i''.e.'', field goals, PATs, and punts) must have five offensive linemen (numbered 50-79) on the scrimmage line unless the kicking team has at least two players seven yards OR one player at least 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage. Previously, only one player had to be lined up seven yards behind the line to avoid using five linemen, causing confusion in kick coverage on defense.
* The procedure for restarting the game clock following a penalty by the offense will change if the penalized team has a lead in the last two minutes of either half. Before this season, the game clock would have been restarted in this situation once the ball was declared ready for play; it now will not start until the ball is snapped.

The committee, once again, took no action on changing the ineligible receiver downfield rule from three yards to one yard; however it will once again be a "point of emphasis" and will adjust officiating mechanics to better officiate those plays.

Although [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers football|Coastal Carolina]] began the transition process to FBS in the 2016 season and joined the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in non-football sports, it was officially classified as an FCS independent for this first season of the transition.

Additionally, the ban was seen as having the unintended effect of limiting scholarship opportunities, especially at [[Group of Five conferences|Group of Five]] schools, for a large number of high school prospects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Sam|title=NCAA Division I Board rescinds satellite camp ban|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/ncaa-division-i-board-rescinds-satellite-camp-ban-180802884.html|website=sports.yahoo.com|publisher=[[Yahoo!

On September 10, a finish noted for its improbability happened when [[2016 Central Michigan Chippewas football team|Central Michigan]] defeated [[2016 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] 30–27 on a Hail Mary pass followed by a lateral on the game's final play. Shortly afterwards, the game officials, as well as the conferences of the participating teams (the [[Mid-American Conference|MAC]] and [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] respectively), announced that Central Michigan should not have been allowed to run the winning play. On the previous play, during which the clock had run out, Oklahoma State had been called for intentional grounding on fourth down. Under NCAA rules, a game cannot end on an accepted live ball foul; however, an exception to that rule states that if the penalty includes a loss of down—which is the case for intentional grounding—the game ends at that point.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/17514343/central-michigan-chippewas-wrongly-get-extra-play-upset-no-22-oklahoma-state-cowboys |title=Central Michigan wrongly gets untimed down, beats No. 22 Oklahoma State |first=Sam Jr. |last=Khan |publisher=ESPN.com |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}</ref>

==Updated stadiums==
*'''[[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami (FL)]]''' debuted major renovations to the renamed '''[[Hard Rock Stadium]]'''. In a project that began after the Hurricanes and the stadium's owner, the [[Miami Dolphins]], completed their 2014 seasons, a canopy was added over the main seating areas, video boards were placed in each corner, many luxury suites and club seats were added, and the stadium's lower bowl was reconstructed, eliminating an obsolete movable stand that had been added in the early 1990s to accommodate [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Miami Marlins|Florida (now Miami) Marlins]]. The capacity was reduced from over 75,000 to slightly over 65,000. 
*'''[[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]]''' made major renovations to '''[[Maverik Stadium]]''', adding a new complex to the west side featuring expanded concourses, luxury suites, and a new press box.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utahstateaggies.com/school-bio/ust-romneystadium.html |title=Merlin Olsen Field At Maverik Stadium |publisher=[[Utah State Aggies]] |access-date=January 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314081530/http://www.utahstateaggies.com/school-bio/ust-romneystadium.html |archive-date=March 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
*'''[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]''' is currently undertaking a $160 million renovation of the south end zone of '''[[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]]'''. The renovation which will bowl in the end zone includes 22 enclosed suites, 60 loge boxes and nearly 2,000 club seats.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shinn|first=John|title=Owen Field renovation moving at scheduled pace|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/sports/ou_football/owen-field-renovation-moving-at-scheduled-pace/article_e7a18b3c-1577-517d-85ca-044b6bc8d9b8.html|access-date=February 11, 2016|work=[[The Norman Transcript]]|publisher=[[Community Newspaper Holdings]]|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The new end zone when completed will be topped by a new state of the art 7,806 square feet scoreboard.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vardeman|first=Brady|title=Oklahoma football: Stadium renovations proceeding on schedule|url=http://www.oudaily.com/sports/oklahoma-football-stadium-renovations-proceeding-on-schedule/article_5d45bc24-c093-11e5-8faa-d7dbfb44b4c5.html|access-date=February 11, 2016|work=[[The Oklahoma Daily]]|publisher=OU Student Media|date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> The official capacity increased to 83,489 (from 82,112).
*'''[[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]]'''  debuted phase 2 of the latest renovations and expansion of '''[[Vaught–Hemingway Stadium]]'''. The 2016 season saw the opening of new seating bowls in the north end zone, bringing capacity to 64,038.
*'''[[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]]''' unveiled The Champions Club, a new club seat section constructed for '''[[Doak Campbell Stadium]]'''. The exclusive 6,000-seat club seat section, with more than 70,000 square feet of air conditioned club space and 34,000 square feet of covered rooftop terraces, was built in the south end zone across from the Unconquered Statue.
*'''[[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]]''' began a four-year renovation of '''[[Sun Devil Stadium]]''' after the 2014 season. For the 2016 season, upper deck seats were removed and the lower bowl on the west sideline and north end zone was redone. Renovations are expected to be complete by the start of the 2018 season.
*'''[[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]]''' was in the midst of approximately $50 million in renovations to '''[[Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium|Milan Puskar Stadium]]'''. For this season, the old turf and goalposts were replaced, and the crown under the field was removed and a modern base and drainage system installed that is more in keeping with today's infilled artificial turf systems. Also, work on the east and north side gates and concourses, including renovations to concessions, restrooms, and additional space for EMS and police operations, was completed for the 2016 season. Similar work on the west and south sides of the stadium is ongoing and expected to be completed for 2017.
*'''[[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]''' began work on expansion of '''[[Papa John's Cardinal Stadium]]''' during the season. The project will increase the stadium's capacity from 55,000 to 65,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comingfullcircle.com/#FREQUENTLY |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Papa John's Cardinal Stadium Expansion Project |publisher=Cardinal Athletic Fund |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref> and at the time was planned to be complete for the 2019 season. Due to unexpected fundraising success, the project timetable was advanced, and the expansion is now expected to open for the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/34459060/papa-johns-cardinal-stadium-expansion-accelerated-due-to-fundraising-success |title=Papa John's Cardinal Stadium expansion accelerated due to fundraising success |publisher=[[WDRB]] |location=[[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]] |date=February 8, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>

In addition to the stadium updates above, two schools played their final season in their then-current venues:
* '''[[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State]]''' was in the process of replacing [[Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium|Hughes Stadium]], owned by the university but located about 4 miles (6&nbsp;km) west of the main campus, with a new on-campus venue tentatively known as '''[[Colorado State Stadium]]'''. The new stadium opened for the 2017 season.
* '''[[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]]''' played its final season in the Georgia Dome, as the stadium was to be demolished once its replacement, [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]], opened in September 2017. As noted [[#Other headlines|above]], Georgia State purchased Turner Field with the intent of renovating the stadium for football, and the Panthers began playing home games there in 2017 while renovations were ongoing.
