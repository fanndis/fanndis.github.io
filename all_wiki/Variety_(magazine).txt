'''''Variety''''' is an American media company owned by [[Penske Media Corporation]]. The company was founded by [[Sime Silverman]] in New York City in 1905 as a weekly newspaper reporting on theater and [[vaudeville]]. In 1933 it added '''''Daily Variety''''', based in Los Angeles, to cover the [[film industry|motion-picture industry]]. '''''Variety.com''''' features breaking entertainment news, reviews, box office results, cover stories, videos, photo galleries and features, plus a credits database, production charts and calendar, with archive content dating back to 1905.

== History ==
''Variety'' has been published since December 16, 1905,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety01-1905-12#page/n2/mode/1up|title=Variety, First Year No. 1|magazine=Variety|date=December 16, 1905|page=3|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref><ref>"Inside Variety" published in 2000 (Ars Millenii, Madrid) by Peter Besas</ref> when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and [[vaudeville]] with its headquarters in New York City.

Sime was fired by ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety81-1925-12#page/n257/mode/1up|title=How "Variety" Happened|magazine=Variety|date=December 30, 1925|page=8|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref> and said that it looked like he would have to start his own paper in order to be able to tell the truth. With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched ''Variety'' as publisher and editor.<ref name="VarietyObit">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n208/mode/1up|title=Sime Silverman, founder of 'Variety,' Dies Suddenly in Hollywood at 60|magazine=Variety|date=September 26, 1933|page=1|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

In addition to Sime's former employer ''The Morning Telegraph'', other major competitors on launch were ''[[The New York Clipper]]'' and the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]''.<ref name="VarietyObit" />

The original cover design, which is very similar to the current design, was sketched by Edgar M. Miller, a scenic painter, who refused payment.<ref name="archive18">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety41-1915-12#page/n158/mode/1up|title=The First Issue of Variety|magazine=Variety|date=December 24, 1915|page=18}}</ref>

The front cover contained pictures of the original editorial staff, who were Alfred Greason, Epes W Sargeant (Chicot or Chic) and Joshua Lowe, as well as Sime.<ref name="Four-Letter">{{cite magazine|title='Variety's' Four-Letter Signatures, The Dog-Tags of its Critics|date=January 9, 1974|magazine=Variety|page=26}}</ref>

The first issue contained a review by Sime's son [[Sidne Silverman|Sidne]], also known as Skigie (based on the childish lisping of his name) who was claimed to be the youngest critic in the world at seven years old.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety01-1905-12#page/n4/mode/1up|title="Skigie," the Youngest Critic in the World|magazine=Variety|date=December 16, 1905|page=5|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

In 1922 Sime acquired ''The New York Clipper'' which had been reporting on the stage and other entertainment since 1853 and folded it two years later, merging some of its features into ''Variety''.<ref name="InsideStuff">{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n210/mode/1up|title=Veteran 'Variety' Mugg Gives Some Inside Stuff on Sime's Starting 'V'|magazine=Variety|date=September 26, 1933|page=3|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

Also in 1922, Sime launched the ''Times Square Daily'', which he referred to as "the world's worst daily" and soon scrapped.<ref name="VarietyObit" /> During that period, ''Variety'' staffers worked on all three papers.

After the launch of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in 1930, which ''Variety'' sued for alleged plagiarism in 1932,<ref name="Variety1932">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety105-1932-01#page/n1/mode/1up|title='Variety' Charges Hollywood Daily of Stealing Its News Each Week|date=January 5, 1932|work=Variety}}</ref> Sime launched ''Daily Variety'' in 1933, based in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], with Arthur Ungar as the editor. It replaced ''Variety Bulletin'' that was issued in Hollywood on Fridays. ''Daily Variety'' was initially published every day other than Sunday but mostly on Monday to Friday.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n91/mode/1up|title=Daily Variety on Coast}} Variety, September 12, 1933 p. 5</ref> Ungar was editor until 1950, followed by Joe Schoenfeld (1950–1959) and then Thomas M.

Sime Silverman had passed on the editorship of the ''Weekly Variety'' to [[Abel Green]] as his replacement in 1931; he remained as publisher until his death in 1933 soon after launching ''Daily Variety''. Green remained as editor from 1931 until his death in 1973.

Sime's son Sidne succeeded him as publisher of both publications but upon contracting [[tuberculosis]] in 1936 he could no longer take a day to day role at the paper.<ref name=Erichs>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|date=February 11, 1976|page=2|title=Harold Erichs, 74, 'Variety' Treasurer, Financial Officer; Career Spanned 60 Years|last=Silverman|first=Syd|author-link=Syd Silverman}}</ref> Green, the editor, and Harold Erichs, the treasurer and chief financial officer, ran the paper during his illness.<ref name=Erichs/> Following Sidne's death in 1950, his only son [[Syd Silverman]], was the sole heir to what was then Variety Inc. Young Syd's [[legal guardian]] Harold Erichs assumed the presidency and continued to oversee Variety until 1956.<ref name=Erichs/> After that date, Syd Silverman
managed the company as publisher of both the ''Weekly Variety'' in New York and the ''Daily Variety'' in Hollywood, until the sale of both papers in 1987 to [[Cahners Publishing]] for $64 million.<ref>{{Cite news|issn=0458-3035|last=Harris|first=Kathryn|title=Writers at Variety Ask: Will Sale End Freewheeling Era?|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 23, 2014|date=July 15, 1987|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-15/business/fi-2283_1_daily-variety }}</ref> He remained as publisher until 1990 when he was succeeded on ''Weekly Variety'' by Gerard A. Byrne and on ''Daily Variety'' by Sime's great grandson, Michael Silverman. Syd became chairman of both publications.<ref>{{cite news|work=Variety|title=Byrne new Variety publisher; Silverman appointed chairman|date=February 7, 1990}}</ref>

In 1953 [[Army Archerd]]'s "Just for Variety" column appeared on page two of ''Daily Variety'' and swiftly became popular in Hollywood. Archerd broke countless exclusive stories, reporting from film sets, announcing pending deals, giving news of star-related hospitalizations, marriages, and births. The column appeared daily for 52 years until September 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/just-for-variety-column-to-end-after-52-years-1117926968/|title='Just for Variety' column to end after 52 years|date=August 3, 2005|access-date=March 12, 2018}}</ref>

On December 7, 1988, the editor, Roger Watkins, proposed and oversaw the transition to [[color print|four-color print]]. Upon its launch, the new-look ''Variety'' measured one inch shorter with a washed-out color on the front. The old front-page box advertisement was replaced by a strip advertisement, along with the first photos published in ''Variety'' since Sime gave up using them in the old format in 1920: they depicted Sime, Abel and Syd.<ref>[http://www.simesite.net/roger/ www.simesite.net/roger/], 7th paragraph.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205074151/http://www.simesite.net/roger/|date=February 5, 2015}}</ref>

For 20 years from 1989 its editor-in-chief was [[Peter Bart]], originally only of the weekly New York edition, with Michael Silverman (Syd's son) running the ''Daily'' in Hollywood. Bart had worked previously at [[Paramount Pictures]] and ''[[The New York Times]]''. In April 2009 Bart moved to the position of "vice president and editorial director", characterized online as "Boffo No More: Bart Up and Out at Variety". From mid 2009 to 2013, Timothy M. Gray oversaw the publication as Editor-in-Chief,<ref>{{cite news|first1=Brooks|last1=Barnes|last2=Cieply|first2=Michael|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/movies/07bart.html |title=Change of Guard at Variety Reflects Shifting Landscape|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 6, 2009}}  Accessed July 30, 2009  (registration required).</ref> after over 30 years of various reporter and editor positions in the newsroom.<ref>"[https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=about_staff_layout&dpt=Editorial Editorial Staff]".

In October 2012 [[Reed Business Information]], the periodical's owner, (formerly known as Reed-Elsevier, which had been parent to Cahner's Corp. in the United States) sold the publication to [[PMC (company)|Penske Media Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 19, 2012|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-big-picture-variety-20120719,0,2609760.story|title=The Big Picture: Variety's future looks bleak}} Accessed July 21, 2012</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/in-a-fire-sale-penske-media-buys-variety/|title=In a Fire Sale, Penske Media Buys Variety|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 9, 2012|first1=Brooks|last1=Barnes|first2=Michael|last2=Cieply|date=October 9, 2012}}</ref> PMC is the owner of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', which since the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] has been considered ''Variety''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s largest competitor in online showbiz news. In October 2012, [[Jay Penske]], Chairman and CEO of PMC, announced that the website's [[paywall]] would come down, the print publication would stay, and he would invest more into Variety's digital platform in a [[town hall meeting|townhall]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.deadline.com/2012/10/jay-penske-tells-variety-town-hall-today-pay-wall-ends-print-stays-digital-expands/|title=Jay Penske Tells Variety Town Hall Today: Pay Wall Ends, Print Stays, Digital Expands|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 10, 2012|access-date=October 11, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2013 owner Penske appointed three co-editors to oversee different parts of the publication's industry coverage; Claudia Eller as Editor, Film; Cynthia Littleton as Editor, TV; and Andrew Wallenstein as Editor, Digital. The decision was also made to stop printing ''Daily Variety'' with the last printed edition published on March 19, 2013 with the headline "Variety Ankles Daily Pub Hubbub".<ref>{{cite news|work=Daily Variety|title=Variety Ankles Daily Pub Hubbub|date=March 19, 2013|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=[[Reuters]]|title=Showbiz magazine Daily Variety goes out of print after 80 years|date=March 20, 2013|access-date=May 5, 2018|first1=Steve |last1=Gorman |first2=Brandon |last2=Lowrey|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainment-us-usa-media-variety/showbiz-magazine-daily-variety-goes-out-of-print-after-80-years-idUSBRE92J01M20130320}}</ref>

In October 2014 Eller and Wallenstein were upped to Co-Editors in Chief, with Littleton continuing to oversee the trade's television coverage. In June 2014, Penske Media Corporation (PMC) entered into an agreement with Reuters to syndicate news from ''Variety'' and ''Variety'' Latino-Powered by Univision to distribute leading entertainment news to the international news agency's global readership. This dissemination comes in the form of columns, news stories, images, video, and data-focused products. In July 2015, ''Variety'' was awarded a Los Angeles Area Emmy Award by the Television Academy in the Best Entertainment Program category for ''[[Variety Studio: Actors on Actors]]'', a series of one-hour specials that take viewers inside Hollywood films and television programs through conversations with acclaimed actors. A second Los Angeles Area Emmy Award was awarded in 2016.

A significant portion of the publication's advertising revenue comes during the film-award season leading up to the [[Academy Awards]]. During this "Awards Season", large numbers of colorful, full-page "[[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]]" advertisements inflate the size of ''Variety'' to double or triple its usual page count. These advertisements are the studios' attempt to reach other Hollywood professionals who will be voting on the many awards given out in the early part of the year, including the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Golden Globes]] and various guild award honors.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Culture==
[[File:Variety magaz logo.png|alt=|thumb|200x200px]]
For much of its existence, ''Variety''{{'s}} writers and columnists have used a [[jargon]] called ''slanguage''<ref>{{cite web  |url= https://variety.com/static-pages/slanguage-dictionary/  |title= ''Variety''{{'s}} "Slanguage Dictionary"  |quote= Now that Variety is available online, we offer the following glossary of terms, most of which you’re likely to see while scanning this site.  }}</ref> or ''varietyese'' (a form of ''[[headlinese]]'') that refers especially to the movie industry, and has largely been adopted and imitated by other writers in the industry. The language initially reflected that spoken by the actors of the early days during the newspaper.<ref name="InsideStuff" />

Such terms as "legit", "boffo", "sitcom", "sex appeal", "payola", and "striptease" are attributed to the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gloria|last=Hillard|title=A Century of 'Variety'-Speak |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4708916 |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=June 18, 2005}} Accessed March 15, 2008.</ref> Its attempt to popularize "infobahn" as a synonym for "[[information superhighway]]" never caught on. [[Television program|Television series]] are referred to as "skeins", and heads of companies or corporate teams are called "toppers". In addition to a stylistic grammatical blip – very frequent omissions of the definite [[Article (grammar)|article]] ''[[the]]'' –, more-common English words and phrases are shortened; "audience members" becomes simply "auds", "performance" "perf", and "network" becomes "net", for example.

In 1934, founder Sime Silverman headed a list in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] of the "ten modern Americans who have done most to keep American jargon alive".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746817,00.html|title=Press: Doctor & Duke|date=January 15, 1934|work=Time|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites ''Variety'' as the earliest source for about two dozen terms, including "show biz" (1945).<ref name=Wren2005>{{cite news|last=Wren|first=Celia|date=February 27, 2005|title=Do you speak showbiz?

Gray and J. C. Suares, which defines nearly 200 of these terms.

One of its popular headlines was during the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]: "[[Wall Street Lays An Egg|Wall St. Lays An Egg]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety96-1929-10#page/n338/mode/1up|title=Wall St. Lays an Egg|work=Variety|date=October 30, 1929}}</ref> The most famous was "[[Sticks Nix Hick Pix]]"<ref>{{cite news|first=George|last=McCall|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety119-1935-07#page/n124/mode/1up|title=Sticks Nix Hick Pix|work=Variety|date=July 17, 1935}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Elizabeth|last=Guider|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/news/1935-exhibitor-perspective-sticks-in-memory-1117922319/|title=1935 exhibitor perspective 'Sticks' in memory|work=Variety|date=May 8, 2005|access-date=March 8, 2018}}</ref> (the [[Theatrical property|movie-prop]] version renders it as "Stix nix hix pix!" in ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), [[Michael Curtiz]]'s [[musical film|musical]]–[[biographical film]] about [[George M. Cohan]] starring [[James Cagney]]).

In 2012 Rizzoli Books published ''Variety: An Illustrated History of the World from the Most Important Magazine in Hollywood'' by Gray. The book covers ''Variety''{{'}}s coverage of hundreds of world events, from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, through Arab Spring in 2012, and argues that the entertainment industry needs to stay aware of changes in politics and tastes since those changes will affect their audiences. In a foreword to the book, [[Martin Scorsese]] calls ''Variety'' "the single most formidable trade publication ever" and says that the book's content "makes you feel not only like a witness to history, but part of it too."

In 2013 ''Variety'' staffers tallied more than 200 uses of weekly or Daily ''Variety'' in TV shows and films, ranging from ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' to ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 2016 ''Variety'' endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for [[President of the United States]], marking the first time the publication endorsed a candidate for elected office in its 111-year history.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/variety-hillary-clinton-endorsement-1201905147/|title=Variety Endorses Hillary Clinton for President|date=November 1, 2016|access-date=November 2, 2016|magazine=Variety|first1=Claudia|last1=Eller|first2=Andrew|last2=Wallenstein}}</ref>

Later it moved to 1536 Broadway at the 45th and Broadway corner until [[Loew's]] acquired the site to build the [[Loew's State Theatre (New York City)|Loew's State Theatre]].<ref name="VarietyObit" />

In 1920 Sime Silverman purchased an old brownstone building around the corner at 154 West 46th Street in New York, which became the ''Variety'' headquarters until 1987, when the publication was purchased.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Broadway: An Encyclopedia|last=Bloom|first=Ken|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|location=New York|pages=538–540}}</ref> Under the new management of Cahners Publishing, the New York headquarters of the ''Weekly Variety'' was relocated to the corner of 32nd Street and Park Avenue South.<ref name=":0" /> Five years later, it was downgraded to a section of one floor in a building housing other Cahner's publications on West 18th Street, until the majority of operations were moved to Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

When ''Daily Variety'' started in 1933, its offices were in various buildings near Hollywood Blvd. and Sunset Blvd. In 1972, Syd Silverman purchased a building at 1400 North Cahuenga Blvd. which housed the Daily's offices until 1988, after which its new corporate owners and new publisher, Arthur Anderman, moved them to a building on the [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California|Miracle Mile]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]].

In late 2008 ''Variety'' moved its Los Angeles offices to [[5900 Wilshire]], a 31-story office building on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile area.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/03/variety-deadline-westwood-building-headquarters-pmc-451471/|title=Deadline And Variety To Live Under One Roof After Westwood Building Deal|date=2013-03-12|website=Deadline|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/a-sign-of-change-variety-name-removed-from-5900-wilshire/|title=A Sign of Change: Variety Name Removed From 5900 Wilshire Los Angeles Magazine|last=Arnold|first=Shayna Rose|date=2013-11-15|website=Los Angeles Magazine|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> The building was dubbed the Variety Building because a red, illuminated "Variety" sign graced the top of the building.<ref name=":1" />

In 2013 PMC, the parent company of ''Variety'', announced plans to move ''Variety's'' offices to their new corporate headquarters at 11175 Santa Monica Blvd. in Westwood.<ref name=":1" /> There, ''Variety'' shares the 9-story building with parent company PMC, Variety Insight, Variety 411, and PMC's other media brands, including Deadline.com, HollywoodLife.com, GoldDerby.com, Robb Report and the West Coast offices of WWD and Footwear News.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==Film reviews==
On January 19, 1907, ''Variety'' published what is considered the first [[film criticism|film review]] in history. Two reviews written by Sime Silverman were published: [[Pathé]]'s comedy short ''An Exciting Honeymoon'' and [[Edison Studios]]' western short ''The Life of a Cowboy'', directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]].<ref name="FirstReview">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety05-1907-01#page/n54/mode/1up|title=An Exciting Honeymoon|work=Variety|page=9|date=January 19, 1907}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/1907-filmhistory.html|title=Timeline of Greatest Film Milestones and Turning Points in Film History - The Year 1907|work=filmsite.org}}</ref>

''Variety'' discontinued reviews of films between March 1911 until January 1913<ref name="VarietyMovieGuide">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WoexyWeRvUC|title=Variety Movie Guide|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=May 1, 1992|isbn=9780139283420}}</ref> as they were convinced by a film producer, believed to be [[George Kleine]], that they were wasting space criticising moving pictures and others had suggested that favourable reviews brought too strong a demand for certain pictures to the exclusion of others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety41-1915-12#page/n155/mode/1up|title=A Critic Confesses|work=Variety|page=16|date=December 24, 1915}}</ref> Despite the gap, ''Variety'' is still the longest unbroken source of film criticism in existence.<ref name="VarietyMovieGuide"/>

In 1930 ''Variety'' also started publishing a summary of miniature reviews for the films reviewed that week<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety97-1930-01#page/n409/mode/1up|title=Miniature Reviews|work=Variety|page=22|date=January 15, 1930}}</ref> and in 1951 the editors decided to position the capsules on top of the reviews,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety182-1951-06#page/n5/mode/1up|title=Film Reviews|work=Variety|page=6|date=June 6, 1951}}</ref> a tradition retained today.

===Reviewers' pen names===
Writing reviews was a side job for ''Variety'' staff, most of whom were hired to be reporters and not film or theatre critics. Many of the publication's reviewers identified their work with four-letter [[pen names]] ("sigs") rather than with their full names. The practice stopped in August 1991.<ref name=sig>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|last=Bart|first=Peter|author-link=Peter Bart|date=August 5, 1991|page=3|title=Signing off on 'sigs'}}</ref> Those abbreviated names include the following:<ref name="Four-Letter"/>

===Reprints of reviews===
''Variety'' is one of the three English-language periodicals with 10,000 or more film reviews reprinted in book form. These are contained in the 24-volume [[Variety Film Reviews]] (1907–1996). Film reviews continue to be published in ''Variety''. The other two periodicals are ''[[The New York Times]]'' (as ''The New York Times Film Reviews'' (1913–2000) in 22 volumes) and ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' (as ''[[Harrison's Reports and Film Reviews]]'' (1919–1962) in 15 volumes).

In 1992 ''Variety'' published the ''Variety Movie Guide'' containing a collection of 5,000 abridged reviews edited by [[Derek Elley]].<ref name="VarietyMovieGuide"/> The last edition was published in 2001 with 8,500 reviews.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Variety Movie Guide 2001|last=Elley|first=Derek|date=March 1, 2001|isbn=0399526579}}</ref> Many of the abridged reviews for films prior to 1998 are published on ''Variety.com'' unless they have later posted the original review.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1985/film/reviews/maximum-overdrive-1200426863/|title=Film reviews - Maximum Overdrive|access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

==Obituaries==
The complete text of approximately 100,000 entertainment-related [[obituaries]] (1905–1986) was reprinted as ''[[Variety Obituaries]]'', an 11-volume set, including alphabetical index. Four additional bi-annual reprints were published (for 1987–1994) before the reprint series was discontinued.

The annual anniversary edition published in January would often contain a [[necrology]] of the entertainment people who had died that year.<ref>{{cite news|work=Variety|title=Necrology of 1982|page=239|date=January 12, 1983}}</ref>

==Charts and data==
''Variety'' started reporting [[box office]] grosses for films by theatre on March 3, 1922, to give exhibitors around the country information on a film's performance on Broadway, which was often where first run showings of a film were held. In addition to New York City, they also endeavored to include all of the key cities in the U.S. in the future and initially also reported results for ten other cities including Chicago and Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety66-1922-03#page/n46/mode/1up|title=Business on Broadway Figures For Exhibitors' Information|magazine=Variety|date=March 3, 1922|page=47}}</ref> They continued to report these grosses for films until 1989 when they put the data into a summarized weekly chart<ref name="NewBOFormat">{{cite news|title=New B.O. Sample Format|work=Variety|page=9|date=December 20, 1989}}</ref> and only published the data by theatre for New York and Los Angeles as well as other international cities such as London and Paris.

As [[Multimedia|media]] expanded over the years, charts and data for other media such as TV ratings and music charts were published, especially in the anniversary editions that were regularly published each January.

During the 1930s charts of the top performing films of the year were published and this tradition has been maintained annually since.<ref name="32ndAnni">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety129-1938-01#page/n2/mode/1up|title=Top Pix and Stars of 1937|work=Variety|page=3|date=January 5, 1938}}</ref>

In 1946 a weekly National Box Office survey was published on page 3 indicating the performance of the week's hits and flops based on the box office results of 25 key U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety162-1946-04#page/n2/mode/1up|title=Lent and Weather Easing Some B.O.s But 'Trunk,' 'Adventure,' 'Utopia' 'Big'|work=Variety|page=3|date=April 3, 1946}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.simesite.net/muggs.asp?articleid=313|title=How Box Office Reporting Was Built|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030810225548/http://www.simesite.net/muggs.asp?articleid=313|archive-date=August 10, 2003}}</ref>

Later in 1946 a list of All-Time Top Grossers with a list of films that had achieved or gave promise of earning $4,000,000 or more in domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals was published.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety163-1946-09#page/n180/mode/1up|title=All-Time Top Grossers|work=Variety|page=5|date=September 25, 1946}}</ref> An updated chart was published annually for over 50 years, normally in the anniversary edition each January.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/numbers/video.asp|title=All-Time Top Film Rentals|date=1998|work=Variety|access-date=24 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991007042514/http://www.variety.com/numbers/video.asp|archive-date=7 October 1999|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/digital/features/rental-champs-rate-of-return-1116680329/|title=Rental Champs Rate of Return|work=Variety|date=December 15, 1997|access-date=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

In the late 1960s ''Variety'' started to use an [[IBM 360]] computer to collate the grosses from their weekly reports of 22 to 24 U.S. cities from January 1, 1968. The data came from up to 800 theatres which represented around 5% of the U.S. cinema population at the time but around one-third of the total U.S. box office grosses. In 1969, they started to publish the computerized box office compilation of the top 50 grossing films of the week based on this data.<ref>{{cite news|title=Computerized B.O. Chart Due|work=Variety|date=April 16, 1969|page=3}}</ref> "[[The Love Bug]]" was the number one in the first chart published for the week ending April 16, 1969.<ref>{{cite news|title=50 Top-Grossing Films|work=Variety|date=April 23, 1969|page=11}}</ref> The chart format was changed in 1989 to reduce the list to a top 40 and display a summary of the sample city theater grosses rather than publish the theater grosses separately.<ref name="NewBOFormat"/> The sample chart was discontinued in 1990.<ref name="SampleChart">{{cite news|title=Variety's Grosses Report|work=Variety|page=5|date=February 14, 1990}}</ref>

Arthur D. Murphy, who joined ''Variety'' in 1964 and worked there until 1993, was one of the first to organize and chart domestic box office gross information that became more available during the 1980s and report it in a meaningful form setting a standard for how film box office information is reported today.<ref name="MurfObit">{{cite news|url=http://www.simesite.net/muggs.asp?articleid=311|title=Art Murphy Exits|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031115050806/http://www.simesite.net/muggs.asp?articleid=311|archive-date=November 15, 2003}}</ref> Murphy used the weekly sample reports to estimate the total US weekly box office compared with previous annual totals which was reported in ''Variety's'' US Boxoffice Report each week. The sample also allowed Murphy to estimate the Market Share percentage rankings of distributors.<ref name="NewBOFormat"/>

In 1976 the Variety Box Office Index (VBI) was launched where each month's actual key city box office tally, after seasonal adjustment, was simultaneously expressed as an index number, with 1970 as a whole being used as the base initially. The current month's VBI expressed the monthly box office performance as a percentage change from the base year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Variety Debuts New Film Index, Graphs|work=Variety|date=February 4, 1976}}</ref> The index was published until 1991 giving a history of comparable monthly and annual box office performance for the past 20 years.

During the 1980s, ''Daily Variety'' started to publish a weekly chart of the domestic box office grosses of films as compared to the Top 50 chart in ''Variety'' which was based on a sample of key markets. ''Variety'' started to publish this weekend box office report together with the sample Top 50 chart (later top 40) until they discontinued the sample chart in February 1990 with the weekend box office report being their main source of box office reporting.<ref name="SampleChart"/>

In 2009 ''Variety'' launched a chart showcasing the top performing film trailers ahead of theatrical release in partnership with media measurement firm Visible Measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visiblemeasures.com/insights/charts/variety/|title=Top 10 Film Trailers of the Week|work=visiblemeasures.com}}</ref>

==Other ''Variety'' products==
In 1937 ''Variety'' compiled and published a Radio Directory compiling a record of events in radio such as program histories, ratings and popularity polls.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/varietyradiod19371938vari#page/n0/mode/2up|title=Variety Radio Directory 1937-1938}}</ref> It published an annual edition for the next three years<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title='Variety' To Publish Annual Book Of Reference on All Show Biz|date=September 21, 1977|page=2}}</ref> which are available on the Media History Digital Library.

In 1981, ''Variety International Showbusiness Reference'' was published, which they claimed was the first book to contain a complete list of all winners and nominees for the [[Academy Awards]], [[Emmy Awards]], [[Tony Awards]], [[Grammy Awards]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]]. The following year they published ''Variety major U.S. showbusiness awards'' containing just this award details and a revised edition, called ''Variety presents the complete book of major U.S. show business awards'', was published in 1985.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Garland|title=Variety presents the complete book of major U.S. show business awards|last=Kaplan|first=Mike|year=1985|isbn=0-8240-8919-7|url=https://archive.org/details/varietypresentsc00kapl/page/n8/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

In 1988, R.R. Bowker, a Reed Reference Publishing Company, part of Reed-Elsevier, PLC, a "sister" company to ''Variety'', published ''Variety's Video Directory Plus'', a CD-ROM subscription product, updated quarterly, containing metadata about 90,000 home video products and full-text film reviews from ''Variety''.

[[Peter Cowie]] joined ''Variety'' in 1989<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2000/more/news/i-variety-i-s-cowie-on-move-1117785663/|title=Variety's Cowie on Move|date=August 28, 2000|access-date=March 18, 2019|magazine=Variety}}.</ref> and his ''International Film Guide'', which had been published annually since 1964, became ''Variety International Film Guide'' with reports from countries on the year in cinema as well as information of film festivals. It continued to bear ''Variety'''s name until 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/catalog?q=%22International+film+guide%22&search_field=search_title|title=Variety International Film Guide|access-date=April 9, 2018|issn=0074-6053}}</ref>

In 1990 ''Variety'' published a 15-volume set of its television reviews (including home video product) from 1923 to 1988.

In 1999 Cowie published ''The Variety Insider'' with detailed information on the year in entertainment as well as historical information.

In November 2014 ''Variety'' announced the premiere of Variety Studio: Actors on Actors, a production with PBS SoCal that featured two actors discussing their craft and thoughts on Hollywood, which subsequently went on to win three Emmy awards, including a Daytime Creative Arts Award in May 2019. 

In January 2017 they launched the Variety Content Studio, creating custom content for brands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/variety-names-dea-lawrence-as-chief-marketing-officer-1201608896/|title=Variety Names Dea Lawrence as Chief Marketing Officer|date=October 6, 2015|work=Variety|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Variety Names Dea Lawrence as Chief Marketing Officer|date=October 6, 2015|work=Variety}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/01/variety-content-studios-penske-media-corporation-1201767453/|title=Variety Announces the Launch of Variety Content Studios|last=Staff|first=Indiewire|date=January 11, 2017|work=IndieWire|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/variety-launches-content-studios-for-branded-production-1201957304/|title=Variety Launches Content Studios for Branded Production|date=January 10, 2017|work=Variety|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>
