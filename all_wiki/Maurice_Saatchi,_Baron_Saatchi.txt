'''Maurice Nathan Saatchi, Baron Saatchi''' ({{lang-ar|موريس ساعتجي}} ; born 21 June 1946) is a British-Iraqi businessman, and with his brother, [[Charles Saatchi|Charles]], co-founder of the [[advertising]] agencies [[Saatchi and Saatchi]] and [[M&C Saatchi]].

== Early life ==
Maurice Saatchi is the third of four sons born to [[Nathan Saatchi]] and Daisy Ezer, a wealthy [[Iraqi Jewish|Iraqi]] [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] family in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]].  Maurice's brothers are David (born 1937), [[Charles Saatchi|Charles Nathan]] (born 1943) and Philip (born 1953).{{sfn|Goldman|1997}} Nathan was a successful textile merchant, and in 1947 he pre-empted a flight that tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews would soon make to avoid persecution and relocated his family to [[Finchley]]<ref name="times2009">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5817312.ece|title=The Saturday interview: Charles Saatchi|last=Thomson|first=Alice |author2=[[Rachel Sylvester]]  |date=28 February 2009|newspaper=Times Online|access-date=24 November 2009 | location=London}}</ref> in [[London]].<ref name="bbc2002">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2124645.stm|title=Charles Saatchi: Artful adman|last=Jones|first=Chris |date=12 July 2002|work=BBC News|access-date=24 November 2009}}</ref> Nathan purchased two textile mills in north London and after a time re-built a thriving business.  Eventually the family would settle into a house with eight bedrooms on Hampstead Lane in [[Highgate]].{{sfn|Goldman|1997}}

Saatchi attended [[Tollington School|Tollington Grammar]] and graduated from the [[London School of Economics]] with a [[first class honours degree]] in Sociology in 1967.{{sfn|Goldman|1997}} His first job was at [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] where Maurice would form valuable relationships with [[Michael Heseltine]], the Group Managing Director and with staff at the Haymarket's leading trade weekly for the ad industry ''Campaign''.  He spent three years at Haymarket as Creative Director before leaving to join his brother Charles' fledgling ad agency.

== Career ==
===Saatchi and Saatchi===
In 1970, Saatchi, with his brother, formed the advertising agency [[Saatchi and Saatchi]].  They are credited with a number of successful advertising campaigns, most notably the "[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] isn't working" posters on behalf of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] for the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 British general election]] and advertisements for the [[cigarette]] brand [[Silk Cut]].<ref>[http://www.alastairmcintosh.com/images/silkcut.htm Silk Cut Cigarette Advertisements].</ref> Maurice Saatchi served as chairman of the firm which by 1986 – following its acquisition of advertising firm [[Ted Bates (advertising firm)|Ted Bates]] – had grown to be the largest ad agency in the world, with over 600 offices.<ref name="BBC profile">{{cite news

===M&C Saatchi===
At the turn of 1995, in the fallout from a shareholder revolt, Saatchi and his brother left the agency, and together founded the rival [[M&C Saatchi]] agency, taking with them many of their management and creative staff, as well as a number of clients – including [[British Airways]].<ref name="bbc2002"/><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=4 January 1996 |title=British Airways head praises Maurice Saatchi |newspaper=Reuters }}</ref> The new company has also been described as a success.<ref name="BBC profile"/>

In mid 2019 M&C Saatchi PLC - a public company listed on the AIM exchange - reported to the City some accounting irregularities which would cause the company to take a charge lowering its 2018 and 2019 results. <ref name ="Guardian 10Dec">[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/10/saatchi-isnt-working-ad-agency-crisis-deepens-as-directors-and-co-founder-quit Guardian Zoe Wood 10Dec19]</ref> By the time the matter was finalised in December 2019 following a [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] review, the accounting issues were quantified at £11.6M. <ref name="Guardian 10Dec" />. Over the course of 2019 the company's share price took a significant tumble from near £4 down to 79p.<ref name="FT 11Dec" /> Then in a shock announcement to the City on 10 December [[Baron Saatchi|Saatchi]] resigned as an executive director along with all three of the independent non-executive directors [[Michael Peat|Sir Michael Peat]], [[Michael Dobbs|Baron Dobbs]] and Lorna Tilbian. It was reported that the departing directors disagreed over whether David Kershaw, one of Saatchi's co-founders of the company should stay as CEO following the accounting scandal. <ref name ="FT 11Dec">[https://www.ft.com/content/cf043b6a-1b7f-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4 FT Alex Barker 11Dec19]</ref>

===Political career===
Maurice Saatchi was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Saatchi''', of [[Staplefield]] in the [[West Sussex|County of West Sussex]] on 4 October 1996.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54547 |date=9 October 1996 |page=13389}}</ref> He sits in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]. Under the leadership of [[Iain Duncan Smith]], Saatchi served as shadow Treasury spokesman in the Lords, forming a close relationship with [[Michael Howard]], who was [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Saatchi argued for the simplification of the tax system and that the poorest eight million people in the United Kingdom should not pay [[income tax]].<ref name="BBC profile"/> In June 2014, he suggested that small businesses should pay no corporate tax and that investors in said small businesses should pay no capital gains tax in order to "challenge cartel capitalism."<ref>Peter Dominiczak, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/10904385/Lord-Saatchi-Cut-corporation-tax-for-small-businesses.html Lord Saatchi: Cut corporation tax for small businesses], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', June 16, 2014</ref>

After Howard became leader of the Conservatives in November 2003, Saatchi was appointed joint chairman of the party with [[Liam Fox]]. He had responsibility for running the party campaign for the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], after which he stepped down.<ref>{{cite news

:* ''I DID NOT convince the Party that if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.''
:* ''I DID NOT dispel the illusion of research, which said that, as immigration was the number one issue in deciding how people vote, it should be the number one topic.''
:* ''I DID NOT prevent economics, the Conservatives' former ace of trumps, becoming a 'second order issue.'''
:* ''I DID NOT avoid the underestimation of public intelligence, as in the policy description 'Lower Taxes' when in fact taxes would be higher.''

He recommended that future Conservative leaders establish a "moral purpose" as an ideology and future direction for the Party.<ref>{{cite news

Following the death of his wife [[Josephine Hart]] to [[ovarian cancer]], Maurice Saatchi has campaigned for a change to the UK law which, he believes, holds doctors back from using innovative treatments because they fear litigation. His [[Medical Innovation Bill]] was formally introduced in 2013 and was co-adopted by the government in its passage through parliament.<ref name=appeal>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=Lord Saatchi's personal appeal |date=26 January 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10595475/Lord-Saatchis-personal-appeal.html |access-date=7 February 2015}}</ref> The bill has enjoyed some popular support and favourable press coverage, but has drawn a critical response from some medical and legal bodies, patient groups and charities.<ref name=ross>{{cite news |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |title=The 'Saatchi Bill': can a PR guru cure cancer? |author=Ross N |author-link=Nick Ross |date=2 June 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/saatchi-bill/10870505/The-Saatchi-Bill-can-a-PR-guru-cure-cancer.html |access-date=7 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=flap>{{cite news |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/nov/19/saatchi-bill-medical-innovation |title=Attacking critics is no way to fix the Saatchi bill |date=19 November 2014 |access-date=7 February 2015 |author=Hills D}}</ref>

===Other roles===
He is also chairman of the Finsbury Food Group plc, and is a governor of the [[London School of Economics]]. Saatchi is a trustee of the [[Museum of Garden History]], and also a director of the [[Centre for Policy Studies]].  He was also a trustee of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from 1988 to 1996.

Saatchi's first wife was Gillian Osband, a children's book editor and writer whom he had known since childhood and whom he married in 1972. They divorced in 1984 and that same year he married the novelist [[Josephine Hart]] (1942–2011), whom he first met when they worked together at [[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]] in 1967.<ref name="BBC profile"/> She died on 2 June 2011.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/8555567/Josephine-Hart.html Obituaries: Josephine Hart], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 3 June 2011</ref>

His country property is a mock Tudor castle called Old Hall in [[Staplefield]], [[West Sussex]], built in 1842. There are sixty acres of parkland and ten acres of flowers, trees and lakes. Maurice Saatchi has a fondness for gardening, laid out the garden on the estate and built a conservatory to house semi-tropical plants.
