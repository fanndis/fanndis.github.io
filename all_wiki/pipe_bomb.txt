A '''pipe bomb''' is an [[improvised explosive device]], which uses a tightly sealed section of [[pipe (material)|pipe]] filled with an [[explosive material]]. The containment provided by the pipe means that simple [[Explosive material#Low explosives|low explosives]] can be used to produce a relatively large explosion due to the containment causing increased pressure, and the fragmentation of the pipe itself creates potentially lethal [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]].

Premature detonation is a hazard of attempting to construct any homemade [[bomb]], and the materials and methods used with pipe bombs make unintentional detonation incidents common, usually resulting in serious injury or death to the assembler.

In many countries, the manufacture or possession of a pipe bomb is a serious [[crime]], regardless of its intended use.

==Design==
[[File:Pipe bomb 02.jpg|thumb|Different pipe bombs' appearances, from a bomb awareness report issued by the US Department of State]]
The bomb is usually a short section of steel water pipe containing the explosive mixture and closed at both ends with steel or brass caps. A fuse is inserted into the pipe with a lead running out through a hole in the side or capped end of the pipe. The fuse can be electric, with wires leading to a timer and battery, or can be a common [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]. All of the components are easily obtainable.

Generally, [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosives]] such as [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] are not used, because these and the [[detonator]]s that they require are difficult for non-state users to obtain. Such explosives also do not require the containment of a pipe bomb.

Instead, any sort of explosive mixture the builder can find or make is used. Some of the explosive mixtures used, such as [[gunpowder]], match heads, or chlorate mixtures, are very prone to ignition by the friction and static electricity generated when packing the material inside the tube or attaching the end caps, causing many injuries or deaths amongst builders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dias|last2=Dingeman|first1=Gary A.|first2=Robbie|title=Honolulu CSI: An Introduction to Forensic Science and Criminal Investigation|year=2004|publisher=Bess Press|isbn=978-1-57306-228-2|page=87}}</ref> Sharp objects such as nails or broken glass are sometimes added to the outer shell, or inside of, the bomb  to increase harm and damage.

==Operation==
Pipe bombs concentrate pressure and release it suddenly, through the failure of the outer casing. Plastic materials can be used, but metals typically have a much higher bursting strength and so will produce more concussive force. For example, common [[schedule 40]] {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} wrought steel pipe has a typical working pressure of {{convert|1010|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, and bursting pressure of {{convert|8090|psi|MPa|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wrought Steel Pipe - Bursting Pressures |title=The bursting pressures are based on Barlow's formula. The working pressures are based on factor 8.  Dimensions according ASME/ANSI B36.10/19. |url=https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wrought-steel-pipe-bursting-pressure-d_1123.html |website=www.engineeringtoolbox.com |language=en}}</ref> though the pipe sealing method can significantly reduce the burst pressure.

The pipe can rupture in different ways, depending on the rate of pressure rise and the [[ductility]] of the casing material.
*If the pressure rise is slow, the metal can deform until the walls become thin and a hole is formed, causing a loud report from the gas release, but no shrapnel.
*A rapid rate of pressure rise will cause the metal to shatter into fragments, which are pushed outward in all directions by the expanding gases.

==Modes of failure==
Pipe bombs can fail to explode if the gas pressure buildup is too slow, resulting in bleed-out through the detonator ignition hole. Insufficiently tight threading can also bleed gas pressure through the threads faster than the chemical reaction pressure can rise.

They can also fail if the pipe is fully sealed and the chemical reaction triggered, but the total pressure buildup from the chemicals is insufficient to exceed the casing strength; such a bomb is a [[dud]], but still potentially dangerous if handled, since an external shock could trigger rupture of the statically pressurized casing.

==Minimum evacuation distances==
If any type of bomb is suspected, typical recommendations are to keep all people at a minimum evacuation distance until authorized bomb disposal personnel arrive. For a pipe bomb, the US Department of Homeland Security recommends a minimum of {{convert|21|m|abbr=on}}, and preferred distance of {{convert|366|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dni.gov/files/NCTC/documents/features_documents/2006_calendar_bomb_stand_chart.pdf|title=Bomb Threat Stand-Off Distances|publisher=The National Counterterrorism Center}}</ref>

==Uses==
Pipe bombs are by nature improvised weapons and typically used by those without access to military devices such as [[grenade]]s. They were successfully used in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). During [[World War II]], members of the [[British Home Guard]] were trained to make and use them.<ref name="McCutcheon2012">{{cite book|author=Introduction by Campbell McCutcheon|title=Home Guard Manual 1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGGoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT77|date=30 September 2012|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=978-1-4456-1103-7|pages=77}}</ref>

In [[Northern Ireland]], there have been hundreds of pipe bomb attacks since the mid-1990s (towards the end of the "[[The Troubles|Troubles]]"). Most of the attacks have been launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] republicans opposed to the 1994 ceasefires, especially the anti-drugs [[vigilante]] group [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD). However, they have also been used by [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]] and by [[Red Hand Defenders]] (RHD) and [[Orange Volunteers]] (OV). They are also used extensively in the south of [[Ireland]] by feuding criminals, including drug dealers, mainly in the capital city of [[Dublin]].

As well as users such as criminals, paramilitaries, and militias, they also have a long tradition of recreational use for amusement or mischief with no intention to cause injury to anyone, but due to the dangers of premature ignition and of shrapnel, pipe bombs are much more dangerous than alternatives such as [[dry ice bomb]]s or [[spud gun]]s.
