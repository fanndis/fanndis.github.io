'''Thistle''' is the common name of a group of [[flowering plant]]s characterised by [[leaf|leaves]] with sharp prickles on the margins, mostly in the family [[Asteraceae]]. Prickles can also occur all over the plant – on the stem and on the flat parts of the leaves. These prickles are an [[adaptation]] that protects the plant from being eaten by [[herbivore]]s. Typically, an [[Involucral bract|involucre]] with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a thistle's flowerheads.

The comparative amount of spininess varies dramatically by species. For example, ''[[Cirsium heterophyllum]]'' has minimal spininess while ''[[Cirsium spinosissimum]]'' is the opposite.<ref>{{cite web | title=Melancholy Thistle | url= http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/en/kukkakasvit/melancholy-thistle |publisher=NatureGate | accessdate= 27 November 2019 }}</ref> Typically, species adapted to dry environments have greater spininess.

The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean precisely those plants in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Cardueae]] (synonym: Cynareae),<ref>{{cite web | title = Cardueae | work = Tree of Life webproject | url = http://tolweb.org/Cardueae/104543 | accessdate = 30 October 2012 }}</ref> especially the genera ''[[Carduus]]'', ''[[Cirsium]]'', and ''[[Onopordum]]''.<ref name="mw">{{cite news | work = Merriam-Webster's online dictionary | title = Thistle | url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=thistle | accessdate = 30 November 2007}}</ref> However, plants outside this tribe are sometimes called thistles, and when this is done, "thistles" would form a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group.

A thistle is the [[Floral emblem#United Kingdom|floral emblem]] of [[Scotland]] and [[Lorraine]], as well as the emblem of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

Biennial thistles are particularly noteworthy for their high wildlife value, producing such things as copious floral resources for pollinators, nourishing seeds for birds like the goldfinch, foliage for butterfly larvae, and down for the lining of birds' nests.<ref name="Hicks">{{cite journal|last1=Hicks|first1=DM|last2=Ouvrard|first2=P|last3=Baldock|first3=KCR|title=Food for Pollinators: Quantifying the Nectar and Pollen Resources of Urban Flower Meadows|journal=PLOS ONE |volume=11 |issue=6|pages=e0158117|date=2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0158117|pmid=27341588|pmc=4920406|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1158117H}}</ref><ref name="Xerces">{{cite web |url=https://xerces.org/native-thistle-guide/ |title=Native Thistles: A Conservation Practitioner's Guide |last1=Eckberg |first1=James |last2=Lee-Mäder |first2=Eric |last3=Hopwood |first3=Jennifer |last4=Foltz Jordan |first4=Sarah |last5=Borders |first5=Brianna |date=2017 |website=The Xerces Society |publisher=The Xerces Society |access-date=27 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="Pollinators">{{cite web|title=Which flowers are the best source of nectar? |publisher=Conservation Grade |url=http://www.conservationgrade.org/2014/10/which_flowers_best_source_nectar/ |accessdate=2017-10-18|date=2014-10-15}}</ref>

==Economic significance==
Thistles, even if one restricts the term to members of the Asteraceae, are too varied a group for generalisation; many are troublesome weeds, including some invasive species of ''Cirsium'', ''Carduus'', ''Silybum'' and ''Onopordum''.<ref name="Gupta">{{cite book |author=Rakesh Kumar Gupta |author2=Wim Reybroeck |author3=Johan W.

==Ecology==
[[File:Six-spot Burnet on a spiny plumeless thistle.jpg|thumb|[[Six-spot burnet]] moths on a thistle flowerhead]]

Thistle flowers are the favourite nectar sources of the [[pearl-bordered fritillary]], [[small pearl-bordered fritillary]], [[high brown fritillary]], and [[dark green fritillary]] butterflies.<ref>[http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/uploads/Bracken%20for%20Butterflies.pdf Bracken for Butterflies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003102036/http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/uploads/Bracken%20for%20Butterflies.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }} leaflet c0853 by [[Butterfly Conservation]], January 2005</ref>
Thistles (and thistle-seed feeders) also provide important sustenance for [[European goldfinch|goldfinch]]es and are strongly favored by many butterflies besides fritillaries such as the [[Danaus (butterfly)|monarch]], [[Skipper (butterfly)|skipper]]s, and the various types of [[tiger swallowtail]]. Additionally, hummingbirds will feed on the flowers of the biennial species (which feature large flowers, as compared with the perennial Canada thistle).

Some thistles (for example ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'', native to Eurasia), have been widely introduced outside their native range.<ref>[http://www.hear.org/Pier/species/Cirsium_vulgare.htm Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., Asteraceae ], Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER)</ref> Control measures include ''Trichosirocalus'' [[weevil]]s, but a problem with this approach, at least in North America, is that the introduced weevils may affect native thistles at least as much as the desired targets.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1603/022.038.0325 | title = Occurrence of ''Trichosirocalus horridus'' (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on Native ''Cirsium altissimum'' Versus Exotic ''C.

Thistles have been said to be very important nectar sources for pollinators. Some ecological organizations, such as the [[Xerces Society]], have attempted to raise awareness of their benefits, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly, ''[[Danaus plexippus]]'' for instance, was highlighted as traditionally relying upon taller large-flowered thistle species such as Tall thistle, ''[[Cirsium altissimum]]'', for its migration.<ref name="Xerces"/> Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, certain non-native thistles, such as ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'' in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies supply bulk seed for native North American thistle species, for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production. ''[[Cirsium vulgare]]'' ranked in the top 10 for nectar production in a [[UK]] plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative.<ref name="Pollinators"/> Bull thistle was also a top producer of nectar sugar in another study in Britain, ranked third with a production per floral unit of (2323 ± 418μg).<ref name="Hicks"/>

==Heraldry==
===Scottish thistle===
According to [[legend]], an invading [[Norsemen|Norse]] army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the 1263 [[Battle of Largs]], which marked the beginning of the departure of King [[Haakon IV]] (Haakon the Elder) of [[Norway]] who, having control of the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Hebrides]], had harried the coast of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] for some years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Webmaster |first=John Duncan |location=UK |url=http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/thistle/thistle.html |title=Scots History Online |publisher=Scots History Online |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

The thistle has been the national emblem of [[Scotland]] since the reign of [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] (1249–1286).{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} It is found in many [[Scottish symbols]] and was used on [[silver coin]]s issued by [[James III of Scotland|King James III]] in 1474, the first coins to feature a thistle.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry/Chapter_18|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/visit/exhibitions/exhibitionprogramme/scotlandsowncoinage/|title=University of Glasgow - The Hunterian - Visit - Exhibitions - Exhibition Programme - Scotland's Own Coinage|website=www.gla.ac.uk|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> In 1536, the [[bawbee]], a sixpence in the [[pound Scots]], was issued for the first time under [[James V of Scotland|King James V]]; it showed a crowned thistle. Thistles continued to appear regularly on Scottish and later British coinage until 2008, when a [[Five pence (British coin)|5p coin]] design showing "''The Badge of Scotland, a thistle royally crowned''" ceased to be minted, though it remains in circulation. [[The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle]], the highest and oldest [[chivalric order]] of Scotland, has thistles on its insignia and a chapel in [[St Giles' Cathedral|St Giles's Kirk]], Edinburgh, dubbed the [[St Giles' Cathedral#Thistle Chapel|Thistle Chapel]]. The thistle is the main charge of the regimental badge of the [[Scots Guards]], the oldest regiment in the [[British Army]]. 

Both the Order of the Thistle and the Scots Guards use the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'', the motto of the [[House of Stuart]] and referring to the thistle's prickly nature. [[Pound coins]] with this motto and a thistle were minted in 1984, 1989, and 2014. The combination of thistle and motto first appeared on the bawbee issued by King Charles II. In 1826 the [[grant of arms]] to the new [[National Bank of Scotland]] stipulates that the shield be surrounded by thistles and "thistle" is used as [[Thistle (disambiguation)#Football (soccer) clubs|the name]] of several [[football in Scotland|Scottish football]] clubs. Since 2013 a stylised thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, has been the emblem of [[Police Scotland]], and had long featured in the [[coat of arms|arms]] of seven of the eight pre-2013 Scottish police services and constabularies, the sole exception being the [[Northern Constabulary]]. As part of the arms of the [[University of Edinburgh]], the thistle appears together with a saltire on one of the escutcheons of the [[Mercat Cross, Edinburgh|Mercat Cross in Edinburgh]]. The coat of arms and crest of [[Nova Scotia]] - "''New Scotland''" - briefly Scotland's colony, has since the 17th century featured thistles.
Following his ascent to the English throne, [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland & I of England]] used a [[heraldic badge|badge]] consisting of a [[Tudor rose]] "[[dimidiation|dimidiated]]" with a Scottish thistle and surmounted by a royal crown.<ref>{{cite book|last= Fox-Davies |first= A.C. |year=1907 |title=Heraldic Badges|location=London |publisher=John Lane |url= https://archive.org/details/heraldicbadges00davgoog |oclc= 4897294  |via=Internet Archive|page=[https://archive.org/details/heraldicbadges00davgoog/page/n138 117]}}</ref> As the floral emblem of Scotland it appears in the [[Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] thereafter, and was included in the heraldry of various [[United Kingdom|British]] institutions, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] alongside the Tudor rose, Northern Irish [[flax]], and Welsh [[leek]]. This floral combination appears on the present issues of the one pound coin. Beside the Tudor rose and Irish [[shamrock]] the thistle appears on the badge of the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the arms of the [[Canada Company]]. Issues of the historical [[florin (British coin)|florin]] showed the same flora, later including a leek. The thistle is also used to symbolise connection with Scotland overseas. For example, in Canada, it is one of the four floral emblems on the [[flag of Montreal]]; in the US, [[Carnegie Mellon University]] features the thistle in its crest in honour of the Scottish heritage of its founder, [[Andrew Carnegie]], and [[Annapolis, Maryland]] features the thistle in its flag and seal. The thistle is also the emblem of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (''[[Onopordum acanthium]]''), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in medieval times; the spear thistle (''[[Cirsium vulgare]]''), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twocrows.co.uk/kaleidescopes/text-pages/thistle-text.html |title=Flowers of Scotland: Thistle |publisher=Twocrows.co.uk |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ormiston.com/ormiston/tartan/thistle.htm |title=Why is the THISTLE a Scottish national symbol? |publisher=Ormiston.com |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> Other species, including dwarf thistle (''[[Cirsium acaule]]''), musk thistle (''[[Carduus nutans]]''), and melancholy thistle (''[[Cirsium heterophyllum]]'') have also been suggested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/guide/scotland-factfile/scottish-icons/the-thistle |title=Scotland Fact File: The Thistle |publisher=Visitscotland.com |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref>

===Thistle of Lorraine===
[[File:Grandes Armes de Nancy.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], former capital of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]].]]
The thistle, and more precisely ''[[Onopordum acanthium]]'', is one of the symbols of [[Lorraine]], together with its coat of arms which displays three [[avalerion]]s, and the [[Cross of Lorraine]].

Lorraine is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with [[Luxembourg]] and [[Germany]]. Before the [[French Revolution]], a large part of the region formed the [[Duchy of Lorraine]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], the thistle was an emblem of the [[Virgin Mary]] because its white sap would bring to mind the milk falling from the breast of the Mother of God. It was later adopted as a personal symbol by [[René of Anjou]], together with the Cross of Lorraine, then known as the Cross of Anjou. It seems through his book ''Livre du cuer d'amours espris'' that the Duke chose the thistle as his emblem not only because it was a Christian symbol, but also because he associated it with physical love.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Nancy|author=Christian Pfister|volume=1|publisher=Berger-Levrault|year=1908|page=554}}</ref>

The thistle and the cross were used again by his grandson, [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]], who introduced them in the region. The  two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the [[Battle of Nancy]] in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated [[Burgundy]]. The Duke's motto was "''Qui s'y frotte s'y pique''", meaning "who touches it, pricks oneself", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto "''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]''". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol of the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], as well as the emblem of the [[AS Nancy]] football team, and the [[Lorraine Regional Natural Park]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mooc.tela-botanica.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=18810|title=Le chardon|publisher=Tela Botanica|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancy-webtv.fr/index.php/sommaire/622-origine-du-blason-de-nancy|title=Origine du blason de Nancy|publisher=Nancy WebTV|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>

==Place names==
''Carduus'' is the [[Latin language|Latin]] term for a thistle (hence [[cardoon]], ''chardon'' in French), and ''Cardonnacum'' is the Latin word for a place with thistles. This is believed to be the origin of name of the [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] village of [[Chardonnay, Saône-et-Loire]], which in turn is thought to be the home of the famous [[Chardonnay]] grape variety.
