'''Thilo Sarrazin''' (born 12 February 1945) is a German politician and former member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], writer, senator of finance for the [[Berlin|State of Berlin]] from January 2002 until April 2009, and former member of the Executive Board of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] until 2010.<ref>bundesbank.de: [http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/pressenotizen/2010/20100909.presseerklaerung.en.php Press release of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726001357/http://www.bundesbank.de/download/presse/pressenotizen/2010/20100909.presseerklaerung.en.php# |date=2011-07-26 }} 9 September 2010</ref><ref>http://bloomberg.com: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-09/bundesbank-says-sarrazin-will-resign-on-sept-30-after-jewish-gene-remark.html Bundesbank Says Sarrazin Will Resign on Sept. 30 After Jewish Gene Remark]</ref>

He became well known after publishing a controversial book about Muslim immigrants in Germany in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/massive-pressure-islam-critic-sarrazin-resigns-from-bundesbank-board-a-716709.html|title='Massive Pressure': Islam Critic Sarrazin Resigns from Bundesbank Board|date=10 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018|via=Spiegel Online}}</ref> In his book ''Deutschland schafft sich ab'' (''[[Germany Abolishes Itself]]''),<ref name="Spiegel on sales">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,726206,00.html|title=Sarrazin bricht Verkaufsrekord|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref> he denounces what he sees as the failure of Germany's post-war [[immigration policy]], sparking a nationwide controversy about the costs and benefits of [[multiculturalism]]. As a result, he is no longer a member of the SPD as of 31 July 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=tagesschau.de|title=Oberstes SPD-Gericht bestätigt Parteiausschluss Sarrazins|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/spd-sarrazin-ausschluss-105.html|access-date=2020-08-01|website=tagesschau.de|language=de}}</ref>

== Life ==

=== Early life and education ===
Sarrazin was born in [[Gera]], Germany. His father was a doctor and his mother was the daughter of a [[West Prussia]]n landowner. His paternal ancestors were French [[Huguenots]] who originated in [[Burgundy]], while his grandmother was English and another ancestor was Italian.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/article4801004/Thilo-Sarrazin-ist-ein-grosser-Integrationserfolg.html|work=[[Die Welt]]|title=Thilo Sarrazin ist ein großer Integrationserfolg|first=Tanit|last=Koch|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref> He has explained that his name means [[saracen]] (i.e. Muslim) and is common in [[Southern France]]: "It is derived from the Arab pirates that were called 'Saracens' in the Middle Ages". He has referred to himself as "a European mongrel".<ref name=weeks>{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/saracen-and-jews?page=2|title=The Saracen and the Jews|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]|first=John|last=Rosenthal|date=1 September 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref>

He grew up in [[Recklinghausen]] where he [[abitur|graduated]] from the local [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] after which he did his military service. From 1967 to 1971, he studied economics at the [[University of Bonn]], earning his doctorate. From November 1973 to December 1974 he worked for the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] and became active in the SPD.

===Career as civil servant===
In 1975 Sarrazin began working in the [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Finance]]. Until 1981 he served as a department head in the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs]] and from 1981 he returned to the Federal Ministry of Finance. From October 1981 he served as bureau chief and was a close collaborator of Federal Finance Minister [[Hans Matthöfer]] and his successor [[Manfred Lahnstein]]. Even after the end of the socialist-liberal [[Coalition government|coalition]] in October 1982, Sarrazin remained in the Finance Ministry, where he was director of several units, including (from 1989 to 1990) the "Innerdeutsche Beziehungen," which prepared the German monetary, economic and social union. During his time as Head of the Federal Ministry of Finance, he was partly responsible for [[Rail transport in Germany|German railways]].<ref name="spiegel-2007-9-24-74">Alexander Neubacher: "Der Weichen-Steller" in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' Nr. 39, 2007, pp. 74–76.</ref>

From 1990 to 1991 Sarrazin worked for the [[Treuhand]]. Up to 1997, he was [[State Secretary]] in the Ministry of Finance in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Subsequently, he was chief executive of TLG Immobilien (TLG).

=== Deutsche Bahn ===
Between spring 2000 and December 2001 he was employed by the [[Deutsche Bahn]], the German national railway. During his first four months he served as head of internal auditing; from 1 September 2000 he was on the board of [[DB Netz]], responsible for planning and investment.

Sarrazin is considered a key developer of the people's share model of the German railway, which provides for the issue of non-voting [[preferred stock]] to limit the influence of private [[investors]]. He claims to have made this proposal to thwart the model of capital [[privatization]] of Deutsche Bahn. He is regarded as an explicit supporter of orienting the Deutsche Bahn on the principles of [[efficiency]] under a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]. His relationship with the former CEO of Deutsche Bahn AG, [[Hartmut Mehdorn]], is characterized as hostile.

Sarrazin's dismissal from the board of DB Netz AG was followed by legal disputes. He drew his salary for a transitional period during which the details of the separation procedures were regulated. According to Hartmut Mehdorn, Sarrazin broke his contract with the company, which stated that secondary activities are not allowed. The employment contract was subsequently terminated without notice by the DB. Sarrazin sued, but the case was dismissed by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court]].

=== Finance Senator ===
Sarrazin was appointed Finance Senator to the [[Senate of Berlin]] in January 2002. He adhered to financial policy based on strict savings and a [[single-entry bookkeeping system]] for the management of local authorities.

As a result of his remarks on Berlin's social and educational reputation some consider Sarrazin being an [[agitator]]. His proposals for cutting social benefits were often accompanied by protests. In 2008 he made suggestions, such as that a beneficiary of [[Hartz concept|ALG II]] could eat for less than €4 per day. In 2009 he said of unemployed persons' management of energy: "First, Hartz IV receivers are more at home, second, they like it warm, and thirdly, many regulate the temperature with the window," in light of the fact that in Germany, the unemployed do not pay for rent and heating themselves. Sarrazin called pension increases "completely senseless action", but instead recommended that the government prepare older citizens for a "long term decline to the level of subsistence."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stern.de/panorama/thilo-sarrazin-kinder-kann-kriegen-wer-damit-fertig-wird-700617.html|title=Kinder kann kriegen, wer damit fertig wird|work=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]|first=Andreas|last=Hoffmann|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref>

In the political controversy surrounding the Berlin event center [[Tempodrom]] he was accused of having awarded state funds irregularly. The preliminary investigation was also against two other SPD-CDU politicians, three companies and two accountants. The investigating prosecutor filed an informal appeal against Sarrazin, but in December 2004 the Berlin district court rejected a trial because the prosecution was seen as ineffective.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/letzter-akt-in-der-tempodrom-affaere/1135838.html|title=Letzter Akt in der Tempodrom-Affäre|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=8 January 2010|first1=Kerstin|last1=Gehrke|first2=Matthias|last2=Oloew|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref>

In August 2009, Berlin's public [[prosecutor]] conducted an investigation of Sarrazin for [[embezzlement]]. According to the office of the prosecutor, he favored the [[Wannsee|Berlin-Wannsee]] [[Country club|Golf and Country Club]], leasing a [[golf course]] to them at a reduced rate.<ref name="bz-2008-06-09">{{Cite news|url=http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0829/seite3/0015/index.html|title=Ein Geruch von Vetternwirtschaft|work=[[Berliner Zeitung]]|date=29 August 2009|first=Sabine|last=Rennefanz|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915043559/http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0829/seite3/0015/index.html|archivedate=15 September 2010}}</ref> Sarrazin dismissed the accusations on the grounds that he saw no financial loss for the city.<ref>[http://www.focus.de/politik/schlagzeilen?day=20090829&did=1125089 ''Sarrazin wehrt sich gegen Untreue-Vorwürfe''].

=== Deutsche Bundesbank ===
On April 30, 2009, Sarrazin resigned from his position as senator as he was appointed to join the executive board of the [[Bundesbank]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,608014,00.html|title=Berliner Finanzsenator.

=== Party membership ===
The party leadership of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) announced in August 2010 that it would investigate whether to terminate Sarrazin's membership, because his theses could be understood as diametrically opposed to basic social-democratic values.<ref>[http://www.spd.de/aktuelles/News/666/parteiausschlussverfahren_gegen_thilo_sarrazin.html SPD Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725100108/http://www.spd.de/aktuelles/News/666/parteiausschlussverfahren_gegen_thilo_sarrazin.html# |date=2011-07-25 }} Secretary-General [[Sigmar Gabriel]]'s announcement of the expulsion proceedings</ref>
An [[Arbitration|arbitration committee]], meeting in Berlin on 21 April 2011, decided that Sarrazin could remain a member of the party. The formal accusation that he had damaged the party with his theories could not be upheld, in particular because Sarrazin read a statement in which he said he had never intended to depart from social democratic values and that he had never intended to suggest that [[social Darwinist|social-Darwinist]] theories should be implemented in political practice.<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110422-34563.html "Sarrazin remains SPD member"], ''The Local – Germany's News in English'', 22 April 2011</ref> This in turn led to dissatisfaction among many SPD party leaders.<ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20110426-34617.html "Sarrazin pardon sparks fierce SPD backlash"], ''The Local – Germany's News in English'', 26 April 2011</ref>
The SPD opened a third proceeding in order to revoke Sarrazin's membership after he published his book "Hostile takeover – how Islam impairs progress and threatens society". The arbitration committee of the concerned SPD district chapter, Berlin Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, accepted the motion of the SPD leadership. Sarrazin and his lawyers stated that they did not accept and sought to appeal the decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article196690923/Thilo-Sarrazin-SPD-darf-den-Berliner-Ex-Finanzsenator-rauswerfen.html |title=Thilo Sarrazin kündigt Berufung "durch alle Instanzen" an |author=DPA |date=July 11, 2019 |website=[[Die Welt]] |language=German |access-date=July 11, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==

== Views ==
=== Immigration, Islam and social welfare ===
[[File:Thilo Sarrazin - Deutschland schafft sich ab. Cover.svg|thumb|upright|Book cover]]

Sarrazin advocates a restrictive immigration policy with the exception of the highly skilled and the reduction of state welfare benefits. In September 2009, his views on economic and immigration policy in Berlin were published in ''[[Lettre International]]'', a German cultural [[quarterly]], and caused severe reactions. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In it he described many Arab and Turkish immigrants as unwilling to integrate. He said, among other things:

{{quote|Integration requires effort from those that are to be integrated. I will not show respect for anyone who is not making that effort. I do not have to acknowledge anyone who lives by welfare, denies the legitimacy of the very state that provides that welfare, refuses to care for the education of his children and constantly produces new little headscarf-girls. This holds true for 70 percent of the Turkish and 90 percent of the Arab population in Berlin.<ref name="ZeitOnline2009-10-01">{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2009-10/sarrazin-aeusserung-integration?page=all|title=Sarrazin muss sich entschuldigen|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref><ref name="ZeitOnline2009-10-03">{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2009-10/sarrazin-forderung-ruecktritt-bundesbank|title=Bundesbank-Präsident legt Sarrazin Rücktritt nahe|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=3 October 2009|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref><ref name=bloom>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-31/weber-to-debate-next-sarrazin-move-as-merkel-slams-unacceptable-remarks.html|title=Weber to Debate Next Sarrazin Steps as Merkel Condemns Comments|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=1 September 2010|first1= Jana|last1=Randow|first2=Christian|last2=Vits|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref>}}

End of August 2010, Sarrazin's book ''Deutschland schafft sich ab'' (''[[Germany Abolishes Itself]]'') was published, and within two months, it became the best-selling book on politics by a German-language author in a decade, with overall sales hitting 1.1 million copies<ref name="Spiegel on sales"/> and the first editions sold out within a matter of hours or days. In the 13th edition Sarrazin added a foreword commenting on the nationwide debate his book has sparked.<ref>''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'': [https://www.welt.de/print/wams/politik/article10919793/Sarrazin-distanziert-sich-von-Sarrazin.html "Sarrazin distanziert sich von Sarrazin"] {{in lang|de}}</ref> As of May 2011, 1.5 million copies had been sold.<ref>''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'': [http://www.focus.de/magazin/debatte/focus-leserdebatte-schadet-sich-die-spd-mit-ihrem-sarrazin-kurs_aid_623031.html "Schadet sich die SPD mit ihrem Sarrazin-Kurs?"] {{in lang|de}}</ref>
In 2010, he was quoted as writing regarding Islam, "No other religion in Europe makes so many demands. No immigrant group other than Muslims is so strongly connected with claims on the welfare state and crime. No group emphasizes their differences so strongly in public, especially through women's clothing. In no other religion is the transition to violence, dictatorship and terrorism so fluid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2010/08/26/thilo-sarrazin/spd-politiker-schreibt-in-seinem-neuen-buch-ueber-den-islam.html|title=Thilo Sarrazin Schreibt über den Islam: "Bei keiner anderen Religion ist der Übergang zu Gewalt und Terrorismus so fließend"|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>

In 2010, Sarrazin's book came under criticism for claiming that Germany's immigrant Muslim population is reluctant to integrate and tends to rely more on social services than to be productive. Moreover, he calculated that their population growth may well overwhelm the German population within a couple of generations at the current rate, and that their intelligence was lower. He proposed stringent reforms for the welfare system to rectify the problems.<ref name="spiegel">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,714567,00.html|title=Immigration Provocateur in Germany Crosses the Line|date=30 August 2010|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/0,1518,714082,00.html|title=Was tun?|journal=[[Der Spiegel]]|volume=34|issue=23 August 2010|language=German}}</ref> The first edition of his book sold out within a few days.

===Genetics===
In 2010, an uproar was caused at an interview with ''[[Welt am Sonntag]]'' in which he claimed that "all Jews share a certain gene like all Basques share a certain gene that distinguishes these from other people."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/political-bookworm/2010/08/german_politicians_new_book_ab.html |title=German Politician Stirs Controversy with His Inflammatory Views on Muslims and Jews |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Stephen|last=Lowman|date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article9255898/Moegen-Sie-keine-Tuerken-Herr-Sarrazin.html |title=Mögen Sie keine Türken, Herr Sarrazin?|first1=A.|last1=Seibel|first2=H.|last2=Schuhmacher|first3=J.|last3=Fahrun|language=German|newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=5 September 2010 |quote={{lang|de|Alle Juden teilen ein bestimmtes Gen, Basken haben bestimmte Gene, die sie von anderen unterscheiden.}} }}</ref> He subsequently offered his regrets for the irritation caused,<ref name=bloom/> and explained his source, for instance, in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'',<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/s/Rub9B4326FE2669456BAC0CF17E0C7E9105/Doc~ECC46C81351DA40E7B3219E328A122494~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html |title=Phantasma "Juden-Gen"|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=1 September 2010|first=Joachim|last=Müller-Jung|accessdate=5 September 2010|language=German}}</ref> referring to international media reports,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/science/10jews.html|title=Studies Show Jews' Genetic Similarity|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 June 2010|first=Nicholas|last=Wade|authorlink=Nicholas Wade|accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> on a 2010 [[Genetic studies on Jews|study]] by Gil Atzmon ''et al.'' that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]''.<ref name="Atzmon">{{Cite journal|first=G.|last=Atzmon|first2=L.|last2=Hao|first3=I.|last3=Pe'er|first4=C.|last4=Velez|first5=A.|last5=Pearlman|first6=P.

In 2018, Sarrazin's statements were criticized by the chairman of the Interior Committee of the German [[Bundestag]], [[Sebastian Edathy]] (SPD), the [[Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft| United Services trade union]] and the political scientist Gerd Wiegel. The [[Central Council of Jews in Germany]] strongly criticized Sarrazin, condemning him as racist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/weitere-meldungen/spd-zentralrat-der-juden-legt-sarrazin-nahe-in-npd-zu-wechseln_aid_545220.html|title=Zentralrat der Juden legt Sarrazin nahe, in NPD zu wechseln|first=FOCUS|last=Online|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/zentralrat-der-juden-sarrazin-erweist-hitler-grosse-ehre-1.28798|title="Sarrazin erweist Hitler große Ehre"|date=15 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}</ref><ref>http://www.zentralratdjuden.de/de/article/2686.html</ref> Sigmar Gabriel, the General Secretary of the SPD, condemned Sarrazin for his eugenic approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/2010/38/SPD-Sigmar-Gabriel|title=Gabriel über Sarrazin: Welch hoffnungsloses Menschenbild!|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>

A ''[[Berliner Morgenpost]]'' poll suggested that almost half of the German population agree with Sarrazin's political views and 18 percent would vote for his party if he started one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/titelseite/article1390251/18-Prozent-der-Deutschen-wuerden-Sarrazin-waehlen.html|title=18 Prozent der Deutschen würden Sarrazin wählen|first=Berliner Morgenpost -|last=Berlin|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref> In a survey conducted for the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' newspaper among 10,000 Sarrazin readers, an overwhelming majority was shown to be male, middle-class, middle-aged to elderly, conservatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/from-financier-to-flagbearer-for-germanys-farright-2228550.html|title=From financier to flag-bearer for Germany's far-right|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>

The German-Turkish sociologist and best-selling author [[Necla Kelek]], who has defended Sarrazin, introduced him at a Berlin press conference in August 2010 attended by roughly 300 journalists. While Turkish and Islamic organizations have accused Sarrazin of [[racism]] and damaging Germany's reputation abroad, Kelek said Sarrazin addressed "bitter truths" in his book and the [[chattering classes]] judged it without reading it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11170314|title=Sarrazin supporter defends banker's Muslim comments|date=2 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

[[Henryk Broder]], the ''Spiegel'' commentator, offered an explanation for attacks on Sarrazin's statements. "And there's a second trick that's being used now: he's being accused of anti-Semitism. If you could accuse him of anything, it's [[philo-Semitism]], because he wrongly thinks Jews are more intelligent than others," Broder said. He added, "But of course, with an anti-Semitism accusation you can really go after someone, because anti-Semitism of course is no longer acceptable in Germany, and rightly so. There is no substantive debate here at all – the issue is that a nation gets up, as it were, they all agree and they take it all out on a scapegoat who they'd like to send into the desert. It's very disturbing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/video/debatte-um-thilo-sarrazin-henryk-m-broder-im-gespraech-mit-spiegel-tv-video-1082930.html|title=Debatte um Thilo Sarrazin: Henryk M.

"Political correctness is silencing an important debate" said {{ill|Matthias Matussek|de}} of ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine. "Sarrazin's findings on the failed integration of Turkish and Arab immigrants are beyond any doubt. He has been forced out of the Bundesbank. The SPD wanted to expel him from the party, too. Invitations previously extended to Sarrazin are being withdrawn. The culture page editors at the German weekly ''[[Die Zeit]]'' are crying foul and the editors at the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' are damning Sarrazin for passages he didn't even write. But what all these technicians of exclusion fail to see is that you cannot cast away the very thing that Sarrazin embodies: the anger of people who are sick and tired—after putting a long and arduous process of Enlightenment behind them—of being confronted with pre-Enlightenment elements that are returning to the center of our society. They are sick of being cursed or laughed at when they offer assistance with integration. And they are tired of reading about Islamist associations that have one degree of separation from terrorism, of honor killings, of death threats against cartoonists and filmmakers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/sarrazin-s-truths-political-correctness-is-silencing-an-important-debate-a-716648.html|title=Sarrazin's Truths: Political Correctness Is Silencing an Important Debate|first=A.

[[Klaus von Dohnányi]], who offered to defend Sarrazin as the SPD sought to expel him, told the ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' newspaper how Germany was overshadowed by its Holocaust history and how a culture had developed whereby anyone saying the words "gene" or "Jew" is automatically considered suspect. He complains that we shy away from debates that "are commonplace in other countries." Among those is the discussion that "specific ethnic groups" share specific characteristics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/debatte-um-thilo-sarrazin-feigheit-vor-dem-wort-1.996129|title=Feigheit vor dem Wort|first=Ein Gastbeitrag von Klaus von|last=Dohnanyi|date=15 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2018|via=Sueddeutsche.de}}</ref>

== The new terror of virtue ==
The publication of his book "Deutschland schafft sich ab" provoked accusations that Sarrazin allegedly was stoking racism and [[xenophobia]].<ref name="loalc">{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.de/20100830/29483 |title=Sarrazin: Muslims not compatible with Germany |date=2010-08-10 |work=The Local de |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> This harsh criticism inspired Sarrazin to write "Der neue Tugendterror -  Über die Grenzen der Meinungsfreiheit in Deutschland" (The new terror of virtue - on the limits of freedom of opinion in Germany) on the topics of the mechanics of [[political correctness]], [[prejudice]] and the political climate in Germany, as he explains in the second chapter of this book, titled "Wie ich mit der Meinungsherrschaft in Konflikt kam: Eine Fallstudie" ("How I got into conflict with the rule of opinion: a case study"). "I had expected a controversial discussion. But nothing had prepared me for the public storm that broke loose upon publication.
