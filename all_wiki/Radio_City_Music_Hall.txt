'''Radio City Music Hall''' is an entertainment venue at 1260 [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]], within [[Rockefeller Center]], in [[Midtown Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company. Radio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style.

Radio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House, although plans for the opera house were canceled in 1929. It opened on December 27, 1932, as part of the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]]. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of two venues built for Rockefeller Center's "Radio City" section, the other being [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]]. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.

One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].

===Planning===
The [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940.{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html|title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit|date=March 8, 1932|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 15, 2017|page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf|title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys|date=October 16, 1940|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=November 21, 2017}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

[[Samuel Roxy Rothafel]], a successful theater operator who was renowned for his domination of the city's movie theater industry,{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=203}} joined the center's advisory board in 1930.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=91}}{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=213}}{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=64}} He offered to build two theaters: a large vaudeville "International Music Hall" on the northernmost block with more than 6,200 seats, and the smaller 3,500-seat "RKO Roxy" movie theater on the southernmost block.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=213}}{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=65}} The idea for these theaters was inspired by Roxy's failed expansion of the 5,920-seat [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] on 50th Street, one and a half blocks away.{{sfn|Adams|1985|p=46}}{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=92}}<ref name="NYSun-Roxy-New-Mood-1932">{{cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252018%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201932%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201932%2520-%25206106.pdf|title=Roxy Presents New Mood|last=Gilligan|first=Edmund|date=November 29, 1932|work=The New York Sun|access-date=November 11, 2017|page=20|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}</ref> Roxy also envisioned an elevated promenade between the two theaters,<ref>{{cite news|last=Brock|first=H.I.|title=Problems Confronting the Designers of Radio City|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=April 5, 1931|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/04/05/102224374.pdf|access-date=November 28, 2017}}</ref> but this was never published in any of the official blueprints.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=213}}

In September 1931, a group of NBC managers and architects went to tour Europe to find performers and look at theater designs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Radio City Leaders Plan Foreign Tour|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=September 11, 1931|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/09/11/118233762.pdf|access-date=November 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Balfour|1978|p=93}}; {{harvnb|Krinsky|1978|p=65}};{{harvnb|Okrent|2003|p=214}}; {{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=5}}.</ref> However, the group did not find any significant architectural details that they could use in the Radio City theaters.{{sfn|Krinsky|1978|p=66}}  In any case, Roxy's friend [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark
]] turned out to have much more innovative designs for the proposed theaters than the Europeans did.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}}

Roxy had a list of design requests for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217–218}} First, he did not want the hall to have either a large balcony over the [[Box (theatre)|box seating]], or rows of box seating facing each other, as implemented in opera houses. This resulted in a "tiered" balcony system where several shallow balconies were built at the back of the theater, cantilevered off the back wall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Second, Roxy specified that the stage contain a central section with three parts, so that the [[Set construction|sets]] could be changed easily.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=5}} Roxy also wanted red seats because he believed it would make the theater successful.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} He wished for an auditorium with an oval shape because contemporary wisdom held that oval-shaped auditoriums had better acoustic qualities.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}} Finally, he wanted to build at least 6,201 seats in the Music Hall so it would be larger than the Roxy Theatre. There were only 5,960 audience seats, but Roxy counted exactly 6,201 seats by including elevator stools, [[orchestra pit]] seats, and dressing-room chairs.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=217–218}}

Despite Roxy's specific requests for design features, the Music Hall's general design was determined by the Associated Architects, the architectural consortium that was designing the rest of Rockefeller Center.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=5}} The Radio City Music Hall was designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]]{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=7}} and interior designer [[Donald Deskey]]{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=10}} in the [[Art Deco]] style.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=1}} Stone used [[Indiana Limestone]] for the facade, as with all the other buildings in Rockefeller Center, but he also included some distinguishing features. Three {{convert|90|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} signs with the hall's name on it were placed on the facade, while intricately ornamented [[fire escape]]s were installed on the walls facing 50th and 51st Streets. Inside, Stone designed {{convert|165|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Grand Foyer with a large staircase, balconies, and mirrors, and commissioned [[Ezra Winter]] for the grand foyer's {{convert|2400|ft2|m2|adj=on}} mural, "Quest for the Fountain of Eternal Youth".{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}} Deskey, meanwhile, was selected as part of a competition for interior designers for the Music Hall.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=220}} He had reportedly called Winter's painting "God-awful" and regarded the interior and exterior as not much better.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=218}} To make the Music Hall presentable in his opinion, Deskey designed upholstery and furniture that was custom to the Hall. Deskey's plan was regarded the best of 35 submissions, and he ultimately used the [[rococo]] style in his interior design.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=220–221}}

The International Music Hall later became the Radio City Music Hall.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA252|page=252|title=World's Largest Theater in Rockefeller Center Will Seat Six Thousand|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=August 1932|access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref> The names "Radio City" and "Radio City Music Hall" derive from one of the complex's first tenants, [[RCA|the Radio Corporation of America (RCA)]], which planned a [[mass media]] complex called Radio City on the west side of Rockefeller Center.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/06/14/96156413.pdf|title=Rockefeller Plans Huge Culture Centre; 4 Theatres in $350,000,000 5th Av.

===Construction, opening, and early years===

The Music Hall opened to the public on December 27, 1932, with a lavish stage show featuring numbers including [[Ray Bolger]], [[Doc Rockwell]] and [[Martha Graham]].{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=94}}{{sfn|Okrent|2003|pp=239–243}} The opening was meant to be a return to high-class variety entertainment.<ref name="DailyArgus-Music-Hall-1932">{{Cite news|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252018%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201931%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201931%2520-%25200398.pdf|title=Mount Vernon Shares Glory at Opening of Radio City Music Hall in New York|date=December 28, 1932|work=Daily Argus|location=[[Mount Vernon, New York]]|access-date=November 10, 2017|page=16|via=[[Fultonhistory.com]]}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes-Music-Hall-1932">{{cite news|title=Music Hall Marks New Era In Design; Many Traditions in Building of Theatres Cast Aside for Modern Devices|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=December 28, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/28/105940014.pdf|access-date=November 12, 2017}}</ref> However, the opening was not a success: the program was very long, spanning from 8&nbsp;p.m. to 2&nbsp;a.m. of the next day, and a multitude of acts were crammed onto the world's largest stage, ensuring that individual acts were lost in the cavernous hall.

On January 11, 1933, after incurring a net operating loss of $180,000, the Music Hall converted to the then-familiar format of a feature film, with a spectacular stage show that Roxy had perfected.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=19}}{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=95}} The first film shown on the giant screen was Frank Capra's ''[[The Bitter Tea of General Yen]]'',{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=19}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01EEDC1E3BEF3ABC4A52DFB7668388629EDE|title=Radio City Music Hall Shows a Melodrama of China as Its First Pictorial Attraction|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|date=January 12, 1933|website=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|language=en|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref> and the Music Hall became the premiere showcase for films from the [[RKO|RKO-Radio Studio]], with ''[[Topaze (1933 American film)|Topaze]]'' the first RKO film to play there.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpictureher114unse#page/n288/mode/1up|title=More than 8,000,000 Attended Radio City Houses in First Year|work=[[Motion Picture Herald]]|date=January 20, 1934|page=27|access-date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> The film-plus-stage-spectacle format continued at the Music Hall until April 25, 1979, with four complete performances presented every day;<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/radio-city-music-hall-opens|title=This Day in History: Radio City Music Hall opens|website=History.com|language=en|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref> the final film the Music Hall presented under this format was ''[[The Promise (1979 film)|The Promise]]'' (1979).<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio City Music Hall in New York, NY|website=Cinema Treasures|date=September 23, 2014|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/55|access-date=November 7, 2019}}</ref> Some of the films that premiered at Radio City Music Hall included ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|''Breakfast at Tiffany's'']] (1961), [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|''To Kill a Mockingbird'']] (1962), [[Mary Poppins (film)|''Mary Poppins'']] (1964), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994).<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/nyregion/new-york-today-radio-city-music-hall-history.html|title=New York Today: The Many Lives of Radio City Music Hall|last=Wang|first=Vivian|date=January 5, 2018|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref> In total, over 650 movies are said to have premiered at the Music Hall.<ref name=":7">{{cite news|title=Radio City hits half-century|last=O'Haire|first=Patricia|date=March 26, 1982|work=New York Daily News|pages=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26588481/ 104], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26588492/ 106], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/26588506/ 112]|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref> The hall was also used for other purposes; for instance, it was used to host [[Easter]] worship services starting in 1940,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/04/10/archives/thousands-attend-services-at-dawn-largest-of-citys-crowds-is.html|title=Thousands Attend Services At Dawn; Largest of City's Crowds Is Gathering of 8,000 in Radio City Music Hall|date=April 10, 1944|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref> as well as benefit parties for Big Brothers Inc. from 1953<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/11/19/archives/movie-show-dec-17-for-big-brothers-women-active-in-organization.html|title=Movie Show Dec. 17 For Big Brothers; Women Active in Organization Take Over Block of Seats at Music Hall for Benefit|date=November 19, 1953|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref> to at least 1959.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/11/01/archives/big-brothers-inc-plans-a-benefit-at-music-hall-proceeds-of-film-dec.html|title=Big Brothers, Inc., Plans a Benefit At Music Hall; Proceeds of Film Dec. 10 and 11 Will Assist Work for Needy Boys|date=November 1, 1959|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 15, 2018}}</ref>

Its exterior is notable for a long [[Marquee (sign)|marquee sign]] that wraps around the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, as well as narrower, seven-story-high signs on the north and south ends of the marquee's Sixth Avenue side; both signs display the hall's name in neon letters.{{sfn|Adams|1985|pp=53–54}} The main entrance to the Music Hall was placed at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street, underneath the marquee.

An entrance to the [[New York City Subway]]'s [[47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center]] station, served by the {{NYCS trains|Sixth}}, is located on Sixth Avenue directly adjacent to the north end of the marquee, within the same structure that houses Radio City Music Hall.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}}

The interior contains a "majestic" grand foyer, the large and lavishly decorated main auditorium, and a series of stairs and elevators that lead to levels of mezzanines.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=97}}{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|pp=12–13}} Designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]],{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=7}} the interior of the theater with its austere [[Art Deco]] lines represented a break with the traditional ornate [[rococo]] ornament associated with movie palaces at the time.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=10}} [[Donald Deskey]] coordinated the interior design process, as well as designed some of the wallpaper, furniture, and other decor in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=10}} Deskey's geometric Art Deco designs incorporate glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather in the ornament for the theater's wall coverings, carpet, light fixtures, and furniture.<ref name=Trove/> All of the Music Hall's staircases were fitted with brass railings, an aspect of the Art Deco style.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=11}}

Deskey commissioned textile designers [[Marguerita Mergentime]] and [[Ruth Reeves]] to create carpet designs and designs for the fabrics covering the walls.<ref name="Trove">{{cite web|title=The art of Rockefeller Center / Christine Roussel. – Version details|website=Trove|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/40174385|access-date=January 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932"/> Reeves designed a carpet that contained musical motifs in "shades of red, brown, gold, and black",{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=11}} but her design was replaced in 1999.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=17}} Mergentime also produced geometric designs of nature and musicians for the walls and carpets, which still exist.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}} Deskey also created his own carpet design consisting of "singing head" depictions, which still exists.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=24}} [[Rene Chambellan]] produced six "playful" bronze plaques of vaudeville characters, which are located in the lobby just above the entrances to the theater.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=14}} [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]] designed all of the Music Hall's ceramic fixtures, especially the lighting bases.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=14}}

====Lobbies and grand foyer====
[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3713739901 4b1a1131a1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Grand Foyer]]

The entrance to the Music Hall is at its southwestern corner, where there are adjacent ticket and advance sales lobbies. Both lobbies contain terrazzo floors and marble walls. The ticket lobby, accessible from Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets, is the larger of the two lobbies. There are four brass ticket booths: one each embedded into the northern and southern walls, and two in the middle, facing the booths in the walls. Large black pillars support a low, slightly [[coffer]]ed ceiling.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}} Circular light fixtures are set into the ceiling of the ticket lobby, within each of the slight indentations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=16}}  The advance sales lobby, accessible from 50th Street just east of Sixth Avenue, contains a single ticket booth on the eastern wall.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}}

To the ticket lobby's east, and the advance sales lobby's northeast, is the elliptical grand foyer, whose four-story-high ceiling and dramatic artwork contrast with the compactness of the lobby.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=11}} Two long, tubular chandeliers created by [[Edward F. Caldwell & Co.]] hang from the ceiling.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=11}}{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=18}} The northern side of the grand foyer contains Ezra Winter's mural, and a grand staircase leading up to the first-mezzanine foyer runs along the northern wall next to Winter's mural.<ref name="NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932"/>{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|pp=11, 15}} Another set of stairs below the grand staircase descends from the northern side of the foyer to the main lounge one level below.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} A smaller staircase to the first-mezzanine lounge runs along the southern wall, connecting to a curved extension of that level's balcony.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=15}} The southern and northern sides of the grand foyer, respectively leading to 50th and 51st Streets, contain shallow vestibules with red marble walls. The northern vestibule is used as the exit lobby, while the southern vestibule is an emergency exit.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}} The grand foyer's eastern wall contains openings from the first, second, and third mezzanine levels, and the western wall contains {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} mirrors within gold frames.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=11}} Eleven doors leading to the Music Hall's auditorium are also located on the grand foyer's eastern side.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} Chambellan commissioned several plaques on the auditorium doors' exteriors, which resemble the vaudeville representations in the lobby and depict the types of performances in the Music Hall.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=23}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}}

The Music Hall includes four elevators that serve the main lounge level through the third mezzanine level. At ground level, a marble lobby for these elevators is located to the west of the northern exit vestibule.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}} Chambellan also designed the elevator doors with reliefs of musicians in atypical representations.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}} The maple circular roundels inside the cabs were designed by [[Edward Trumbull]], and represent wine, women, and song.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=51}}{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=12}}

====Auditorium====
[[File:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of stage and orchestra seating from mezzanine seating]]
The auditorium itself is very large and striking. Architectural critic [[Douglas Haskell]] describes it thus: "The focus is the great proscenium arch, over {{convert|60|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} feet wide, a huge semi-circular void. From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights."{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that "nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and "finest precision dancers", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}

The auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}}

The auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the "northern lights" Haskell described.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}}

The Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27|title=Secrets of the Magic Theater|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=27|date=January 1941|access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a "bandwagon" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=19}}

There is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}}

====Mezzanines====
[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]
The Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: "Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home."<ref name="NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932">{{cite news|title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale|first=Walter Rendell|last=Storey|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=December 25, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf|access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>

====Main lounge====
The main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black "permatex", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|pp=13–14}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=14}}

The landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|pp=14–15}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s "History of Cosmetics Mural", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=15}}

====Offstage====
[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]
The [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site. The offstage rooms include a [[carpenter (theatre)|carpenter]]'s studio, a [[scene shop]], sewing rooms, dressing rooms for 600 people, a [[green room]] for performers' guests, and a dormitory.{{sfn|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1978|p=9}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio City Music Hall To Be Opened Dec. 27; Brilliant Program Is Planned for Premiere – Theatre to Have Dormitory for the Chorus.|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|date=November 18, 1932|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/11/18/105886921.pdf|access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref>

The elevator system was designed by Peter Clark and built by Otis Elevators. The [[stage lift|elevator]] system was so advanced that the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] incorporated identical hydraulics in constructing [[World War II]] aircraft carriers; according to Radio City lore, during the war, government agents guarded the basement to hide the U.S. Navy's technological advantage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boland Jr.|first=Ed|title=F.Y.I.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/18/nyregion/fyi-414514.html|work=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=March 18, 2012|date=August 18, 2002}}</ref>
