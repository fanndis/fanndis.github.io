[[File:2004-09-14 1680x3000 chicago boeing building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boeing International Headquarters|Boeing's headquarters]]]]

The Fulton River District makes up the north east area of the Near West Side, on the Chicago River just west of the Loop. The related [[Fulton Market District|Fulton Market]] area extends west of the [[Kennedy Expressway]] as far as [[Union Park (Chicago)|Union Park]].

The Fulton River District is the home of [[Boeing]], and the [[Ogilvie Transportation Center]] (formerly Chicago & North Western Station), a major commuter rail terminal. The neighborhood is known for the aroma of [[chocolate]] emanating from the [[Blommer Chocolate Company]].

==== Greektown ====
{{Main|Greektown, Chicago}}
Greektown is a restaurant and nightlife corridor along [[Halsted Street]] between Van Buren and [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Streets]]. In the late 19th century Greek immigrants settled the area and competed with nearby Italians for business and jobs.<ref name="UIC">{{cite web|title=Greeks: Halsted Street |work=Maxwell and Halsted |url=https://maxwellhalsted.uic.edu/home/alien-colonies/greek-americans-halsted-st/ |access-date=October 19, 2019 |publisher=University of Illinois, Chicago}}</ref>

It was popularized in the movie ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'', which was actually filmed mostly in [[Toronto]].

=== Little Italy ===
{{Main|Little Italy, Chicago}}

The neighborhood between the Illinois Medical District and UIC's east campus is known as Little Italy. An Italian community developed in the late nineteenth century. For a late 19th early 20th century history of the Taylor Street area see https://maxwellhalsted.uic.edu/home/alien-colonies/italian-american-taylor-st/  ["Alien" Colonies: "In the Vicinity of Maxwell and Halsted Streets: Chicago 1890-1930, a Human Documentary"]

Italians never actually constituted a majority in the polyglot area,<ref name="encyclopediaofchicagolittleitaly">{{cite web|title=Little Italy|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/758.html}}</ref> but the neighborhood is still home to several Italian-American landmarks, such as the Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei and the [[National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame]], as well as Italian-American [[social club]]s. Taylor Street is home to the Italian restaurants Rosebud, Francesca's, Pompei and Al's No. 1 Italian Beef. There are other schools in this neighborhood. For example, Village Leadership Academy (VLA).

Part of the Italian-American population of the neighborhood was displaced in the 1960s and 70s by the construction of UIC's east campus.<ref name=explorechicago>{{cite web|title=Littly Italy, UIC|url=http://explorechicago.org/city/en/neighborhoods/little_italy.html|work=Explore Chicago|publisher=City of Chicago|access-date=12 January 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221050931/http://explorechicago.org/city/en/neighborhoods/little_italy.html|archive-date=21 December 2012}}</ref> The university is the source of the newer name for the area.

The 1980 novel ''[[Paper Fish]]'' by [[Tina De Rosa]] takes place in this community.<ref name=Candeloropethnic231>Candeloro, Dominic. "Chicago's Italians: A Survey of the Ethnic Factor, 1850–1990."

=== University Village/Maxwell Street ===
{{Main|Maxwell Street}}
Located five minutes from the Loop, University Village is a vibrant neighborhood consisting of residential and retail properties. University Village, along with other major developments such as University Commons and University Station is conveniently located near the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) campus, the medical district, Chicago's fabled Maxwell Street, and downtown Chicago.

The blocks around the intersection of Maxwell and Halsted Streets, the heart of University Village, once served as a weekly outdoor market. The area was also a center in the development of the [[Chicago Blues]] in the mid-twentieth century. The Market was moved twice in the 1990s and 2000s, and continues on Des Plaines Street. In the 2000s, UIC led a redevelopment of the area, which included new dormitories, parking garages, commercial buildings, and housing.

The borders are 16th Street to the south, the Dan Ryan Expressway to the east, Racine to the west, and Harrison Street to the north.  Taylor Street is part of University Village.

=== South Water Market ===
Chicago's original produce market sat along the south side of the Chicago River, west of what is now Michigan Ave. Incoming vessels could bring fruits and vegetables from the states located around the [[Great Lakes]]. This market became known as South Water Market because of its location.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Retail Geography|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1068.html|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago History Museum|access-date=14 January 2013}}</ref>

By the 1920s, the market was congested and overcrowded. The City of Chicago built new streets parallel to the Chicago River and moved the market to the neighborhood, alongside the [[St. Charles Air Line]]. The three-story buildings were originally designed by the architects Fugard & Knapp.

On July 10, 2003, the Chicago Planning Commission granted their approval on the sale of the produce market for a cost of approximately $36 million to Enterprise Companies of Chicago redevelop into retail and housing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-07-17/business/0307170240_1_university-village-flea-market-enterprise-development|title=S.

=== Illinois Medical District ===
{{Main|Illinois Medical District}}
The Illinois Medical District is one of the largest medical districts in the United States, and the largest in the state. [[John H. Stroger Jr.]] Hospital of Cook County (formerly known as [[Cook County Hospital]]), one of the largest county-run hospitals in the U.S. and inspiration for the TV shows ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and ''[[The Fugitive (1963 TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', is located here.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cookcountyil.gov/agency/juvenile-temporary-detention-center |title=Juvenile Temporary Detention Center |publisher=CookCountyIL.gov |language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-20}}</ref> The District had its start in the 1870s when Cook County Hospital, Rush Medical College, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons were established on the Near West Side following the great [[Chicago fire of 1871]]. The cornerstone for the Medical Center was the building of Cook County Hospital in 1876. In 1877, Rush Medical College erected a building next to County at Harrison and Wood. Presbyterian Hospital (affiliated with Rush) was built in 1883. The University of Illinois at Chicago's origins in the District can be traced to the College of Physicians and Surgeons, founded in 1881. In 1917, the State acquired the vacated [[West Side Park]] located at Polk and Wolcott for the University.

The district is also home to [[University of Illinois Medical Center]], [[Rush University Medical Center]], [[Rush University]], [[University of Illinois College of Medicine]], [[UIC Eye & Ear Infirmary]], [[UIC College of Dentistry]], [[UIC College of Pharmacy]], Jesse Brown VA, [http://www.psych.uic.edu The Neuropsychiatric Institute], [http://www.cookcountyhhs.org/locations/ruth-m-rothstein-core-center/ Rothstein CORE Center], [http://chicagolighthouse.org Chicago Lighthouse for the Blind & Visually Impaired], [[Illinois Forensic Science Center]], West Side CDC, the [http://www.chicagocac.org Chicago Children's Advocacy Center], the Chicago office of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago Dept. of Public Health and the [https://www.cookcountyil.gov/agency/medical-examiner Cook County Coroner's Office].

=== Tri-Taylor ===
Tri-Taylor, the western end of Taylor Street's Little Italy, consists of the roughly triangular area bordered by Congress Parkway to the North, Ogden Avenue to the East, [[Roosevelt Road]] on the south and railroad tracks on the west. The neighborhood is traditionally an extension of the Little Italy neighborhood to its east, although it has consistently been one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Chicago as it was situated on the borders of African American, Irish, Hispanic, and Italian areas. It is a residential area for students from UIC. The neighborhood is also home to the Chicago Technology Park research center as well as the West Side Center for Disease Control, the office for the Medical Examiner of Cook County, and Chicago Hope Academy (a private Christian high school that opened in the former St. Callistus School in 2005).

===United Center Area===
The [[United Center]] opened its doors in 1994, replacing [[Chicago Stadium]], which was located on the opposite side of Madison Street. The United Center is the home arena for the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Chicago Blackhawks|Blackhawks]], and also occasionally hosts concerts and other special events. The venue can seat between 20,000 and 25,000 people, depending on the event. A [[Michael Jordan Statue|statue of Michael Jordan]] sits in front of the arena. The area around the United Center used to be known for its notoriously high crime rate and housing projects off Lake Street and Damen known as the [[Henry Horner Homes]], also known as "the Hornetz nest".
