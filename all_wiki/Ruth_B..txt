She says she chose the six-second video service because it took less effort to upload short clips, compared to other popular services like [[YouTube]].<ref name=":0" />

Berhe graduated from [[Ross Sheppard High School]] in 2013. She attended [[MacEwan University]], but took time off her studies to focus on music.<ref name="CBC" />

==  Career ==
Berhe posted her first Vine video in May 2013, and started making singing Vines about a year later.<ref name=CBC /><ref name="Edmonton Journal" /> Her singing Vines, typically six second covers of popular songs, helped grow her a following.<ref name="Edmonton Journal" /> In November 2014,<!-- She says "November of last year" in the CBC video at 0:52 --> she posted a Vine of her singing a line that she had made up, which was inspired by the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''.<ref name=CBC /> It garnered around 84,000 likes within a week, which was unusual for her at the time. She took note of its popularity, with some of her followers commenting that she should make it into a full song.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.andpop.com/2015/11/30/ruth-b-talks-vine-the-intro-getting-inspired-by-once-upon-a-time/|title = Ruth B Talks Vine, The Intro & Getting Inspired By 'Once Upon A Time'|date = November 30, 2015|accessdate = December 6, 2015|website = ANDPOP|publisher = |last = Khan|first = Sarah}}</ref> It became  "Lost Boy", which she posted on [[YouTube]] on January 18, 2015 and was released on [[iTunes]] on February 12, 2015.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

Berhe entered the studio in early 2016 to begin recording her debut full-length album with [[Joel Little]], a New Zealand producer who helped [[Lorde]] create her first album. She says she was writing songs long before the album went into production, so she had many songs to pick from when her label told her it was time to start putting something together.<ref name=":0" />

She honored National Arts Centre Award winner Michael Buble at the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards gala by performing his song "Home". Later at the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony she performed Neil Young's song "Heart of Gold" to honor his induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall Of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruthbofficial.com/news/|title=News|website=Ruth B.|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}</ref>

The following year at the [[Juno Awards of 2018|2018 Juno Awards]] she was nominated for three awards including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, and Pop Album of the Year.{{cn|date=January 2020}}
