'''Pope Francis''' ({{lang-la|Franciscus}}; {{lang-it|Francesco}}; {{lang-es|link=no|Francisco}}; born '''Jorge Mario Bergoglio''',{{efn|Pronunciation: {{IPA-es|ˈxoɾxe ˈmaɾjo βeɾˈɣoɣljo|}} (Spanish); {{IPA-it|berˈɡɔʎʎo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is, as the [[bishop of Rome]], the head of the [[Catholic Church]] and [[List of sovereigns of Vatican City State|sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City]] State. Francis is the first [[Jesuit]] [[pope]], the first from the [[Americas]], the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since the Syrian [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], who reigned in the 8th century.

Born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], as a young man Bergoglio worked for a time as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] and a [[janitor]] before getting training as a chemist, and working as a technician in a [[food science]] laboratory.  After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the [[Society of Jesus]] (the Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was Argentina's [[provincial superior]] of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] considered him a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. Throughout his public life, Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor and commitment to [[Pope Francis: ecumenism and interreligious dialogue|interreligious dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes. 

Francis maintains the traditional views of the Church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]], and the [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of [[deaconess]]es and has made women full members of [[Dicasteries|dicasteries in the Roman curia]]. He maintains that the Church should be more open and welcoming for members of the [[LGBT community]], and favors [[Civil union|legal recognition of same-sex couples]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Ardrey|first=Taylor|title=Pope Francis said same-sex couples should be covered by a civil union law|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/pope-francis-same-sex-civil-union-law-2020-10|access-date=2020-10-22|website=Business Insider}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite news|last=Pullella|first=Philip|date=2020-10-22|title=Pope says same-sex couples should be covered by civil union laws|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pope-film-homosexuals-idUSKBN27706J|access-date=2020-10-22}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite news|last=Rocca|first=Francis X.|date=2020-10-22|title=Pope Francis Backs Civil Unions for Gay Couples, in Shift for Vatican|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/pope-francis-backs-civil-unions-for-gay-couples-in-shift-for-vatican-11603296578|access-date=2020-10-22|issn=0099-9660}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite web|date=October 22, 2020|title=The Irish Times view on the pope and same-sex civil unions: a welcome shift in tone|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/the-irish-times-view-on-the-pope-and-same-sex-civil-unions-a-welcome-shift-in-tone-1.4388751|access-date=October 23, 2020|website=The Irish Times|language=en|quote=The context of his comments also makes clear that he approves of same-sex adoption.

Since 2018, he has been a heavily vocal opponent of [[neo-nationalism]]. He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, including admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|communion]] with the publication of ''[[Amoris laetitia]]''.

Early in his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio sold off the archdiocese's shares in multiple banks and turned its accounts into those of a normal customer in international banks.

When Bergoglio became Pope, an alleged photo of him giving the [[sacramental bread]] to dictator Jorge Rafael Videla became popular in social networks. It has also been used by the newspaper ''[[Página/12]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoomnews.es/34129/actualidad/mundo/bergoglio-historia-papa-francisco-dictadura-argentina-videla|title=Bergoglio: la verdadera historia del Papa Francisco y la dictadura de Videla|last=Cifuentes|first=Pedro|date=15 March 2013|publisher=Zoom News|language=es|trans-title=Bergoglio: the true story of Pope Francis and Videla's dictatorship|access-date=28 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130701131917/http://www.zoomnews.es/34129/actualidad/mundo/bergoglio-historia-papa-francisco-dictadura-argentina-videla|archive-date=1 July 2013}}</ref> The photo was soon proved to be false. It was revealed that the priest, whose face is not visible in the photo, was Carlos Berón de Astrada. The photo was taken at the church "Pequeña Obra de la Divina Providencia Don Orione" in 1990, not during the Dirty War, and after Videla's presidential pardon. The photo was produced by the agency AFP and it was initially published by the ''[[Crónica (newspaper)|Crónica]]'' newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infotechnology.com/internet/The-fake-viral-photo-of-pope-Francis-who-is-the-priest-that-gives-the-communion-to-Videla-20130319-0002.html|title=The fake viral photo of pope Francis: who is the priest that gives the communion to Videla|date=19 March 2013|publisher=Info Technology|name-list-style=amp|author1=Joaquín Garau|author2=Pablo Martín Fernández|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

===Fernando de la Rúa===
[[Fernando de la Rúa]] replaced [[Carlos Menem]] as president of Argentina in 1999. As an archbishop, Bergoglio celebrated the annual Mass at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]] on the ''[[First National Government]]'' holiday, 25 May. In 2000, Bergoglio criticized the perceived apathy of society.<ref>Rubin, p. 19</ref> Argentina faced an [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|economic depression]] at the time, and the Church criticized the fiscal austerity of the government, which increased poverty. De la Rúa asked the Church to promote a dialogue between the leaders of economic and political sectors to find a solution for the crisis. He claims that he talked with Bergoglio and proposed to take part in the meeting, but Bergoglio would have told him that the meeting was canceled because of a misunderstanding by De la Rúa's assistant, who may have declined the president's assistance. Bishop [[Jorge Casaretto]] considers it unlikely, as De la Rúa only made the request in newspaper interviews, but never made a formal request to the Church.<ref>Reato, p. 160</ref>

The [[Justicialist Party]] won the [[Argentine legislative election, 2001|2001 elections]] and got the majority in the Congress, and appointed [[Ramón Puerta]] as president of the Senate. As vice president [[Carlos Álvarez (Argentine politician)|Carlos Álvarez]] resigned shortly before, this left an opposing party second in the [[Argentine order of precedence|order of precedence]]. Bergoglio asked for an interview with Puerta, and had a positive impression of him. Puerta told him that the Justicialist party was not plotting to oust De la Rúa, and promised to help the president promote the laws that may be required.<ref>Reato, pp. 222–223</ref>

During police repression of the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina|riots of December 2001]], he contacted the Ministry of the Interior and asked that the police distinguish rioters and vandals from peaceful protesters.<ref>Rubin, pp. 18–19</ref>

===Néstor and Cristina Kirchner===

When Bergoglio celebrated Mass at the cathedral for the 2004 ''First National Government'' holiday, President [[Néstor Kirchner]] attended and heard Bergoglio request more political dialogue, reject intolerance, and criticize exhibitionism and strident announcements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/604859-el-mensaje-de-la-iglesia-era-para-kirchner|title=El mensaje de la Iglesia era para Kirchner|last=Obarrio|first=Mariano|date=27 May 2004|newspaper=La Nación|language=es|trans-title=The message of the church was for Kirchner|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> Kirchner celebrated the national day elsewhere the following year and the Mass in the cathedral was suspended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/706830-suspendio|title=Suspendió la Iglesia el tedeum en la Capital|last=Colonna|first=Lucas|date=24 May 2005|newspaper=La Nación|language=es|trans-title=The church suspended the tedeum in the capital|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> In 2006, Bergoglio helped the fellow Jesuit [[Joaquín Piña]] to win the elections in the [[Misiones Province]] and prevent an amendment of the local constitution that would allow indefinite re-elections. Kirchner intended to use that project to start similar amendments at other provinces, and eventually to the national constitution.<ref>Reato, pp. 224–225</ref> Kirchner considered Bergoglio as a political rival to the day he died in October 2010.<ref name="anios">{{cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1562777-jorge-bergoglio-y-los-kirchner-anos-de-una-relacion-tensa|title=Jorge Bergoglio y los Kirchner: años de una relación tensa|date=14 March 2013|newspaper=La Nación|language=es|trans-title=Jorge Bergoglio and the Kirchners: years of a tense relation|access-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> Bergoglio's relations with Kirchner's widow and successor, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], have been similarly tense. In 2008, Bergoglio called for national reconciliation during [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector|disturbances]] in the country's agricultural regions, which the government interpreted as a support for anti-government demonstrators.<ref name="anios"/> The campaign to enact [[Same-sex marriage in Argentina|same-sex marriage legislation]] was a particularly tense period in their relations.<ref name="anios"/>

When Bergoglio was elected pope, the initial reactions were mixed. Most of the Argentine society cheered it, but the pro-government newspaper ''[[Página/12]]'' published renewed allegations about the Dirty War, and the president of the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library]] described a global conspiracy theory. The president took more than an hour before congratulating the new Pope, and only did so in a passing reference within a routine speech. However, due to the Pope's popularity in Argentina, Cristina Kirchner made what the political analyst Claudio Fantini called a "[[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican shift]]" in her relations with him and fully embraced the Francis phenomenon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/27/christina-fernandez-de-kirchner-pope-francis|title=Cristina Fernández de Kirchner turns Pope Francis from foe to friend|date=27 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Associated Press in Buenos Aires|access-date=15 March 2014}}</ref> On the day before his inauguration as pope, Bergoglio, now Francis, had a private meeting with Kirchner.

A February 2014 survey by the [[World Values Survey]] cited in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' shows how the unity Pope Francis had created could be challenged. Although views about Francis personally were favorable, many Catholics disagreed with at least some of his teachings. The survey found that members of the Catholic Church are deeply divided over abortion, artificial contraception, divorce, the ordination of women, and married priests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pope-francis-faces-church-divided-over-doctrine-global-poll-of-catholics-finds/2014/02/08/e90ecef4-8f89-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html|title=Pope Francis faces church divided over doctrine, global poll of Catholics finds|last=Boorstein|first=Michelle|date=9 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/09/poll-catholic-beliefs-at-odds-with-vatican-doctrine/|title=Poll: Catholic Beliefs at Odds With Vatican Doctrine|last=Frizell|first=Sam|date=9 February 2014|work=Time|access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref> In the same month Pope Francis asked parishes to provide answers to an official questionnaire<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141027095239/http://press.vatican.va/content/dam/salastampa/it/bollettino/documentazione-linkata/Documento-preparatorio-IIIAssGenStraod_ENG.pdf Vatican: Synod of Bishops – Extraordinary General Assembly – Pastoral Challenges to the Family in the Context of Evangelization – Preparatory Document, Vatican City 2013].

[[Linda Woodhead]] of [[Lancaster University]] wrote of the survey Francis initiated, "it's not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize." Woodhead said that many ordinary Catholics would have difficulty understanding theological [[jargon]] there. Nonetheless, she suspected the survey might be influential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/7408/new_poll___faithful_catholics__an_endangered_species|title=New Poll: 'Faithful Catholics' an Endangered Species|date=12 December 2013|publisher=University of Southern California|access-date=4 October 2014}}</ref>

The [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] {{As of|2014|4|lc=y}} had refused to publish results of this survey; a Church spokesman said a senior Vatican official had expressly asked for summaries to remain confidential, and that orders had come from the Pope that the information should not be made public until after October. This disappointed many reformers who hoped the laity would be more involved in decision-making. Some other Catholic churches, for example in [[Catholic Church in Germany|Germany]] and [[Catholic Church in Austria|Austria]], published summaries of the responses to the survey, which showed a wide gap between Church teaching and the behavior of ordinary Catholics.<ref name="bbc27060172" />

=== Outreach to other religions ===
{{Main|Pope Francis: ecumenism and interreligious dialogue}}
Pope Francis continued in the tradition of the [[Second Vatican Council]] and of the papacies since the Council in dialoguing and cooperating with leaders of other Christian faiths and of other religions, and with those claiming no religious belief.

===Clerical titles===
{{See also|Theology of Pope Francis#Clericalism}}
In January 2014, Pope Francis said that he would appoint fewer [[monsignor]]s and only assign those honored to the lowest of the three surviving ranks of monsignor, [[chaplain of His Holiness]]. It would be awarded only to [[diocesan priest]]s at least 65 years old. During his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Pope Francis never sought the title for any of his priests. It is believed he associates it with clerical careerism and hierarchy, though he did not apply this restriction to clergy working in the Roman Curia or diplomatic corps, where careerism is an even greater concern.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/31027/|title=Pope abolishes honorary title of monsignor for diocesan priests under the age of 65|last=O'Connell|first=Gerard|date=4 January 2014|publisher=Vatican Insider|access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref>

===Consistories===
{{Main|Cardinals created by Francis}}
At the first [[Papal consistory|consistory]] of his papacy, held on 22 February 2014, Francis created 19 new cardinals. At the time of their elevation to that rank, 16 of these new cardinals were under eighty years of age and thus eligible to vote in a [[papal conclave]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26301947 Pope Francis appoints 19 new cardinals in Rome ceremony], BBC News, 22 February 2014. Retrieved 22 February 2014</ref> The new appointees included prelates from South America, Africa, and Asia, including appointees in some of the world's poorest countries, such as [[Chibly Langlois]] from [[Haiti]] and [[Philippe Ouédraogo (bishop)|Philippe Nakellentuba Ouedraogo]] from [[Burkina Faso]].<ref name="Reuters">[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/22/us-pope-consistory-benedict-idUSBREA1L07X20140222 Pope Francis inducts new cardinals as predecessor Benedict looks on], Reuters, 22 February 2014. Retrieved 22 February 2014</ref> The consistory was a rare occasion in which Francis and his predecessor, [[Benedict XVI]], appeared together in public.<ref name="Reuters" />

Benedict XVI also attended the second consistory on 14 February 2015, at which Francis elevated 20 new cardinals, with 15 under the age of eighty and five over the age of eighty. The pope continued his practice of appointing cardinals from the peripheries, such as [[Charles Maung Bo]] of [[Myanmar]] and [[Soane Patita Paini Mafi]] of [[Tonga]].<ref>"[http://www.news.va/en/news/230499 Annuncio di Concistoro per la creazione di nuovi Cardinali]" NEWS.VA Official Vatican Network. 4 January 2015.

Francis presided over the third consistory of his papacy on 19 November 2016, elevating 17 new cardinals. Of that total number at the time of their elevation, 13 were under the age of eighty and four were over the age of eighty. Francis continued his previous practice of elevating cardinals from the peripheries with an emphasis again on Asia and Africa, such as [[Patrick D'Rozario]] from Bangladesh and [[Dieudonné Nzapalainga]] from the [[Central African Republic]], while also naming the first three American cardinals of his papacy and only one Curial appointment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/06/28/pope_francis_allocution_at_cardinals_creation_consistory/1321890|title=Pope Francis: Allocution at Consistory for Creation of Cardinals|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>

The pope presided over a fourth consistory for the elevation of five new cardinals on the afternoon of 28 June 2017. Each of the five were under the age of eighty, and were thus eligible to vote in a papal conclave. This consistory was noteworthy for the fact that, with the pope continuing the trend of elevating cardinals from a diverse range of areas, no cardinals elevated are of the Roman Curia, and one was a mere auxiliary bishop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ncregister.com/daily-news/francis-fifth-a-synod-humanae-vitae-milestone-and-more-decentralized-church|title=Francis' Fifth: A Synod, Humanae Vitae Milestone and More Decentralized Church|website=m.ncregister.com|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref>

Francis presided over his fifth consistory for the elevation of 14 new cardinals on 28 June 2018. The first eleven were under the age of eighty, and therefore, were eligible to vote in a future papal conclave while the last three were over the age of eighty, and thus, ineligible to vote in a papal conclave.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-cardinals/pope-francis-names-14-new-cardinals-from-five-continents-idUSKCN1lL0CH|title=Pope Francis names 14 new cardinals from five continents|work=Reuters|author=Crispian Balmer|date=20 May 2018|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref> The pope continued the practice of naming the [[Vicar of Rome]] and a curial prefect as cardinals, while naming his substitute for the Secretariat of State in anticipation of his transferral to a curial department. The pope also continued his practice of bestowing the red hat on those from peripheries such as Madagascar, Pakistan, and Iraq, and like in 2016, created a priest as a cardinal. The consistory was also noteworthy for the fact that Francis named the papal almoner [[Konrad Krajewski]] as a cardinal, marking the consistory the first occasion where the almoner was made a cardinal. Francis himself later said that he wanted the office of almoner to receive the red hat going forward as it was an important arm of the Vatican.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-interview-changes/pope-to-make-vatican-changes-in-push-for-reform-transparency-idUSKBN1Jl1T8|date=22 June 2018|access-date=23 December 2018|work=Reuters|author=Philip Pullella|title=Pope to make Vatican changes in push for reform, transparency}}</ref>

On 1 September 2019, following his weekly Sunday Angelus address, Francis unexpectedly announced the appointment of 13 new cardinals. Of these, 10 appointees were under the age of 80 and would therefore become [[cardinal electors]], besides three over 80. The new cardinals were formally installed at the consistory celebrated on 5 October 2019.<ref name="R0901">{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/pope-picks-cardinals-putting-stamp-104820408.html|title=Pope picks new cardinals, putting his stamp on Church's future|work=[[Reuters]], via [[Yahoo.com]]|first=Philip|last=Pullella|date=1 September 2019|access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> Most of the new cardinals come from the peripheries of the church and developing countries.

Most of these new appointees continued the trend that Francis adhered to, appointing the first cardinals to represent [[Brunei]] and [[Rwanda]]. Francis also nominated the first [[African American]] cardinal ([[Wilton Daniel Gregory|Gregory]]), while naming the first [[Conventual Franciscan]] ([[Mauro Gambetti|Gambetti]]) in almost 160 years, and the first from Siena ([[Augusto Paolo Lojudice|Lojudice]]) since 1801.<ref>{{cite news | access-date = 7 November 2020 | url = https://international.la-croix.com/news/letter-from-rome/the-popes-13-new-cardinals-and-the-next-conclave/13266 | work = La Croix | title = The pope's 13 new cardinals and the next conclave | date = 31 October 2020 | first = Robert | last = Mickens}}</ref> Three of his appointees were only priests upon their nomination, therefore, two (Gambetti and [[Enrico Feroci|Feroci]]) received their [[episcopal consecration]], while one ([[Raniero Cantalamessa|Cantalamessa]]) was granted a papal dispensation from it.

{{main|Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy}}
With his April 2015 [[papal bull]] of indiction, ''Misericordiae Vultus'' ([[Latin]]: "The Face of [[Mercy]]"), Francis inaugurated a Special [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of Mercy, to run from 8 December 2015, [[Solemnity]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], to the last Sunday before [[Advent]] and the Solemnity of the [[Feast of Christ the King]] of the Universe on 20 November 2016.

The [[Holy Door]]s of the major basilicas of Rome (including the Great Door of St. Peter's) were opened, and special "Doors of Mercy" were opened at cathedrals and other major churches around the world, where the faithful can earn indulgences by fulfilling the usual conditions of prayer for the Pope's intentions, confession, and detachment from sin, and communion.<ref name="opening" /><ref>{{cite web|title=The Gift Of The Indulgence (29 January 2000)|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/tribunals/apost_penit/documents/rc_trib_appen_pro_20000129_indulgence_en.html|access-date=2020-09-06|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref> During Lent of that year, special 24-hour penance services will be celebrated, and during the year, special qualified and experienced priests called "Missionaries of Mercy" will be available in every diocese to forgive even severe, special-case sins normally reserved to the Holy See's [[Apostolic Penitentiary]].<ref name="Misericordiae" /><ref name="time" />

Pope Francis established the [[World Day of the Poor]] in his Apostolic Letter, ''Misericordia et Misera'', issued on 20 November 2016 to celebrate the end of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Day of the Poor|url=http://justiceandpeace.org.au/world-day-of-the-poor/|website=Justice and Peace Office|publisher=Justice and Peace Office|access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldmalaysia.com/news/card-ranjith-calls-for-prayers-and-practical-action-on-world-day-of-the-poor/39361/1|title=Card Ranjith calls for prayers and practical action on World Day of the Poor|date=30 November 2017|website=Herald Malaysia Online|access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref>

== Theological emphases ==
{{Main|Theology of Pope Francis}}
In ''Evangelii gaudium'' Pope Francis revealed what would be the emphases of his pontificate: a missionary impulse among all Catholics, sharing the faith more actively, avoiding worldliness and more visibly living the gospel of God's mercy, and helping the poor and working for [[Catholic social teaching|social justice]].<ref>Cindy Wooden (26 November 2013) "A summary of the key issues raised by Pope in Evangelii Gaudium",.''Catholic Herald''.

Pope Francis has come under scrutiny in the case of Father Julio Grassi, a priest convicted of child sexual abuse. As Cardinal, Bergoglio commissioned a study that concluded Grassi was innocent, that his victims were lying and that the case against him never should have gone to trial. Despite the study, the [[Supreme Court of Argentina]] upheld the conviction.

===Theological disagreements===
====''Amoris laetitia'' and the communion to the divorced and civilly remarried====
{{Main|Amoris laetitia}}
On a theological level, controversy arose after the publication of the apostolic exhortation ''[[Amoris laetitia]]'', especially regarding whether the exhortation had changed the [[Catholic Church]]'s sacramental discipline concerning access to the [[Sacrament of Penance|sacraments of Penance]] and the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] for divorced couples who have [[Civil marriage|civilly remarried]].<ref name="Oullet">Oullet, Marc (21 November 2017), [http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/accompanying-discerning-integrating-weakness "Accompanying, Discerning, Integrating Weakness"], ''L'Osservatore Romano''<span class="reference-accessdate" zoompage-fontsize="12">, retrieved <span class="nowrap" zoompage-fontsize="12">29 November</span> 2017</span></ref> Francis had written that "It is important that the divorced who have entered a new union should be made to feel part of the Church." He called not for "a new set of general rules, canonical in nature and applicable to all cases," but "a responsible personal and pastoral discernment of particular cases." He went on to say: “It is true that general rules set forth a good which can never be disregarded or neglected, but in their formulation they cannot provide absolutely for all particular situations.”<ref name="Carroll">{{Cite news|last=Carroll|first=James|date=8 April 2016|title=The New Morality of Pope Francis|work=The New Yorker|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/new-morality-of-pope-francis-joy-of-love|access-date=28 September 2019|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

Four cardinals ([[Raymond Leo Burke]], [[Carlo Caffarra]], [[Walter Brandmüller]], and [[Joachim Meisner]]) formally asked Pope Francis for clarifications, particularly on the issue of giving communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/four-cardinals-formally-ask-pope-for-clarity-on-amoris-laetitia|title=Four Cardinals Formally Ask Pope for Clarity on 'Amoris Laetitia'|newspaper=[[National Catholic Register]]|access-date=4 February 2018}}</ref> They submitted five "dubia" (doubts), and requested a yes or no answer.

Cardinal [[Gerhard Ludwig Müller|Gerhard Müller]], former prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], maintained that ''Amoris Laetitia'' should only be interpreted in line with previous doctrine. Therefore, according to Cardinal Müller, divorced and civilly remarried can have access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist only if they take on the duty of living in complete continence.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/cardinal-mueller-on-communion-for-divorced-and-remarried-teaching-of-jesus |title= Cardinal Müller on Communion for Divorced & Remarried: Can't Change Church Teaching |newspaper=[[National Catholic Register]] |publisher=[[EWTN]] |location= Irondale, Alabama |date= 4 March 2016 |access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/01/cardinal-muller-communion-for-the-remarried-is-against-gods-law |title= Cardinal Müller: Communion for the remarried is against God's law |newspaper= [[Catholic Herald]] |publisher= [[Sir Rocco Forte]], [[Lord Black of Crossharbour]] |location= London, England |date= 1 February 2017 |access-date= 8 July 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180705233123/http://catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/02/01/cardinal-muller-communion-for-the-remarried-is-against-gods-law/ |archive-date= 5 July 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Pope Francis subsequently announced that [[dicastery]] prefects would be appointed for a single five-year term, and replaced Müller at the end of his term in 2017 with [[Luis Ladaria Ferrer]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Edward|last=Pentin|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/edward-pentin/cardinal-mueller-to-be-dismissed |title=Pope Francis Appoints Spanish Jesuit Ladaria to Succeed Cardinal Müller |newspaper=[[National Catholic Register]] |publisher=[[EWTN]] |location= Irondale, AL |date=3 June 2017 |access-date= 8 July 2018}}</ref> Cardinal [[Carlo Caffarra]], one of the authors of the dubia, maintains that after ''Amoris laetitia'' "only a blind man could deny there's great confusion, uncertainty and insecurity in the Church."<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2017/01/14/cardinal-says-blind-man-deny-confusion-caused-pope |title=Cardinal says 'only blind man' could deny confusion caused by Pope |newspaper=[[Crux (online newspaper)|Crux Now]] |publisher=Boston Globe Partners LLC |location=Boston, MA |date= 14 January 2017 |access-date=4 February 2017 }}</ref>

The ''[[Document on Human Fraternity|Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together]]'' is a joint statement signed by Pope Francis and [[Sheikh]] [[Ahmed el-Tayeb]], [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]], on 4 February 2019 in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. This joint statement is concerned with how different faiths can live peaceably in the same world and areas. Criticisms focused particularly on the passage about God's will with regard to the diversity of religions, claiming that the "pluralism and the diversity of religions, colour, sex, race and language are willed by God in His wisdom, through which He created human beings".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pope Francis|last2=Al-Tayyeb|first2=Ahmad|date=4 February 2019|title=Document on "Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together" signed by His Holiness Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Ahamad al-Tayyib (Abu Dhabi, 4 February 2019)|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/travels/2019/outside/documents/papa-francesco_20190204_documento-fratellanza-umana.html|access-date=13 June 2020|website=w2.vatican.va}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Gabriel|date=12 April 2019|title=After Abu Dhabi {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/after-abu-dhabi|access-date=13 June 2020|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org}}</ref> Catholic theologian Chad Pecknold wrote that this sentence was "puzzling, and potentially problematic".<ref name=":7">{{cite web|last=Farrow|first=Mary|date=4 February 2019|title=Pope Francis signs peace declaration on 'Human Fraternity' with Grand Imam|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-signs-peace-declaration-on-human-fraternity-with-grand-imam-98253|access-date=13 June 2020|website=Catholic News Agency|language=en}}</ref> Some Catholic observers tried to understand it as an allusion to the "permissive will" of God, allowing evil on earth.<ref name=":6" /> Pecknold wrote that the diversity of religions might also be "evidence of our natural desire to know God".<ref name=":7" /> On 8 February 2019 Bishop [[Athanasius Schneider]] released a document entitled "The Gift of Filial Adoption, the Christian Faith: the only valid and the only God-willed religion".<ref name=":6" />

===Appreciation===
In the [[oratorio]] [[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si']] by [[Peter Reulein]] (music) written on a [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]], the figure of Pope Francis appears next to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Clare of Assisi]]. In the oratorio, Pope Franziskus suggests a bridge from the crucifixion scene on [[Calvary|Golgotha]] to the suffering of the present. He emphasizes the female talent and the importance of the charism of women for church and society. The texts of the [[encyclical]] ''[[Laudato si']]'' and ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' were used. The motto of the [[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]] also plays a central role.<ref name="Laudato si-score">{{cite book | last1 = Reulein | first1 = Peter | author-link = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | author-link2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | page = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}</ref> The oratorio was premiered on 6 November 2016 in the [[Limburg Cathedral]].<ref name="Laudato si-Liebfrauen">{{cite web | url = http://www.liebfrauen.net/meldung_volltext.php?si=5807238ed0bee&id=57f955bfc9ddd&view=&lang=&akt=musikkunstkultur_musikmeldungen&k1=main&k2=musikkunstkultur&k3=musikmeldungen&k4= | title = Festkonzert zum Jubiläum des Referates Kirchenmusik / Laudato si'—Oratorium von Peter Reulein (Uraufführung) | publisher = [[Liebfrauen, Frankfurt]] | year = 2016 | language = de | access-date = 25 December 2016}}</ref>
