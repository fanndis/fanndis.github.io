The '''2019 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election''' took place on January 3, 2019, on the opening day of the [[116th United States Congress]], two months after the [[United States]] [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 elections]]. This was the 126th [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] election since the office was created in 1789. House [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] received 220 votes, a majority of the chamber, to become its speaker. House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] garnered 192 votes, with 18 more going to others. As only 430 representatives in the 435-member House cast a vote (due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting), 216 votes were necessary in order to win.

Immediately after the election, the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]], [[Don Young]], administered the [[Oath of office#Federal Executive and Legislative Branch Oaths|oath of office]] to the new speaker. Pelosi in turn administered the oath of office [[en masse]] to the rest of the members of the United States House of Representatives.

[[Incumbent]] speaker [[Paul Ryan]] did not run for re-election to the House.<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-43729218|title=US House Speaker Paul Ryan to stand down|date=April 11, 2018|website=Bbc.com}}</ref> With the Democratic caucus assuming control of the House in January 2019, Pelosi had been the [[Speaker-presumptive]] since the incoming [[House Democratic Caucus]] formally nominated her the previous November.
__TOC__

==Process and conventions==
The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] is the presiding officer of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. The House elects its speaker at the beginning of a new Congress (i.e. {{Linktext|biennially}}, after [[Election Day (United States)|a general election]]) or when a speaker dies, resigns or is removed from the position intra-term. Since 1839, the House has elected speakers by [[roll call vote]].<ref name=HG125>{{cite web| last=Forte| first=David F.| title=Essays on Article I: Speaker of the House| url=https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/10/speaker-of-the-house| work=Heritage Guide to The Constitution| publisher=Heritage Foundation| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Traditionally, each [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|party's caucus or conference]] selects a candidate for the speakership from among its senior leaders prior to the roll call. Representatives are not restricted to voting for the candidate nominated by their party, but generally do, as the outcome of the election effectively determines which party has the [[Majority party|majority]] and consequently will organize the House.<ref name=CRS-RL30857>{{cite web| last1=Heitshusen| first1=Valerie| last2=Beth| first2=Richard S.| title=Speakers of the House: Elections, 1913â€“2019| date=January 4, 2019| work=CRS Report for Congress| url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30857.pdf| publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], the [[Library of Congress]]| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Representatives that choose to vote for someone other than their party's nominated candidate usually vote for another member within the party or vote "[[Abstention|present]]".

Moreover, as the Constitution does not explicitly state that the speaker must be an [[incumbent]] member of the House, it is permissible for representatives to vote for someone who is not a member of the House at the time, and non-members have received a few votes in various speaker elections over the past several years.<ref>{{cite web| last=Grier| first=Peter| date=September 25, 2015| url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Decoder/2015/0925/John-Boehner-exit-Anyone-can-run-for-House-speaker-even-you| title=John Boehner exit: Anyone can run for House speaker, even you| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Nevertheless, every person elected speaker has been a member.<ref name=CRS-RL30857/>

To be elected speaker a candidate must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast, as opposed to an absolute majority of the full membership of the House{{snd}}presently 218 votes, in a House of 435. There have only been a few instances during the past century where a person received a majority of the votes cast, and thus won the election, while failing to obtain a majority of the full membership. It happened most recently in January 2015 ([[114th United States Congress|114th Congress]]), when [[John Boehner]] was elected with 216 votes (as opposed to 218). Such a variation in the number of votes necessary to win a given election might arise due to vacancies, absentees, or members being present but not voting. If no candidate wins a majority of the "votes cast for a person by name," then the roll call is repeated until a speaker is elected.<ref name=CRS-RL30857/> Multiple roll calls have been necessary only 14 times since 1789; and not since 1923 ([[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]]), when a closely divided House needed nine ballots to elect [[Frederick H. Gillett]] speaker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speaker Elections Decided by Multiple Ballots|url=http://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/|website=history.house.gov|publisher=United States House of Representatives|access-date=January 22, 2019}}</ref> Upon winning election the new Speaker is immediately sworn in by the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]], the chamber's longest-serving member.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fathers/Deans of the House|url=https://history.house.gov/Institution/Seniority/Deans-of-the-House/|website=history.house.gov|publisher=United States House of Representatives|access-date=January 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://constitution.laws.com/house-of-representatives/election-of-the-speaker| title=Election of the Speaker Overview| website=constitution.laws.com| accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref>

==Democratic Party==
During the midterm election campaign, there were indications that many of the incoming Democrats would not support party leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] for the speakership. After taking back the House in November, [[Ohio]] Rep. [[Marcia Fudge]] was mentioned as a possible alternative. However, she quickly bowed out after being offered the chairmanship of the [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Elections|House Administration Subcommittee on Elections]]. Other possible defectors, including incoming New York Rep. [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], later publicly declared her support for Pelosi.
