'''Woodrow Wilson Awards''' are given out in multiple countries each year by the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to individuals in both the public sphere and business who have shown an outstanding commitment to [[President of the United States]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s dream of integrating politics, scholarship, and policy for the common good.  Created in 1999 as a local Award for leadership in Washington, DC, the Awards were expanded in 2001 to recognize great leaders and thinkers throughout the world.  Funding from the Awards supports additional research, scholars, and programs in Washington and the home community of the recipients.

==Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service==
The Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service is given to individuals who have served with distinction in public life and have shown a special commitment to seeking out informed opinions and thoughtful views. Recipients of this award share Woodrow Wilson’s steadfast belief in public discourse, scholarship, and the extension of the benefits of knowledge in the United States and around the world. These leaders devote themselves to examining the historical background and long-term implications of important public policy issues while encouraging the free and open exchange of ideas that is the bedrock of our nation’s foundation.

==Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship==
The Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship is given to executives who demonstrate a commitment to the common good—beyond the bottom line. They are the people who demonstrate that private firms should be good citizens in their own neighborhoods, as well as in the world. The award is given to those who have done tremendous work in improving their local communities and the world at large.
