Additionally, its population of {{UN Population|Nauru}} is [[list of countries and dependencies by population|the world's second smallest]], after Vatican City.

Settled by people from [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]] {{circa|1000 BC}}, Nauru was [[annexation|annexed]] and claimed as a colony by the [[German Empire]] in the late 19th century. After [[World War&nbsp;I]], Nauru became a [[League of Nations mandate]] administered by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. During [[World War&nbsp;II]], Nauru was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops, and was [[leapfrogging (strategy)|bypassed]] by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into [[United Nations trust territories|United Nations trusteeship]]. Nauru gained its independence in 1968, and became a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC) in 1969.

Nauru is a [[Phosphorite|phosphate-rock]] island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy [[Surface mining|strip mining]] operations.

In 1948, Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Administrator for Nauru, [[Eddie Ward]], imposed a [[state of emergency]] with [[Native Police]] and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were "accidentally received."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63066635 |title=NAURU RIOT |newspaper=[[Townsville Daily Bulletin]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=2 July 1949 |access-date=17 February 2020 |page=1 |via=Trove }}</ref><ref>{{Citation| title=Chinese Lose Nauru and Manus Cases| journal=Pacific Islands Monthly| year=1949| issue=Vol. XIX, No. 6 ( Jan. 1, 1949)| location=[Sydney| publisher=Pacific Publications| url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-330063007| id=nla.obj-330063007| access-date=17 February 2020| via=Trove}}</ref> The governments of the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] made official complaints against [[Australia]] at the [[United Nations]] over this incident.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49714695 |title=Nauru, New Guinea |newspaper=[[The Courier-mail]] |location=Queensland, Australia |date=5 October 1949 |access-date=17 February 2020 |page=4 |via=Trove }}</ref>

In 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to [[Curtis Island (Queensland)|Curtis Island]] off the coast of [[Queensland]], Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain and New Zealand damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104291886|title=Island Purchase For Nauruans|date=6 May 1964|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=1 April 2019|issue=10,840|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=38|page=5|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131721012|title=Nauruans Likely To Settle Curtis Island|date=30 May 1963|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=1 April 2019|issue=10,549|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=37|page=9|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be {{Australian pound|10 million||}}, which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral, agricultural, and fishing industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/how-the-entire-nation-of-nauru-almost-moved-to-queensland-63833|title=How the entire nation of Nauru almost moved to Queensland|last=McAdam|first=Jane|date=15 August 2016|website=The Conversation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401022237/http://theconversation.com/how-the-entire-nation-of-nauru-almost-moved-to-queensland-63833|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref> However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation, which Australia would not agree to.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131721799|title=Lack of Sovereignty 'Disappoints' Nauruans|date=5 June 1963|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=1 April 2019|issue=10,554|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=37|page=45|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island, instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105839593|title=Nauru not to take Curtis Is.|date=21 August 1964|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=1 April 2019|issue=10,930|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=38|page=3|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt where [[coconut]] palms flourish. The land around [[Buada Lagoon]] supports bananas, [[pineapple]]s, vegetables, [[pandanus tectorius|pandanus trees]], and indigenous hardwoods, such as the [[calophyllum inophyllum|tamanu tree]].<ref name=state/>

Nauru was one of three great [[Phosphorite|phosphate rock]] islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (Ocean Island), in [[Kiribati]], and [[Makatea]], in [[French Polynesia]]. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to {{cvt|15|m}} high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable,<ref name="KN-20180916" /> and has also affected the surrounding [[exclusive economic zone]]; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.<ref name="state"/><ref name="UNCCC">{{cite web |author= |year= 1999 |url= http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf |title=Climate Change&nbsp;– Response |work=First National Communication |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=9 September 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090806210630/http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf |archive-date=6 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

There are limited natural sources of freshwater on Nauru. Rooftop [[Rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater. The islanders are mostly dependent on three [[desalination]] plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency.

=== Climate ===
Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by [[monsoon]] rains between November and February, but rarely has cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], with several significant recorded droughts.<ref name= "UNCCD"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Affaire de certaines terres à phosphates à Nauru |year=2003 |publisher=International Court of Justice |isbn=978-92-1-070936-1 |pages=107–109 }}</ref> The temperature on Nauru ranges between {{cvt|30|and|35|C}} during the day and is quite stable at around {{cvt|25|C}} at night.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |title= Pacific Climate Change Science Program |accessdate=10 June 2012 |publisher= Government of Australia |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175200/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}</ref>

Streams and rivers do not exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems.

The president of Nauru is [[Lionel Aingimea]], who heads a 19-member [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. Nauru also participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Olympic Games]]. Recently Nauru became a member country of the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April 2016.

Nauru is a republic with a [[parliamentary system]] of government.<ref name=davidson/> The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years.<ref>

Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19&nbsp;members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the [[Democratic Party of Nauru|Democratic Party]], [[Nauru First]] and the [[Centre Party (Nauru)|Centre Party]]. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anckar |first1=D |last2=Anckar |first2=C |title=Democracies without Parties |journal=Comparative Political Studies |year=2000 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=225–247 |doi=10.1177/0010414000033002003 |s2cid=154687315 }}</ref>

From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services.

The Nauruan economy peaked in the mid-1970s, when its [[GDP]] per capita was estimated to be US$50,000, second only to Saudi Arabia.<ref name="KN-20180916" /> Most of this came from phosphate mining, which declined from the early 1980s.<ref name="CER-NAU-2007"/>{{RP|5}} There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.<ref name=state/><ref>{{cite news |work=[[BBC News Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm |title=Big tasks for a small island |accessdate=10 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813094527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/332164.stm |archive-date=13 August 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the [[Nauru Phosphate Corporation]].<ref name=state/> The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the [[Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust]].
