'''''Destiny's Child''''' is the [[self-titled]] debut studio album by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]], released by [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] on February 17, 1998. It features the singles "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]" and "[[With Me (Destiny's Child song)|With Me]]". It won [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award]] for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year due to both singles having a remix (Part 2) as well as having an original version (Part 1). Both singles preceded the album. The album spent twenty six weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and peaked at number sixty-seven. In the United Kingdom, it reached the top fifty, peaking at number forty-five on the albums chart due to strength of its lead single, "No, No, No". The album did go on to sell over one million copies in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicstarx.net/biography/biography-destinys-child/|title=Destiny's Child Biography and Sales|access-date=2011-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107234633/http://www.musicstarx.net/biography/biography-destinys-child/|archive-date=2012-01-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was re-packaged and re-released in several countries after the success of the follow-up album, ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' (1999).
