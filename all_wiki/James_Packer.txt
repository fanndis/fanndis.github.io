==Early life and education==
James Packer was born in [[Sydney]], the son of philanthropist [[Roslyn Packer|Roslyn]] (née Weedon) and [[media mogul]] [[Kerry Packer]]. His grandfather was the media proprietor Sir [[Frank Packer]].

Packer was educated at [[Cranbrook School Sydney|Cranbrook School]] in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill, Sydney]]. After obtaining the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] (HSC) at Cranbrook, he began working at his father's extensive [[Newcastle Waters Station|Newcastle Waters]] [[cattle station]] in the [[Barkly Tableland]] of the [[Northern Territory]], where he was a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackeroo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/05/1051987635136.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Shadow on the son |date=5 May 2003 |first=Richard |last=Guilliatt}}</ref> Packer has stated he did not attend university as he "didn't have the marks".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2009/s2711781.htm|title=Will the Son Also Rise|date=12 October 2009|format=transcript|work=[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]|publisher=ABC TV|access-date=7 June 2018}}</ref>

==Career==
Packer is the major shareholder and a director of Crown Resorts Limited, one of Australia's largest casino groups. In October 2017, Crown's market capitalisation was over A$8&nbsp;billion.<ref name="au.finance.yahoo.com">{{Cite web|url=https://au.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CWN.AX/|title=CWN.AX: Summary for CROWN FPO - Yahoo Finance|website=au.finance.yahoo.com|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> Every year Crown's Australian resorts attract over 31 million visits.<ref name="Crown Limited">{{Cite journal|author=Crown Limited|first=Crown Resorts Limited|date=September 2017|title=Crown Resorts Limited Annual Report 2017, (page 2)|url=http://crownresorts.com.au/CrownResorts/files/32/32fd5304-b34a-4f98-9cbf-14e84bee1857.pdf}}</ref>

===Early internet investments===
Following the dotcom crash of 2000–2001, Packer acquired stakes in the online classified sites [[Seek Limited|SEEK]] and [[Carsales.com]], believing that newspaper companies relying heavily on classified advertising were vulnerable to online companies in categories including employment and vehicle listings.<ref name=williams>{{cite book |author=Williams, Pamela |title=Killing Fairfax: Packer, Murdoch & The Ultimate Revenge |publisher=HarperCollinsPublisher |year=2013 |isbn=9780732297664 }}</ref>{{rp|15}}

Packer purchased a 25% stake in SEEK for A$33 million in August 2003. He sold most of his stake six years later for A$440&nbsp;million.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|53}}<ref name=williams/>{{rp|242}} At Packer's urging, the magazine group then controlled by his family, [[Australian Consolidated Press]], acquired a 41% stake in online advertiser Carsales in October 2005.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|101}} The deal, initially valued at A$100 million, was eventually worth A$462 million to Packer-controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adele |last=Ferguson |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Online boom shows much more pain still to come for retailers|date=24 May 2011 |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/online-boom-shows-much-more-pain-still-to-come-for-retailers-20110523-1f0ov.html |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>

===Selling Channel Nine===
In March 2006, Packer began discussing whether to sell Channel Nine and the Australian Consolidated Press magazine group to help fund his move into the international gaming and tourism business. Given changes in media due to the Internet and pay-TV, Packer was concerned about the future of free-to-air television.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|140}}{{rp|150}} On 17 October 2006, Packer's team finalised a deal to sell 50% of the media assets—which also included a 50% stake in web portal [[Ninemsn.com.au|Ninemsn]] and a 51% stake in Carsales—to private equity group CVC Asia Pacific for A$4.5 billion, plus an additional A$1 billion in equity in the new company, which would be called PBL Media.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|213}}

In June 2007, Packer sold another 25% share of the joint-venture PBL Media to CVC for $515 million. In October 2008, Packer wrote down his final 25% stake in PBL Media to zero.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|222}} By the end of 2012, debt from CVC's acquisition had overwhelmed Channel Nine and US hedge funds ousted CVC, taking complete ownership.<ref>{{cite news |first=Helia |last=Ebrahimi |work=CNBC|title=Interview with Helia Ebrahimi|date=13 September 2013 |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/100837845 |accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>

===One.Tel===
{{Main|One.Tel}}
Packer was a director of Australian Telecommunications company One.Tel, which was declared insolvent during May 2001. The collapse of One.Tel cost PBL A$327 million. Packer admitted at a PBL annual general meeting that he had learned "painful lessons" from the collapse of One.Tel. Later at the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]]'s inquiry over the collapse he denied that he was apologising for his own personal conduct; instead, he claimed, "I was making an apology for accepting the bona fides of Mr. [[Jodee Rich|Rich]] and a Mr. Heaney, and the executive directors of One.Tel."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In April 2014, [[Lachlan Murdoch]] and Packer agreed to a A$40 million settlement over the One.Tel failure. The settlement was approved by the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] on 17 April 2014, with A$14.93 million to be paid by the Packer family's Consolidated Press Holdings, A$11.77 million to be paid by Packer's [[Crown Resorts]] and A$13.3 million to be paid by [[News Corp (2013–present)|News Corp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/court-approves-40m-onetel-settlement-20140417-36u8c.html |title=Court approves $40m One.Tel settlement |last1=Butler |first1=Ben |date=17 April 2014 |website=The Age |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

==Wealth==
Packer first appeared on various [[net wealth|wealth lists]] in 2006, following the death of his father the previous year and the intergeneration transfer of the bulk of Kerry Packer's wealth to his son, James. James Packer's wealth was valued at A$7.25&nbsp;billion.  A television report{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} on 21 June 2007 alleged that Packer had lost in excess of A$1&nbsp;billion over the previous six months in 2007 due to poor investment decisions and falling profits.  The 2008 [[BRW Rich 200|''BRW'' Rich 200]] listed Packer as the third-richest person in Australia with a personal wealth of A$6.1&nbsp;billion, behind [[Fortescue Metals Group]] chief executive [[Andrew Forrest]] and [[Westfield Group]]'s [[Frank Lowy]]. That was the first time in 21 years that a member of the Packer family had not topped the list.<ref name="Age2008"/> According to ''BRW'', Packer's wealth dipped to an estimated A$3&nbsp;billion during 2009.<ref name="richgetpoorer"/> In its 2013 ''BRW Rich 200'' list, Packer was ranked third with his wealth estimated at A$6.0&nbsp;billion, a boost of A$1.1&nbsp;billion on the previous year. In the 2014 wealth rankings by ''BRW'', Packer's wealth was assessed at A$7.19&nbsp;billion, making him the third-richest Australian.<ref name="brw2014"/><ref name="Heathcode">{{cite news|url=http://brw.com.au/p/business/rich_get_richer_our_top_billionaires_O0X7PZ1oAhqQAKBnW8Xo1L |work=[[BRW (magazine)|Business Review Weekly]]|title=Rich 200 get richer: Our top 10 billionaires enjoy a year to remember|date=14 November 2013|first=Andrew |last=Heathcode}}</ref> In 2015 ''BRW'' Rich 200, Packer's net worth was assessed at A$6.08&nbsp;billion, making him the seventh-richest Australian.<ref name="brw2015"/>

In January 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that due to ongoing financial problems, Packer's wealth dropped to under A$3&nbsp;billion; also reporting that Packer listed for sale his Mangusta yacht and delayed the purchase of a Boeing business jet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24926608-5001021,00.html |title=James Packer's shrinking funds |author1=Leys, Nick |author2=Miranda, Charles |date=18 January 2009 |work=The Sunday Telegraph}}</ref> Yet by mid-2010, it was reported that Packer owned a number of assets including ''Ellerston Z'' (a [[superyacht]]), ''Arctic P'' (a luxury cruise ship and former ice-breaker), a private jet, a 12-seater [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopter, and a variety of cars.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/executive-style/luxury/pastimes-paid-for-by-the-planet-20100614-y6xb.html |work=The Age |date=12 June 2010 |author=Hornery, Andrew |title=Pastimes paid for by the planet |accessdate=10 October 2011 }}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
James Packer is the founder and engineer of both the Packer Family Foundation and Crown Resorts Foundation. In July 2014, the Foundations launched their $200 million National Philanthropic Fund which is one of Australia's largest philanthropic commitments.<ref>{{cite web | title=Crown Resorts | website=Crown Resorts | url=http://crownresorts.com.au/crown-resorts-foundation/$200m-national-philanthropic-fund | access-date=26 August 2018}}</ref>

According to the two foundations, they are working together to promote Indigenous education opportunities, the arts and culture, and partnerships with organisations that encourage and foster social cohesion. Underlying these priorities are learning, accessibility and engagement outcomes for young Australians – staying engaged with school and learning is the key to long-term positive outcomes, and this is the approach and message that the partner organisations are delivering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crownresorts.com.au/CrownResorts/files/f0/f0d746fb-1836-4983-a859-0f3f42166c67.pdf|title=Crown Resorts And Packer Family Foundations' National Philanthropic Fund|website=crownresorts.com.au|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>
