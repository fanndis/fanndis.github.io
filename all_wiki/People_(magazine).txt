''People'' is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming the "World's Most Beautiful", "Best & Worst Dressed", and "Sexiest Man Alive".  The magazine's headquarters are in New York City, and it maintains editorial bureaus in Los Angeles and in London. For economic reasons, it closed bureaus in [[Austin]], [[Miami]], and [[Chicago]] in 2006.<ref name="variety" /><ref name="twp" />

==History==
The concept for ''People'' has been attributed to [[Andrew Heiskell]], Time Inc.'s chief executive officer at the time and the former publisher of the weekly [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. "Dick" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. "Dick" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Stolley characterized the magazine as "getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut on February 25, 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name="variety" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).
           
The core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and [[Ronald B. Scott]] (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist [[Bernard Waber]], author, and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joyce Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.

In 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Español]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm "Grad Named Head of ''People en Español''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}. Tufts University. February 29, 2004.</ref> Although the original idea was that Spanish-language translations of articles from the English magazine would comprise half the content, ''People en Español'' over time came to have entirely original content.

In 2002, ''People'' introduced ''People Stylewatch'', a title focusing on celebrity style, [[fashion]], and beauty – a newsstand extension of its Stylewatch column. Due to its success, the frequency of ''People Stylewatch'' was increased to 10 times per year in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In spring 2017, People Stylewatch was rebranded as PeopleStyle. In late 2017, it was announced that there would no longer be a print version of PeopleStyle and it would be a digital-only publication.

In Australia, the localized version of ''People'' is titled ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' since there was already another magazine published under the title ''[[People (Australian magazine)|People]]''. The international edition of ''People'' has been published in Greece since 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

On July 26, 2013, Outlook Group announced that it was closing down the Indian edition of ''People'', which began publication in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestmediainfo.com/2013/07/outlook-to-close-down-international-titles-people-geo-and-marie-claire/ |title=Outlook to close down international titles - People, Geo and Marie Claire |publisher=Best Media Info |date=July 26, 2013 |access-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Nikhil Pahwa |url=http://www.medianama.com/2013/07/223-on-the-state-of-the-magazine-industry-in-india-outlook-shuts-three-magazines/ |title=On The State Of The Magazine Industry In India; Outlook Shuts Three Magazines |publisher=MediaNama |date=July 29, 2013 |access-date=March 16, 2014}}</ref>

In September 2016, in collaboration with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', ''People'' launched the People/Entertainment Weekly Network. The "free, ad-supported online-video network{{nbsp}}... covering celebrities, pop culture, lifestyle and human-interest stories", was rebranded as PeopleTV in September 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/peopletv-time-inc-celeb-entertainment-ott-network-1202558733/|title=‘PeopleTV’ Is New Name of Time Inc.’s Celeb and Entertainment Online Network|last=Spangler|first=Todd|work=Variety|access-date=April 12, 2018}}</ref>

In December 2016, [[LaTavia Roberson]] engaged in a feud with ''People'' after alleging they misquoted and misrepresented her interview online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/music/latavia-roberson-miscarriage-memoir-i-am-latavia-cover/|title=Destiny's Child Alum LaTavia Roberson Opens Up About Heartbreaking Miscarriage: 'Her Spirit Has Guided Me'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Former Destiny's Child Member LaTavia Roberson Has a Bone to Pick With People Magazine|url=http://www.bet.com/music/2016/12/28/former-destiny-s-child-member-latavia-roberson.html|website=BET.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ousted Destiny's Child Member LaTavia Roberson Is Pretty Pissed About An Interview She Gave|url=http://www.oxygen.com/very-real/ousted-destinys-child-member-latavia-roberson-is-pretty-pissed-about-an-interview-she-gave|work=Oxygen|date=December 29, 2016}}</ref>

In 1998, the magazine introduced a version targeted at [[adolescence|teens]], called ''Teen People''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tweens, Teens, and Magazines|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tweens-teens-and-magazines-fact-sheet.pdf|publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation|access-date=August 19, 2015|date=January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208234750/https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tweens-teens-and-magazines-fact-sheet.pdf|archive-date=December 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, on July 27, 2006, the company announced that it would shut down publication of ''Teen People'' immediately. The last issue to be released was scheduled for September 2006.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/business/media/26mag.html "Teen People magazine closes, but website will still continue"]. ''The New York Times''. July 26, 2006.</ref>  In exchange, subscribers to this magazine received ''Entertainment Weekly'' for the rest of their subscriptions. There were numerous reasons cited for the publication shutdown, including a downfall in ad pages, competition from both other teen-oriented magazines and the internet, and a decrease in circulation numbers.<ref name="medialifemagazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6217.asp|title=''Medialifemagazine.com''.|publisher=Medialifemagazine.com|date=July 26, 2006|access-date=January 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016145206/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6217.asp|archive-date=October 16, 2006}}</ref> Teenpeople.com was merged into People.com in April 2007. People.com will "carry teen-focused stories that are branded as TeenPeople.com," Mark Golin, the editor of People.com explained.

===Competition for celebrity photos===
In a July 2006 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' article, [[Janice Min]], ''[[Us Weekly]]'' [[editor-in-chief]], blamed ''People'' for the increase in cost to publishers of celebrity photos:
{{Quote|1=They are among the largest spenders of celebrity photos in the industry....One of the first things they ever did, that led to the jacking up of photo prices, was to pay $75,000 to buy pictures of [[Jennifer Lopez]] reading ''Us'' magazine, so ''Us Weekly'' couldn't buy them.

That was the watershed moment that kicked off high photo prices in my mind. I had never seen anything like it. But they saw a competitor come along, and responded. It was a business move, and probably a smart one.<ref name="variety"/>}} 
''People'' reportedly paid $4.1 million for photos of newborn Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, the child of [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brad Pitt]].<ref name="variety" /> The photos set a single-day traffic record for their website, attracting 26.5 million page views.<ref name="variety" />

===Sexiest Man Alive=== 
The annual feature the "Sexiest Man Alive" is billed as a benchmark of male [[physical attractiveness|attractiveness]] and typically includes only [[bankable star|famous people]] and [[A list|celebrities]]. It is determined using a procedure similar to the procedure used for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]. The origin of the title was a discussion on a planned story on [[Mel Gibson]]. Someone exclaimed, "Oh my God, he is the sexiest man alive!" And someone else said, "You should use that as a cover line."<ref>{{cite news| last1=Argetsinger| first1=Amy| last2=Roberts| first2=Roxanne| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/19/AR2007111900024.html| title=Matt Damon??!!!

For the first decade or so, the feature appeared at uneven intervals. Originally awarded in the wintertime, it shifted around the calendar, resulting in gaps as short as seven months and as long as a year and a half, with no selection at all during 1994 (21 years later the magazine did select [[Keanu Reeves]] to fill the 1994 gap, with runners-up including [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Jim Carrey]]). Since 1997, the dates have settled between mid-November and early December.

Dates of magazine issues, winners, ages of winners at the time of selection, and pertinent comments are listed below.

{{As of|2020}}, [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Patrick Swayze]] are the only winners to have died. Kennedy and David Beckham are the only non-entertainers to have won the accolade.

=== People Magazine Yearbook ===
People Magazine Yearbook is an annual publication released by publishers of People Magazine, currently Meredith Corporation<ref name=":0" />. The Yearbook broadly covers all the major events that happened in the year that it covers. This includes socially relevant news events that made headlines around the world in general but more specifically in the United States. Besides the news headlines, it covers celebrity weddings, splits/divorces, births and deaths, and also scandalous events that generated a lot of news when they happened. Over the years, it has covered headlining events in the world of Music (Grammy Awards), Movies (Oscar Awards, The Golden Globe Awards), and Television (Emmy Awards) in a bite sized recap of the event and the award winners. The Yearbook has had the year (say, 2010) written in Bold on the front cover since 1995<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 1995|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Home Entertainment|year=1995|isbn=1-883013-04-6|location=New York}}</ref>, although this has gradually changed in the more recent editions. The year now usually appears in a more inconspicuous way on the front cover, and it also appears on the spine.

==== Early Years ====
The People Magazine Yearbook was first published in the Year 1991 by The Time Inc. Magazine Company and it was called "Private Lives"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Private Lives|publisher=Oxmoor Hourse, The Time Inc. Magazine Company|year=1991|isbn=0-8487-1024-X|location=New York}}</ref>. This issue did not mention any year conspicuously on the front page or the inner page but the front flap of the hardcover version of the magazine described Private Lives as "''People's'' chronicle of an extraordinary year - 1990", clearly describing that the events covered inside are from 1990. Next Year, the 1992 sequel to Private Lives was published and it was called "Private Lives Volume II"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Private Lives Volume II|publisher=Oxmoor House, The Time Inc. Magazine Company|year=1992|isbn=0-8487-1114-9|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref>. The first page had an additional tagline that described the magazine as The Year in Review: 1991 Private Lives. In 1993, there was another change in the publication and also its cover title. The year was added on the cover for the first time and this annual issue was called "Private Lives 1993"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Private Lives 1993|publisher=People Books, Time Inc.|year=1993|isbn=1-883013-00-3|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref>. The Year appeared in Bold on the front cover. The first page described the publication as Private Lives The Year in Review: 1992. Next year, in 1994, People Books released Private Lives 1994<ref>{{Cite book|title=Private Lives 1994|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Home Entertainment|year=1994|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref> with the first page that said Private Lives Year in Review: 1993. The year 1995 ushered in the single biggest change in the magazine title. It was called "People Yearbook 1995"<ref name=":1" />. Previous title of Private Lives was dropped completely and the publication was defined as a "yearbook" for the first time.

==== Changes over the Years ====
In all the years since its inception, People Magazine Yearbook has covered events from the previous year and not the year on the front cover, and this is true even from the time period when it was called Private Lives. For example, People Magazine Yearbook 2008 covered events of 2007<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2008|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Home Entertainment|year=2007|isbn=1-933821-16-7|location=New York}}</ref>. And People Magazine Yearbook 1998 covered the events of the Year 1997<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 1998|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Home Entertainment|year=1998|isbn=1-883013-27-5|location=New York}}</ref>. 2014 was the last year for this to happen. The 2014 yearbook covered events of 2013<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2014!|publisher=People Books, Time Home Entertainment Inc.|year=2013|isbn=978-1618930620|location=New York}}</ref>. In 2015, a shift happened in the magazine that changed for the first time the year it actually covered within its pages. Instead of covering the events of 2014, this issue covered the events of 2015 and arrived on the stands towards the end of 2015<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2015|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Books|year=2015|location=New York|pages=1}}</ref>. To make the shift properly understood, the first page of this yearbook included a tagline "The Most Memorable Moments of 2015". With this move, People Magazine Yearbook changed its own 25-year-old tradition. This shift, however, resulted in the year 2014 never being covered by the People Magazine Yearbook and 2014 became the only year not to be covered since its inception in 1991. Since then, the People Magazine Yearbook has been covering events of the same year that are on the Front Page. Another typeface change was experimented for two years when People Magazine Yearbook 2013!<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2013!|publisher=People Books, Time Home Entertainment Inc.|year=2012|isbn=1-61893-016-8|location=New York}}</ref> and People Magazine Yearbook 2014!<ref name=":2" /> had an exclamation mark following the year. This was dropped in the 2015 Yearbook and the publication discarded the exclamation mark. However, this issue dropped the Bold writing of the year on the front page and replaced it with a more inconspicuous style and it's been like that to the present<ref name=":3" />. The 2016 Yearbook was a special "flip cover" issue wherein it combined a special edition memorabilia to cherish the memories of people that passed away in 2016<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2016|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Books|year=2016|location=New York}}</ref>. The list included Prince, David Bowie, Nancy Reagan, Alan Rickman, Doris Roberts, Muhammad Ali etc. The special edition could be accessed by flipping over the magazine. In November 2017, Meredith Corporation announced that it would acquire Time Inc. for $2.8 billion<ref>{{Cite web|date=Nov 6, 2018|title=Here’s a timeline of Meredith’s purchase of Time Inc. and what’s been happening|url=http://www.fipp.com/news/timeline-merediths-purchase-time-inc/}}</ref>. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2018<ref>{{Cite web|date=Jan 31, 2018|title=Meredith Corporation Announces Completion Of Time Inc. Acquisition And Reports Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter And First Half Results|url=https://ir.meredith.com/news-releases/press-release-details/2018/Meredith-Corporation-Announces-Completion-Of-Time-Inc-Acquisition-And-Reports-Fiscal-2018-Second-Quarter-And-First-Half-Results/default.aspx}}</ref>. Time Magazine, People Magazine and also People Magazine Yearbook are now published by Meredith Corporation. The copyright of the 2018 Yearbook was described as belonging to Time Inc. Books, a division of Meredith Corporation and published by People Books, an imprint of Time Books<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2018|publisher=People Books, Time Inc. Books|year=2018|isbn=978-1547847983|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Butan|first=Christina|date=Dec 7, 2018|title=Celebrate the Best and Most Memorable Moments of 2018 With PEOPLE's Yearbook Special Edition|url=https://people.com/celebrity/people-celebrates-2018-special-yearbook-edition/}}</ref>. However, in the 2019 Yearbook, the copyright was described as belonging to Meredith Corporation<ref>{{Cite book|title=People Yearbook 2019|publisher=People Books, Meredith Corporation|year=2019|location=New York}}</ref>.
