== Ethnicity ==
{{See also|List of ethnic groups in Nigeria}}
Nigerians come from multiple ethnic and religious backgrounds as the founding of Nigeria was the result of a colonial creation by the [[British Empire]] that correlated not with ethnic and religious boundaries.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233"/>

== History ==
{{Further|History of Nigeria}}
There have been several major historical states in Nigeria that have influenced Nigerian society via their kings and their legal and taxation systems, and the use of religion to legitimize the power of the king and to unite the people.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16">Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. pp. 15-16.</ref> Northern Nigeria has been culturally influenced by Islamic influence including several major historic Islamic states in the region.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/> The [[Kanem-Bornu Empire]] and the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] were major historical Islamic states in northern Nigeria.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/> Southern Nigeria historically held several powerful states, including the [[Benin Empire]] and [[Oyo Empire]], Ife Confederacy and several other Yoruba states.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 15-16"/>

== Culture ==
Nigerian culture was profoundly affected by the British [[Colonialism|colonial rule]].<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18">Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 18.</ref> Such as British colonial authorities' denouncements and attacks upon [[polygamy]], trial by ordeal, and certain types of sacrifices.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/> At the same time, British colonial authorities maintained and promoted traditional Nigerian culture that strengthened colonial administration.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/> The British spread Christianity throughout southern Nigeria and Christian missionaries assisted British authorities in establishing a [[Western world|Western]]-style education system in Nigeria that resulted in the teaching of the English language in Nigeria and its subsequent adoption as Nigeria's main language.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/> The British replaced unpaid household labour with [[wage labour]].<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 18"/> Prior to colonization in the twentieth century, Nigeria's tribes usually [[Land tenure|possessed the land]] as a community, such that land could not be bought or sold.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" /> Colonization brought the notion of individuals owning land and commercialization of land began.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" />

In Nigeria, seventy percent of Nigerians live in villages of two types: the first type used by the Igbo and Tiv involves a collection of dispersed compounds, the second type used amongst the Hausa fulani, Yoruba, and Kanuri involves nucleii of compounds.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6">Toyin Falola. ''Culture and Customs of Nigeria''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Greenwood Press, 2001. p. 6.</ref> These villages compose members of the ethnicity-related through ancestry as well as strangers who have been assimilated into the ethnicity.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6" /> Since the time prior to colonization to the present it has been common practice of Nigeria's tribes to adopt strangers into the tribes.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 4" /> A male elder commonly serves as a village chief.<ref name="Toyin Falola 2001. pp. 6" />

In Nigeria's large cities, there is substantial [[intermingling]] of Nigerians with foreigners, especially Europeans, [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], and [[Indian people|Indians]].<ref name="Toyin Fall 2001. pp. 8" /> The economic importance of Nigeria's cities has resulted in migrations of people from their traditional ethnic or cultural homeland to cities outside those territories.<ref name="Toyin Fall 2001. pp. 8" /> Igbo, Hausa Fulani and Ibibio people have commonly migrated to [[Lagos]] and many southerners migrate to the north to trade or work while a number of northerner seasonal workers and small-scale entrepreneurs go to the south.<ref name="Toyin Fall 2001. pp. 8" />

== Religion ==
{{Further|Religion in Nigeria}}

* [[Islam|Muslim]] 47.6%<ref name=":0" />
* [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] 11.2%<ref name=":0" />
* Other [[Christianity|Christian]] 34.7%<ref name=":0" />
* Traditionalist 5.9%<ref name=":0" />
* Unspecified 0.5%<ref name=":0" />

== Sectarianism ==
Ethnic, religious, and regional disputes and tensions have commonly divided Nigerians on political issues.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 111">April A. Gordon. ''Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook''. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 111.</ref> In particular, cultural and political divisions between the [[Islam|Muslim]] north and the [[Christianity|Christian]] south has politicized religion and caused significant political disputes in Nigeria.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 111" /> Ethnic-motivated and religious-motivated violence by extremists has increased these tensions as well.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" />

However, despite instances of extremism, most Nigerians continue to peacefully coexist, and a common Nigerian identity has been fostered amongst the more-educated and affluent Nigerians as well as with the many Nigerians who leave small homogeneous ethnic communities to seek economic opportunities in the cities where the population is ethnically mixed.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /> Although there are cultural divisions amongst Nigerians, the English language is commonly used as their primary language.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /> Also, most Nigerians share a strong commitment to individual liberties and democracy.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /> Even during periods of military rule, such military governments were pressured to maintain democratic stances by the Nigerian people.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" /> Nigeria's political figures commonly know multiple indigenous languages outside their own indigenous language.<ref name="April A. Gordon 2003. pp. 233" />
