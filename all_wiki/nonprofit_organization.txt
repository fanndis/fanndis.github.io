A nonprofit is subject to the [[Contract failure#Non-Distribution Constraint|non-distribution constraint]]: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties. A wide array of organizations are nonprofit, including most political organizations, schools, business associations, churches, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. Nonprofit entities generally seek approval from governments to be [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]], and some may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions. But an entity may [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] as a nonprofit entity without securing tax-exempt status. 

The key aspects of nonprofits are accountability, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. For a nonprofit that seeks to finance its operations through donations, public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. The more nonprofits focus on their mission, the more public confidence they will have, and as a result, more money for the organization.<ref name = ciconte/> The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public's confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are.

==Statistics in the United States==

According to the [[National Center for Charitable Statistics]] (NCCS), there are more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered in the United States, including [[Charitable organization|public charities]], [[private foundation]]s, and other nonprofit organizations. Private charitable contributions increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2017 (since 2014), at an estimated $410.02 billion. Out of these contributions, religious organizations received 30.9%, education organizations received 14.3%, and human services organizations received 12.1%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nccs.urban.org/publication/nonprofit-sector-brief-2018#giving |title=The Nonprofit Sector in Brief 2018: Public Charities, Giving, and Volunteering |last=McKeever |first=Brice S. |date=November 2018 |accessdate=24 April 2020 |publisher=Urban Institute National Center for Charitable Statistics}}</ref> Between September 2010 and September 2014, approximately 25.3% of Americans over the age of 16 volunteered for a nonprofit.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://nccs.urban.org/data-statistics/quick-facts-about-nonprofits|title = Quick Facts About Nonprofits|work = National Center for Charitable Statistics|publisher = Urban Institute|access-date = 12 December 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218131455/http://nccs.urban.org/data-statistics/quick-facts-about-nonprofits|archive-date = 18 December 2017|url-status = dead}}</ref>

== Mechanism of money-raising ==
Nonprofits are not driven by generating profit, but they must bring in enough income to pursue their social goals. Nonprofits are able to raise money in different ways. This includes income from donations from individual donors or foundations; sponsorship from corporations; government funding; programs, services or merchandise sales; and investments.<ref>Sacristán López de los Mozos, I., Rodríguez Duarte, A., & Rodríguez Ruiz, Ó. (2016). Resource dependence in non-profit organizations: is it harder to fundraise if you diversify your revenue structure?. ''Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary & Nonprofit Organizations'', 27(6), 2641–2665.</ref> Each NPO is unique in which source of income works best for them. With an increase in NPO's within the last decade, organizations have adopted competitive advantages to create revenue for themselves to remain financially stable. Donations from private individuals or organizations can change each year and government grants have diminished. With changes in funding from year to year, many nonprofit organizations have been moving toward increasing the diversity of their funding sources. For example, many nonprofits that have relied on government grants have started fundraising efforts to appeal to individual donors.

=== Challenges ===
NPO's challenges primarily stem from lack of funding. Funding can either come from within the organization, fundraising, donations, or from the federal government. When cutbacks are made from the federal government, the organization suffers from devolution. This term describes when there is a shift of responsibility from a central government to a local, sub-national authority. The shift is due to the loss of funds; therefore, resulting in changes of responsibilities in running programs. Because of this frequent challenge, management must be innovative and effective in the pursuit of success.

== Nonprofit vs. not-for-profit ==
{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=July 2019}}

Nonprofit and not-for-profit are terms that are used similarly, but do not mean the same thing. Both are organizations that do not make a profit, but may receive an income to sustain their missions. The income that nonprofit and not-for-profit organizations generate is used differently. Nonprofit organizations return any extra income to the organization. Not-for-profits use their excess money to pay their members who do work for them. Another difference between nonprofit organizations and not-for-profit organizations is their membership. Nonprofits have volunteers or employees who do not receive any money from the organization's fundraising efforts. They may earn a salary for their work that is independent from the money the organization has fundraised. Not-for-profit members have the opportunity to benefit from the organization's fundraising efforts.<ref name=":1" />

In the United States, both nonprofits and not-for-profits are tax-exempt under IRS publication 557. Although they are both tax-exempt, each organization faces different tax code requirements. A nonprofit is tax-exempt under [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] requirements if it is either a religious, charitable, or educational based organization that does not influence state and federal legislation. Not-for-profits are tax-exempt under [[501(c)(7)]] requirements if they are an organization for pleasure, recreation or another nonprofit purpose.<ref name=":1">Burgess, M. (26 October 2017) What is the difference between nonprofit & not for profit?. Retrieved from https://bizfluent.com/info-7991949-difference-between-nonprofit-not-profit.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212193242/https://bizfluent.com/info-7991949-difference-between-nonprofit-not-profit.html |date=12 December 2017 }}</ref>

Nonprofits are either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving nonprofit organizations create a benefit for the members of their organization and can include but are not limited to credit unions, sports clubs, and advocacy groups. Community-serving nonprofit organizations focus on providing services to the community either globally or locally. Community-serving nonprofits include organizations that deliver aid and development programs, medical research, education, and health services. It is possible for a nonprofit to be both member-serving and community-serving.

==Management==

A common misconception about nonprofits is that they are run completely by volunteers. Most nonprofits have staff that work for the company, possibly using volunteers to perform the nonprofit's services under the direction of the paid staff. Nonprofits must be careful to balance the salaries paid to staff against the money paid to provide services to the nonprofit's beneficiaries. Organizations whose salary expenses are too high relative to their program expenses may face regulatory scrutiny.<ref>Simkovich, D. (2017). How to Run a Non-Profit Organization. Retrieved from http://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-nonprofit-organization-4133.html {{dead link|date=August 2018}}</ref>

A second misconception is that nonprofit organizations may not make a profit. Although the goal of nonprofits isn't specifically to maximize profits, they still have to operate as a fiscally responsible business. They must manage their income (both grants and donations and income from services) and expenses so as to remain a fiscally viable entity. Nonprofits have the responsibility of focusing on being professional, financially responsible, replacing self-interest and [[profit motive]] with mission motive.<ref>Anheier, K. H. (2005). ''Nonprofit Organizations: An Introduction.'' New York, NY: Routledge.</ref>

Though nonprofits are managed differently from for-profit businesses, they have felt pressure to be more businesslike. To combat private and public business growth in the public service industry, nonprofits have modeled their business management and mission, shifting their raison d’être to establish sustainability and growth.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0899764006295996| title=An Investigation of Innovation in Nonprofit Organizations: The Role of Organizational Mission| journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly| volume=36| issue=2| pages=256–281| year=2007| last1=McDonald| first1=Robert E.| s2cid=144378017}}</ref>

Setting effective missions is a key for the successful management of nonprofit organizations.<ref name=":0" /> There are three important conditions for effective mission: opportunity, competence, and commitment.<ref name=":0" />

One way of managing the sustainability of nonprofit organizations is to establish strong relations with donor groups.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Managing the Non-profit Organization: Principles and Practices|last=Drucker|first=Peter|publisher=HarperBusiness|year=2006|isbn=978-0060851149|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/managingnonprofi0000druc}}</ref> This requires a donor marketing strategy, something many nonprofits lack.<ref name=":0" />

==Functions==
NPOs have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. For legal classification, there are, nevertheless, some elements of importance:
* Management provisions
* Accountability and auditing provisions
* Provisory for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation
* Provisions for the dissolution of the entity
* Tax statuses of corporate and private donors
* Tax status of the founders.

Some of the above must be (in most jurisdictions in the [[United States|USA]] at least) expressed in the organization's charter of establishment or constitution. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.

While affiliations will not affect a legal status, they may be taken into consideration by legal proceedings as an indication of purpose. Most countries have laws that regulate the establishment and management of NPOs and that require compliance with [[corporate governance]] regimes. Most larger organizations are required to publish their financial reports detailing their income and expenditure publicly.

In many aspects, they are similar to corporate [[business entity|business entities]] though there are often significant differences. Both not-for-profit and [[for-profit]] corporate entities must have board members, steering-committee members, or trustees who owe the organization a [[fiduciary duty]] of loyalty and trust. A notable exception to this involves [[Church (building)|churches]], which are often not required to disclose finances to anyone, including church members. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ansberger|first=Paul|date=2008|title=A History of the Tax-Exempt Sector: An SOI Perspective|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/tehistory.pdf|journal=Statistics of Income Bulletin|volume=Winter 2008|pages=105–135|via=IRS}}</ref>

===Formation and structure===
In the [[United States]], nonprofit organizations are formed by filing bylaws or [[articles of incorporation]] or both in the state in which they expect to operate. The act of incorporation creates a legal entity enabling the organization to be treated as a distinct body (corporation) by law and to enter into business dealings, form contracts, and own property as individuals or for-profit corporations can.

Nonprofits can have members, but many do not. The nonprofit may also be a [[Trust law|trust]] or [[Voluntary association|association]] of members. The organization may be controlled by its members who elect the [[board of directors]], [[board of governors]] or board of [[trustee]]s. A nonprofit may have a delegate structure to allow for the representation of groups or corporations as members. Alternatively, it may be a non-membership organization and the board of directors may elect its own successors.

The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and [[board-only]]. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as 'members'; examples of such organizations are [[FairVote]]<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/?page=6 FairVote – Board of Directors<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030044259/http://fairvote.org/?page=6 |date=30 October 2008 }}.</ref><ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/?page=168 FairVote – FAQs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023121012/http://www.fairvote.org/?page=168 |date=23 October 2008 }}.</ref> and the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]].<ref>[http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=3416 NORML Board of Directors – NORML<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030033542/http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=3416 |date=30 October 2008 }}.</ref> The [[Model Nonprofit Corporation Act]] imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Convert Taxes into Profits: Professional Guide for Non Profit Organizations|publisher=International Business Publications|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I9zBptuV1-wC&q=The+Model+Nonprofit+Corporation+Act+imposes+many+complexities+and+requirements+on+membership+decision-making&pg=PA12|accessdate=28 October 2014|isbn=9781438722160|date=20 March 2009}}</ref> Accordingly, many organizations, such as the [[Wikimedia Foundation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_bylaws#ARTICLE_III_-_MEMBERSHIP |title=Bylaws |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |date=14 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> have formed board-only structures. The [[National Association of Parliamentarians]] has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to [[market discipline]] for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as the election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=ABA Code Revision Raises Concerns for Democracy and Parliamentary Law in Nonprofits|author1=Malamut, Michael E.  |author2=Blach, Thomas J.  |name-list-style=amp |publisher=National Parliamentarian, Volume 69, No. 1 |year=2008 }}</ref><ref>''Charity on Trial: What You Need to Know Before You Give'' / Doug White (2007) {{ISBN|1-56980-301-3}}.</ref> A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements.<ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=727363 SSRN-Voluntary Disclosure in Nonprofit Organizations: an Exploratory Study by Bruce Behn, Delwyn DeVries, Jing Lin<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to members and directors is concerned.

===Tax exemption===
In many countries, nonprofits may apply for [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status, so that the organization itself may be exempt from income tax and other taxes. In the United States, to be exempt from federal income taxes, the organization must meet the requirements set forth in the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while granting tax-exempt designation (such as 501(c)(3)) is granted by the federal government via the IRS. This means that not all nonprofits are eligible to be tax-exempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Applying-for-Tax-Exemption |title=Applying for Exemption – Difference Between Nonprofit and Tax-Exempt Status |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=18 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016211718/http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Applying-for-Tax-Exemption |archivedate=16 October 2012 }}</ref> NPOs use the model of a [[double bottom line]] in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization's sustainability.<ref>The Nonprofit Handbook: Everything You Need to Know to Start and Run Your Nonprofit Organization (Paperback), Gary M.

==By jurisdiction==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], nonprofit organizations include trade unions, charitable entities, co-operatives, universities and hospitals, mutual societies, grass-root and support groups, political parties, religious groups, incorporated associations, not-for-profit companies, [[trusts]] and more. Furthermore, they operate across a multitude of domains and industries, from health, employment, disability and other human services to local sporting clubs, credit unions, and research institutes.<ref>{{cite book|last = Lyons|first= Mark|date = 2001|title = Third Sector: The contribution of nonprofit and cooperative enterprise in Australia|publisher = Allen & Unwin|isbn=  9781864487428}}</ref> A nonprofit organization in Australia can choose from a number of legal forms depending on the needs and activities of the organization: co-operative, company limited by guarantee, unincorporated association, incorporated association (by the Associations Incorporation Act 1985) or incorporated association or council (by the Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/management/view_help_sheet.do?articleid=2099 |title=Legal structures of nonprofit organizations in Australia |publisher=Ourcommunity.com.au |accessdate=30 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222051633/http://www.ourcommunity.com.au/management/view_help_sheet.do?articleid=2099 |archive-date=22 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From an academic perspective, [[social enterprise]] is, for the most part, considered a sub-set of the nonprofit sector as typically they too are concerned with a purpose relating to a public good. However, these are not bound to adhere to a nonprofit legal structure, and many incorporate and operate as for-profit entities.

In Australia, nonprofit organizations are primarily established in one of three ways: companies limited by guarantee, trusts, and incorporated associations. However, the incorporated association form is typically used by organizations intending to operate only within one Australian state jurisdiction. Nonprofit organizations seeking to establish a presence across [[Australia]] typically consider incorporating as a company or as a trust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/%5BA4ID%5D%20AustraliaNon-ProfitLawLegalGuide.pdf |last1=Ford |first1=David |last2=Ford |first2=Emil |title=Guide to establishing non-profit organisations in Australia |accessdate=14 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328101743/http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/%5BA4ID%5D%20AustraliaNon-ProfitLawLegalGuide.pdf |archivedate=28 March 2014 |publisher=Advocates for International Development |date=August 2012 }}</ref>

=== Belgium ===
By Belgian law, there are several kinds of nonprofit organization:
* Non-profit membership associations'', called ''[[Vereniging zonder winstoogmerk]]'' (abbreviated ''vzw'') in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]), or ''Association sans but lucratif'' (abbreviated ''asbl'') in [[French language|French]], or ''Vereinigung ohne Gewinnerzielungsabsicht'' in [[German language|German]]
* ''[[Association without lucrative purpose|Internationale vereniging zonder winstoogmerk]]'' (Dutch, often abbreviated ''[[ivzw]]'') or ''[[Association internationale sans but lucratif]]'' (French, often abbreviated ''[[aisbl]]'') for international nonprofit organizations.
* ''Stichting van openbaar nut'' (Dutch, abbreviated ''son'') or ''Fondation d’utilités publique'' (French, abbreviated ''fup''); a non-membership organization for the common good.
These three kinds of nonprofit organizations contrast to a fourth:
* ''Feitelijke vereniging'' (Dutch) or ''Association de fait'' (French), an informal organization, often started for a short-term project, or managed alongside another NPO that does not have any status in law so cannot purchase property etc. (association sans personnalité morale).

=== Canada ===
[[Canada]] allows nonprofit organizations to be incorporated or unincorporated. They may incorporate either federally, under Part II of the [[Canada Business Corporations Act]], or under provincial legislation. Many of the governing Acts for Canadian nonprofits date to the early 1900s, meaning that nonprofit legislation has not kept pace with legislation that governs for-profit corporations, particularly with regards to [[corporate governance]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Federal, and in some provinces (including [[Ontario]]), incorporation is by way of [[Letters Patent]], and any change to the Letters Patent (even a simple name change) requires formal approval by the appropriate government, as do bylaw changes. Other provinces (including [[Alberta]]) permit incorporation ''as of right'', by the filing of Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Association.

During 2009, the federal government enacted new legislation repealing the Canada Corporations Act, Part II – the ''Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act''. This Act was last amended on 10 October 2011, and the act was current until 4 March 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-7.75/page-1.html |title=Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act |publisher=Status of Canada |accessdate=22 March 2013}}</ref> It allows for incorporation ''as of right'', by Articles of Incorporation; does away with the ''[[ultra vires]]'' doctrine for nonprofits; establishes them as legal persons; and substantially updates the governance provisions for nonprofits. Ontario also overhauled its legislation, adopting the ''Ontario Not-for-Profit Corporations Act'' during 2010; the new Act is expected to be in effect as of 1 July 2013.

Canada also permits a variety of charities (including public and private foundations). Charitable status is granted by the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] (CRA) upon application by a nonprofit; charities are allowed to issue income tax receipts to donors, must spend a certain percentage of their assets (including cash, investments, and fixed assets) and file annual reports in order to maintain their charitable status. In determining whether an organization can become a charity, CRA applies a [[common law]] test to its stated objects and activities. These must be:
* The relief of poverty
* The advancement of education
* The advancement of religion, or
* Certain other purposes that benefit the community in a way the courts have said is charitable<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/cpc/wtc-eng.html |title=Charities and Giving; What is Charitable |publisher=Canada Revenue Agency |accessdate=28 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315133346/http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/cpc/wtc-eng.html |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Charities are not permitted to engage in partisan political activity; doing so may result in the revocation of charitable status. However, a charity can carry out a small number of political activities that are non-partisan, help further the charities' purposes, and subordinate to the charity's charitable purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/vdgllry/chrts-gvng/pltclctvts-eng.html|title=Charities and Giving – Charities Information webinars – Political Activities|accessdate=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226195025/http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/vdgllry/chrts-gvng/pltclctvts-eng.html|archive-date=26 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===France===
<!-- Courtesy note: [[Association loi de 1901]] links here as {{R to section}} -->
In [[France]], nonprofits are called ''associations''. They are based on a law enacted 1 July 1901. As a consequence, the nonprofits are also called ''association loi 1901''.

A nonprofit can be created by two people to accomplish a common goal. The ''association'' can have industrial or commercial activities or both, but the members cannot make any profit from the activities. Thereby, worker's unions and political parties can be organized from this law.

In 2008, the [[National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies]] (INSEE) counted more than a million of these ''associations'' in the country, and about 16 million people older than 16 are members of a nonprofit in France (a third of the population over 16 years old). The nonprofits employ 1.6 million people, and 8 million are volunteers for them.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1327 |title =Vie associative : 16 millions d'adhérents en 2008|website = [[INSEE]]|date = December 2010|language = French}}</ref>

This law is also relevant in many [[French colonial empire|former French colonies]], particularly in [[Africa]].

=== Hong Kong ===
The [[Hong Kong]] Company Registry provides a memorandum of procedure for applying to Registrar of Companies for a Licence under Section 21 of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32) for a limited company for the purpose of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity, or any other useful object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forum.hktdc.com/topic/2245/1/en/Non-profit-organisation-in-Hong-Kong.htm|title=HKTDC Forum: Doing Business in Hong Kong – Non profit organisation in Hong Kong|accessdate=14 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509123857/http://forum.hktdc.com/topic/2245/1/en/Non-profit-organisation-in-Hong-Kong.htm|archive-date=9 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://app1.hkicpa.org.hk/APLUS/0704/44.pdf |title=Charities: Tax exemption under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance |date=April 2007 |website=hkicpa.org.hk |publisher=IRD |access-date=1 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011002430/http://app1.hkicpa.org.hk/APLUS/0704/44.pdf |archive-date=11 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== India ===
In [[India]], [[non-governmental organizations]] are the most common type of societal institutions that do not have commercial interests. However, they are not the only category of non-commercial organizations that can gain official recognition. For example, memorial trusts, which honor renowned individuals through social work, may not be considered as NGOs.<ref>{{cite book|title=book keeping and accounting|publisher=govt.of Maharashtra}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

They can be registered in four ways:
* Trust
* Society
* Section-25 company (Section 8 as per the new Companies Act, 2013)
* Special licensing{{vague|date=July 2019}}{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Registration can be with either the Registrar of Companies (RoC) or the Registrar of Societies (RoS).

The following laws or Constitutional Articles of the Republic of India are relevant to the NGOs:
* Articles 19(1)(c) and 30 of the Constitution of India
* Income Tax Act, 1961
* Public Trusts Acts of various states
* Societies Registration Act, 1860
* Section 25 of the Indian Companies Act, 1956 (Section 8 as per the new Companies Act, 2013)
* Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 1976.

=== Republic of Ireland ===
The Irish Nonprofits Database was created by Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange (INKEx) to act as a repository for regulatory and voluntarily disclosed information about Irish public-benefit nonprofits. The database lists more than 10,000 nonprofit organizations in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In 2012 INKEx ceased to operate due to lack of funding.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-nonprofits-knowledge-exchange-database-charities-503576-Jun2012/|title=Non-profit transparency database to close due to lack of funding|last=McLysaght|first=Emer|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=18 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Israel===
In [[Israel]] nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are usually established as registered nonprofit associations (Hebrew ''amutah,'' plural ''amutot'') or public benefit companies (Hebrew ''Chevrah LeTo’elet Hatzibur,'' not to be confused with [[public benefit corporation]]s). The structure of [[financial statements]] of nonprofit organizations is regulated Israel's Accounting Standard No. 5, and must include a [[balance sheet]], a report on activities, the income and expenditure for the particular period, a report on changes in assets, a statement of [[cash flow]]s, and notes to the financial statements. A report showing the level of restriction imposed on the assets and liabilities can be given, though this is not required.

‘'Amutot'’ are regulated by the Associations Law, 1980. An ''amutah'' is a body corporate, though not a company. The ''amutah'' is successor to the Ottoman Society which predated the State of Israel, and was established by the now-superseded Ottoman Societies Law of 1909, based on the French law of 1901. Public benefit companies are governed solely by company law; if their regulations and objectives meet the two conditions specified in Section 345A of the Companies Act, they will in effect be ''amutot'' in all but name.

An ''amutah'' must register with the ''Rasham Ha’amutot'' ('Registrar of Amutot'); a public benefit company must register with the ''Rasham HaChavarot'' [Registrar of Companies]. Both are under the purview of the ''Rashot Hata’agidim'' ('Corporations Authority') of the [[Ministry of Justice (Israel)|Ministry of Justice]].

=== Japan ===
In [[Japan]], an NPO is any citizen's group that serves the public interest and does not produce a profit for its members. NPOs are given corporate status to assist them in conducting business transactions. As at February 2011, there were 41,600 NPOs in Japan. Two hundred NPOs were given tax-deductible status by the government, which meant that only contributions to those organizations were tax deductible for the contributors.<ref>Kamiya, Setsuko, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110222i1.html NPO tax status threatened by Diet split]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 22 February 2011, p. 3.</ref>

=== New Zealand ===

{{main|Incorporated society}}

In [[New Zealand]], nonprofit organizations usually are established as [[incorporated society|incorporated societies]] or [[charitable trust]]s. An incorporated society requires a membership of at least 15{{nbsp}}people.

=== Russia ===
Russian law contains many legal forms of non-commercial organization (NCO), resulting in a complex, often contradictory, and limiting regulatory framework.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ljubownikow|first1=S.|last2=Crotty|first2=J.|title=Civil Society in a Transitional Context: The Response of Health and Educational NGOs to Legislative Changes in Russia's Industrialized Regions|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|date=1 April 2013|volume=43|issue=4|pages=759–776|doi=10.1177/0899764013482396|s2cid=154664612|url=http://pure.aber.ac.uk/ws/files/6044055/Civil_Society_in_a_Transition_Context.pdf}}</ref> The primary requirements are that NCOs, whatever their type, do not have the generation of profit as their main objective and do not distribute any such profit among their participants (Article 50(1), Civil Code). Most commonly there are five forms of NCO:
*Public associations – A public association is the form most comparable to an 'association' as used in international parlance. A public association is a membership-based organization of individuals who associate on the basis of common interests and goals stipulated in the organization's charter.
*[[Foundation (nonprofit)|Foundation]]s – Foundations are property-based, non-membership organizations created by individuals or legal persons (or both) to pursue social, charitable, cultural, educational, or other public benefit goals.
*[[Institution]]s – The institution (uchrezhdeniye) is a form that exists in Russia and several other countries of the former Soviet Union. Like foundations, institutions do not have members. Unlike foundations, however, institutions do not acquire property rights in the property conveyed to them (Article 120, Civil Code, and Article 20, NCO Law). Moreover, the founders are liable for any obligations of the institution that it cannot meet on its own.
*Non-commercial partnerships – A non-commercial partnership (NP) (Article 8, NCO Law) is a membership organization pursuing activities for the mutual benefit of members. Therefore, assets that have been transferred to an NP as donations can be used for purposes other than those having public benefit.
*Autonomous non-commercial organizations – An autonomous non-commercial organization (ANO) (Article 10, NCO Law) is a non-membership organization undertaking services in the field of education, social policy, culture, etc., which in practice often generates income by providing its services for a fee.

=== South Africa ===
In [[South Africa]], certain types of charity may issue a tax certificate when requested, which donors can use to apply for a tax deduction. Charities/NGOs may be established as voluntary associations, trusts or nonprofit companies (NPCs). Voluntary associations are established by agreement under the common law, and trusts are registered by the Master of the High Court.

'''Nonprofit companies''' (NPCs) are registered by the [[Companies and Intellectual Property Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.za/node/727559|title=Register a non-profit company – South African Government|work=gov.za|access-date=17 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811094446/http://www.gov.za/node/727559|archive-date=11 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> All of these may voluntarily register with The Directorate for Nonprofit Organisations and may apply for tax-exempt status to the [[South African Revenue Service]] (SARS).

=== Ukraine ===
In [[Ukraine]], nonprofit organizations include non-governmental organizations, cooperatives (inc. [[housing cooperative]]s), charitable organizations, [[religious organization]]s, political parties, [[List of commodities exchanges|commodities exchanges]] (in Ukraine, commodities exchanges can't be organized for profit) and more. Nonprofit organizations obtain their non-profit status from tax authorities. The state fiscal service is the main registration authority for nonprofit status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/registration-of-non-governmental-organization/|title=Registration of non-governmental organization in Ukraine.|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525063109/http://en.clc.co.ua/registration-of-non-governmental-organization/|archive-date=25 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK a nonprofit organization may take the form of an [[unincorporated association]], a [[charitable trust]], a [[charitable incorporated organisation]] (CIO), a [[company limited by guarantee]] (which may or may not be charitable), a [[Royal charter|charter organization]] (which may or may not be charitable), a [[charitable company]], a [[community interest company]] (CIC) (which may or may not be charitable), a [[community benefit society]] (which may or may not be charitable), or a [[cooperative society]] (which may or may not be charitable). Thus a nonprofit may be charitable (see under [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|Charitable Organisation]]) or not, and may be required to be registered or not.

=== United States ===
{{for|a United States analysis of this issue|501(c) organization|Charitable organization#United States}}

After a nonprofit organization has been formed at the state level, the organization may seek recognition of [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] status with respect to [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax]]. That is done typically by applying to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), although statutory exemptions exist for limited types of nonprofit organization. The IRS, after reviewing the application to ensure the organization meets the conditions to be recognized as a tax-exempt organization (such as the purpose, limitations on spending, and internal safeguards for a charity), may issue an authorization letter to the nonprofit granting it tax-exempt status for income-tax payment, filing, and deductibility purposes. The exemption does not apply to other federal taxes such as employment taxes. Additionally, a tax-exempt organization must pay federal tax on income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/unrelated-business-income-tax|title=Special rules for unrelated business income tax|website=|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> Failure to maintain operations in conformity to the laws may result in the loss of tax-exempt status.

Individual states and localities offer nonprofits exemptions from other taxes such as [[sales tax]] or [[property tax]]. Federal tax-exempt status does not guarantee exemption from state and local taxes and vice versa. These exemptions generally have separate applications, and their requirements may differ from the IRS requirements. Furthermore, even a tax-exempt organization may be required to file annual financial reports ([[IRS Form 990]]) at the state and federal levels. A tax-exempt organization's 990 forms are required to be available for public scrutiny.

==== Governance ====

The board of directors has ultimate control over the organization, but typically an [[executive director]] is hired. In some cases, the board is elected by a membership, but commonly, the board of directors is self-perpetuating. In these '[[board-only]]' organizations, board members nominate new members and vote on their fellow directors' nominations.<ref>Dent, George W., [https://ssrn.com/abstract=2481646 Corporate Governance Without Shareholders: A Cautionary Lesson from Non-Profit Organizations] (2014). Delaware Journal of Corporate Law (DJCL), Vol. 39, No. 1, 2014; Case Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014–34. Available at [[SSRN]]</ref> Part VI Governance, Management, and Disclosure, section A, question 7a of the Form 990 asks 'Did the organization have members, stockholders, or other persons who had the power to elect or appoint one or more members of the governing body?'; the IRS instructions added '(other than the organization's governing body itself, acting in such capacity)'.<ref>[https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990 About Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax].  IRS. Updated: 20 November 2018.  Accessed 15 April 2019</ref>

== Problems ==

=== Founder's syndrome ===
[[Founder's syndrome]] is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Block|first1=Stephen R.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Steven|title=Toward and Understanding of Founder's Syndrome|journal=Nonprofit Management & Leadership|date=Summer 2002|volume=12|issue=4|page=353|doi=10.1002/nml.12403}}</ref>

==== Resource mismanagement ====
Resource mismanagement is a particular problem with NPOs because the employees are not accountable to anyone who has a direct stake in the organization. For example, an employee may start a new program without disclosing its complete liabilities. The employee may be rewarded for improving the NPO's reputation, making other employees happy, and attracting new donors. Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute [[accounting fraud]]. But even indirect liabilities negatively affect the financial sustainability of the NPO, and the NPO will have financial problems unless strict controls are instated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audit Guide for Small Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://www.vscpa.com/content/Visitors/Nonprofit_Resources/Audit_Guide.aspx|access-date=21 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104103321/http://www.vscpa.com/content/Visitors/Nonprofit_Resources/Audit_Guide.aspx|archive-date=4 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Some commenters have argued that the receipt of significant funding from large for-profit corporations can ultimately alter the NPO's functions.<ref>{{cite news|editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Edwards |editor2-first=D. |editor2-last=Hulme |date=2002|title= NGO Performance and Accountability: Introduction and Overview (Chapter 11)|work= The Earthscan Reader on NGO Management|location= UK|publisher= Earthscan Publications Ltd.}}</ref> A frequent measure of an NPO's efficiency is its [[Expense ratio#Nonprofit organizations|expense ratio]] (i.e. expenditures on things other than its programs, divided by its total expenditures).

=== Competition for talent ===
Competition for employees with the public and private sector is another problem that nonprofit organizations inevitably face, particularly for management positions. There are reports of major talent shortages in the nonprofit sector today regarding newly graduated workers,<ref>{{cite news|author=Chertavian, G.|title= Nonprofits Need to Compete for Top Talent|url= https://hbr.org/2013/03/nonprofits-need-to-compete-for|work=Harvard Business Review|date=March 2013}}</ref> and NPOs have for too long relegated hiring to a secondary priority,<ref name="auto">{{cite web | last=Maw | first=Liz | title=Winning the Talent Game | url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/winning_the_talent_game | date=9 July 2014 | work=Stanford Social Innovation Review | accessdate=6 August 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807002149/https://ssir.org/articles/entry/winning_the_talent_game | archive-date=7 August 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref> which could be why they find themselves in the position many do. While many established NPOs are well-funded and comparative to their public sector competitors, many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain vibrant personalities. The initial interest for many is the remuneration package, though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and implacable work that drove them away.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Becchetti|first1 = Leonardo|last2= Castriota|first2= Stefano|last3 = Depedri|first3 = Sara|title = Working in the for-profit versus not-for-profit sector: what difference does it make?

Public- and private-sector employment have, for the most part, been able to offer more to their employees than most nonprofit agencies throughout history. Either in the form of higher wages, more comprehensive benefit packages, or less tedious work, the public and private sectors have enjoyed an advantage over NPOs in attracting employees. Traditionally, the NPO has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause. Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally. This leads many young and driven employees to forego NPOs in favor of more stable employment. Today, however, nonprofit organizations are adopting methods used by their competitors and finding new means to retain their employees and attract the best of the newly minted workforce.<ref>{{cite web|last = Cohen|first = R.|title = Nonprofit Salaries: Achieving Parity with the Private Sector|url = https://nonprofitquarterly.org/management/5506-nonprofit-salaries-achieving-parity-with-the-private-sector.html|date = 21 June 2010|work = Nonprofit Quarterly|access-date = 10 December 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211005101/https://nonprofitquarterly.org/management/5506-nonprofit-salaries-achieving-parity-with-the-private-sector.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>

It has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector<ref>{{cite web|last =Coffman|first = S. |title =  Nonprofits Can Compete with Employee Benefits |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2002/12/23/focus4.html?page=all |date = 23 December 2002|work = Columbus Business First}}</ref> and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. A good environment is ranked higher than salary and pressure of work.<ref name="auto" /> NPOs are encouraged to pay as much as they are able and offer a low-stress work environment that the employee can associate him or herself positively with. Other incentives that should be implemented are generous vacation allowances or flexible work hours.<ref>{{cite web|last =Fox |first = T. |title = How to Compete with the Private Sector for Young Workers|url =  https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2014/03/18/how-to-compete-with-the-private-sector-for-young-workers/|work = The Washington Post|date = 18 March 2014}}</ref>

== Online presence ==
Many NPOs often use the [[.org]] or [[.us]] (or the [[country code top-level domain]] of their respective country) or [[.edu]] [[top-level domain]] (TLD) when selecting a [[domain name]] to differentiate themselves from more commercial entities, which typically use the [[.com]] space.

In the traditional domain noted in {{IETF RFC|1591}}, .org is for 'organizations that didn't fit anywhere else' in the naming system, which implies that it is the proper category for non-commercial organizations if they are not governmental, educational, or one of the other types with a specific TLD. It is not designated specifically for charitable organizations or any specific organizational or tax-law status; however, it encompasses anything that is not classifiable as another category. Currently, no restrictions are enforced on registration of .com or .org, so one can find organizations of all sorts in either of these domains, as well as other top-level domains including newer, more specific ones which may apply to particular sorts of organization including [[.museum]] for museums and [[.coop]] for [[cooperative]]s. Organizations might also register by the appropriate country code top-level domain for their country.

== Alternative names ==
Instead of being defined by 'non' words, some organizations are suggesting new, positive-sounding terminology to describe the sector. The term 'civil society organization' (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, including the ''Center for the Study of Global Governance''.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Glasius|editor-first1=Marlies|editor-last2=Kaldor|editor-first2=Mary|editor-last3=Anheier|editor-first3=Helmut|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/yearbook06-7.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424172538/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/yearbook06-7.htm|archive-date=24 April 2007|title=Global Civil Society 2006/7|publisher=Sage|year=2005}}</ref> The term 'citizen sector organization' (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector&nbsp;– as one of citizens, for citizens&nbsp;– by organizations including [[Ashoka: Innovators for the Public]].<ref>Drayton, W: [http://www.alliancemagazine.org/opinion/words-matter/ "Words Matter"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107010444/http://www.alliancemagazine.org/opinion/words-matter/ |date=7 November 2017 }}. Alliance Magazine, Vol. 12/No.2, June 2007.</ref> Advocates argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities, and limitations.<ref>Alvarado, Elliott I.: "Nonprofit or Not-for-profit – Which Are You?", page 6-7. Nonprofit World, Volume 18, Number 6, November/December 2000.</ref>

In some Spanish-language jurisdictions, nonprofit organizations are called "civil associations".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
