'''Barbara Anne Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|PC|size=100%}} (''{{née}}'' '''Betts'''; 6 October 1910 – 3 May 2002), was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] from [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] to [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], making her the longest-serving female MP in the history of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] until that record was broken in 2007 by [[Gwyneth Dunwoody]]. She later became the [[Member of the European Parliament]] for [[Greater Manchester]] from [[1979 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1979]] to [[1989 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1989]] and subsequently a member of the [[House of Lords]], having been granted a [[life peer]]age in 1990. She was the only woman to hold the position of [[First Secretary of State]].

One of the most significant Labour Party politicians of the 20th century, Castle developed a close political partnership with [[Harold Wilson]] and served in several [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]] roles during both his premierships. As [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] (1965–1968) she oversaw the introduction of permanent speed limits, breathalysers and seat belts. Castle was then elevated to [[Secretary of State for Employment]] and [[First Secretary of State]] (1968–1970), and successfully intervened in the strike by [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Ford sewing machinists]] against pay discrimination. Following this Castle introduced the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]]. During her time in government Castle also served as [[Minister for Overseas Development]] and [[Secretary of State for Social Services|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]].

==Early life==
Barbara Anne Betts was born on 6 October 1910 at 64 Derby Road, [[Chesterfield]], the youngest of three children to Frank Betts and his wife Annie Rebecca (''née'' Ferrand).{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=3}} Raised in [[Pontefract]] and [[Bradford]], Castle grew up in a politically active home and was introduced to socialism from a young age. Her older sister, [[Marjorie McIntosh (politician)|Marjorie]], later became a pioneer of the [[Inner London Education Authority]], while their brother Tristram (almost always called Jimmie) engaged in field work with [[Oxfam]] in Nigeria. She joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a teenager.

Her father was a tax inspector, exempt from military service in the [[First World War]] due to his high rank in a [[reserved occupation]]. It was because of the nature of the tax-collecting profession, and the promotions he received, that the family frequently moved around the country. Having moved to [[Bradford]] in 1922, the Betts family swiftly became involved with the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Although her father was prohibited from formal political activity because of his role as a civil servant, he became editor of the ''[[Bradford Pioneer]]'', the city's socialist newspaper, after [[William Leach (Labour politician)|William Leach]] was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]].<ref name="Obit">{{cite news|author=Anne Perkins|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,709885,00.html|title=Obituary: Baroness Castle of Blackburn|date=4 May 2002|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104151735/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,709885,00.html|archive-date=4 November 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/famousperson/castle/2561817 |title=Barbara Castle |publisher=Lasting Tribute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726094629/http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/famousperson/castle/2561817 |archivedate=26 July 2007 }}</ref> Castle's mother ran the family home while also operating a soup kitchen for the town's coalminers. After Barbara had left home Annie was elected as a Labour councillor in Bradford.

==Education==
Castle attended Love Lane Elementary School, then to [[Pontefract and District Girls High School]]. After moving to Bradford at the age of twelve, she attended [[Bradford Girls' Grammar School]]. She became involved in acting at the school and developed oratorical skills. She excelled academically, winning numerous awards from the school. She also organised mock elections at the school, in which she stood as the Labour candidate. There were some aspects of the school that she did not like, notably the presence of many girls from rich families. In her last year she was appointed Head Girl.

Her education continued at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]], from which she graduated with a [[third-class degree|third-class]] BA in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. She began serious political activity at Oxford, serving as the Treasurer of the [[Oxford University Labour Club]], the highest position a woman could hold in the club at the time. She struggled to accept the atmosphere of a university that had only recently begun to question its traditionally sexist attitudes. She was scornful of the elitist nature of some elements of the institution, branding the [[Oxford Union]] "that cadet class of the establishment".

==Early career==
Castle was elected to [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras|St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council]] in 1937 (where she remained until 1945), and in 1943 she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference for the first time. Throughout the [[Second World War]] she worked as a senior administrative officer at the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and she was an [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) warden during [[the Blitz]].<ref name="Derby">{{cite web|url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/non-driver-derbyshire-born-mp-1866069|title=Non-Driver Derbyshire-Born MP Who Put Her Foot Down When It Came to Road Safety|first=Jim|last=Pickard|date=6 August 2018|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[Derby Telegraph]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825120635/https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/nostalgia/non-driver-derbyshire-born-mp-1866069|archive-date=25 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Member of Parliament (1945–1979)==
In the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], which Labour won by a landslide, Castle was elected as the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Blackburn]].

===Cabinet minister===
====Minister for Overseas Development, 1964–1965====

Labour returned to government under [[Harold Wilson]] in October 1964 following a [[1964 United Kingdom general election|general election]], defeating [[Alec Douglas-Home]]'s Conservative government by winning a slim majority of four seats, thus ending 13 years of successive Conservative governments. Wilson had selected his core Cabinet four months prior to the election;{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} Castle knew Wilson intended to place her within his Cabinet, which would make her the fourth woman in British history ever to hold position in a Cabinet, after [[Margaret Bondfield]], [[Ellen Wilkinson]] and [[Florence Horsbrugh, Baroness Horsbrugh|Florence Horsbrugh]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m04c.pdf|title=Women in the House of Commons House of Commons: Information Office Factsheet M4|chapter=Appendix C: Women MPs who have held Ministerial office|access-date=30 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108070346/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/m04c.pdf|archive-date=8 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

Castle entered the Cabinet as the first [[Secretary of State for International Development|Minister for Overseas Development]], a newly created ministry for which she, alongside the [[Fabian Society]], had drawn up the plans for.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} For the last year she had acted as the opposition spokeswoman on overseas development.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=161}} Castle's plans were extensive, though the ministry's budget was modest.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=163}} She set about trying to divert powers from other departments related to overseas aid, including the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and [[HM Treasury|the Treasury]]. She was only partially successful in her aims and provoked an internal Whitehall dispute in the process.{{sfnp|Mitchell|Wienir|1997|p=87}}

In June 1965 Castle announced interest-free aid loans would be available to certain (not exclusively [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]) countries.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=197}} She had previously criticised the Conservative government for granting loans that only waived up to the first seven years of interest, which she considered to be counter-intuitive.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=175}}

In August, Castle published her government [[white paper]] ''Overseas Development: The Work of a New Ministry''.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=178}} The financial commitments of the ministry were omitted from the report, after a protracted clash between Castle and her Cabinet colleagues [[James Callaghan]] ([[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) and [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] ([[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs]]). Labour had made a [[manifesto]] promise to increase aid spending to 1% of [[gross national product]], almost double Conservative spending.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|pp=197–198}} However, the national economy was unstable, public resentment towards the Commonwealth was growing due to immigration, and within Cabinet aid was viewed with either indifference or contempt.{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=175}} Castle grappled with Callaghan and Brown over the department's budgetary allocation; they reached a compromise following Wilson's intervention,{{sfnp|Martineau|2000|p=177}} but the sum only amounted to a small increase in spending.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|pp=199}}

====Minister of Transport, 1965–1968====
Initially reluctant to head up the department, Castle accepted the role of [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] (23 December 1965 – 6 April 1968) in a [[Cabinet reshuffle]] after Wilson proved persuasive.<ref name="NewStatesman">{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/node/150817|title=The New Statesman Interview – Barbara Castle|first=Steve|last=Richards|date=28 February 2000|accessdate=28 August 2018|work=[[New Statesman]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829072149/https://www.newstatesman.com/node/150817|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In February 1966, Castle addressed Parliament, calling for "a profound change in public attitudes" to curtail increasing road fatality figures, stating: "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not manage to kill as many civilians in Britain as have been killed on our roads since the war".<ref name="Hansard1">{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1966/feb/10/road-safety-bill|title=ROAD SAFETY BILL|date=10 February 1966|accessdate=14 January 2019|work=[[Hansard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114153329/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1966/feb/10/road-safety-bill|archive-date=14 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The statistics bore out; between 1945 and the mid-1960s approximately 150,000 people were killed and several million injured on Britain's roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/history/postgraduate/road-safety|title=Science, Technology and Road Safety in the Motor Age|accessdate=14 January 2019|work=[[University of Leicester]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417120710/http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/history/postgraduate/road-safety|archive-date=17 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

She introduced the [[breathalyser]] to combat the then recently acknowledged crisis of [[drink-driving]].

Castle also made permanent the [[Road speed limits in the United Kingdom|national speed limit]] (70&nbsp;mph). Having been introduced as a four-month trial by outgoing Transport Minister [[Tom Fraser]] in December 1965, Castle first extended the limit period in 1966 and in 1967 made the limit permanent, following the findings of a [[Road Research Laboratory]] report revealing motorway casualties had fallen 20% since its introduction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneyweek.com/419950/22-december-1965-70mph-speed-limit-introduced/|title=22 December 1965: 70mph speed limit introduced|first=Ben|last=Judge|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[MoneyWeek]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827075555/https://moneyweek.com/419950/22-december-1965-70mph-speed-limit-introduced/|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/09/archive-casualties-70mph-speed-limit|title=From the archive, 9 June 1967: Casualties down 20 p.c. under 70 m.p.h. speed limit|date=9 June 2012|accessdate=27 August 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180827110408/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jun/09/archive-casualties-70mph-speed-limit|archive-date=27 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

During a tour of [[New York City]] in October 1966, where Castle was examining the impact of traffic problems in American cities, she vocalised plans to introduce a [[London congestion charge]], which was to be introduced as soon as the technical details of fee collection were solved.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/10/16/archives/london-to-set-fees-on-cars-entering-city-in-rush-hours.html|title=London to Set Fees on Cars Entering City in Rush Hours|first=Murray|last=Schumach|date=16 October 1966|accessdate=14 January 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114153239/https://www.nytimes.com/1966/10/16/archives/london-to-set-fees-on-cars-entering-city-in-rush-hours.html|archive-date=14 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Castle urged New York's [[New York City Department of Transportation|Transport Commissioner]] to adopt the same policy, describing plans for more roadways as "self-defeating", stating the solution was "more and better mass transit systems".<ref name="NYT1"/>

She presided over the closure of approximately 2,050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the [[Beeching axe|Beeching cuts]]—a betrayal of pre-election commitments by the Labour party to halt the proposals. Nevertheless, she refused closure of several lines, one example being the [[Looe Valley Line]] in Cornwall, and introduced the first Government [[rail subsidies]] for socially necessary but unprofitable railways in the Transport Act 1968.

One of her most memorable achievements as Transport minister was to pass legislation decreeing that all new cars had to be fitted with [[seat belt]]s. Despite being appointed to the Ministry of Transport, a role which she was originally unenthusiastic about, Castle could not actually drive herself, and was chauffeured to functions. (The Labour politician [[Hazel Blears]] recalled driving Castle at one time as a young Labour Party activist in the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=63 Hazel Blears’ memories of Barbara Castle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319125818/http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=63 |date=19 March 2008 }}, The Labour History Group, 20 June 2007</ref>) Despite her lack of a driving licence, she attracted controversy when she told local government leaders to give added emphasis to motor vehicle access in urban areas, as "most pedestrians are walking to or from their cars."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Castle and her husband Edward Castle had bought a new flat in John Spencer Square in late 1967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.roads.org.uk/ringways/ringway1/north-cross-route|title=North Cross Route|website=Roads.org.uk|language=en|access-date=17 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181117105010/http://www.roads.org.uk/ringways/ringway1/north-cross-route|archive-date=17 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> while she was the Minister of Transport.

====First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment, 1968–1970====
As [[Secretary of State for Employment]], Castle was also appointed [[First Secretary of State]] by Wilson, bringing her firmly into the heart of government. She was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the trade unions rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her 1969 [[white paper]], '[[In Place of Strife]]'. This also involved a major cabinet split, with threatened resignations, hot tempers and her future nemesis [[James Callaghan]] breaking ranks to publicly try to undermine the bill. The whole episode alienated her from many of her friends on the left, with the [[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]] newspaper railing very hard against the bill, which they held to be attacking the workers without attacking the bosses. The split is often said to be partly responsible for Labour's defeat at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]]. The eventual deal with the unions dropped most of the contentious clauses.

Castle also helped make history when she intervened in the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968|Ford sewing machinists' strike of 1968]], in which the women of the [[Dagenham Ford Plant]] demanded to be paid the same as their male counterparts. She helped resolve the strike, which resulted in a pay rise for Ford's female workers bringing them to 92% of what the men received. Most significantly, as a consequence of this strike, Castle put through the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/Tl_Display.php?Where=Dc1Title+contains+'Ford+sewing+machinists,+1968'|title=TUC {{!}} History Online|website=www.unionhistory.info|access-date=20 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114184346/http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/Tl_Display.php?Where=Dc1Title+contains+%27Ford+sewing+machinists%2C+1968%27|archive-date=14 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A 2010 British film, ''[[Made in Dagenham]]'', was based on the Ford strike. She was portrayed by [[Miranda Richardson]].

In April 1970, Castle's husband Ted lost his position as an alderman of the [[Greater London Council]]. He was devastated and although he was supportive of his wife's achievements, he considered himself a failure against her.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=339}} Upset and concerned by her husband's distress, Barbara moved to persuade Wilson to grant Ted a peerage.<ref name="DailyTelegraph2"/>

===Opposition===
In May 1970, Wilson [[1970 United Kingdom general election|called a general election]], held on 18 June. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Edward Heath]], enjoyed a surprise victory, despite opinion polling indicating a steady lead for Labour in the run-up.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=344}} Castle privately blamed complacency within Labour for their loss and had expressed skepticism of their poll lead, writing in her diaries: "I have a haunting feeling there is a silent majority sitting behind its lace curtains waiting to come out and vote Tory."{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=344}}

In the immediate aftermath of the government's defeat, Castle found she was out of favour with Wilson. The day following the general election, Wilson held a final inner Cabinet meeting at [[Downing Street]], to which Castle was not invited.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=345}} Eager to make contact, she later called him at [[Chequers]], where Wilson engaged in a brusque telephone conversation with her.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=345}}

Refusing to acknowledge her career had been curtailed, Castle proposed to run for deputy leadership of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]].{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=347}} When she informed Wilson of her plans he was furious; Castle's reputation within the party had been damaged by the failure of ''[[In Place of Strife]]'' and Wilson censured her, claiming her plan would split the party.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=347}} In an act of retribution for her challenge to the deputy leadership, Wilson impeded Ted Castle's peerage, which he had all but promised prior to the general election.{{sfnp|Perkins|2003|p=348}}

Castle remained as the Labour shadow spokesperson on Employment. The new Government introduced many of her policy suggestions as part of their Industrial Relations Act. When she was attacking the Conservative bill, the government simply pointed to her own white paper, following which Wilson reshuffled her first to the health portfolio and then out of the shadow cabinet.

===Return to Cabinet===
====Secretary of State for Health and Social Services, 1974–1976====
Despite having been on the Labour back benches since 1972 and not part of the shadow cabinet, in 1974, after [[Harold Wilson]]'s defeat of [[Edward Heath]], Castle became [[Secretary of State for Social Services|Secretary of State for Health and Social Services]]. While serving in this position, Castle introduced a wide range of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the [[Carer's Allowance|Invalid Care Allowance]] (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.<ref>[[Anthony Seldon]] and Kevin Hickson (eds), ''New Labour, Old Labour: The Wilson and Callaghan Governments, 1974–79''.</ref>

In the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum debate]] she took a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] stance. During a debate with Liberal leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]] he asked her whether, if the vote would be yes, she would stay on as a minister. To this she replied: "If the vote is yes my country will need me to save it."<ref>{{YouTube|Nj0u_pnAw_s|Barbara Castle Labour's Greatest Woman, video}}</ref> Despite her views she later became a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (1979–1989). Her public support of leaving the EEC infuriated Wilson. Castle recorded in her diary and in her subsequent autobiography that Wilson summoned her to Downing Street where he angrily accused her of disloyalty and that as he had brought her back into the cabinet against other's wishes and advice, he deserved better from her. Castle claimed she offered to resign, but Wilson calmed down and she continued to campaign for leaving in the referendum.<ref>Castle, Barbara. The Castle Diaries 1964-1976.

Castle remained in cabinet until Wilson's resignation in March 1976. The head of the [[Downing Street policy unit]], [[Bernard Donoughue]], records in his diary that he warned Wilson that Castle's dogged pursuit of personal policy stances on public health would "wreck the NHS". Donoughue claims that Wilson agreed, but admitted he would leave it to his successor to resolve.<ref>''Downing Street Diary: with Harold Wilson at no.10''.

Castle lost her place as a Cabinet minister when her bitter political enemy [[James Callaghan]] succeeded Wilson as prime minister following a [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]]. Although he left Wilson's Cabinet virtually unchanged, he dismissed Castle almost immediately upon taking office, in the midst of a complex health bill that she was steering through the House Commons at the time.<ref name="CallaghanObit">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1486556/Lord-Callaghan-of-Cardiff.html|title=Lord Callaghan of Cardiff|date=28 March 2005|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082058/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/1486556/Lord-Callaghan-of-Cardiff.html|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Although he had not yet decided on her successor at the time he fired her, Callaghan removed her under the pretext he wanted to lower the average age of his Cabinet,<ref name="WashingtonPost">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/05/06/barbara-castle-91/7ad94886-d4c5-4d59-b33c-c82257653aa0|title=Barbara Castle, 91|first=Richard|last=Pearson|date=6 May 2002|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903114826/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2002/05/06/barbara-castle-91/7ad94886-d4c5-4d59-b33c-c82257653aa0/|archive-date=3 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which she regarded as a "phoney reason".<ref name="BBC2000">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/946997.stm|title=Barbara Castle: Scaling the ramparts|first=Chris|last=Jones|date=29 September 2000|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=[[BBC]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031101163008/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/946997.stm|archive-date=1 November 2003|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview years later, she remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was not to reply with "Then why not start with yourself, Jim?" (Callaghan was four years older than Wilson, the man he was replacing, and less than 18 months younger than Castle). Castle was angry to discover that Wilson had broken a private confidence in informing Callaghan that she had intended to retire from the cabinet before the next election.<ref>Castle, Barbara.

==European Parliament (1979–1989)==
Despite her [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] stance, less than a month after leaving Westminster at the 1979 general election she stood for and was elected to the [[European Parliament]], writing in the ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' that "politics is not just about policies: it is about fighting for them in every available forum and at every opportunity." In 1982 she wrote in the ''New Statesman'' that Labour should abandon its opposition to British membership of the EEC, saying that Britain should fight its corner inside it.<ref>Barbara Castle, 'Let them throw us out', ''New Statesman'' (17 September 1982), pp. 10–11.</ref> This led her former ally [[Ian Mikardo]] to say to her: "Your name is mud".<ref>''The Times'' (10 June 1993), p. 37.</ref>

She represented [[Greater Manchester North (European Parliament constituency)|Greater Manchester North]] from 1979–1984, and was then elected for another five years to represent [[Greater Manchester West (European Parliament constituency)|Greater Manchester West]] from 1984–1989. She was, at that time, the only British MEP to have held a cabinet position.

In the European Parliament Castle led Labour's delegation, serving as vice-chair of the Socialist Group and as a member of the [[Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development|Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development]] and also the Delegation for relations with [[Malta]].

The Castle Diaries were published in two volumes in 1980 and 1984, chronicling her time in office from 1964–1976 and providing an insight into the workings of Cabinet Government. [[Edmund Dell]], reviewing the diaries that cover the years 1974–76 in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', said that it "shows more about the nature of cabinet government – even though it deals with only one Cabinet – than any previous publication, academic, political or biographical. It is, I think, better than [[Richard Crossman|Crossman]]".<ref>Edmund Dell, '[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v02/n19/edmund-dell/keeping-left Keeping Left] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191026202155/https://www.lrb.co.uk/v02/n19/edmund-dell/keeping-left |date=26 October 2019 }}', ''London Review of Books'', Vol. 2 No. 19 (2 October 1980), pp. 13–14.</ref> [[Michael Foot]] in the ''Listener'' claimed that the diary, "whatever else it is or not, is a human document, hopelessly absorbing".<ref name="Times">''The Times'' (16 October 1980), p. 7.</ref> [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] in the ''Sunday Telegraph'' wrote that it was "a contribution of first rate importance to our knowledge of modern politics".<ref name="Times"/>

==Life peer==
In 1974, [[Edward Castle, Baron Castle|Ted Castle]] was made a life peer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JcastleT.htm |title=Ted Castle |publisher=Spartacus Educational |date=16 December 1979 |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004174228/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/JcastleT.htm |archivedate=4 October 2008}}</ref> This meant that Barbara was now formally Lady Castle, but she refused to use this courtesy title. Ted Castle died in 1979. On 16 July 1990, she was created a [[life peer]] in her own right, as '''Baroness Castle of Blackburn''', ''of [[Ibstone]] in the [[Buckinghamshire|County of Buckingham]]shire''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52215 |date=19 July 1990 |page=12091}}</ref> She remained active in politics right up until her death, attacking the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], [[Gordon Brown]], at the Labour party conference in 2001 for his refusal to link pensions to earnings.

Castle was a critic of [[Blairism]] and "[[New Labour]]", in particular with Blairite economic ideologies, which she perceived to be acceptance of "[[market economics]], unchallenged [[globalisation]] and the dominance of the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]]".<ref name="NewStatesman"/> She also accused Blairites of distorting and dismissing the Labour Party's past, stating in an interview published in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine in 2000, the party's centenary:<blockquote>"They do not seem to have realised that all governments, whatever their complexion, end in apparent failure. [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] was triumphant in 1959 and was biting the dust shortly afterwards. [[Edward Heath|Heath]] won in 1970 and spent three and half years doing U-turns, looking for the perfect answer. [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] was a remarkable woman, but her premiership ended in ignominy. But the current leadership seems preoccupied by the failing of Labour in power and in opposition."<ref name="NewStatesman"/></blockquote>

==Honours and awards==
Barbara Castle was the recipient of "The Order of the Companions of [[Oliver Tambo|OR Tambo]] in Silver", a South African award to foreign nationals for friendship with that country. In a statement the South African government recognised Castle's "outstanding contribution to the struggle against apartheid and the establishment of a non-sexist, non-racial and democratic South Africa".<ref name="thepresidency.gov.za">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=214 |title=The Order of the Companions of OR Tambo in Silver – Profile of Barbara Castle |publisher=The Presidency – Republic of South Africa |accessdate=24 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719021558/http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/orders_list.asp?show=214 |archivedate=19 July 2010 }}</ref> This can be seen throughout Castle's career with her active support for the Anti-Apartheid Movement (AAM) in Britain from the very start of its existence and her continued interest and devotion to colonial issues within Parliament.<ref name="thepresidency.gov.za"/>
