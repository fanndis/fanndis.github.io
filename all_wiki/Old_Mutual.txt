[[File:Old Mutual headquarters.jpg|thumb|Original Old Mutual headquarters in [[Cape Town]]. The building now serves as residential accommodation.]]
In 1939, the Old Mutual [[art deco]] office opened in Darling Street as the [[Mutual Building]] ('Mutualgebou' in Afrikaans)<ref name="history"/> which has since been converted to residential use and known as "Mutual Heights". In 1956, Old Mutual relocated its head office to Mutualpark in [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]], at that time the largest office block in the southern hemisphere.<ref name="history"/>

In March 2016, Old Mutual plc announced a new strategy for the Group, called 'managed separation', that sought to unlock and create value for shareholders.  The strategy would entail the separation of its four businesses - Old Mutual Emerging Markets, Nedbank, UK-based Old Mutual Wealth and Boston-based Old Mutual Asset Management (OMAM) - into standalone entities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35782231|title=Old Mutual to split into four units|website=Bbc.com|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> In August 2016, Old Mutual Investment Group signed a deal with the [[Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority]] to invest $700 million in hospitality, retail, commercial sectors, and food security,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrikonomics.com/why-old-mutual-is-investing-millions-in-nigeria/|title=Why Old Mutual is investing millions in Nigeria|website=Afrikonomics.com|date=22 September 2016|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and sold its Italian wealth management arm to the [[ERGO Group]] for â¬278 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/08/09/old-mutual-sells-238m-italian-wealth-arm-as-part-of-separation/|title=Old Mutual sells Â£238m Italian wealth arm as part of separation|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 August 2016|author=Marion Dakers|accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref>

A significant strategic milestone was reached during the first half of 2017 with the announcement of a series of transactions that would reduce Old Mutual plc's stake in OM Asset Management (OMAM) to 5.5%. OMAM is now independent from Old Mutual plc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutualplc.com/media/news/view-news.jsp?news-id=31584|title=Sale of first tranche of OM Asset Management shares to HNA Capital US closes|website=Old Mutual plc|date=12 May 2017|author=Old Mutual|accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref> Additionally, in 2017 Old Mutual completed the sale of Indian-based Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/kotak-mah-bk-old-mutual-stake/old-mutual-to-sell-india-insurance-jv-stake-to-kotak-for-202-mln-idUSL4N1I01J1|title=Old Mutual to sell India insurance JV stake to Kotak for $202 mln|date=28 April 2017|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>

In June 2018 the company executed the 'managed separation' strategy. Old Mutual plc shares were de-listed and Old Mutual Limited and Quilter plc, now independent businesses, listed on the Johannesburg, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibian and London Stock Exchanges. On 15 October 2018, Old Mutual unbundled their majority shareholding in Nedbank, marking a distribution worth approximately R43.2 billion to Old Mutual shareholders, and the completion of Old Mutual Group's managed separation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oldmutual.com/investor-relations/nedbank-unbundling-details|title=Old Mutual Unbundles Nedbank Shares worth R43.2 billion|publisher=Old Mutual|accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> Old Mutual's head office moved to No 1 Mutual Place, Sandton, Johannesburg in the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Financial-Services/old-mutuals-african-arm-lists-on-the-jse-as-managed-separation-continues-20180626|title=Old Mutual's African arm lists on the JSE as 'managed separation' continues|publisher=Fin 24|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=26 June 2018}}</ref>
