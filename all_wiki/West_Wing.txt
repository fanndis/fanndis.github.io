==History==

Before the construction of the West Wing, presidential staff worked on the western end of the second floor of what is now the Executive Residence.<ref name="insidewh">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-white-house/|title=The White House Building|website=The White House}}</ref> However, when [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became president, he found that the existing offices in the mansion were insufficient to accommodate his family of six children as well as his staff.

A year later in 1902, First Lady [[Edith Roosevelt]] hired [[McKim, Mead & White]] to separate the living quarters from the offices, to enlarge and modernize the public rooms, to re-do the landscaping, and to redecorate the interior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Learn-About-TR/TR-Encyclopedia/Family-and-Friends/Edith-Kermit-Carow-Roosevelt.aspx|title=TR Center - Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt|website=TheodoreRooseveltCenter.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>  Congress approved over half a million dollars for the renovation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKfKAgAAQBAJ&q=Edith+Roosevelt&pg=PA199|title=American First Ladies: Their Lives and Their Legacy|last=Gould|first=Lewis L.|date=2014-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135311551|language=en}}</ref>

The West Wing was originally intended as a temporary office structure,<ref name="insidewh" /> built on the site of the extensive greenhouses and stables. The President's Office and the Cabinet Room took up the eastern third of the building closest to the Residence and attached colonnaded terrace. Roosevelt's rectangular office with adjacent Cabinet Room through a set of double doors which was located approximately where the Roosevelt Room is now near the centre.<ref name="Seale">William Seale, ''The President's House'' (White House Historical Association, 1986), pp. 946-49.</ref>

In 1909, [[William Howard Taft]] expanded the building southward, covering the tennis court. He placed the first [[Oval Office]] at the centre of the addition's south facade, reminiscent of the oval rooms on the three floors of the White House.<ref name=insidewh /> Later, at the outset of his presidency, [[Herbert Hoover]] rebuilt the West Wing, excavating a partial basement, and supporting it with structural steel. The completed building, however, lasted less than seven months.<ref name="Seale"/> On December 24, 1929, the West Wing was significantly damaged by an electrical fire.<ref name=oval /> Hoover rebuilt it, and added air-conditioning.

The fourth and final major reorganization was undertaken less than three years later by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Dissatisfied with the size and layout of President Hoover's West Wing, he engaged New York architect [[Eric Gugler]] to redesign it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent size of the building, Gugler excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn,<ref>The underground offices became the Situation Room and White House Mess. [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/thc1995012318/PP/ 1938 photo, showing courtyard lighting the underground offices] from Library of Congress.</ref> and built an unobtrusive "penthouse" story.<ref name="Seale"/> The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. Gugler's most notable change was the addition to the east side containing a new Cabinet Room, Secretary's Office, and Oval Office.<ref name="Seale"/> The new office's location gave presidents greater privacy, allowing them to slip back and forth between the White House and the West Wing without being in full view of the staff.<ref name=oval />

As the size of the president's staff grew over the latter half of the 20th century, the West Wing generally came to be seen as too small for its modern governmental functions. Today, most of the staff members of the [[Executive Office of the President]] are located in the adjacent [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]].

[[Richard Nixon]] also renamed the room, previously called by Franklin Roosevelt the "Fish Room" (where he kept [[aquarium]]s, and where [[John F. Kennedy]] displayed trophy fish), in honour of the two presidents Roosevelt: Theodore, who first built the West Wing, and Franklin, who built the current Oval Office. By tradition, a portrait of [[Franklin Roosevelt]] hangs over the mantel of the [[Roosevelt Room]]<ref name=roos /> during the administration of a president from the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and a portrait of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] hangs during the administration of a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president (although [[Bill Clinton]] chose to retain the portrait of Theodore Roosevelt above the mantel). In the past, the portrait not hanging over the mantel hung on the opposite wall. However, during the first term of [[George W. Bush]], an audio-visual cabinet was placed on the opposite wall providing secure audio and visual conference capabilities across the hall from the Oval Office.

During the 1930s, the [[March of Dimes]] constructed a swimming pool so that Franklin Roosevelt could exercise, as therapy for his [[polio]]-related disability. Richard Nixon had the swimming pool covered over to create the [[Press Briefing Room (White House)|Press Briefing Room]], where the [[White House Press Secretary]] gives daily briefings.<ref name=ww>{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing.htm |title=West Wing of the White House}}</ref>

==Depiction on ''The West Wing'' TV series==
{{main article|The West Wing}}
In 1999, ''The West Wing'' television series brought greater public attention to the workings of the presidential staff, as well as to the location of those working in the West Wing. The show followed the working lives of a fictional Democratic U.S. president, [[Josiah Bartlet]], and his senior staff.  When asked whether the show accurately captured the working environment in 2003, Press Secretary [[Scott McClellan]] commented that the show portrayed more foot traffic and larger rooms than in the real West Wing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Scott McClellan Hosts Ask the White House | url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ask/20031118.html | work=The White House |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref>
