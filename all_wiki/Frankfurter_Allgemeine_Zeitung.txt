The paper runs its own correspondent network. Its editorial policy is not determined by a single editor, but cooperatively by four editors. It is the German newspaper with the widest circulation abroad, with its editors claiming the newspaper is delivered to 148 countries.

==History==
[[Image:FAZ Building 2.jpg|thumb|left|Editorial department building of ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']]
[[Image:Konrad Adenauer by Giuseppe Moro, August 1961.jpg|thumb|left|[[Konrad Adenauer]] reading the F.A.Z. in 1961]]
The first edition of the ''F.A.Z.'' appeared on 1 November 1949;<ref>{{cite web|title=World Press Trends|url=http://www.wan-ifra.org/system/files/field_article_file/WPT_Sample_report_Germany.pdf|work=WAN IFRA|accessdate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sigurd Hess|title=German Intelligence Organizations and the Media|journal=Journal of Intelligence History|date=2009|volume=9|issue=1–2|pages=75–87|doi=10.1080/16161262.2009.10555166|s2cid=154195583}}</ref> its founding editor was {{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Welter|de}}. Some editors had worked for the  [[moderate]] ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'', which had been banned in 1943. However, in their first issue, the F.A.Z. [[editorial]] expressly refuted the notion of being the earlier paper's successor or of continuing its legacy:

{{quote|text= Arising from the fact that some of our colleagues previously were members of the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'', it often has been suggested an attempt was being made here to be the successor to that newspaper.

Until 30 September 1950 the ''F.A.Z.'' was printed in [[Mainz]].

Traditionally, many of the headlines in the ''F.A.Z.'' were styled in orthodox [[blackletter]] format and no photographs appeared on the title page. Some of the rare exceptions were a picture of the celebrating people in front of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] on [[German Unity Day]] on 4 October 1990, and the two pictures in the edition of 12 September 2001 showing the collapsing [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and the [[President of the United States|American president]] [[George W. Bush]].

In the early 2000s, ''F.A.Z.'' expanded aggressively, with customized sections for Berlin and Munich.<ref name="LandlerNYT2004">{{cite news|first= Mark|last= Landler|author-link= Mark Landler|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/business/media-woes-at-two-pillars-of-german-journalism.html |title= MEDIA; Woes at Two Pillars of German Journalism|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 January 2004|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> An eight-page six-day-a-week English-language edition was distributed as an insert in ''[[The International Herald Tribune]]'' (which is owned by [[The New York Times Company]]); the articles were selected and translated from the same day's edition of the parent newspaper by the ''F.A.Z.'' staff in Frankfurt.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/03/business/worldbusiness/03iht-partner.2.t.html |title= FAZ English Edition Debuts With the IHT|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 April 2000|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>  However, F.A.Z. group suffered a loss of 60.6&nbsp;million euros in 2002. By 2004 the customized sections were scrapped. The English edition shrank to a tabloid published once a week.<ref name="LandlerNYT2004"/>

On 5 October 2007, the ''F.A.Z.'' altered their traditional layout to include color photographs on the front page and exclude [[blackletter]] typeface outside the [[Nameplate (publishing)|nameplate]]. Due to its traditionally sober layout, the introduction of colour photographs in the F.A.Z. was controversially discussed by the readers, becoming the subject of a 2009 comedy film that was still current three years later.<ref>{{cite news|first=Hans-Jürgen|last=Jakobs|url= http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/frankfurter-frakturen-und-sie-dreht-sich-doch-1.788362 |title= Und sie dreht sich doch|language=German|trans-title=And she in fact does change|newspaper=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|date=17 May 2010|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

Currently, the F.A.Z. is produced electronically using the [[IBM NICA|Networked Interactive Content Access (NICA)]] and Hermes. For its characteristic comment headings, a digital ''[[fraktur (typeface)|Fraktur]]'' font was ordered. The Fraktur has since been abandoned, however, with the above-mentioned change of layout.

After having introduced on 1 August 1999 the new spelling prescribed by the [[German orthography reform of 1996|German spelling reform]], the F.A.Z. returned exactly one year later to the old spelling, declaring that the reform had failed to achieve the primary goals of improving language mastery and strengthening the unity of the language.<ref>"[http://m.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/a-86856.html Die "FAZ" ruft zur Konterrevolution auf]" (26&nbsp;July 2000). ''Der Spiegel''. Spiegel.de. Retrieved 28&nbsp;November 2016.</ref> After several changes had been made to the new spelling, F.A.Z. accepted it and started using it (in a custom version) on 1 January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|first= Dagmar|last= Giersberg|others= Translated by Hillary Crowe and Heather Moers|url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/siw/en630493.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131218062147/http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/siw/en630493.htm|archivedate=18 December 2013|title=Chronicle of a Long Debate: The Spelling Reform|date= December 2007|publisher= [[Goethe-Institut]]|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

==Orientation==
Its political orientation is [[centre right]]<ref name=koopmans /> and [[conservative liberalism|liberal]]-[[liberal conservatism|conservative]],<ref name=enzensberger/> occasionally providing a forum to commentators with different opinions. In particular, the ''Feuilleton'' and some sections of the Sunday edition cannot be said to be specifically conservative or liberal at all.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In the [[German election, 2013|2013 elections]] the paper was among the supporters of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Juan P.

==Ownership==
It has the legal form of a [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]]; the independent ''FAZIT-Stiftung'' (FAZIT Foundation) is its majority shareholder (93.7%).<ref>Annual report of FAZIT Foundation at [http://www.ebundesanzeiger.de/  ebundesanzeiger.de]</ref> The FAZIT-Stiftung was born in 1959 by the transformation of the then FAZ owner "Allgemeine Verlagsgesellschaft mbH" into a [[private foundation]]. The FAZIT-Stiftung is 'owned' by up to nine persons who can't sell or buy their share but have to transmit it free of charge to a successor which is co-opted by the remaining shareholders. The foundations statute prescribe that only such persons shall be co-opted as new member, who "by their standing and personality" can guarantee the "independence" of the FAZ. The current group of seven is composed of active or former [[Chief executive officer|CEO]]s, company owners, board members, and corporate lawyers.  The FAZIT foundation also owns more than 90% of the shares of the company 'Frankfurter Societät' which in turn is owner of the [[Printer (publishing)|printing enterprise]] 'Frankfurter Societätsdruckerei' and the regional paper [[Frankfurter Neue Presse]].

==Circulation==
The ''F.A.Z.'' is one of several high-profile national newspapers in Germany (along with ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Die Welt]]'', ''[[Die Zeit]]'', ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'' and ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'') and among them has the second largest circulation nationwide. It maintains the largest number of foreign correspondents of any European newspaper (53 as of 2002).<ref>Hans Magnus Enzensberger: ''[http://home.online.no/~boethius/avis/magnus.htm Die geschrumpfte Welt auf Zeitungspapier.]'' In: FAZ, 7 March 2002.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210203724/http://home.online.no/~boethius/avis/magnus.htm |date=10 February 2009 }}</ref>

==Controversies and bans==
In December 1999, future German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] published a sensational article in the ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', lamenting the "tragedy" that had befallen the party ([[CDU donations scandal]]), blaming former Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and urging a new course.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alison|last=Smale|author-link= Alison Smale|url= http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/the-making-of-angela-merkel/|title=The Making of Angela Merkel|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, the ''F.A.Z.'' was banned in [[Egypt]] for publishing articles which were deemed as "insulting Islam".<ref>{{cite web|title=The impact of blasphemy laws on human Rights|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/PolicingBelief_Egypt.pdf|work=Freedom House|accessdate=29 September 2013|format=Policy Brief}}</ref> The paper was again banned in Egypt in February 2008 due to the publication of Prophet Mohammad's cartoons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel issue on Islam banned in Egypt|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080402-der-spiegel-issue-islam-banned-egypt-egypt-germany|accessdate=29 September 2013|work=France24|date=2 April 2008}}</ref> In November 2012, the paper provoked strong criticism in Spain because of its stance against Spanish immigration to Germany during the economic crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2012/11/19/internacional/1353321744.html |title=Aumenta el rechazo y temor a la 'avalancha' de españoles en Alemania|work=El Mundo|date=19 November 2012|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>

In July 2019, the ''F.A.Z.''  website, along with other major German media, including [[Spiegel Online]], was blocked by China's [[Great Firewall]]. The reasons for the ban remain unclear, while ''F.A.Z.''  believed it was possibly due to its reports on [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|the massive protests in Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/1.6270744 |title=Internetzensur: China sperrt die F.A.Z. |last=Ankenbrand |first=Hendrik |access-date=2019-07-09 | trans-title=Internet censorship: China blocks the ''F.A.Z.'' |work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung| language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://cn.rfi.fr/%25E4%25B8%25AD%25E5%259B%25BD/20190708-%25E6%25B3%2595%25E5%2585%25B0%25E5%2585%258B%25E7%25A6%258F%25E6%25B1%2587%25E6%258A%25A5%25E7%25BD%2591%25E7%25AB%2599%25E4%25B9%259F%25E8%25A2%25AB%25E4%25B8%25AD%25E5%259B%25BD%25E5%25B1%258F%25E8%2594%25BD |title=《法兰克福汇报》网站也被中国屏蔽 |date=2019-07-08 |work=Radio France Internationale |access-date=2019-07-09 |language=zh-Hans|trans-title=''F.A.Z.'' website was blocked in China}}</ref>
