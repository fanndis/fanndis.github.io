'''''Charlotte's Web''''' is a 2006 American [[fantasy]]-[[comedy]] film based on the [[Charlotte's Web|1952 novel of the same name]] by [[E. B. White]]. Directed by [[Gary Winick]] and written by [[Susannah Grant]] and [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], it is the second film adaptation of White's book, following a [[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|1973 animated version]] produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. The film stars [[Dakota Fanning]], [[Kevin Anderson (actor)|Kevin Anderson]], and [[Beau Bridges]], with voices provided by [[Dominic Scott Kay]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[John Cleese]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[André 3000]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Reba McEntire]], and [[Robert Redford]]. [[Danny Elfman]] composed the film's score.

Produced by [[Walden Media]], [[Jordan Kerner]]'s The K Entertainment Company and [[Nickelodeon Movies]], the film premiered in [[Australia]] on December 7, 2006 and was released theatrically by [[Paramount Pictures]] on December 15, 2006 in the United States. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, yet was only modestly commercially successful. The movie grossed only $82 million and $61 million elsewhere for a worldwide total of $144.9 million against an $85 million budget, as well as grossing an additional $95.2 million in home media sales.<ref>https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Charlottes-Web#tab=video-sales</ref>

==Plot==
During springtime on a farm in [[Somerset County, Maine]], young Fern Arable discovers her father John about to kill a runt of a litter of newborn pigs. She successfully begs her father to spare the piglet's life; Fern names him Wilbur and nurtures him lovingly. The next morning, Fern sneaks Wilbur into her school desk, causing commotion.

When Wilbur has matured, Fern is regretfully forced to take him to her uncle Homer Zuckerman's barnyard. Mrs. Arable feels slightly concerned for Fern's behavior and one night, prevails upon Fern to stay home, do her homework and go straight to bed. During this time, Wilbur feels abandoned and is left yearning for companionship, but is snubbed by the other animals - a serious and steadfast [[sheep]] named Samuel; a fun-loving and kindly [[goose]] couple named Gussy and Golly; two beautiful and laid-back [[cow]] sisters named Bitsy and Betsy; and a cowardly and humorous [[horse]] named Ike - until he is befriended by Charlotte A. Cavatica, a [[barn spider]] who lives in the space above Wilbur's sty in the Zuckermans' barn. When the other animals reveal to Wilbur that he will be prepared for dinner by [[Christmas]], Charlotte promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to save Wilbur's life. With the help of Samuel, Gussy, Golly, Bitsy, Betsy, Ike and a comedic [[rat]] named Templeton, Charlotte convinces the Zuckerman family that Wilbur is actually quite special by spelling out descriptions of him in her [[spider web|web]] such as "Some pig", "Terrific", "Radiant" and "Humble".

The next day, the Arables, Zuckermans, Wilbur, Charlotte and Templeton go to a fair where Wilbur is entered in a contest. While there, Charlotte produces an [[spider#Reproduction|egg sac]] containing her unborn offspring while Wilbur, despite winning no prizes, is later celebrated by the fair's staff and visitors, making him too prestigious to justify killing him. Exhausted from laying eggs, Charlotte cannot return home because she is dying. Wilbur bids an emotional farewell to her as she remains at the fair and dies shortly after his departure, but he manages to take her egg sac home with the help of Templeton. Wilbur then lives to witness his first Christmas and by the next spring, hundreds of Charlotte's offspring emerge; most of the young spiders soon leave, but three named Joy, Aranea and Nellie stay and become Wilbur's friends.

==Production==
''Charlotte's Web'' was produced without any involvement from E. B. White's estate.<ref>{{cite web|title=E.B. White's Web| work = Lifestyle section of Bangor Metro|publisher=Webster-Atlantic|date=May 10, 2007|url=http://bangormetro.com/media/Bangor-Metro/May-2007/E-B-Whites-Web/|accessdate=October 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723182320/http://bangormetro.com/media/Bangor-Metro/May-2007/E-B-Whites-Web/|archivedate=July 23, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was the first film based on a book by E. B. White since 2001's ''[[The Trumpet of the Swan (film)|The Trumpet of the Swan]]''.

Major shooting was completed in May 2005. It was filmed on location in [[Greendale, Victoria]] and suburbs in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The fair scene in the story was filmed in [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]] at [[Heidelberg West Football Club]]'s football ground. The school scenes were filmed at Spotswood Primary School.

The talking-animal [[visual effects]] were done by various visual effect studios such as [[Rising Sun Pictures]], Fuel International, Proof, [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]] (which also animated 1999's ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'', another film based on an E. B. White book, as well as its 2002 sequel ''[[Stuart Little 2]]''), Digital Pictures Iloura and Tippett Studio. The visual effects supervisor for the film was [[John Berton]], who noted that a live-action version of ''Charlotte's Web'' has become much more practical in recent years due to advances in technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Filming in "Radiant" Victoria Australia|work=About the Film.

The three geese which appeared in the movie were procured local to the Nillumbik Shire, Victoria from the Burford Family Farm in Hurstbridge. These were hand raised by the Burford Family, before being sold to the producers for the princely sum of $50AUD and euthanized in order to allow the movie's taxidermist to prepare the geese for filming. This arrangement led to controversy following the release of the film after one of the breeders was accused of deliberately conducting a "ram-raid" of the local ANZ.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The site's critical consensus reads, "Kids will be entertained by the straightforward plot and cute animals, and adults will be charmed by how quiet and humble the production is, a fine translation of E.B. White's genteel prose."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/charlottes_web/|title=Charlotte's Web (2006)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/charlottes-web Charlotte's Web Reviews - Metacritic]</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore|publisher=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

[[Michael Medved]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it "irresistible" and "glowing with goodness". Medved also said that Dakota Fanning's performance was "delightfully spunky".<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlotte's Web|url=https://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/review.jsp?pid=3649|last=Medved|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Medved|work=Michael Medved's Eye on Entertainment|publisher=MichaelMedved.com|date=December 15, 2006|access-date=December 18, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160131/http://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/review.jsp?pid=3649|archive-date=September 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' stated that the film was "a bit noisy" but praised the director for putting "the book, in all its glorious tall-tale reverence, right up on screen." He later went on to say that "What hooks you from the start is Dakota Fanning's unfussy passion as Fern."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|title=Movie Review: Charlotte's Web|work =[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/movie/0,6115,1569403_1_0_,00.html|date=December 15, 2006|access-date=December 18, 2006}}</ref> Conversely, Colm Andrew of the [[Manx Independent]] gave the film a score of 6/10, saying that the main problem was "the ultra-cute characterisation of Wilbur, resulting in half the audience rooting for his demise" although overall it was "a competent retelling of a classic story that won't offend".<ref>[http://www.iomtoday.co.im/what-where-when/FILMREVIEW-A-SUGARCOATED-WEB.2052021.jp Review by Colm Andrew] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214122657/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/what-where-when/FILMREVIEW-A-SUGARCOATED-WEB.2052021.jp |date=February 14, 2009 }}, IOM Today</ref>
