'''Chatham House,''' also known as the '''Royal Institute of International Affairs''', is an independent policy institute headquartered in [[London]]. Its mission is to provide authoritative commentary on world events and offer solutions to global challenges. It is the originator of the [[Chatham House Rule]]. Its presidents are [[Baroness Manningham-Buller]], [[Alistair Darling|Lord Darling of Roulanish]] and [[Sir John Major]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Our Governance|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-governance|access-date=2020-10-26|website=Chatham House – International Affairs Think Tank|language=en}}</ref>

==Overview==
Canadian [[philanthropist]]s Colonel [[Reuben Wells Leonard]] and Kate Rowlands Leonard purchased the property in 1923, donating the building as a headquarters for the fledgling organization that then became known as Chatham House.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ziff |first1=Bruce H. |title=Unforeseen Legacies: Reuben Wells Leonard and the Leonard Foundation Trust |date=January 1, 2000 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7L-VKEh-i4C&pg=PA52 |accessdate=10 July 2020}}</ref>
 
Drawing upon its members, Chatham House aims to promote debate on significant developments in international affairs and policy responses. Its independent research and analysis on global, regional and country-specific challenges is intended to offer new ideas to decision-makers on how these can best be tackled in the near to long term. Chatham House is routinely used as an authority and source of information by media organisations seeking background knowledge or expertise on matters involving major international issues.

Chatham House is membership-based, with a range of membership options for [[corporations]], [[academic institutions]], [[NGOs]], and individuals, including students and under-30s. In addition to corporate members consisting of government departments, large corporations, academic institutions, investment banks, NGOs, energy companies and other organisations, Chatham House's individual members currently include international leaders from business, diplomacy, science, politics and media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/become-member |title=Become a member |work=Chatham House}}</ref>

==Chatham House Rule==
{{Main|Chatham House Rule}}
Chatham House is the origin of the non-attribution rule known as the [[Chatham House Rule]], which provides that attendees of meetings may discuss the content of the meeting in the outside world, but may not discuss who attended or identify what a specific individual said. The Chatham House Rule evolved to facilitate frank and honest discussion on controversial or unpopular issues by speakers who may not have otherwise had the appropriate forum to speak freely. Despite this, most meetings at Chatham House are held [[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|on the record]], and not under the Chatham House Rule.

==Research and publications==
Chatham House research is structured around five thematic programmes, comprising: energy, environment and resources; global economy and finance; global health security; international law; and international security; as well as six regional programmes, covering Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Russia and Eurasia, and the US and Americas.

Chatham House also contains the Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy, which focuses on the political economy of resource production and consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-people/bernice-lee|title=Bernice Lee|website=Chatham House – International Affairs Think Tank}}</ref>

===Speakers===
Chatham House also hosts international speakers, such as [[Shinzō Abe]], [[Abdulqawi Yusuf|Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf]], [[Saad Hariri]], [[Filipe Nyusi]], [[Barham Salih]], [[Katrín Jakobsdóttir]] and [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/events|title=Chatham House Events|author=Chatham House|first=|date=September 2016|website=|publisher=TheatreSmart.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 December 2019|display-authors=}}</ref>

===Periodical publications===
Chatham House also produces the policy journal ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'' as well as a bi-monthly magazine, ''[[The World Today (magazine)|The World Today]]''. ''The World Today'' is represented for syndication by Tribune Content Agency, a subsidiary of The Tribune Company.

==Chatham House Prize==

The Chatham House Prize is an annual award presented to "the person, persons or organization deemed by members of Chatham House to have made the most significant contribution to the improvement of international relations in the previous year".<ref name="CHPrize">{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/events/chatham-house-prize|title=Chatham House Prize|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Chatham House|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>

==Venue==
[[File:Chatham House over the Jubilee weekend (7345325368).jpg|thumb|Chatham House in 2012]]
Chatham House takes its name from the building where it is based, a [[Grade I listed]] 18th-century house in [[St James's Square]], designed in part by [[Henry Flitcroft]] and occupied by three British Prime Ministers, including [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].

==History==

=== Origins ===
The Royal Institute of International Affairs finds its origins in a meeting, convened by [[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]], of the American and British delegates to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] on 30 May 1919. Curtis had long been an advocate for the scientific study of international affairs and, following the beneficial exchange of information after the peace conference, argued that the method of expert analysis and debate should be continued when the delegates returned home in the form of international institute.<ref>{{harvp|Carrington|2004|p=47}}</ref>
[[File:Lionel Curtis.jpg|Lionel Curtis|thumb|150px|left|[[Lionel George Curtis|Lionel Curtis]] was instrumental in the founding of Chatham House.]]
Ultimately, the British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the Americans developing the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in [[New York City|New York]].

The British Institute of International Affairs, as it was then known, held its inaugural meeting, chaired by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]], on 5 July 1920. In this, former Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] moved the resolution calling the institute into existence:

''"That an Institute be constituted for the study of International Questions, to be called the British Institute of International Affairs."''<ref name="Carrington_48">{{harvp|Carrington|2004|p=48}}</ref>

These two, along with [[Arthur Balfour|Arthur J. Balfour]] and [[J. R. Clynes|John R. Clynes]], became the first Presidents of the Institute, with Lionel Curtis and [[Geoffrey Malcolm Gathorne-Hardy|G. M. Gathorne–Hardy]] appointed joint Honorary Secretaries.<ref name="Carrington_48"/>

By 1922, as the Institute's membership grew, there was a need for a larger and more practical space and the Institute acquired, through the gift of Canadian [[Reuben Wells Leonard|Colonel R. W. Leonard]], Chatham House, Number 10 [[St. James's Square]], where the Institute is still housed.<ref name="Carrington_50">{{harvp|Carrington|2004|p=50}}</ref>

=== Inter-war years ===
Following its inception, the Institute quickly focused upon Edward Grey's resolution, with the 1920s proving an active decade at Chatham House. The journal ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'' was launched in January 1922, allowing for the international circulation of the various reports and discussions which took place within the Institute.<ref name="Carrington_50"/>

After being appointed as Director of Studies, Professor [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]] became the leading figure producing the Institute's annual Survey of International Affairs, a role he held until his retirement in 1955. While providing a detailed annual overview of international relations, the survey's primary role was ‘to record current international history’.<ref>'Report of the Council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs to the 7th AGM' in ''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports 1926-1931'', (London: Chatham House, 1931), p. 3.</ref> The survey continued until 1963 and was well received throughout the Institution, coming to be known as ‘the characteristic external expression of Chatham House research: a pioneer in method and a model for scholarship.’<ref>'Report of the Council of the Royal Institute of International Affairs to the 7th AGM' in ''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports 1926-1931'', (London: Chatham House, 1931), p. 11.</ref>

In 1926, 14 members of Chatham House represented the [[United Kingdom]] at the first conference of the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]], a forum dedicated to the discussion of problems and relations between Pacific nations.<ref>'Report of the 8th AGM' in ''Annual Reports 1926-1931'', p. 3</ref> The IPR served as a platform for the Institute to develop an advanced political and commercial awareness of the region, with special focus being placed upon China's economic development and international relations.<ref>'Report of the 11th AGM' in ''Annual Reports 1926-1931'', p. 31.</ref>

In the same year the Institute received its [[royal charter]], thereupon being known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The Charter set out the aims and objectives of the Institute, reaffirming its wish to ‘advance the sciences of international politics...promote the study and investigation of international questions by means of lectures and discussion…promote the exchange of information, knowledge and thought on international affairs.’<ref>'Report of the 11th AGM' in ''Annual Reports 1926-1931'', pp. 5 - 6.</ref>

==Further expansion==
1929 marked the next stage in the Institute's development, with the appointment of a full-time chief executive or director. [[Ivison Macadam]] was appointed to the position (Secretary and then Director-General),<ref>''Chatham House: Its History and Inhabitants'', [[C. E. Carrington]], Revised and updated by Mary Bone, ''The Royal Institute of International Affairs'', 2004.</ref> in which he oversaw the Institute's rapid expansion with its growing research, organisational and financial needs.<ref>Obituary of Ivison Macadam published in '' The Times '', London, 31 December 1974 by [[Kenneth Younger]]</ref> A role he occupied until 1955.

Macadam was able to secure funding to expand the physical plant of the Institute by acquiring the freeholds of 6 Duke of York Street, then called York Street, (largely through the generosity of [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]], [[Sir John Power, 1st Baronet|John Power]] and others) and later 9 St James's Square, then [[Portland Club (London)|the Portland Club]], in 1943 (through a donation to cover its purchase by [[Henry Price (tailor)|Henry Price]]), and connect these adjoining properties to the original freehold property of Chatham House at 10, St James Square (with the cost of these connections covered by Astor's sons, William, David and John). Power also donated his leasehold property in Chesham Place to the Institute in 1938. These additional properties provided much needed additional space for the Institute's activities.<ref>The Institute then owned the freeholds covering a rectangle of properties fronting on 10 and 9 in St. James’s Square on the south running north bordered on the east by Duke of York Street to the properties on Ormand Yard on the north (the mews immediately south of Jermyn Street). These freehold properties also later proved to be a valuable financial asset when in the 1960s the northern properties were redeveloped to provide additional annual income for the Institute. ''Chatham House: Its History and Inhabitants'', C. E. Carrington, Revised and updated by Mary Bone, ''The Royal Institute of International Affairs'', 2004.</ref>

1929 also saw the inception of the Institute's special study group on the international gold problem. The group, which included leading economists such as [[John Maynard Keynes]], conducted a three-year study into the developing economic issues which the post-war international monetary settlement created.<ref>{{cite web |title=The International Gold Problem, 1931-2011 |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/research/economics/current-projects/international-gold-problem-1931-2011 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref>  The group's research anticipated Britain's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]] two years later.<ref name="Kisch">{{cite web |last=Kisch |first=C.H. |title=The Gold Problem |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/International%20Economics/1931kisch.pdf |publisher=Chatham House |accessdate=2014-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626013039/http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/International%20Economics/1931kisch.pdf |archive-date=26 June 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Around this time Chatham House became known as the place for leading statesmen and actors in world affairs to visit when in London; notably, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited the institute on 20 October 1931, in which he delivered a talk on ‘The Future of India’. The talk was attended by 750 members, making it the Institute's largest meeting up to that point.<ref name="Angell"/>

[[File:Committee of Reconstruction, 1943..jpg|thumb|Committee of Post-War Reconstruction meeting in the Institute's Common Room, 1943.]]

In 1933 [[Norman Angell]], whilst working within the Institute's Council, was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his book ''[[The Great Illusion]]'', making him the first and only Laureate to be awarded the prize for publishing a book.<ref name="Angell">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1933/angell-facts.html |title=Sir Norman Angell - Facts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1967-10-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>

Chatham House held the first Commonwealth Relations Conference in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]] in 1933. Held roughly every five years, the conference provided a forum for leading politicians, lawyers, academics and others to discuss the implications of recent Imperial Conferences.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McIntyre |first=W. David |year=2008 |title=The Unofficial Commonwealth Relations Conferences, 1933–59: Precursors of the Tri-sector Commonwealth |journal=[[Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History]] |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=591–614 |doi=10.1080/03086530802560992 |ref=harv}}</ref> With various dominion nations seeking to follow individual foreign policy aims, Major-General Sir [[Neill Malcolm]], the chairman of the Council of the Institute,<ref>Chatham House: Its History and Inhabitants, C.E.Carrington and Mary Bone, Royal Institute of International Affairs, 2004. p 114.</ref> emphasised the need for "essential agreement in matters of foreign policy between the various Governments," with the Commonwealth Relations Conference being the vehicle upon which this cooperation would be achieved and maintained.<ref>'Report of the 13th AGM' in ''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports 1931-1932'', pp. 9-10.</ref>

In 1937, Robert Cecil was also awarded the Nobel Prize for his commitment to, and defence of, the [[League of Nations]] and the pursuit for peace and disarmament amongst its members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1937/chelwood-facts.html |title=Robert Cecil - Facts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1958-11-24 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>

=== War years, 1939–1945 ===
At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] the Institute, under the Chairmanship of [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]],<ref>Chatham House: Its history and inhabitants, C. E. Carrington and Mary Bone, Royal Institute of International Affairs, p 114</ref> was decentralised for security reasons, with many of the staff moving to [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. There, the Foreign Press and Research Service of the Institute worked closely with the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] who requested various reports on foreign press, historical and political background of the enemy and various other topics supervised by [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]],<ref>Chatham House and British Foreign Policy, 1919-1945, Edited by Andrea Bosco & Cornelia Nevari, Lothian Foundation Press, 1994, p146.</ref> dedicating their research to the war effort.<ref name="Carrington_63_64">{{harvp|Carrington|2004|pp=63-64}}</ref>

The Institute also provided many additional services to scholars and the armed forces at its St. James's Square home. Research facilities were opened to refugee and allied academics, whilst arrangements were made for both the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] and the Polish Research Centre to relocate to the Institute following the bombing of their premises. In addition, allied officers undertook courses in international affairs at the Institute in an attempt to develop their international and political awareness as well as post war reconstruction planning.<ref name="Carrington_63_64"/>

=== The post-war years ===
Chatham House had been researching potential post-war issues as early as 1939 through the Committee on Reconstruction.<ref name="Carrington_63_64"/> Whilst a number of staff returned to the Institute at the end of the war, a proportion of members found themselves joining a range of international organisations, including the [[United Nations]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Combining this with the Institute's early support of the League of Nations and impact of the gold study on the [[Bretton Woods system]], Chatham House found itself to be a leading actor in international political and economic redevelopment.<ref name="Carrington_63_64"/>

[[File:Margaret Thatcher at the door of Chatham House..jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Margaret Thatcher]] leaving Chatham House after attending the 'Inside Saudi Arabia: Society, Economy and Defence' conference, October 1993.]]

In reaction to the changing post-war world, Chatham House embarked on a number of studies relating to Britain and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]'s new political stature, in light of growing calls for [[Decolonization|decolonisation]] and the development of the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Julius |first=Dr. DeAnne |title=Impartial and International |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/General/1110turkey_julius.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018082730/http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/General/1110turkey_julius.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-10-18 |publisher=Chatham House |accessdate=2014-01-24}}</ref> A board of studies in race relations was created in 1953, allowing for the close examination of changing attitudes and calls for racial equality throughout the world. The group broke off into an independent charity in 1958, forming the [[Institute of Race Relations (United Kingdom)|Institute of Race Relations]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/about/ |title=About &#124; Institute of Race Relations |publisher=Irr.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref>

Following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|Brazilian coup d'état]], the institute developed a growing focus on the Latin American region. [[Che Guevara]], then [[Cuba]]'s Minister of Industry, wrote an analysis of ‘The Cuban Economy: Its Past and Present Importance’ in 1964 for ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'', displaying the Institute's desire to tackle the most difficult international issues.<ref>''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports, 1964-1965'', p. 3.</ref>

Chatham House played a more direct role in the international affairs of the [[Cold War]] through the October 1975 Anglo-Soviet round-table, the first in a series of meetings between Chatham House and the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]] in Moscow. As an early example of [[Track II diplomacy|two-track diplomacy]], the meeting sought to develop closer communication and improved relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, one of the first such attempts in the Cold War.<ref>''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports, 1975-1976'', p. 3.</ref>

Soon after the first Anglo-Soviet round-table, the Institute began an intensive research project into ‘British Foreign Policy to 1985’. Its primary aim was to analyse the foreign policy issues which Britain would encounter in the near and far future. Research began in 1976 and the findings were published in ''[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]]'' between 1977 and 1979.

At the start of the 1980s, the Council moved to expand the Institute's research capabilities in two key emerging areas. The first modern programmes to be created under this initiative were the Energy and Research Programme and the International Economics Programme, formed in 1980 - 1981.<ref>''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports, 1980–1981'', p. 9.</ref>

In addition to reshaping its research practices, the Institute also sought to strengthen its international network, notably amongst economically prosperous nations. For example, Chatham House's Far East programme, created with the intention of improving Anglo-Japanese relations in the long and short term, was bolstered by the support of the Japan 2000 group in 1984.<ref>''The Royal Institute of International Affairs Annual Reports, 1984-1985'', p. 7.</ref>

=== Recent history ===
The Institute celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1995, an event marked by the visit of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. During her visit, the Queen was briefed by the Institute's experts on [[South Africa]] in preparation for her impending visit to the country, following the end of [[apartheid]].

In 1998, the Angola Forum was created. Its oil reserves, combined with growing international ambition, facilitated [[Angola]]'s quick ascent as an influential African nation, resulting in Chatham House launching the Forum to create an international platform for "forward looking, policy focused and influential debate and research".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/structure/africa-programme/angola-forum-project|title=Angola Forum|work=Chatham House}}</ref> The Institute's wider Africa Programme was created in 2002, beginning the modern structure of area studies programmes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/structure/africa-programme/|title=Africa Programme|work=Chatham House}}</ref>

In 2005, ''Security, Terrorism and the UK'' was published.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org//node/13351 |title=International Security Department |author= |date= |website=Chatham House}}</ref> The publication, which links the UK's participation in the Iraq War and the nation's exposure to terrorism, gained significant media attention.{{cn|date=July 2020}}
