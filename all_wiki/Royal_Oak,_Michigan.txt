'''Royal Oak''' is a city in [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 57,236.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Royal Oak city, Michigan| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| access-date=August 19, 2011}}</ref> 

The city is located along the [[Woodward Corridor]], and [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] and [[Interstate 696]] also pass through Royal Oak. As a northern suburb of [[Metro Detroit]], the city is about {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} north of the city of [[Detroit]]. Portions of the [[Detroit Zoo]] are within Royal Oak, extending into neighboring [[Huntington Woods, Michigan|Huntington Woods]].  

==History==
Early Europeans in this area near Fort Detroit in the 18th century were mostly French Canadians; some traded with the [[Sauk people|Sauk]], [[Wyandot people|Huron]], and other Native Americans in the area. After defeating France in the [[Seven Years' War]], Great Britain took control of their territory east of the Mississippi River, including Fort Detroit and environs. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain promoted development of what was then called Upper Canada and Province of Quebec, across the Detroit and St. Clair rivers to the south and east.

Royal Oak was not incorporated as a village until 1891. It was designated a city in 1921. Royal Oak was named in 1819, during one of the surveying expeditions led by Territorial Governor [[Lewis Cass]]. A large oak tree at this small settlement reminded Cass of the story of the [[Royal Oak]], where [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] of England was said to have hid to escape capture by the [[Roundhead]]s after the [[Battle of Worcester]]. Cass named the settlement after that, several years after the United States had fought Great Britain across the northern border in the [[War of 1812]].

===20th century to present===
[[File:ShrineoftheLittleFlowerRPC.jpg|thumb|left|Shrine of the Little Flower]]
Royal Oak developed as a suburb of Detroit in the early 20th century, following Detroit's booming growth as a result of industrialization and its auto industry.

The Royal Oak Farmers Market opened as a truck market, at the corner of 4th and Troy streets, on October 14, 1925 as a cooperative venture between the then-new City of Royal Oak and [[Oakland County, Michigan]]. There were still numerous farmers in the county. The present structure, at the corner of 11 Mile Road and Troy Street, is adjacent to the 44th District Court. It was erected in the spring of 1927 and dedicated July 1 of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ci.royal-oak.mi.us/farmersmarket|title=Farmers Market {{!}} City of Royal Oak|website=www.ci.royal-oak.mi.us|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>

In the 1920s, Father [[Charles Coughlin]], a Canadian Catholic priest who relocated to Detroit, became the founding pastor of the [[National Shrine of the Little Flower|Shrine of the Little Flower]], now a prominent landmark in the city. Through his ministry, he raised funds to build the present [[limestone]] church complex and tower. Initially he broadcast religious speeches from this site.

During the 1930s, his broadcasts became more political. He initially supported President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], then opposed him and promoted the causes of the fascist leaders of Germany and Italy. The Roosevelt administration closed down his radio operation after the outbreak of World War II, with support from the Catholic hierarchy. Coughlin had developed national political influence and had an increasingly anti-semitic message, at a time when Jewish people were being severely persecuted in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=43|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714134848/http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=43|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|title=Father Charles E.

The downtown originally had a typical mixture of small-scale retail and trade to serve the city of Royal Oak. With the development of the highway system in the postwar period, it lost business to suburban malls. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, Royal Oak's downtown has developed as an entertainment and nightlife destination. A number of large condominiums and lofts have been built in the area, increasing the density of the downtown population.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|11.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|11.78|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (0.08%) is water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-24.pdf|format=PDF |title=Michigan: 2010 Population and Housing Unit Counts 2010 Census of Population and Housing | date = September 2012|publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]]| work = [[2010 United States Census]]| access-date = May 1, 2020|page=37 Michigan}}</ref>

Royal Oak developed around a river, the Red Run. Vinsetta Boulevard was built skirting a source branch of the Red Run for its median. In the 1930s, Vinsetta's entire median, along with the river and all but the tops of the bridges for the crossing streets<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicbridges.org/bridges/browser/?bridgebrowser=michigan/greenleaf|title=HistoricBridges.org - Bridge Not Found|website=www.historicbridges.org|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> were filled in as part of a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA project]] during the Great Depression. During 1967–8, the rest of the river in Oakland County was buried within a six-foot drain pipe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coheadquarters.com/PennLibr/HistoricRO/Muller1.htm |title=A Run Ran Through It: Red Run, The Ghost River of Royal Oak |publisher=CO Headquarters |author=Penney, David G.

==Economy==
{{Further|Economy of metropolitan Detroit}}

Royal Oak developed initially as a suburb after Detroit boomed as a major industrial city. People began to move to the suburbs for newer housing, especially after World War II. It had a compact, traditional street-side shopping district, which runs along Main Street and Washington Avenue downtown. During the 2000s, this area was redeveloped with numerous new businesses, and is now considered a trendy, upscale, urban-chic district, featuring restaurants, shopping, and entertainment. A number of mixed-use high-rise developments have been constructed — mostly condo "lofts" with retail and office space on the lower levels.

Points of interest include the [[Detroit Zoo]], a major regional tourist attraction, the [[William Beaumont Hospital]], the Royal Oak Music Theatre, the Main Art Theatre, the Baldwin Theatre, Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle, Emagine Theater, and shops, cafes, and restaurants. The main offices of Hour Detroit media, which publishes [[Metro Detroit]]'s lifestyle magazine, are located in the city.

The [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] has awarded Royal Oak the distinction of "Tree City USA" every year since 1976 as a result of the city's commitment to [[tree planting]] and preservation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/map.cfm|title=Tree City USA Directory - The Arbor Day Foundation|website=arborday.org|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>

The Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program is a foundation set up by Detroit-area native [[Gilda Radner]], who is known for her work as a comedian of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In 1998 the Program created a free cancer support community for people with cancer, their families, and friends. [[Gilda's Club]] Metro Detroit operates a three-story non-residential house in Royal Oak. It has served more than 3,000 members for social and emotional support through a variety of activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gildasclubdetroit.org/|title=Gilda's Club Detroit {{!}} Royal Oak, MI|website=Gilda's Club|language=en-US|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>

Major employers in Royal Oak include William Beaumont Hospital with 7,147 employees, The City of Royal Oak with 465 employees, Royal Oak Public Schools with 482 employees, Oakland Community College with 448 employees, Consumers Energy with 351 employees, Flex-N-Gate with 350 employees, the Detroit Zoo with 301 employees, Holiday Market with 300 employees, and HHI- Form Tech with 290 employees.

==Education==
The city is served by [[Royal Oak Neighborhood Schools]]. There is also a private high school, Shrine Catholic. A branch of [[Oakland Community College]] is located in the city.

A portion of land in the city is zoned to Berkley Public Schools.

In recent years Royal Oak has begun to consolidate its public schools in response to a decline in enrollment levels compared to the [[baby boom]] era. In 2006, the city's two public high schools, [[Dondero High School|George A. Dondero High School]] and [[Clarence M. Kimball High School]], were combined into a new [[Royal Oak High School]]. Beginning in 2007, the city's two middle schools were combined into one school, Royal Oak Middle School. The number of elementary schools was reduced to six.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.royaloakschools.com/portal/consolidationinformation|title=Consolidation Information {{!}} Royal Oak Schools|website=www.royaloakschools.com|access-date=May 4, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311080708/http://royaloakschools.com/portal/consolidationinformation|archive-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> Some parents protested the planned closure and demolition of Longfellow and Whittier elementary schools. They were seeking to have them considered for historic district recognition by way of signed petition.<ref name=":0" /> Despite their efforts, both schools and a number of other former elementary schools were demolished in the fall of 2007.

The Royal Oak school system gained brief notoriety for an incident following the Trump election. Some middle schoolers chanted "build that wall". A student video of the incident was widely shared on [[Facebook]], attracting more than 4 million views within 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/oakland-county/2016/11/10/royal-oak-students-chant-build-wall-cafeteria/93581592/|title=Royal Oak Middle School students chant 'Build the wall'|newspaper=Detroit News|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref> A week later a noose was found in the 8th grade boys bathroom at the middle school.
