{{Short description|Guarantee of law protecting all persons equally in the United States}}{{US Constitution article series}}{{United States constitutional law}}
The '''Equal Protection Clause''' is from the text of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. The clause, which took effect in 1868, provides "nor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws". It mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHj_0R2rbxAC&q=%22Equal+Protection+Clause+similarly%22+encyclopedia&pg=PA153|title =Equal protection of the laws|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of American Law|publisher=Infobase|last=Failinger|first=Marie|editor-first=David Andrew|editor-last=Schultz|pages=152–53|isbn=9781438109916|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724001052/https://books.google.de/books?id=EHj_0R2rbxAC&pg=PA153&dq=%22Equal+Protection+Clause+similarly%22+encyclopedia&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiR3OXkq-TqAhUQiIsKHfiVCyEQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%22Equal%20Protection%20Clause%20similarly%22%20encyclopedia&f=false|archive-date=July 24, 2020|quote="The equal protection clause guarantees the right of "similarly situated" people to be treated the same way by the law."}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fair Treatment by the Government: Equal Protection |url=https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/fair-treatment-by-the-government-equal-protec |website=GeorgiaLegalAid.org |publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government at University of Georgia |access-date=July 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320205514/https://www.georgialegalaid.org/resource/fair-treatment-by-the-government-equal-protec |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |date=July 30, 2004 |quote="The basic intent of equal protection is to make sure that people are treated as equally as possible under our legal system.

A primary motivation for this clause was to validate the equality provisions contained in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], which guaranteed that all citizens would have the guaranteed right to equal protection by law. As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism, by applying substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

The meaning of the Equal Protection Clause has been the subject of much debate, and inspired the well-known phrase "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]". This clause was the basis for ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that helped to dismantle [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], and also the basis for many other decisions rejecting discrimination against, and bigotry towards people belonging to various groups.

While the Equal Protection Clause itself applies only to state and local governments, the Supreme Court held in ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954) that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] nonetheless imposes various equal protection requirements on the federal government via [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights#Reverse incorporation|reverse incorporation]].

==Text==
The Equal Protection Clause is located at the end of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; ''nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws''. [emphasis added]}}

==Background==
[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|right|thumb|Congressman [[John Bingham]] of [[Ohio]] was the principal framer of the Equal Protection Clause.]]
Though equality under the law is an American legal tradition arguably dating to the Declaration of Independence,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Antieau|first=Chester James|date=1952|title=Equal Protection outside the Clause|journal=California Law Review|volume=40|issue=3|pages=362–377|doi=10.2307/3477928|jstor=3477928|url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol40/iss3/2}}</ref> formal equality for many groups remained elusive. Before passage of the Reconstruction Amendments, which included the Equal Protection Clause, American law did not extend constitutional rights to Black Americans.<ref name=":52">{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/60/393/#tab-opinion-1964281|title=Dred Scott v.

Even Black Americans that were [[Free Negro|not enslaved]] lacked many crucial legal protections.<ref name=":52" /> In the 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, the Supreme Court rejected [[abolitionism]] and determined Black men, whether free or in bondage, had no legal rights under the U.S. Constitution at the time.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Dred Scott, 150 Years Ago|journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|issue=55|pages=19|jstor=25073625}}</ref> Currently, a plurality of historians believe that this judicial decision set the United States on the path to the Civil War, which led to the ratifications of the Reconstruction Amendments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swisher|first=Carl Brent|date=1957|title=Dred Scott One Hundred Years After|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167–183|doi=10.2307/2127194|jstor=2127194|s2cid=154345582}}</ref> &nbsp;

Before and during the Civil War, the Southern states prohibited speech of pro-Union citizens, anti-slavery advocates, and northerners in general, since the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights did not apply to the states]] during such times. During the Civil War, many of the Southern states stripped the state citizenship of many whites and banished them from their state, effectively seizing their property.
Shortly after the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]], the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was proposed by Congress and [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratified]] by the states in 1865, [[Abolitionism|abolishing]] [[slavery]]. Subsequently, many ex-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states then adopted [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] following the war, with these laws severely restricting the rights of blacks to hold [[property]], including [[real property]] (such as [[real estate]]), and many forms of [[personal property]], and to form legally enforceable [[contracts]]. Such codes also established harsher [[Punishment|criminal consequences]] for blacks than for whites.<ref>For details on the rationale for, and ratification of, the Fourteenth Amendment, see generally {{cite book |title=Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863—1877 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780060158514 |url-access=registration |last=Foner |first=Eric |author-link=Eric Foner |year=1988 |publisher=Harper & Row |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-091453-0 }}, as well as {{cite book |title=Processes of Constitutional Decisionmaking |last=Brest |first=Paul |year=2000 |publisher=Aspen Law & Business |location=Gaithersburg |isbn=978-0-7355-1250-4 |pages=241–242 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Because of the inequality imposed by Black Codes, a Republican controlled Congress enacted the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. The Act provided that all persons born in the United States were citizens (contrary to the Supreme Court's 1857 decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]''), and required that "citizens of every [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and color ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens."<ref>See Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 242–46.</ref>

President Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 amid concerns (among other things) that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to enact such bill. Such doubts were one factor that led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).</ref><ref>Newman, Roger. ''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).</ref> Additionally, Congress wanted to protect [[Scalawag|white Unionists]] who were under personal and legal attack in the former Confederacy.<ref>Hardy, David. "Original Popular Understanding of the 14th Amendment As Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-68", Whittier Law Review, Vol. 30, p. 695 (2008-2009).</ref> The effort was led by the [[Radical Republicans]] of both houses of Congress, including [[John Bingham]], [[Charles Sumner]], and [[Thaddeus Stevens]]. It was the most influential of these men, John Bingham, who was the principal author and drafter of the Equal Protection Clause.

The [[Southern United States|Southern]] states were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, Section 5, Clause 1 of the Constitution, to "be the Judge of the ... Qualifications of its own Members", had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having rebelled against the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact—the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a "[[Rump legislature|rump]]" Congress—that permitted the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment by Congress and subsequently proposed to the states. The ratification of the amendment by the former Confederate states was imposed as a condition of their acceptance back into the Union.<ref>See Foner (1988), passim.

== Ratification ==
With the return to originalist interpretations of the Constitution, many wonder what was intended by the framers of the reconstruction amendments at the time of their ratification. The 13th amendment abolished slavery but to what extent it protected other rights was unclear.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|author-link1=Michael Zuckert|last=Zuckert|first=Michael P.|date=1992|title=Completing the Constitution: The Fourteenth Amendment and Constitutional Rights|journal=Publius|volume=22|issue=2|pages=69–91|doi=10.2307/3330348|jstor=3330348}}</ref> After the 13th amendment the South began to institute black codes which were restrictive laws seeking to keep Black Americans in a position of inferiority. The 14th amendment was ratified by nervous Republicans in response to the rise of Black codes.<ref name=":3" /> This ratification was irregular in many ways. First there were multiple states that rejected the 14th amendment, but when their new governments were created due to reconstruction, these new governments accepted the amendment.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/307/433/#tab-opinion-1936403|title=Coleman v.

The nullification of the two state's acceptance was considered illegitimate and both Ohio and New Jersey were included in those counted as ratifying the amendment.<ref name=":4" />

Many historians have argued that 14th amendment was not originally intended to grant sweeping political and social rights to the citizens but instead to solidify the constitutionality of the 1866 Civil rights Act.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Perry|first=Michael J.|date=1979|title=Modern Equal Protection: A Conceptualization and Appraisal|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=79|issue=6|pages=1023–1084|doi=10.2307/1121988|jstor=1121988}}</ref> While it is widely agreed that this was a key reason for the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, many historians adopt a much wider view.

Though the equal protection clause is one of the most cited ideas in legal theory, it received little attention during the ratification of the 14th amendment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Frank|first1=John P.|last2=Munro|first2=Robert F.|date=1950|title=The Original Understanding of "Equal Protection of the Laws"|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=50|issue=2|pages=131–169|doi=10.2307/1118709|jstor=1118709|url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4037}}</ref> Instead the key tenet of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification was the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]].<ref name=":0" /> This clause sought to protect the privileges and immunities of all citizens which now included Black men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.launchknowledge.com/constitution/|title=Constitution of the United States - We the People|website=launchknowledge.com|language=en-us}}</ref> The scope of this clause was substantially narrowed following the [[Slaughter-House Cases|Slaughterhouse Cases]] in which it was determined that a citizen's privileges and immunities were only ensured at the Federal level and that it was government overreach to impose this standard on the states.<ref name=":1" /> Even in this halting decision the Court still acknowledged the context in which the Amendment was passed, stating that knowing the evils and injustice the 14th amendment was meant to combat is key in our legal understanding of its implications and purpose.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/83/36/#tab-opinion-1967657|title=Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1872)|work=Justia Law|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en}}</ref> With the abridgment of the Privileges and Immunities clause, legal arguments aimed at protecting Black American's rights became more complex and that is when the equal protection clause started to gain attention for the arguments it could enhance.<ref name=":0" /> &nbsp;

During the debate in Congress, more than one version of the clause was considered. Here is the first version: "The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure ... to all persons in the several states equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property."<ref name="Kelly">Kelly, Alfred. "[http://www.utexas.edu/law/journals/tlr/sources/Issue%2087.1/fn7.kelly.pdf Clio and the Court: An Illicit Love Affair]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}", ''The Supreme Court Review'' at p. 148 (1965) reprinted in ''The Supreme Court in and of the Stream of Power'' (Kermit Hall ed., Psychology Press 2000).</ref> Bingham said about this version: "It confers upon Congress power to see to it that the protection given by the laws of the States shall be equal in respect to life and liberty and property to all persons."<ref name="Kelly" /> The main opponent of the first version was Congressman [[Robert S.

Hale ended up voting for the final version, however. When Senator [[Jacob Howard]] introduced that final version, he said:<ref>Curtis, Michael.

<blockquote>It prohibits the hanging of a black man for a crime for which the white man is not to be hanged. It protects the black man in his fundamental rights as a citizen with the same shield which it throws over the white man. Ought not the time to be now passed when one measure of justice is to be meted out to a member of one caste while another and a different measure is meted out to the member of another caste, both castes being alike citizens of the United States, both bound to obey the same laws, to sustain the burdens of the same Government, and both equally responsible to justice and to God for the deeds done in the body?</blockquote>

The [[39th United States Congress]] proposed the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866.  A difference between the initial and final versions of the clause was that the final version spoke not just of "equal protection" but of "the equal protection of the laws".  John Bingham said in January 1867: "no State may deny to any person the equal protection of the laws, including all the limitations for personal protection of every article and section of the Constitution{{nbsp}}..."<ref>Glidden, William.

==Early history following ratification==
Bingham said in a speech on March 31, 1871 that the clause meant no State could deny to any one "the equal protection of the Constitution of the United States ... [or] any of the rights which it guarantees to all men", nor deny to anyone "any right secured to him either by the laws and treaties of the United States or of such State."<ref>Flack, Horace. ''The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment'', p. 232 (Johns Hopkins Press, 1908).

As for public schooling, no states during this era of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] actually required separate schools for blacks.<ref name=Foner>[[Eric Foner|Foner, Eric]].

==Gilded Age interpretation and the ''Plessy'' decision==
In the United States, the year 1877 marked the end of Reconstruction and the start of the [[Gilded Age]]. The first truly landmark equal protection decision by the Supreme Court was ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'' (1880). A black man convicted of murder by an [[all-white jury]] challenged a [[West Virginia]] [[statute]] excluding blacks from serving on juries. Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been "drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant's] race."  At the same time, the Court explicitly allowed [[sexism]] and other types of discrimination, saying that states "may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment was ever intended to prohibit this. ... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color."<ref>Kerber, Linda.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YAIo1k6SSKcC&pg=PA133 No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship]'', p. 133 (Macmillan, 1999).</ref>

[[Image:The Fuller Court.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Plessy'']]The next important postwar case was the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883), in which the constitutionality of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have "full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, [[common carriers|public conveyances]] on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement." In its opinion, the Court explicated what has since become known as the "[[State action (United States constitutional law)|state action doctrine]]", according to which the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause apply only to acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was "simply a private wrong". [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[John Marshall Harlan]] dissented alone, saying, "I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism." Harlan went on to argue that because (1) "public conveyances on land and water" use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is "a quasi-public employment", and (3) "places of public amusement" are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services ''was'' an act sanctioned by the state.
A few years later, Justice Stanley Matthews wrote the Court's opinion in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'' (1886).<ref>''Yick Wo v. Hopkins'', {{ussc|118|356|1886}}.</ref> In it the word "person" from the 14th Amendment's section has been given the broadest possible meaning by the U.S. Supreme Court:<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18">{{cite web|title=Annotation 18 - Fourteenth Amendment: Section 1 – Rights Guaranteed: Equal Protection of the Laws: Scope and application state action|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation18.html#t94|publisher=FindLaw for Legal Professionals - Law & Legal Information by FindLaw, a Thomson Reuters business|access-date=23 November 2013}}</ref>

<blockquote>These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.</blockquote>

Thus, the Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) [[Alien (law)|legal aliens]] in the United States who are Chinese citizens.

In its most contentious Gilded Age interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a [[Louisiana]] [[Jim Crow law]] that required the [[racial segregation|segregation]] of blacks and whites on [[Rail transport|railroads]] and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races.<ref>For a summary of the social, political and historical background to ''Plessy'', see {{cite book |title=The Strange Career of Jim Crow |last=Woodward |first=C.

Vann Woodward |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514690-5 |pages=6 and pp. 69–70 }}</ref> The Court, speaking through Justice [[Henry B. Brown]], ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in [[civil rights]], not equality in [[social rule|social arrangements]]. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana's railway law amply met that requirement, being based on "the established usages, customs and traditions of the people." Justice Harlan again dissented. "Every one knows," he wrote,

{{quote|that the statute in question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons&nbsp; ... [I]n view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no [[caste]] here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.}}

Such "arbitrary separation" by race, Harlan concluded, was "a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the [[equality before the law]] established by the Constitution."<ref>For a skeptical evaluation of Harlan, see {{cite journal |last=Chin |first=Gabriel J. |year=1996 |title=The ''Plessy'' Myth: Justice Harlan and the Chinese Cases |journal=Iowa Law Review |volume=82 |page=151 |issn=0021-0552 |ssrn=1121505 }}</ref> Harlan's philosophy of [[constitutional colorblindness]] would eventually become more widely accepted, especially after [[World War II]].

It was also in the Gilded Age that a ruling by the Supreme Court included [[headnote]]s written by John C. Bancroft, a former railway company president. Bancroft, acting as [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States|court reporter]], indicated in the headnotes that corporations were "persons", while the actual court decision itself avoided specific statements regarding the Equal Protection Clause as applied to corporations.<ref>See ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/118/394/case.html Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]'', {{ussc|118|394|1886}}. In the summary of the case Bancroft wrote that the Court declared that it did not need to hear argument on whether the Equal Protection Clause protected corporations, because "we are all of the opinion that it does." Id. at 396.  Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] announced from the bench that the Court would not hear argument on the question whether the equal protection clause applied to corporations: "We are all of the opinion that it does." The background and developments from this utterance are treated in H. Graham, Everyman's Constitution--Historical Essays on the Fourteenth Amendment, the ''Conspiracy Theory,'' and American Constitutionalism (1968), chs. 9, 10, and pp. 566-84. Justice [[Hugo Black]], in Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. v. Johnson, 303 U.S. 77, 85 (1938), and Justice [[William O. Douglas]], in Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, 337 U.S. 562, 576 (1949), have disagreed that corporations are persons for equal protection purposes.</ref> However, the legal concept of [[corporate personhood]] predates the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>See ''Providence Bank v. Billings'', {{ussc|29|514|1830}}, in which Chief Justice Marshall wrote: "The great object of an incorporation is to bestow the character and properties of individuality on a collective and changing body of men." Nevertheless, the concept of corporate personhood remains controversial.

==Between ''Plessy'' and ''Brown''==
[[Image:EqualJusticeUnderLaw.jpg|right|thumb|The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court Building]] opened in 1935, inscribed with the words "[[Equal justice under law|Equal Justice Under Law]]" which were inspired by the Equal Protection Clause.<ref>Feldman, Noah. ''Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR's Great Supreme Court Justices'', p. 145 (Hachette Digital 2010).</ref>]]In ''[[Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada]]'' (1938), [[Lloyd Gaines]] was a black student at [[Lincoln University of Missouri]], one of the [[historically black colleges]] in [[Missouri]]. He applied for admission to the law school at the all-white [[University of Missouri]], since Lincoln did not have a law school, but was denied admission due solely to his race. The Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of ''Plessy'', held that a State offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.

In ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948), the Court showed increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. The ''Shelley'' case concerned a privately made contract that prohibited "people of the Negro or Mongolian race" from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of ''The Civil Rights Cases'', the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts' ''enforcement'' of such a contract could; after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.

The companion cases ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' and ''[[McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents]]'', both decided in 1950, paved the way for a series of school integration cases. In ''McLaurin'', the [[University of Oklahoma]] had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Fred M. Vinson]], said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:

{{quote|There is a vast difference—a Constitutional difference—between restrictions imposed by the state which prohibit the intellectual commingling of students, and the refusal of individuals to commingle where the state presents no such bar.}}

The present situation, Vinson said, was the former. In ''Sweatt'', the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas's state system of [[law school]]s, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system—not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not ''equal''. They lacked "substantial equality in the educational opportunities" offered to their students.

All of these cases, as well as the upcoming ''Brown'' case, were litigated by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]. It was [[Charles Hamilton Houston]], a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate and law professor at [[Howard University]], who in the 1930s first began to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts. [[Thurgood Marshall]], a former student of Houston's and the future [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] and [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], joined him. Both men were extraordinarily skilled [[appellate court|appellate]] advocates, but part of their shrewdness lay in their careful choice of ''which'' cases to litigate, selecting the best legal proving grounds for their cause.<ref>See generally {{cite book |title=Origin of the Civil Rights Movements: Black Communities Organizing for Change |last=Morris |first=Aldon D. |year=1986 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-922130-3 }}</ref>

==''Brown'' and its consequences==
{{See also|Brown v. Board of Education}}
In 1954 the contextualization of the equal protection clause would change forever. The Supreme Court itself recognized the gravity of the Brown v Board decision acknowledging that a split decision would be a threat to the role of the Supreme Court and even to the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karlan|first=Pamela S.|title=What Can Brown® do for You?: Neutral Principles and the Struggle over the Equal Protection Clause|date=2009|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1049–1069|jstor=20684748}}</ref> When [[Earl Warren]] became Chief Justice in 1953, ''Brown'' had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling—he had been an extremely successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician before joining the Court—was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional.<ref>For an exhaustive history of the ''Brown'' case from start to finish, see {{cite book |title=Simple Justice |last=Kluger |first=Richard |year=1977 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York |isbn=978-0-394-72255-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/simplejusticehis00klug_0 }}</ref> In that opinion, Warren wrote:

{{quote|To separate [children in grade and high schools] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone ... We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.}}

Warren discouraged other justices, such as [[Robert H. Jackson]], from publishing any concurring opinion; Jackson's draft, which emerged much later (in 1988), included this statement: "Constitutions are easier amended than social customs, and even the North never fully conformed its racial practices to its professions".<ref>Shimsky, MaryJane. ''"Hesitating Between Two Worlds": The Civil Rights Odyssey of Robert H. Jackson'', p. 468 (ProQuest, 2007).</ref><ref>''I Dissent: Great Opposing Opinions in Landmark Supreme Court Cases'', pp. 133–151 (Mark Tushnet, ed. Beacon Press, 2008).</ref> The Court set the case for re-argument on the question of how to implement the decision. In ''[[Brown II]]'', decided in 1954, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local [[board of education|school boards]] and to the [[United States district court|trial courts]] that had originally heard the cases. (''Brown'' was actually a consolidation of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with "all deliberate speed".

[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Court that decided ''Brown'']]Partly because of that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared "[[massive resistance]]" in the South to the desegregation decision, [[racial integration|integration]] did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to ''Brown'' but to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was not until ''[[Green v. School Board of New Kent County]]'' (1968), in which Justice [[William J. Brennan]], writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a "freedom-of-choice" school plan as inadequate. This was a significant decision; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to ''Brown''. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks rarely attended white-identified schools.

In response to ''Green'', many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because [[residential segregation]] was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' approved [[Desegregation busing|busing]] as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students ''between'' [[school district|districts]], instead of merely ''within'' a district. ''Milliken'' basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>For a comprehensive history of school desegregation from ''Brown'' through ''Milliken'' (one on which this article relies for its assertions), see Brest ''et al.'' (2000), pp. 768–794.</ref>

The curtailment of busing in ''Milliken v. Bradley'' is one of several reasons that have been cited to explain why equalized educational opportunity in the United States has fallen short of completion. In the view of various liberal scholars, the election of [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968 meant that the executive branch was no longer behind the Court's constitutional commitments.<ref>For the history of the [[United States|American]] political branches' engagement with the Supreme Court's commitment to desegregation (and vice versa), see {{cite book |title=The Warren Court and American Politics |url=https://archive.org/details/warrencourtameri00powe |url-access=registration |last=Powe |first=Lucas A., Jr. |year=2001 |publisher=Belknap Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-674-00683-6 }}, and {{cite book |title=Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America |last=Kotz |first=Nick |year=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-618-08825-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/judgmentdayslynd00kotz }} For more on the debate summarized in the text, see, e.g., {{cite book |title=The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change? |last=Rosenberg |first=Gerald N. |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-72703-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hollowhope00gera }}, and {{cite journal |last=Klarman |first=Michael J. |year=1994 |title=''Brown'', Racial Change, and the Civil Rights Movement |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=80 |issue=1|pages=7–150 |doi=10.2307/1073592 |jstor= 1073592 }}</ref> Also, the Court itself decided in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973) that the Equal Protection Clause allows—but does not require—a state to provide equal educational funding to all students within the state.<ref>Reynolds, Troy. "Education Finance Reform Litigation and Separation of Powers: Kentucky Makes Its Contribution," ''Kentucky Law Journal'', Vol. 80 (1991): 309, 310.</ref> Moreover, the Court's decision in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) allowed families to opt out of public schools, despite "inequality in economic resources that made the option of private schools available to some and not to others", as [[Martha Minow]] has put it.<ref>[[Martha Minow|Minow, Martha]]. "Confronting the Seduction of Choice: Law, Education and American Pluralism", ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', Vol. 120, p. 814, 819-820 (2011)(''Pierce'' "entrenched the pattern of a two-tiered system of schooling, which sanctions private opt-outs from publicly run schools").</ref>

American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still ''[[de facto]]'' segregated. Whether due to ''Brown'', or due to Congressional action, or due to societal change, the percentage of black students attending majority-black school districts decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s.<ref>For data and analysis, see {{cite web|url=http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |title=Schools More Separate |access-date=2008-07-16 |author=Orfield |date=July 2001 |work=Harvard University Civil Rights Project |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628215819/http://www.civilrightsproject.harvard.edu/research/deseg/Schools_More_Separate.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-28 }}</ref> In ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'' (2007), the Court held that, if a school system became racially imbalanced due to social factors other than governmental racism, then the state is not as free to integrate schools as if the state had been at fault for the racial imbalance. This is especially evident in the charter school system where parents of students can pick which schools their children attend based on the amenities provided by that school and the needs of the child. It seems that race is a factor in the choice of charter school.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Nicholas|title=Racial, Economic, and Linguistic Segregation: Analyzing Market Supports in the District of Columbia's Public Charter Schools.|journal=Education and Urban Society|date=8 August 2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=120–141|doi=10.1177/0013124511407317|s2cid=144814662|url=http://eus.sagepub.com/content/45/1/120|access-date=28 October 2013}}</ref>

==Application to federal government==
By its terms, the clause restrains only state governments. However, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s [[due process]] guarantee, beginning with ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954), has been interpreted as imposing some of the same restrictions on the federal government: "Though the Fifth Amendment does not contain an equal protection clause, as does the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only to the States, the concepts of equal protection and due process are not mutually exclusive."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=347&invol=497 |title=FindLaw &#124; Cases and Codes |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date=1954-05-17 |access-date=2012-08-13}}</ref> In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003) the Supreme Court added: "Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests"<ref>Lawrence v. Texas, {{Ussc|539|598|2003}}, at page 2482</ref>
Some scholars have argued that the Court's decision in ''Bolling'' should have been reached on other grounds. For example, [[Michael W. McConnell]] has written that Congress never "required that the schools of the District of Columbia be segregated."<ref>Balkin, J. M.; Bruce A. Ackerman (2001). "Part II". What Brown v. Board of Education should have said : the nation's top legal experts rewrite America's landmark civil rights decision. et al. New York University Press. p. 168.</ref> According to that rationale, the segregation of schools in Washington D.C. was unauthorized and therefore illegal.

==Tiered scrutiny==
"Contemporary equal protection doctrine is, at least on the surface, straightforward. Racial classifications—whether invidious or benign—are presumptively unconstitutional and trigger strict judicial scrutiny. Facially neutral state action, absent discriminatory intent, is presumptively constitutional and triggers rational basis review. This disparate treatment of facially neutral state action and racial classifications has been met with considerable critique."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feingold|first=Jonathan|date=2019-04-01|title=Equal Protection Design Defects|url=https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/833|journal=Temple Law Review|volume=91|issue=3|pages=513}}</ref>'''{{rp|516}}'''

Despite the undoubted importance of ''Brown'', much of modern equal protection jurisprudence originated in other cases, though not everyone agrees about ''which'' other cases. Many scholars assert that the opinion of Justice [[Harlan Stone]] in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938)<ref>304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938). For a theory of judicial review based on Stone's footnote, see Ely, John Hart (1981). ''Democracy and Distrust''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-19637-6}}.</ref> contained a footnote that was a critical turning point for equal protection jurisprudence,<ref name="Goldstein">Goldstein, Leslie. "[https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume4/issue2/Goldstein4U.Pa.J.Const.L.372(2002).pdf Between the Tiers: The New(est) Equal Protection and Bush v. Gore] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202127/https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume4/issue2/Goldstein4U.Pa.J.Const.L.372(2002).pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}", ''University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law'', Vol. 4, p. 372 (2002) .</ref> but that assertion is disputed.<ref>Farber, Daniel and Frickey, Philip. "[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2542&context=facpubs Is Carolene Products Dead--Reflections on Affirmative Action and the Dynamics of Civil Rights Legislation]", ''California Law Review'', Vol. 79, p. 685 (1991). Farber and Frickey point out that "only Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Roberts joined Justice Stone's footnote", and in any event "It is simply a myth ... that the process theory of footnote four in Carolene Products is, or ever has been, the primary justification for invalidating laws embodying prejudice against racial minorities."</ref>

Whatever its precise origins, the basic idea of the modern approach is that more judicial scrutiny is triggered by purported discrimination that involves "[[fundamental rights]]" (such as the right to procreation), and similarly more judicial scrutiny is also triggered if the purported victim of discrimination has been targeted because he or she belongs to a "[[suspect classification]]" (such as a single racial group). This modern doctrine was pioneered in ''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma]]'' (1942), which involved depriving certain criminals of the fundamental right to procreate:<ref>''Skinner v. Oklahoma'', 316 U.S. 535 (1942). Sometimes the "suspect" classification strand of the modern doctrine is attributed to ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), but ''Korematsu'' did not involve the Fourteenth Amendment, and moreover it came later than the ''Skinner'' opinion (which clearly stated that both deprivation of fundamental rights as well as oppression of a particular race or nationality were invidious).</ref>

<blockquote>When the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offense and sterilizes one and not the other, it has made as invidious a discrimination as if it had selected a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.</blockquote>

Until 1976, the Supreme Court usually ended up dealing with discrimination by using one of two possible levels of scrutiny: what has come to be called "[[strict scrutiny]]" (when a suspect class or fundamental right is involved), or instead the more lenient "[[rational basis review]]". Strict scrutiny means that a challenged statute must be "narrowly tailored" to serve a "compelling" government interest, and must not have a "less restrictive" alternative. In contrast, rational basis scrutiny merely requires that a challenged statute be "reasonably related" to a "legitimate" government interest.

However, in the 1976 case of ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'', the Court added another tier of scrutiny, called "[[intermediate scrutiny]]", regarding gender discrimination. The Court may have added other tiers too, such as "enhanced rational basis" scrutiny,<ref>See ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985)</ref> and "exceedingly persuasive basis" scrutiny.<ref>See ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' (1996).</ref>

All of this is known as "tiered" scrutiny, and it has had many critics, including Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] who argued for a "spectrum of standards in reviewing discrimination", instead of discrete tiers.<ref name=Fleming /> Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] argued for only one level of scrutiny, given that "there is only one Equal Protection Clause".<ref name=Fleming>Fleming, James. "[http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol74/iss4/26 'There is Only One Equal Protection Clause': An Appreciation of Justice Stevens's Equal Protection Jurisprudence]", ''Fordham Law Review'', Vol. 74, p. 2301, 2306 (2006).</ref> The whole tiered strategy developed by the Court is meant to reconcile the principle of equal protection with the reality that most laws necessarily discriminate in some way.<ref>See ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620, 631 (1996): "the equal protection of the laws must coexist with the practical necessity that most legislation classifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage to various groups or persons."</ref>

Choosing the standard of scrutiny can determine the outcome of a case, and the strict scrutiny standard is often described as "strict in theory and fatal in fact".<ref>Curry, James et al. ''Constitutional Government: The American Experience'', p. 282 (Kendall Hunt 2003) (attributing the phrase to Gerald Gunther).</ref> In order to select the correct level of scrutiny, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] urged the Court to identify rights as "fundamental" or identify classes as "suspect" by analyzing what was understood when the Equal Protection Clause was adopted, instead of based upon more subjective factors.<ref>Domino, John. ''Civil Rights & Liberties in the 21st Century'', pp. 337-338 (Pearson 2009).</ref>

==Discriminatory intent and disparate impact==
{{Main|Disparate impact}}
Because inequalities can be caused either intentionally or unintentionally, the Supreme Court has decided that the Equal Protection Clause itself does not forbid governmental policies that unintentionally lead to racial disparities, though Congress may have some power under other clauses of the Constitution to address unintentional disparate impacts. This subject was addressed in the seminal case of ''[[Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.]]'' (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a city in the suburbs of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] that had refused to [[zoning|re-zone]] a plot of land on which the plaintiff intended to build low-income, racially integrated housing. On the face, there was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights's]] planning commission. The result was racially disparate, however, since the refusal supposedly prevented mostly African-Americans and Hispanics from moving in. Justice [[Lewis Franklin Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], writing for the Court, stated, "Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause." Disparate impact merely has an [[evidence|evidentiary]] value; absent a "stark" pattern, "impact is not determinative."

The result in ''Arlington Heights'' was similar to that in ''[[Washington v. Davis]]'' (1976), and has been defended on the basis that the Equal Protection Clause was not designed to guarantee [[equality of outcome|equal outcomes]], but rather [[equal opportunity|equal opportunities]]; if a legislature wants to correct unintentional but racially disparate effects, it may be able to do so through further legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/03/constitutional__1.html |title=Constitutional Rights: Two |last=Herzog |first=Don |date=March 22, 2005 |work=Left2Right }} Note that the Court has put significant limits on the [[congressional power of enforcement]]. See ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), ''[[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett]]'' (2001), and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' (2000). The Court has also interpreted federal statutory law as limiting the power of states to correct disparate effects. See ''[[Ricci v. DeStefano]]'' (2009).</ref> It is possible for a discriminating state to hide its true intention, and one possible solution is for disparate impact to be considered as stronger evidence of discriminatory intent.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Krieger |first=Linda Hamilton |year=1995 |title=The Content of Our Categories: A Cognitive Bias Approach to Discrimination and Equal Protection Opportunity |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=47 |issue= 6|pages=1161–1248 |doi=10.2307/1229191 |jstor= 1229191 |hdl=10125/66110 }}, and {{cite journal |last=Lawrence |first=Charles R., III |year=1987 |title=Reckoning with Unconscious Racism |journal=Stanford Law Review |volume=39 |issue= 2|pages=317–388 |doi=10.2307/1228797 |jstor= 1228797 |hdl=10125/65975 }}</ref> This debate, though, is currently academic, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in ''Arlington Heights''.

For an example of how this rule limits the Court's powers under the Equal Protection Clause, see ''[[McClesky v. Kemp]]'' (1987). In that case a black man was convicted of murdering a white police officer and sentenced to death in the state of Georgia. A study found that killers of whites were more likely to be sentenced to death than were killers of blacks.<ref name="Baldus1983">{{cite journal |last=Baldus |first=David C. |author2=Pulaski, Charles |author3=Woodworth, George  |year=1983 |title=Comparative Review of Death Sentences: An Empirical Study of the Georgia Experience |journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=661–753 |doi=10.2307/1143133 |jstor= 1143133|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/jclc/vol74/iss3/2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> The Court found that the defense had failed to prove that such data demonstrated the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.

The “[[Stop-and-frisk in New York City|Stop and Frisk]]” policy in New York allows officers to stop anyone who they feel looks suspicious. Data from police stops shows that even when controlling for variability, people who are black and those of Hispanic descent were stopped more frequently than white people, with these statistics dating back to the late 1990s. A term that has been created to describe the disproportionate number of police stops of black people is “Driving While Black.” This term is used to describe the stopping of innocent black people who are not committing any crime. The Equal Protection Clause, made to protect all people equally and to ensure equal treatment under the law, is misused to allow for the mistreatment of different minority populations.

==Voting rights==
[[File:John Marshall Harlan II official.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Justice John Marshall Harlan II sought to interpret the Equal Protection Clause in the context of Section 2 of the same amendment]]The Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927) that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited denial of the vote based on race. The first modern application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the [[Tennessee]] [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause.

It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal [[voting rights]]; after all, it would seem to make the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice [[John Marshall Harlan II|John M. Harlan]] (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from ''Reynolds''. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:

{{quote|If constitutional amendment was the only means by which all men and, later, women, could be guaranteed the right to vote at all, even for ''federal'' officers, how can it be that the far less obvious right to a particular kind of apportionment of ''state'' legislatures ... can be conferred by judicial construction of the Fourteenth Amendment?'' [Emphasis in the original.]}}

Harlan also relied on the fact that Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment "expressly recognizes the States' power to deny 'or in any way' abridge the right of their inhabitants to vote for 'the members of the [state] Legislature.'"<ref>Van Alstyne, William. "The Fourteenth Amendment, the Right to Vote, and the Understanding of the Thirty-Ninth Congress", ''Supreme Court Review'', p. 33 (1965).</ref> Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a specific federal response to such actions by a state: reduction of a state's representation in Congress. However, the Supreme Court has instead responded that voting is a "fundamental right" on the same plane as marriage (''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''); for any discrimination in fundamental rights to be constitutional, the Court requires the legislation to pass strict scrutiny. Under this theory, equal protection jurisprudence has been applied to voting rights.

A recent use of equal protection doctrine came in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in [[Florida]] in the aftermath of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. The Supreme Court used four of its rulings from 1960s voting rights cases (one of which was [[Reynolds v. Sims]]) to support its ruling in Bush v. Gore. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices [[David Souter|Souter]] and [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] joined the majority of five—but only for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.<ref>For criticisms as well as several defenses of the Court's decision, see Bush v. Gore'': The Question of Legitimacy'', edited by {{cite book |title= Bush v.

==Sex, disability, and sexual orientation==
Originally, the Fourteenth Amendment did not forbid sex discrimination to the same extent as other forms of discrimination. On the one hand, Section Two of the amendment specifically discouraged states from interfering with the voting rights of "males", which made the amendment anathema to many women when it was proposed in 1866.<ref>Cullen-Dupont, Kathryn. ''Encyclopedia of Women's History in America'', pp. 91-92 (Infobase Publishing, Jan 1, 2009).</ref> On the other hand, as feminists like [[Victoria Woodhull]] pointed out, the word "person" in the Equal Protection Clause was apparently chosen deliberately, instead of a masculine term that could have easily been used instead.<ref>Hymowitz, Carol and Weissman, Michaele. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0c-adTP64AsC&pg=PT128 A History of Women in America]'', p. 128 (Random House Digital, 2011).</ref>

[[File:2007 WY Proof Rev.png|thumb|Each state can guarantee more equality than does the Equal Protection Clause.  For example, the state of [[Wyoming]] granted women the right to vote even before the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] required it.]]

In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court decided ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'', extending the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect women from sex discrimination, in situations where there is no rational basis for the discrimination.<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/24338/Reed-v-Reed-Significance.html "''Reed v. Reed'' - Significance, Notable Trials and Court Cases - 1963 to 1972"]</ref> That level of scrutiny was boosted to an intermediate level in ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'' (1976).<ref>''Craig v. Boren'', 429 U.S. 190 (1976).</ref>

The Supreme Court has been disinclined to extend full "[[suspect classification]]" status (thus making a law that categorizes on that basis subject to greater judicial scrutiny) for groups other than racial minorities and religious groups. In ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.]]'' (1985), the Court refused to make the [[developmental disability|developmentally disabled]] a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however&mdash;and Justice Thurgood Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence&mdash;that the Court did appear to examine the City of Cleburne's denial of a permit to a group home for intellectually disabled people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Pettinga |first=Gayle Lynn |year=1987 |title=Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny by Any Other Name |journal=Indiana Law Journal |volume=62 |page=779 |issn=0019-6665 }}; {{cite journal |last=Wadhwani |first=Neelum J. |year=2006 |title=Rational Reviews, Irrational Results |journal=Texas Law Review |volume=84 |pages=801, 809&ndash;811 |issn=0040-4411 }}</ref>

The Court's decision in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996) struck down a [[Colorado]] constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals "minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination." The Court rejected as "implausible" the dissent's argument that the amendment would not deprive homosexuals of general protections provided to everyone else but rather would merely prevent "special treatment of homosexuals."<ref>Kuligowski, Monte. "Romer v. Evans: Judicial Judgment or Emotive Utterance?," ''Journal of Civil Rights and Economic Development'', Vol. 12 (1996).</ref> Much as in ''City of Cleburne'', the ''Romer'' decision seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joslin |first=Courtney |year=1997 |title=Equal Protection and Anti-Gay Legislation |journal=Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=32 |pages=225, 240 |issn=0017-8039 |quote=The ''Romer'' Court applied a more 'active,' ''Cleburne''-like rational basis standard ...}}; {{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=Robert C. |year=1999 |title=Successful Rational Basis Claims in the Supreme Court from the 1971 Term Through ''Romer v. Evans'' |journal=Indiana Law Review |volume=32 |page=357 |issn=0019-6665 }}</ref>

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting [[homosexual]] [[sodomy]] on substantive due process grounds. In Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only ''homosexual'' sodomy, and not ''heterosexual'' sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited ''City of Cleburne'', and also relied in part on ''Romer''. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to [[sexual orientation]].

While the courts have applied rational-basis scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, it has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Koppelman |first=Andrew |year=1994 |title=Why Discrimination against Lesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination |journal=New York University Law Review |volume=69 |page=197 |issn=0028-7881 }}; see also <u>[[Fricke v. Lynch]]</u>, 491 F.Supp. 381, 388, fn. 6 (1980), ''vacated'' 627 F.2d 1088 [case decided on First Amendment free-speech grounds, but "This case can also be profitably analyzed under the Equal Protection Clause of the fourteenth amendment. In preventing Aaron Fricke from attending the senior reception, the school has afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students those wishing to attend the reception with companions of the same sex."]</ref> Other scholars disagree, arguing that "homophobia" is distinct from sexism, in a sociological sense, and so treating it as such would be an unacceptable judicial shortcut.<ref>Gerstmann, Evan. '' [https://archive.org/details/samesexmarriagec0000gers/page/55 Same Sex Marriage and the Constitution]'', p. 55 (Cambridge University Press, 2004).</ref>

In 2013, the Court struck down part of the federal [[Defense of Marriage Act]], in ''[[United States v. Windsor]]''. No state statute was in question, and therefore the Equal Protection Clause did not apply. The Court did employ similar principles, however, in combination with [[federalism]] principles. The Court did not purport to use any level of scrutiny more demanding than rational basis review, according to law professor [[Erwin Chemerinsky]].<ref>Chemerinsky, Erwin. "[http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 Justice Kennedy's World] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709102734/http://m.law.com/module/alm/app/nlj.do#!/article/1029801790 |date=2013-07-09 }}", ''[[The National Law Journal]]'' (July 1, 2013): "There is another similarity between his opinion in Windsor and his earlier ones in Romer and Lawrence: the Supreme Court invalidated the law without using heightened scrutiny for sexual-orientation discrimination ... A law based on animus fails to meet even rational-basis review so there was no need to adopt a higher level of scrutiny."</ref> The four dissenting justices argued that the authors of the statute were rational.<ref>''[http://www2.bloomberglaw.com/public/mobile/document/United_States_v_Windsor_No_12307_2013_BL_168683_US_June_26_2013_C/1 United States v. Windsor]'', No. 12-307, 2013 BL 169620, 118 FEP Cases 1417 (U.S. June 26, 2013).</ref>

In 2015, the Supreme Court held [[Obergefell v. Hodges|in a 5–4 decision]] that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and required all states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages validly performed in other jurisdictions.

==Affirmative action==
{{See also|Affirmative action in the United States}}
[[Affirmative action]] is the consideration of race, gender, or other factors, to benefit an underrepresented group or to address past injustices done to that group. Individuals who belong to the group are preferred over those who do not belong to the group, for example in educational admissions, hiring, promotions, awarding of contracts, and the like.<ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy">{{cite web
| publisher = Stanford University| title = Affirmative Action| url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/affirmative-action/
| access-date = April 6, 2012}}</ref> Such action may be used as a "tie-breaker" if all other factors are inconclusive, or may be achieved through [[racial quota|quota]]s, which allot a certain number of benefits to each group.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Congress enacted race-conscious programs primarily to assist newly freed slaves who had personally been denied many advantages earlier in their lives. Such legislation was enacted by many of the same people who framed the Equal Protection Clause, though that clause did not apply to such federal legislation, and instead only applied to state legislation.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Schnapper |first=Eric |year=1985 |title=Affirmative Action and the Legislative History of the Fourteenth Amendment |journal=Virginia Law Review |volume=71 |issue= 5|pages=753–798 |doi=10.2307/1073012 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/vp/irla/Documents/AFFIRM.ACTION.LEGISLATIVE.HISTORY.%20FOURTEENTH%20AMENDMENT.pdf|jstor=1073012 }}</ref> Likewise, the Equal Protection Clause does not apply to private universities and other private businesses, which are free to practice affirmative action unless prohibited by federal statute or state law.

Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government [[independent contractor|contractor]]s&mdash;for instance, ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]]'' (1995) and ''[[City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.]]'' (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by [[public university|public universities]]: ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'' (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]''.

In ''Bakke'', the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their [[University and college admissions|admissions]] process. In ''Grutter'' and ''Gratz'', the Court upheld both ''Bakke'' as a precedent and the admissions policy of the [[University of Michigan Law School]]. In [[dicta]], however, Justice O'Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In ''Gratz'', the Court invalidated Michigan's undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school's policy, which treated race as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.

In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in ''Grutter'', and a Harvard College admissions policy praised by Justice Powell's opinion in ''Bakke'', passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued—including Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] in his dissent to ''Grutter''—that the scrutiny the Court has applied in some cases is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one.<ref>See {{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |title=Reflections on ''Grutter'' |last=Schuck |first=Peter H. |date=September 5, 2003 |work=Jurist |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909065433/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/symposium-aa/schuck.php |archive-date=2005-09-09 }}</ref> On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Siegel |first=Reva B. |author-link=Reva Siegel |year=2004 |title=Equality Talk: Antisubordination and Anticlassification Values in Constitutional Struggles over ''Brown'' |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue= 5|pages=1470–1547 |doi=10.2307/4093259 |jstor= 4093259 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/1102 |type=Submitted manuscript }}; {{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Stephen L. |author-link=Stephen L.
