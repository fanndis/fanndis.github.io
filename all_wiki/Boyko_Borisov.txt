'''Boyko Metodiev Borisov''' ({{lang-bg|Бойко Методиев Борисов}}, {{IPA-bg|ˈbɔjko mɛˈtɔdiɛf boˈrisof|IPA}}; born 13 June 1959) is a Bulgarian politician who has been [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] since May 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-01/bulgaria-republic-of-macedonia-sign-accord-to-repair-relations|title=Republic of Macedonia Mends Ties With Bulgaria Eyeing EU|date=1 August 2017|accessdate=10 April 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> He was also Prime Minister from 2009 to 2013 and from 2014 to January 2017, making him Bulgaria's [[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|second-longest serving]] Prime Minister to date.

Borisov was elected [[Mayor of Sofia]] in 2004. In December 2005, he was the founding chairman of the conservative political party [[GERB|Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria]] (GERB), becoming its lead candidate in the [[2009 Bulgarian parliamentary election|2009 general election]]. Borisov led GERB to a landslide victory in 2009, defeating the incumbent [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], and resigned as mayor of Sofia to be sworn in as Prime Minister. He resigned in 2013, after [[2013 Bulgarian protests against the first Borisov cabinet|nationwide protests]] against the government's energy policy, but after leading GERB to victory in the [[2014 Bulgarian parliamentary election|2014 general election]], he became Prime Minister again. His second term ended similarly to his first, after Borisov resigned in January 2017, this time following GERB's defeat in the [[2016 Bulgarian presidential election|2016 presidential election]]. As before, Borisov led GERB to election victory again in the snap [[2017 Bulgarian parliamentary election|2017 general election]], becoming Prime Minister for a third time.

Under Borisov's cabinets, Bulgaria has seen improved macroeconomic stability. Concurrently, it has remained the EU's poorest member, with nearly a quarter of its population below national [[poverty line]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) - Bulgaria |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=BG |website=World Bank |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> [[Foreign direct investment]] has fallen, and rampant corruption has led to the rejection of Bulgaria's [[Schengen Area]] bids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dutch minister 'Bloks' Bulgaria's Schengen accession |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/dutch-minister-bloks-bulgarias-schengen-accession/ |website=Euractiv |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Electoral results for Borisov and his party have been overshadowed by allegations of [[election fraud]] and manipulation in [[2013 Bulgarian parliamentary election|2013]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Bulgarian elections marred by claims of voting fraud |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a99213a8-b98d-11e2-bc57-00144feabdc0 |website=The Financial Times |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> [[2015 Bulgarian local elections|2015]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Chaos, Fraud Mar Bulgaria's Local Election and Referendum |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/27-ccwatch/cc-watch-briefs/4555-chaos-fraud-marr-bulgaria-s-local-election-and-referendum |website=OCCRP |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> and in 2019 both [[2019 Bulgarian local elections|locally]] and for the [[2019 European Parliament election in Bulgaria|European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bulgaria Election Body Ignores Questions About EU Elections |url=https://balkaninsight.com/2019/06/06/bulgaria-election-body-ignores-questions-about-eu-elections/ |website=BalkanInsight |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Judicial threats and attacks against journalists have increased to the point where journalism in Bulgaria has become "dangerous" according to [[Reporters Without Borders]], which ranks Bulgaria 111th globally in press freedom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bulgaria RSF |url=https://rsf.org/en/bulgaria |website=Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Former U.S. ambassador to Bulgaria [[James Pardew]] said in 2019 that a "national political environment with little government or criminal accountability and no serious opposition to challenge the current government" is in place as a result of collusion, corruption and stifling of the media under Borisov.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trump and Bulgaria: Attacks on free media damage democracy |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/471659-trump-and-bulgaria-attacks-on-free-media-damage-democracy |website=The Hill |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>

==Early life and family==
[[File:Borisov-Tzvetanov.jpg|left|thumb|206x206px|Borisov with [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov]]]]
Borisov was born in 1959 in [[Bankya]] (then a village, today a town, part of [[Stolichna Municipality]]) to the Ministry of Internal Affairs official Metodi Borisov and elementary school teacher Veneta Borisova. Borisov has claimed that his grandfather was executed by the communists for being a [[Nikola Petkov]] supporter in the wake of the [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1944]]. This has been disputed, however, as Nikola Petkov was still an ally of the communist insurgents in 1944. Furthermore, Borisov's later rise within the ranks of communist-era security services would have been unlikely with such family background.<ref name=Duma>{{cite web|url=https://duma.bg/?go=news&p=detail&nodeId=142272|title=Borisov should state the truth about his grandfather|publisher=Duma|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> Other sources point that Borisov's grandfather either died during a criminal incident,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.segabg.com/article.php?id=835932|title=Boyko Borisov and his feud with facts|publisher=Sega|date=24 December 2016|accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> or that both his grandfathers died peacefully in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref name=Duma/>

In 1977, Borisov graduated from Bankya's high school with excellent grades.{{sfn|Lilov|2013|p=8}} Between 1982 and 1990, he assumed different positions in the Ministry of Internal Affairs as a firefighter and later as a professor at the Police Academy in Sofia.<ref name="darik-bio">{{cite news|url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=192798|title=Бойко Борисов|date=27 October 2007|publisher=Darik News|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2009-07-07}}</ref> As a National Security Office member, Borisov took part in the protection of crops and haylofts during the [[Revival Process|name-changing campaign towards ethnic Turks]] in the 1980s.<ref name="echo-bio">{{cite news|url=http://www.sofiaecho.com/2009/07/10/752482_boiko-borissov-a-general-history|title=Boiko Borissov: A general history|date=10 July 2009|publisher=The Sofia Echo|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> From 1985 to 1990, Borisov was a lecturer at the Higher Institute for Police Officers Training and Scientific Research of the Ministry of Interior.

Borisov quit the Ministry in 1991 with the rank of major, after formally refusing to renounce his Communist Party membership, or "depoliticise". In 1991, he founded a private security company, Ipon-1. He subsequently became bodyguard to Bulgaria's last communist leader, [[Todor Zhivkov]], after the latter was overthrown in 1989,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170326-boyko-borisov-bulgarias-mr-big|title=Boyko Borisov, Bulgaria's Mr. Big|date=2017-03-26|work=France 24|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327161239/http://www.france24.com/en/20170326-boyko-borisov-bulgarias-mr-big|archive-date=27 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and to [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]]. Borisov has been claiming participation in [[karate]] championships since 1978, serving as the coach of the Bulgarian national team and a referee of international matches. He said to United States President [[Barack Obama]] that he has a [[7th dan]] black belt in karate, but his coach denied this, and stated that Borisov has never been even a karate competitor, but only an administrator of the team.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://afera.bg/%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%87%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%BE.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103164546/http://afera.bg/%D1%86%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%87%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80-%D0%BF%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%B1%D0%BE.html |archive-date=3 January 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://glasove.com/categories/skandalut/news/tsoncho-kolev-bivsh-trenior-po-karate-na-premiera-boyko-nyama-cheren-kolan |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116104141/http://glasove.com/categories/skandalut/news/tsoncho-kolev-bivsh-trenior-po-karate-na-premiera-boyko-nyama-cheren-kolan |archive-date=16 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Borisov is divorced, but for a number of years lived with Tsvetelina Borislavova, head of Bulgarian American Credit Bank. Borisov has a daughter, Veneta, from his former marriage to the physician Stela. Borisov also has a sister, Krasimira Ivanova.

Later in 2005, he resigned from that post, instead of standing as a candidate in the mayoral election in Sofia. He was elected as [[Mayor of Sofia|Mayor]] and succeeded [[Stefan Sofiyanski]].{{sfn|Lilov|2013|p=15}} He was re-elected in the 2007 election.

===Domestic policy===
[[File:Boyko Borisov 2.jpg|thumb|Borisov in 2009|237x237px|left]]Borisov's stated policies were mostly aimed at curbing corruption in the public administration<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,634095,00.html Europe's Poorest Country Heads for the Polls], Spiegel, 7 March 2009</ref> and building an adequate infrastructure.

Borisov is a strong supporter of the total [[smoking ban]]. Although initially removing the ban introduced by the previous government, the Borisov Cabinet reintroduced it in 2012<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulgaria's Good News in 2012|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=146449|publisher=novinite.com|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref> with the aim to reduce the number of smokers from 40% of the population to about 15–20%.<ref>[http://thesofiaecho.com/2011/03/18/1061009_smoking-in-bulgaria-cut Smoking in Bulgaria?

Following public opposition, Borisov's government banned [[hydraulic fracturing]] for [[shale gas]] exploration and extraction.

Protests of doctors and other health professionals broke out in 2010 over failure to reform the health care sector, resulting in delayed payments and salaries. In March 2010, health minister Bozhidar Nanev resigned over a [[conflict of interest]] scandal.

===Resignation===
Following the eruption of nationwide [[2013 Bulgarian anti-monopoly protests|protests]] on 12 February 2013 over high energy costs, low living standards and corruption, Borisov and his government resigned on 20 February. Before that, Borisov had accepted the resignation of Finance Minister [[Simeon Djankov]] after a dispute over farm subsidies and promised a cut in power prices and punishing foreign-owned companies—a potential risk in damaging [[Bulgaria-Czech Republic relations]]—but protests continued. He then said: "I will not participate in a government under which police are beating people." The [[2013 Bulgarian parliamentary election|election]] due in summer was rescheduled for 12 May 2013. Djankov's resignation was a blow to Borisov's center-right credentials, since Djankov spearheaded the reforms during their term in office. He was also regarded as able manager of the public administration. In 2013 Djankov became an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]] and was appointed Rector of the New Economic School in Moscow.<ref><nowiki>https://www.nes.ru/dataupload/files/news/Press-releases/2013-10-1_Board_of_Directors_meeting_English.pdf</nowiki></ref>

Later in April, Borisov's former Agriculture minister [[Miroslav Naydenov]] revealed that the government had spied on several cabinet ministers, business figures and the opposition under orders of [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov]], deputy chairman of GERB. Several members of parliament corroborated these claims, as well as members of the wiretapping unit in the Interior Ministry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=149848|title=Ex AgriMin Exposes Shocking Mass Spying in Bulgaria|publisher=Novinite|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
During Borisov's second government, the business climate and promised reforms took a nosedive. "Reforms failed to get off the ground, in particular, changes to the justice system and plans to help cash-strapped schools and the creaking health care system".<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, Bulgaria's parliament rejected an anti-corruption law.<ref name=":0" />

The cultivation of [[genetically modified crops]] was banned in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bulgaria-gmo-eu/bulgaria-opts-out-of-growing-genetically-modified-crops-idUSKCN0RV43M20151001|title=Bulgaria opts out of growing genetically modified crops|publisher=Reuters|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>

A fence was built along the border with Turkey to stem the flow of migrants during the [[European migrant crisis]]. Border control was also tightened. Some 17,000 people were detained by October 2016, down by more than a third compared to 2015. A riot broke out in a migrant camp near [[Harmanli]] in 2016, prompting a police response with water cannons and rubber bullets, and later a closure of the camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-bulgaria-idUSKBN13K15A|title=After riot, Bulgaria to send migrants to closed camps, plans extraditions|publisher=Reuters|date=16 November 2016|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>

In June 2018, a public tender was launched to build the natural gas interconnector link with Turkey.

In March 2019, a journalist investigation revealed that real estate company Arteks had sold a luxury property at prices sharply lower than the market value to a number of senior government officials. These include justice minister [[Tsetska Tsacheva]], GERB deputy chairman Tsvetan Tsvetanov and deputy sports minister Vanya Koleva, who all subsequently resigned.

Further investigations revealed that Borisov's deputy economy minister, Aleksandar Manolev, built a private dwelling using funds from an EU development program. Numerous similar estates, built as [[bed and breakfast]] houses using EU funds, were revealed to have been used as private property in a similar manner. Overall, 749 guesthouses were revealed to have been built under the programme since 2007. The Attorney General's office launched an investigation following the reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/bulgaria-launches-probe-into-fake-bed-and-breakfasts-funded-by-eu/29901295.html|title=Bulgaria Launches Probe into Fake Bed-And-Breakfasts Funded By EU|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=24 April 2019|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>[[File:President Trump Welcomes the Prime Minister of Bulgaria (49124832977).jpg|thumb|President [[Donald Trump]] meets with Boyko Borisov Monday, Nov. 25, 2019, in the Oval Office of the White House.]]

Borisov's government received further criticism for its handling of [[African swine fever virus]] outbreaks which caused the culling of tens of thousands of pigs in several regions in July 2019. EU Health and Food Safety commissioner [[Vytenis Andriukaitis]] said that Bulgaria "had not done much" to prevent the outbreak and was facing the prospect of losing its entire pig farming industry to the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sofiaglobe.com/2019/07/25/eu-health-commissioner-greatly-disappointed-by-bulgarias-handling-of-african-swine-fever/|title=EU Health Commissioner 'greatly disappointed' by Bulgaria's handling of African Swine Fever|publisher=The Sofia Globe|date=25 July 2019|accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref> Additionally, culled pigs were hastily buried, sometimes close to bodies of water, instead of incinerated, as the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency had previously closed down an incinerator in the affected region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dnes.dir.bg/politika/zashto-chehiya-uspya-da-se-spravi-s-afrikanskata-chuma-po-svinete-a-nie-ne|title=Why Czechia succeeded against the African swine fever and we did not|publisher=Dir.bg|date=28 July 2019|accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref>

Borisov spent much of his term locked in an institutional war with President [[Rumen Radev]], the latter an opposition-sponsored independent and former Air Force General that defeated Borisov's preferred candidate in the [[2016 Bulgarian presidential election]].

==Controversies==

===Allegations of corruption and connections with organized crime===
Periodically ensuing corruption scandals and controversies has led to reports of high levels of corruption in Borisov's government. According to the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], compiled by Transparency International, Borisov's government was as corrupt as previous governments, with two of his closest ministers – [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov|Tzvetan Tzvetanov]] and [[Miroslav Naydenov]]—investigated by the Prosecutor General and the Tax Authority for taking bribes while in office. This goes against Borisov's declared mission to fight corruption and organized crime while pressing criminal charges against former corrupt politicians.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Despite Borisov's initial promise, no representative of previous cabinets has so far been convicted.

In 2007 Boyko Borisov was accused by the magazine ''U.S. Congressional Quarterly'' (CQ) of being directly linked to the biggest mobsters in Bulgaria. CQ asserted that, "the most powerful politician in Bulgaria, Washington's newest ally in the global war on terror, is a close associate of known mobsters and linked to almost 30 unsolved murders in the Black Sea republic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_165193915 |title=News.bg – US Report: Borisov is a Mobster |publisher=International.ibox.bg |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> According to a confidential report compiled by former top U.S. law enforcement agency officials Borisov had used his position as the Chief Secretary of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry to help organized crime bosses attack their opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=77632 |title=Bulgaria: Bush's Bulgarian Partner in the Terror War Has Mob History, Investigators Say – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref>

On 14 January 2011, journalists from the Bulgarian weekly newspaper ''Galeria'' distributed audio records of an alleged conversation between Borisov and Customs Agency Head Vanyo Tanov. The tapes reveal that Borisov instructed customs authorities to immediately stop their investigation of "Ledenika" brewery which had been suspected of illegal activities and tax crimes. However, Finance Minister [[Simeon Djankov]] was recorded on tape ordering the Head of Customs to do his work properly and not yield to Borisov's demands.

This created a rift within the government, as it was widely believed that the wiretapping was ordered by Interior Minister [[Tzvetan Tzvetanov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=124159 |title=Transcript from 2nd Taped Call between Bulgarian PM, Customs Head: Transcript from 2nd Taped Call between Bulgarian PM, Customs Head – Novinite.com – Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> Later those tapes were declared "manipulated" (not being able to tell if they were fake or not) by two independent examinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnes.dir.bg/news/manipulatzia-boyko-borisov-vanyo-tanov-Podslushvaneto-na-Tanov-zapisi-7820416 |title=Експертиза: Записите с Ваньо Танов не са оригинали – Днес.dir.bg |publisher=Dnes.dir.bg |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btv.bg/story/1789847804-Vtorata_ekspertiza_potvardi_che_razgovorite_na_Tanov_sa_manipulirani.html |title=Втората експертиза потвърди, че разговорите на Танов са манипулирани – bTV Новините |publisher=Btv.bg |accessdate=2012-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927151915/http://www.btv.bg/story/1789847804-Vtorata_ekspertiza_potvardi_che_razgovorite_na_Tanov_sa_manipulirani.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In early July, Borisov admitted that the conversation had been genuine, though tampered with, while giving an interview to Bulgarian bloggers in the presence of the Interior Minister.<ref>{{cite web|author=EurActiv.com |url=http://www.euractiv.com/justice/romania-bulgaria-set-fail-bigges-news-513887 |title=Romania, Bulgaria set to fail their biggest test |publisher=EurActiv |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Joi Ito, Japan |url=http://globalvoices.org/2012/07/11/bulgaria-pm-boyko-invites-creators-of-boykometer-for-a-chat/ |title=Bulgaria: PM Boyko Invites Creators of "Boykometer" for a Chat · Global Voices |publisher=Globalvoices.org |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> A March 2013 investigation by the Prosecutor General suggests that the wire-tapping was ordered by [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov|Tzvetan Tzvetanov]], Borisov's trusted deputy in the GERB party, with the aim of getting rid of Customs Head Vanyo Tanov.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

After a public row due to leaked wiretapped conversations between Boyko Borisov, [[Miroslav Naydenov]] and the deputy prosecutor general, Boyko Borisov distanced himself from the former agriculture minister and he was excluded from GERB.

According to political scientist Ivan Krastev, "Boyko wants to be everybody’s best friend. He wants to hear all sides, make them believe that he has taken their side. He thinks that he needs to take on all positions at once...He is more pro-American, pro-Russian and pro-European than anyone else."<ref>{{cite web |title=Bulgaria's pro-Brussels PM: 'There's no better place to live than the EU' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/bulgarias-pro-brussels-pm-theres-no-better-place-to-live-than-the-eu |website=The Guardian |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref>

In December 2011, Borisov, who occasionally plays as a striker for the third division side [[F.C. Vitosha Bistritsa]], collected 44% of about 8,000 votes in a fans' poll to crown Bulgaria's Footballer of the Year, ahead of then-[[Manchester United]] striker [[Dimitar Berbatov]]. Following the result, Borisov called for the award to be annulled, claiming it was a protest vote against the poor conditions of Bulgarian football.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/16033250.stm Bulgarian PM wins player of year but wants award annulled] ''BBC Sport'' 5 December 2011.</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/bulgaria/8936332/Bulgarian-prime-minister-beats-Dimitar-Berbatov-in-countrys-best-footballer-poll.html Bulgarian prime minister beats Dimitar Berbatov in country's best footballer poll] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 5 December 2011.

=== Susceptibility to American lobbyism ===
In January 2019, Bulgarian President and former Air Force Commander [[Rumen Radev]] levied heavy criticism against Borisov, saying he "perverted" the tender for the acquisition of new fighter jets intended to replace its ageing [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/news/purchase-of-new-fighter-jets-by-bulgaria-pits-president-against-prime-minister/|title=Purchase of new fighter jets by Bulgaria pits President against Prime Minister|last=Gotev|first=Georgi|date=2019-01-07|website=euractiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> Potential replacements were [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]s, [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|Saab Gripens]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|Lockheed Martin F-16s]] or [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F-18s]]. In December 2018, Borisov's government decided to buy F-16s, ignoring four out of the seven criteria of the tender and exceeding the financial framework. President Radev called this a "triple blow against Bulgaria," adding that the Americans should realise they only won the tender via lobbyism.<ref name=":1" />
{{Quote|text="I insisted that the [tender] procedure and financial framework be respected, which guarantees the best choice, no matter which aircraft it would be. The government did the opposite – they announced the winner in breach of their own rules and those of the Parliament, and even committed to pay an enormous amount.

=== Image controversy and popular protest ===
[[File:Ostavka 6.jpg|thumb|249x249px|The [[2020 Bulgarian protests]]]]
{{Main|2020 Bulgarian protests}}
In June 2020, photographs emerged that purported to show what appeared to be Prime Minister Borisov laying half-naked on a bed, next to a nightstand featuring a handgun and stacks of [[euro]] banknotes. Borisov confirmed that the room in which the photos were taken was his, but denied the gun and money, stating that the images could have been manipulated. Borisov accused President [[Rumen Radev]] of flying a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|consumer drone]] into his residence in order to take the pictures. He also accused former Ombudswoman [[Maya Manolova]], TV star [[Slavi Trifonov]] and his own former second in command [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov]] (who had just left and condemned the ruling party) of involvement in a plot to take photos of him while he was sleeping in a "KGB-Style" [[kompromat]] operation. Radev condemned the leaks and called it an "insane" invasion of the prime minister's privacy. He added that he owns a drone, but that the accusation that he personally piloted it into the prime minister's residence to take pictures was part of Borisov's "fantasy and paranoia".<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 June 2020|title=A Gun on a Nightstand and Wads of Cash Escalate Bulgarian Feud|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/a-gun-on-a-nightstand-and-wads-of-cash-escalate-bulgarian-feud|url-status=live|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gotev|first1=Georgi|last2=Nikolov|first2=Krassen|date=2020-06-18|title=Borissov fends off 'kompromats', says will sleep with a gun|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/borissov-fends-off-kompromats-says-will-sleep-with-a-gun/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.euractiv.com|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Dzhambazova|first1=Boryana|last2=Kingsley|first2=Patrick|date=2020-07-19|title=Showdown on Beach in Bulgaria Balloons into Political Crisis|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/world/europe/bulgaria-protests.html|access-date=2020-07-20|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-18|title=Bedroom Photos Leave Bulgarian Prime Minister Red-faced|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/06/18/bulgarian-prime-minister-enters-a-survival-mode/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Balkan Insight|language=en-US}}</ref> A leaked audio recording was also posted on the internet, in which a voice that strongly resembled Borisov's spoke in very brass tones and insulted a member of the national assembly, as well as various European leaders.<ref>{{Cite web|last=24новини|title=В циничен запис Борисов скандално обижда Цвета Караянчева (аудио)|url=https://24novini.bg/bulgaria/politics/item/27593-v-tsinichen-zapis-borisov-skandalno-obizhda-tsveta-karayancheva-audio|access-date=2020-07-20|website=24novini.bg|language=bg-bg}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Изтече нов запис с гласа на Борисов: Сладур такъв… ще ме притискаш… (АУДИО)|url=https://fakti.bg/razsledvania/492521-izteche-nov-zapis-s-glasa-na-borisov-sladur-takav-shte-me-pritiskash-audio|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Fakti.bg - Да извадим фактите наяве}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Слави Трифонов: Този запис е отвратителен, Гешев да го провери|url=https://fakti.bg/mnenia/483324-slavi-trifonov-tozi-zapis-e-otvratitelen-geshev-da-go-proveri|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Fakti.bg - Да извадим фактите наяве}}</ref> These scandals, along with an intrusion by the Chief Prosecutor into the Bulgarian Presidency triggered the [[2020 Bulgarian protests]] that sought the resignations of Borisov, his government and the chief prosecutor.
