The '''Duke of Lancaster''' is the titular owner of the estates of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and head of the [[History of Lancashire|County Palatine of Lancaster]]. It is also an ancient title that is informally used within [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] to describe [[Elizabeth II]], the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]]. The Duchy of Lancaster exists as a separate entity from the [[Crown Estate]] and currently provides income for the British monarch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.duchyoflancaster.co.uk/about-the-duchy/our-people/duke-chancellor-and-the-officers/|title=HM The Queen, Duke of Lancaster|website=Duchy of Lancaster|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>  The title merged with the crown as a result of the House of Lancaster's participation in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. 

It is customary at formal dinners in the [[Historic Counties of England|historic county]] boundaries of Lancashire and in Lancastrian regiments of the armed forces for the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]] to the crown to be announced as "The Queen, Duke of Lancaster." In addition, in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] it was quite common as late as the second half of the twentieth century to hear [[God Save the Queen|the national anthem]] sung as "God save our gracious Queen, [[long live our noble Duke]],"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ibtimes.com/queen-elizabeth-iis-titles-shockingly-include-duke-lord-despite-being-female-2845251|title=Queen Elizabeth II's Titles  Include 'Duke,' 'Lord' Despite her being a  Female monarch in her own right|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|date=13 October 2019|last=Armecin|first=Catherine}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1190207/queen-elizabeth-ii-news-royal-family-ancient-titles-scotland-spt|title=The Queen's surprising ancient titles revealed - and why her main title causes controversy|newspaper=[[Daily Express]]|date=13 October 2019|last=Kretschmer|first=Anna}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1450151/The-Reverend-John-Williams.html|title=The Reverend John Williams|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=24 December 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Little Book of Lancashire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P-gTDQAAQBAJ&q=%22God+save+our+gracious+Queen,+long+live+our+noble+Duke,%22&pg=PT86|year=2013|publisher=History Press|page=86|location=[[Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]]|last=Tulloch|first=Alexander|isbn=978-0-7524-9746-4}}</ref> but this is a tradition that has no constitutional warrant, and the British monarch is not styled legally so within either the County Palatine of Lancashire nor the Duchy of Lancaster in any official capacity (for example, [[Letters Patent]] or [[Acts of Parliament]]), merely as a sign of local, 'Lancastrian' loyalty.

==History==
There were several Dukes of Lancaster in the 14th and early 15th centuries. There were three creations of the Dukedom of Lancaster. The first creation was on 6 March 1351, for [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont, 4th Earl of Lancaster]], a great-grandson of Henry III; he was also [[Earl of Leicester|4th Earl of Leicester]], [[Earl of Derby|1st Earl of Derby]], [[Earl of Lincoln|1st Earl of Lincoln]] and [[Lord of Bowland]].  He died in 1361 and the peerage expired.

The second creation was on 13 November 1362, for [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt, 1st Earl of Richmond]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lancastercastle.com/history-heritage/duchy-of-lancaster/|title=Duchy of Lancaster|website=Lancaster Castle|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref> who was both Henry Grosmont's son-in-law and also third surviving son of [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]]. John had married [[Blanche of Lancaster|Blanche of Lancaster, 6th Countess of Lancaster]], daughter of Henry Grosmont and heiress to his estates. When John of Gaunt, the 1st Duke of this creation died on 4 February 1399, the Dukedom passed to his son, [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke, 1st Duke of Hereford]].  Later that same year, the new 2nd Duke usurped the throne of England from [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], ascending the throne as Henry IV, at which point the Dukedom [[merged in the Crown]] (i.e. becomes vested with [[the Crown]]).

The third creation was on 10 November 1399, for [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales]], eldest son of the new king. In 1413, the 1st Duke ascended the throne as King Henry V, and the Dukedom merged in the crown again, where it has remained ever since.
