On October 3, 2005, [[Harriet Miers]] was nominated for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] to replace retired Associate Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. Miers was, at the time, [[White House Counsel]], and had previously served in several roles both during Bush's tenure as [[Governor of Texas]] and President.
  
The nomination almost immediately drew criticism, much of it from within the President's own party: [[David Frum]] castigated an "unforced error",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frum.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjM1NDExNTgwNmFkYjc5ODJkNWFjNTdmYzg0MDIyMGQ=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004003034/http://frum.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjM1NDExNTgwNmFkYjc5ODJkNWFjNTdmYzg0MDIyMGQ=|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 October 2008|title=David Frum's Diary on National Review Online|date=4 October 2008}}</ref> and [[Robert Bork]] denounced it a "disaster" and "a slap in the face to the conservatives who've been building up a conservative legal movement for the last 20 years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/9623345|title=MSN - Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|website=NBC News}}</ref> Hearings before the [[United States Senate]] [[Senate Judiciary Committee|Judiciary Committee]] had been scheduled to begin on November 7, and members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leadership had stated before the nomination that they aimed to have the nominee confirmed before [[Thanksgiving]] (November 24).

==Selection process==
[[File:Bush-Miers-051003.jpg|thumb|right|Bush with Miers during the announcement of her nomination]]
On July 1, 2005, Sandra Day O'Connor announced her plan to retire as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, effective as of the date that her replacement was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. Bush appointed Miers as head of the search committee for candidates to replace O'Connor. On July 19, Bush announced that he had chosen [[John Roberts]] as O'Connor's replacement. After [[William Rehnquist]] died of complications from [[thyroid cancer]] on September 3, Bush withdrew this nomination and renominated Roberts for [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]], to which he was confirmed.

Meanwhile, [[United States Senate Minority Leader|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Nevada]]) recommended Miers as O'Connor's successor.<ref>"I had recommended that the President consider nominating Ms. Miers because I was impressed with her record of achievement as the managing partner of a major Texas law firm and the first woman president of the Texas Bar Association.

==Miers's background==
{{Main|Harriet Miers}}

===Education===
Miers attended [[Southern Methodist University]], where she received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[mathematics]] (1967) and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree (1970). However, Miers' education would later prove troublesome during her nomination process. Her academic background went against a tradition that had gained momentum since the late 1970s of appointing justices who had received their collegiate, legal, and other graduate education at elite institutions. At the time of her nomination, all sitting justices hailed from the leading [[Law school rankings in the United States|"Top 14"]] law schools (specifically [[Yale Law School|Yale]], [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], [[Stanford Law School|Stanford]], [[Columbia Law School|Columbia]], and [[Northwestern Law School|Northwestern]]).

Consequently, as the nomination process developed, individuals across the partisan spectrum came to both denigrate Miers on account of her degrees as well as to paint them as a non-issue. Addressing her education, conservative columnist and Harvard-trained psychiatrist [[Charles Krauthammer]] contended that "the Supreme Court is an elite institution. It is not one of the 'popular' branches of government"; conversely, Harry Reid (a graduate of [[George Washington University Law School]]'s part-time program) stated he did not feel an [[Ivy League]] pedigree was a necessary criterion for placement on the court. However, in the long run, discussion over Miers' academic credentials was overshadowed by the focus placed on her career history and ties to the Bush administration, with fears of "snobbery" calls quieting discussion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordpress.com/business/content/shared/news/nation/stories/10/13_COXBUSH_MIERS_PEDIGREE.html |title=Miers' academic background draws scrutiny<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310062033/http://www.oxfordpress.com/business/content/shared/news/nation/stories/10/13_COXBUSH_MIERS_PEDIGREE.html |archive-date=2008-03-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Professional experience===
Miers had [[law clerk|clerked]] for the [[Chief Judge]] of the [[United States District Court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|Northern District of Texas]], but had never served as a judge. She had neither taught nor written to any substantial extent on law. In private practice, as a [[corporate law|corporate litigator]] at the law firm Locke Lord, Miers had courtroom experience, but a scant and undistinguished track record of litigating in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] (almost none litigating constitutional issues), and had never argued a case before the Supreme Court.

Speaking to Miers's lack of credentials, the White House quickly advanced the defense that 41 of the 110 Supreme Court Justices appointed to date had never served as a judge prior to their nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/justices/nopriorexp.html|title=FindLaw Supreme Court Center: Supreme Court: Justices Without Prior Judicial Experience - FindLaw}}</ref>  Some examples during the 20th century include [[William Henry Moody|William Moody]] (appointed 1906), [[Charles Evans Hughes]] (1910), [[James Clark McReynolds|James McReynolds]] (1914), [[Louis Brandeis]] (1916), [[George Sutherland]] (1922), [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]] (1922), [[Harlan F. Stone]] (1925), [[Owen Roberts]] (1930), [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley F. Reed]] (1938), [[Felix Frankfurter]] (1939), [[William O. Douglas]] (1939), [[Frank Murphy]] (1940), [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] (1941), [[Harold Hitz Burton|Harold Burton]] (1945), [[Tom C. Clark]] (1949), [[Earl Warren]] (1953), [[Arthur Goldberg]] (1962), [[Abe Fortas]] (1965), [[Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]] (1972), and [[William Rehnquist]] (1972). The White House's attempt to use this to placate opposition was at best ineffectual, and at worst, backfired: offering the comparison to Fortas or particularly Warren further inflamed opposition among conservatives, who do not look upon either as a great exemplar of the kind of Supreme Court justice desired. The White House also argued that 10 of the 34 Justices appointed since 1933 were appointed from positions within the President's administration (as was the case with Miers). These Justices include the aforementioned Powell, Warren, Frankfurter, and Douglas, as well as [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[Tom C. Clark]].

Reid, who had previously floated Miers as an example of an acceptable nominee (further inflaming conservative hostility),<ref>http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/10/3/112632.shtml{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100301468.html|title=Conservative Republicans Divided Over Nominee|last=Babington|first=Charles|date=2005-10-04|last2=Edsall|first2=Thomas B.|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-10-03-Bush-Miers_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Bush's choice of Miers rewrites script|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/10/|title=TAPPED: October 2005 Archives|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026100246/http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/10/|archive-date=October 26, 2005}}</ref> issued a statement:

==Nomination issues==
Because little was known about Miers' position on divisive issues, and because she had no prior experience as a judge, her nomination was subject to debate on both sides. Many critics were concerned that her inner-circle relationship with the president and his staff could lead to conflicts of interests in court cases. Republican Senator [[Sam Brownback]] stated on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' that "[t]here's precious little to go on and a deep concern that this would be a [[David Souter|Souter]]-type candidate."; in reference to David Souter having been appointed by George H. W. Bush, yet Souter turned out to be considered a mostly liberal justice.<ref name="ABC News">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1184984|title=GOP Senator Concerned About Miers' Abortion Views|date=October 5, 2005|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}</ref>

===Positions on issues that might have come before the court===
====Abortion====
The subject of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', among other [[abortion]]-related Supreme Court precedents, was highly topical in this  nomination, in part because O'Connor had voted to overturn a number of state restrictions on abortion, often in narrowly divided 5–4 decisions.

As the confirmation process proceeded, more became known about Miers' personal/judicial views on abortion. In 1989, when Miers was running for the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] City Council, she allegedly filled out a survey for the anti-abortion group Texas United for Life.<ref>Note that the document referenced does not contain her signature. {{cite web|url=http://wid.ap.org/documents/scotus/miers/miers_tulpac.pdf|title= 1989 Texans United for Life survey|accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> The questionnaire sought to gauge candidates' feelings on the use of [[constitutional amendment]]s or state laws to ban abortions in the event the Supreme Court overturned a 1973 ruling that established abortion rights. The questionnaire asked "If Congress passes a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution that would prohibit abortion except when it was necessary to prevent the death of the mother, would you actively support its ratification by the Texas Legislature." Miers answered "yes" to this question and all others listed.

Miers said in 1992 that she felt Supreme Court nominees should not be asked about how they would rule on abortion issues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.timothypcarney.com/?p=156 |title=Timothy P. Carney<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2005-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210191846/http://www.timothypcarney.com/?p=156 |archive-date=2005-12-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1993, when the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) opted to take a stance in favor of legal access to abortion, Miers fought to have the full membership of the ABA vote on the topic: "If we were going to take a position on this divisive issue, the members should have been able to vote."

It is not clear what impact, if any, her personal views would have had on her judicial rulings. The religious beliefs of nominees on abortion and other controversial social issues have been a significant part of confirmation hearings for nominees thought to have traditional religious beliefs. Some [[civil rights]] activists (notably the [[Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] law professor [[Charles E. Rice|Charles Rice]] in the ''[[National Review]]'', the civil rights group the [[Center for Jewish Values]] and the conservative Catholic group Fidelis)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051005_miers.htm |title=MIERS' RELIGION ALREADY UNDER FIRE |publisher=[[Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights]] |date=October 5, 2005 |accessdate=2007-01-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524165754/http://www.catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051005_miers.htm |archive-date=May 24, 2006 }}</ref> consider such interrogation by senators to be a violation of the constitutional prohibition of any religious tests for federal office.

Senator [[Sam Brownback|Brownback]], a member of the Judiciary Committee, said there was a "good chance" he would vote against Miers if she testified that ''Roe v. Wade'' was "settled law".<ref name="ABC News"/>

Miers withdrew her nomination shortly after an awkward dispute she had in a private talk with Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue was what she had said during their private talk about the right to privacy, a major underpinning of ''Roe v. Wade''.<ref name="hosted.ap.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/31343584|title=MSN - Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|website=NBC News}}</ref>

====Affirmative action====
As President of the [[State Bar of Texas|Texas State Bar]], Miers supported [[affirmative action]], going so far as to continue a [[Quota share|quota system]] for women and ethnic minorities practicing law in the state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/21/AR2005102102139_pf.html|title=Miers Backed Race, Sex Set-Asides|author=Jo Becker and Sylvia Moreno|date=October 22, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-04 | work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Bob Dunn, the outgoing president of the organization, described Miers as "certainly one of the leaders" in supporting the quota system.

====The right to keep and bear arms====
Miers included the "[[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]]" in a list of "precious liberties" contained in a commentary she authored in 1992.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Texas Lawyer|date=July 27, 1992|pages=10|title=Title unknown}}</ref>

====Gay rights====
Although Miers did not make her position clear on [[gay rights]], she hinted at her views in answering a questionnaire submitted to her by a Texas gay rights group during her 1989 campaign for a Dallas City Council position. Miers indicated on the questionnaire that she supported civil rights for [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], but opposed the repeal of the [[sodomy]] laws that were ultimately overturned by a 6–3 decision (with Justice O'Connor in the majority) in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.  Miers was mistakenly thought to have served on the board of the [[ex-gay]] organization [[Exodus International]]; she had actually served on the board of [[Exodus Ministries]], a [[Rehabilitation (penology)|former prisoner rehabilitation]] organization.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush's unconventional choice|last=Feldmann|first=Linda |author2=Warren Richey |author3=Gail Russell Chaddock|date=2005-10-04|accessdate=2008-11-27|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1004/p01s03-usju.html}}</ref>

====Balance of powers====
As President of the Texas State Bar, Miers fought legislation that would curtail the power of the Texas Supreme Court to limit [[attorneys fees]] in [[tort|tort lawsuits]]. Some commentators have asked whether this portends a lack of respect for the proper role of the courts. For example, conservative activist [[Mark Levin]] responded to this information by saying, "[i]f there is a bias toward judicial supremacy, it's best that we know this now, in advance of a confirmation vote."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/9623557|title=Miers' stand on attorney fee caps questioned|date=October 7, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-04|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}</ref> Miers' rationale for withdrawing her nomination—that she feared the Senate's demand for information about her White House work would force a breach of [[Executive Branch]] secrecy—may indicate that she supported expansive presidential powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogdenovo.org/archives/001113.html|title=De Novo: Next Victim, Please|website=www.blogdenovo.org}}</ref>

===Other potential controversies: the Texas Lottery Commission===

From 1995 to 2000, Miers chaired the [[Texas Lottery]] Commission (having been appointed by Bush when he was [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor of Texas]]).

In 1997, the Commission hired Lawrence Littwin as the lottery's executive director; five months later, he was fired. Littwin brought suit over his firing, alleging that the lottery contractor, [[GTECH Corporation|GTech Corporation]], had influenced the Commission to fire him for improper reasons. GTech settled the case by paying him $300,000, with Littwin agreeing not to discuss the case or the settlement.

==Reactions to her nomination==
Miers' nomination drew criticism from both political parties. Principal complaints focused on her credentials, which critics charged were insufficient for the position.

Liberals and many conservatives also charged that her nomination was the result of political [[cronyism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billoreilly.com/show?action=viewTVShow&showID=1490#1|title=Bill O'Reilly: The O'Reilly Factor - Monday, August 27, 2007|first=Bill|last=O'Reilly|website=www.billoreilly.com}}</ref> Since her legal experience did not compare to that of other possible candidates, like federal appellate judges [[Edith Jones]], [[Priscilla Owen]], and [[Janice Rogers Brown]], it was deemed likely that President Bush nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications.<ref>{{cite news

[[Paul Schenck|Robert Schenck]] had access to [[Harriet Miers]] during her brief Supreme Court nomination and took exception that she was attending [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Washington, D.C.]] rather than a local chapter of the more fundamentalist [[Christian churches and churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] as she had done back in Texas.{{citation needed|reason=which one?|date=August 2016}}

Colbert said in the guise of his [[Stephen Colbert (character)|character]] on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'':<ref name="word">{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/the_word/index.jhtml?start=81|date=2005-10-17|accessdate=2006-06-04 |title=The Colbert Report: Videos: The Word (Truthiness) }}</ref>

{{quote|Consider Harriet Miers. If you 'think' about it, of course her nomination's absurd. But the president didn't say he 'thought' about his selection. He said this:

{{block indent|(''video clip of President Bush:'') 'I know her heart.'}}
Notice how he said nothing about her brain? He didn't have to. He ''feels'' the truth about Harriet Miers.}}

Following the October 3 nomination of Miers for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court by President [[George W. Bush]]; then Ohio Senator [[Mike DeWine]] stated that "I think the fact she doesn't have judicial experience will add to the diversity of the Supreme Court. There is no reason everyone has to have that same [judicial] background."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2010/05/10/gop_on_kagan_need_for_judicial_experience/|title=GOP: Judicial experience matters, unless it doesn't|date=May 10, 2010|last=Madden| first=Mike|work=Salon|access-date=April 15, 2019|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Withdrawal==
President George W. Bush withdrew his nomination of Harriet Miers shortly after an awkward dispute she had with Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue was what she had said during their private talk about the right to privacy, an underpinning of the high court's 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision establishing abortion rights.<ref name="hosted.ap.org"/>

Bush stated that Miers asked to [[Defeated and withdrawn nominees to the Supreme Court of the United States|withdraw her nomination]] on October 27, 2005, and he acceded to her wishes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/9837502|title=MSN - Outlook, Office, Skype, Bing, Breaking News, and Latest Videos|website=NBC News}}</ref> The narrative where Miers jumped rather than being pushed was accepted at first, but has since been challenged. Most prominently, [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]] reported that Miers' abysmal performance in [[murder board]]s before the hearings made clear to [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Andy Card]] and Deputy White House Counsel [[William K. Kelley]] that the game was up, at which point, they demanded Miers withdraw. After initial resistance, she acquiesced.<ref>See [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]], SUPREME CONFLICT 282-4 (2007).</ref>

Bush and Miers attributed her withdrawal to requests from the Judiciary Committee for the release of internal White House documents that the administration had insisted were protected by [[executive privilege]]. Both Republican and Democratic senators denied that they were attempting to obtain privileged documents.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/27/miers.nominations/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com - Miers withdraws Supreme Court nomination - Oct 28, 2005 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Most observers instead believed this rationale was a way for the Bush administration to pull her nomination and still "save face," by avoiding a direct acknowledgment of the lack of support for her nomination. The claim of executive privilege had been publicly recommended as an "exit strategy" by commentators such as Charles Krauthammer,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/20/AR2005102001635.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Miers: The Only Exit Strategy | first=Charles | last=Krauthammer | date=October 21, 2005 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> and reports indicated that White House advisors had considered that as a tactic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/politics/3413494|title=Bush: Records of Miers' legal advice off-limits|date=25 October 2005}}</ref>

[[Samuel Alito]], a federal judge on the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], was nominated four days after her withdrawal and subsequently confirmed.
