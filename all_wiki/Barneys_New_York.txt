'''Barneys New York Inc.''' was an American [[luxury goods|luxury]] [[department store]] brand, founded in 1923 in [[New York City]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2020/film/news/barneys-closing-end-of-era-1203509762/amp/ Barneys, Fabulous Department Store for Movie Stars, Dies at 97] ''Variety'', Ramin Setoodeh, February 21, 2020 </ref> It introduced major luxury brands including [[Armani]], [[Azzedine Alaïa]], [[Comme des Garçons]], [[Christian Louboutin]], [[Gregory Herman]] and [[Ermenegildo Zegna]] to the US market.

Barneys New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2019 and closed 15 of its 22 stores, including flagship stores in [[Las Vegas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Seattle]]. Following its sale in November 2019, [[Authentic Brands Group]] took control of the Barneys [[brand name]] and licensed it to [[Saks Fifth Avenue]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/business/media/barneys-bankruptcy-authentic-brands.html Barneys Is Sold for Scrap, Ending an Era] Vanessa Friedman and Sapna Maheshwari, ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 2019</ref>

==Operations under Pressman family ownership==
===Early history===
[[Barney Pressman]] initially opened a men’s discount clothing store.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Lauren|date=2019-04-04|title=Hit by rent hike at New York flagship, Barneys New York gets lifeline with $50 million in credit|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/04/barneys-new-york-secures-50-million-in-credit-after-rent-spike.html|access-date=2020-06-03|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref> His first store was in a {{convert|500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space with {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} of frontage at [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and West 17th Street in [[Manhattan]] in 1923. He raised the $500 to pay the lease by pawning his wife's [[engagement ring]]. Barney's Clothes were stocked with 40 brand name suits and a big sign with a slogan, "No Bunk, No Junk, No Imitations". Barney's sold clothing at discounted prices by purchasing showroom samples, retail overstocks, and manufacturers' closeouts at auctions and bankruptcy sales. He also offered free alterations and free parking to attract customers. And this first of its kind store landed Barney Pressman on many TV and Radio shows.

Pressman claimed to be the first Manhattan retailer to use radio and television, beginning with "Calling All Men to Barney's" radio spots in the 1930s that parodied the introduction of the [[Dick Tracy]] show. He sponsored radio programs featuring Irish tenors and bands playing jigs to advertise Irish [[wool]]ens. Women encased in barrels gave away matchbooks with the store name and address. He also chartered a boat to take 2,000 of his customers from Manhattan to [[Coney Island]].

During the 1960s "Barney’s son, Fred, helped transition from a discount store to a luxury retailer."<ref name=":3" />

In a 1973 interview with ''[[Business Week]]'', [[Fred Pressman]], Barney Pressman's son, stated that he became "convinced that the discount route definitely was not for us. My father and I have always hated cheap goods ... I didn't want to sell low-end merchandise. Now, many of those who chose to are verging on bankruptcy." Fred Pressman's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated:

<blockquote>With his father's blessing, Fred Pressman slowly transformed the store from a salty discount house that sold roast beef sandwiches in its pub to a purveyor of Italian designers with a cafe serving Perrier and light salads. He began to discard the types of suits that his father was prone to unearthing at auctions and bankruptcy sales, peppering the racks instead with then-obscure and top-name designers both, but continued to offer touches like free alterations that gave Barneys its reputation.</blockquote>

Pressman is quoted as saying, "The best value you can offer a customer is personal attention to every detail, and they will return again and again. Ultimately, the customer cares the most about how he or she is treated." Pressman died in July 1996.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |title=Barney's Fred Pressman, 73 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-07-15/news/9607140212_1_barney-pressman-fred-pressman-barneys-new-york |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2011<!--present in achive.org-->}}</ref>

In 1970, Barney's built a fifth story onto its original building and a five-story addition. The original store was renamed America House and the addition was named International House. The expanded store occupied the entire Seventh Avenue block (between 16th and 17th streets), with {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of selling space and 20 individual shops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

International House, Fred Pressman promised, would feature complete collections of European designers, "from denim pants to $250 suits", not just a watered-down "potpourri of fabrics and models". The renovated America House, he said, would hold merchandise from "manufacturers who are in effect designers".

By 1973, the store was stocking 60,000 suits. It carried the full lines of designers such as [[Bill Blass]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Christian Dior]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy]]. It became the first clothing store in the U.S. to stock the full line of [[Giorgio Armani]], after signing an agreement in 1976. Barneys is widely credited to have introduced Giorgio Armani to the American market.<ref name=":0" />

Women's clothing was introduced in 1976 on the third floor of the International House. In the following year, the women's store relocated to The Penthouse, a new top-level enclosure. Barney's also added housewares, cosmetics, and gift departments to the store. Also in 1977, Barney's in-store restaurant was renamed The Cafe and began selling salads, soup and sandwiches.

===Barney's to Barneys===
The company dropped the apostrophe in Barney's in 1981. In 1981, the women's penthouse became a duplex. Barneys imported 80% of the women's and 40% of the men's merchandise. The $25 million, {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} women's store finally opened in 1986 in a row of six townhouses and two larger adjacent buildings across the store along 17th Street. The addition included a unisex beauty salon and restaurant, antiques, and accessories, gifts, and housewares departments. It accounted for about one-third of Barneys' sales of some $90 million the following year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In 1988, Barneys opened a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} men's store in the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The store abandoned its Seventh Avenue flagship in 1993, moving to the current {{convert|230000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, nine-story, [[Kohn Pederson Fox]]-designed Manhattan store on [[Madison Avenue]] at East 61st Street. It was the largest new store in New York City since the [[Great Depression]]. The store is a 22-story building with 14 floors of offices above the store. The wood floors, a marble mosaic on the lobby floor, gold-leaf ceilings, and lacquered walls of the new Barneys store cost $267 million.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1989, the store formed a holding company with Japanese department store [[Isetan]] to operate stores in both countries. The first Tokyo store opened in November 1990. The agreement also called for the [[holding company]] to spend $250,000 to open 30 smaller stores of approximately {{convert|6,500|sqft|m2}}.<ref>{{cite news |title=Company News; Barneys to Open California Store |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/08/business/company-news-barneys-to-open-california-store.html?src=pm |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=8 June 1989}}</ref> The earliest of these smaller format stores opened in [[Costa Mesa, California]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barneys N.Y. to Open South Coast Plaza Store |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-23/business/fi-601_1_barney-pressman-barneys-new-york-costa-mesa-store |last=Galante |first=Mary Ann |date=23 May 1989 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

Barneys opened its first department store outside Manhattan in [[Chicago]], in 1993, followed by another large store in [[Beverly Hills, California]], in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barneys to Open Beverly Hills Store |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-08/business/fi-2018_1_barneys-new-york-open-beverly-hills-store-saks-fifth-avenue |date=8 June 1989 |last=Groves |first=Martha |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> The Chicago store closed in 2019.

====1996 bankruptcy====
In 1995, the Pressman family intended to close the investment relationship with Isetan consolidating the Barneys retail business and Isetan investment in the United States real estate for the Barneys flagship stores in New York, Chicago, and Beverly Hills. At the conclusion of this consolidation, the real estate investment and the retail businesses would be held in one company.

During the consolidation effort, Isetan's final funding of the real estate investment was intended to be processed through a Pressman family holding company, PREEN ('''P'''ressman '''R'''obert '''E'''ugene '''E'''lizabeth '''N'''ancy) and then directed to the real estate development.  Instead of the funds flowing directly through the holding company to the real estate investment, they were given in exchange to BNY Licensing (another Pressman family company that held the Barneys trademarks) for the projected 50 year royalty stream due BNY Licensing from Isetan for their Barneys Japan business. Isetan was unaware of this transaction at the time.

Isetan had reported their investment in Barneys earlier in the year as a current asset expressing their intent and belief that it would be concluded in 1995/first quarter 1996. Isetan considered the handling of the final investment a breach in trust, and stopped efforts to consolidate the investment and the Pressman family business.

In December 1995, under the advice of John P. Campo of LeBeouf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae and Anthony Grillo of The Blackstone Group, the Pressmans recognizing that consolidating the investment and the business was no longer viable, voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. It was believed that, only in bankruptcy court, could the agreement between the Pressman family and Isetan be dismissed and a new agreement be authored. The strategy failed.

The company filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in early January 1996. The bankruptcy allowed the company to close stores that were opened early in the company's expansion and were no longer consistent with the company's strategy. These stores included stores in Cleveland, Ohio; Costa Mesa, California; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Short Hills, New Jersey. In subsequent years, management would re-enter some of these markets with larger flagship stores.

==Operations during 21st century==
===2000&ndash;2010===
On December 20, 2004, the Pressman family sold its remaining ownership, less than 2%, to the [[Jones Apparel Group]], which in turn sold the company in September 2007 to [[Dubai]]-based [[private equity]] firm Istithmar PJSC for $937.4 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Apparel Group buys Barneys for $400 million |url=https://www.jckonline.com/editorial-article/jones-apparel-group-buys-barneys-for-400-million/ |date=15 November 2004 |magazine=JCK}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Jones Sells Barneys to Dubai Firm |url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10364441/1/jones-sells-barneys-to-dubai-firm.html |journal=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=June 22, 2007 |accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref> Included in Istithmar's purchase was an estimated $500 million in debt. "The luxury market took a sharp turn for the worse after Istithmar's acquisition of Barneys. U.S. sales of high end clothing, fragrances and accessories slipped 14% in 2009, according to Bain & Co. Although luxury was a star performer over the 2010 holiday season, spending trends have yet to recover to pre-recessionary levels. The privately held company doesn't reveal financial results but said that EBITDA rose by $30 million in 2010."<ref name="dodes1">{{cite news |last=Dodes |first=Rachel |title=Barneys, Prada in Tussle |url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704570104576124420342774508 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=5 February 2011<!--present in archive.org-->|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

===2010&ndash;2019===
Howard Socol, Barneys' former CEO, resigned shortly after the change in ownership. The company failed to fill the position for over two years until it appointed Mark Lee to the post in September 2010. Lee is the former chief executive of [[Gucci Group]] and has consulted and sat on the board of many other fashion companies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dodes |first=Rachel |title=Barneys Brings in Gucci Veteran |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447443045315982 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=24 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126140812/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703846604575447443045315982.html |archivedate=26 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> After Lee's appointment, Barneys experienced changes in its staff, advertising, and website.

Barney's advertisements and catalogs are usually shot in-house, but for Spring 2011 candid shots by art photographers such as [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], [[Nan Goldin]] and [[Juergen Teller]] were taken behind-the-scenes during [[New York Fashion Week]]. Some existing stores will face new renovations such as the in [[Madison Avenue]] location's main floor and Co-Op levels. The traditional red awnings have been changed to black. Barneys' website has been revamped and has launched a new site called "The Window" which is the retailer's primary "social media landing page"—a window into the Barneys world, with news about fashion and happenings at Barneys stores.<ref name="dodes1" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Horyn |first=Cathy |title=Barney's New Chief Explains Those Changes |url=http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/barneyss-new-chief-explains-those-changes/?scp=1&sq=barneys&st=cse |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=4 February 2011 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

As of February 2011, Barneys no longer sold [[Prada]] (with the exception of shoes and [[menswear]]) because of disagreements concerning prices and inventory control. Prada wanted to lease space, but control its own inventory and markdowns under a concession model. Barneys declined.<ref name="dodes1"/>

In May 2012, [[Perry Capital]] acquired a majority ownership of the company which reduced its $590 million debt to $50 million. It will have three seats on the seven-member board. The former majority owner [[Istithmar World]] as well as new investor [[Yucaipa Cos]] will also be on the board as will current executive chairman Mark Lee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/05/08/bloomberg_articlesM3NVYH6VDKJ001-M3POB.DTL |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910054605/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2012/05/08/bloomberg_articlesM3NVYH6VDKJ001-M3POB.DTL |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Two new board members |url-status=dead |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>

In December 2013, ''[[Women's Wear Daily]]'' announced that the retailer would return to the portion of its original Seventh Avenue site being vacated by bankrupt [[Loehmann's]].

====2019 bankruptcy====
On August 6, 2019, Barneys New York filed for bankruptcy once more.

On 25 October 2019, [[Authentic Brands Group]] announced it had won the bidding process ($271.4 million bid).

==Barneys New York CO-OP==
Established in 1986, the Barneys New York CO-OP originally existed as the contemporary department within Barneys flagship stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vmsd.com/content/barneys-ny-ending-co-op-brand |title=Barneys N.Y. Ending Co-op Brand |date=25 July 2013 |journal=VMSD}}</ref> Created to house trendier and less expensive product than the rest of the store, the CO-OP was aimed at younger shoppers with smaller budgets than a traditional Barneys customer. The CO-OP department was spun-off into a separate chain of stores in the 2000s, primarily located in shopping malls and lifestyle centers. At its height, there were more than 20 CO-OP stores throughout the United States.

In 2013, Barneys retired the CO-OP name. Several CO-OPs were converted into boutique versions of the flagship Barneys New York brand, but most closed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2013/03/06/barneys-rebranding-co-op-stores-signals-the-start-of-a-more-luxe-era/#449bdb3a3240 |title=Barneys Rebranding Co-op Stores Signals the Start of a More Luxe Era |journal=Forbes |date=6 March 2013 |first=Lydia |last=Dishman}}</ref>

==Controversies==
===Use of "Co-op" in name===
The 2010 opening of the Brooklyn, New York CO-OP location raised some concerns among members of the [[Park Slope Food Coop]] regarding the use of the term "co-op" by a for-profit corporation. According to the general manager of the Food Coop, Barneys's use of the term is a violation of the New York State Cooperative Corporations Law.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/16/all_parkslopefoodcoop_2010_04_23_bk.html |first=Stephen |last=Brown |title=Is the Barneys Co-op breaking the law — with its name? |newspaper=[[The Brooklyn Paper]] |date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

Barneys was repeatedly accused of [[racial profiling|racially profiling]] its customers throughout the years. In 1996, Johnnie Roberts, a journalist for ''Newsweek'', published an account of an incident taking place in the spring of 1990 in which he was mistakenly [[shopping while black|accused of shoplifting because he is African American]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/25/barneys-racial-profiling_n_4164447.html |first=Kim |last=Bhasin |title=Barneys' Racial Profiling Problem Stretches Back At Least 20 Years |newspaper=[[HuffPost]] |date=25 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Trayon Christian, a 19-year-old African American, purchased a $350 [[Ferragamo]] belt and was arrested shortly after leaving the store. The police had received a call from the store claiming that the [[debit card]] used was fraudulent, even though the customer provided proper identification at the time of the purchase. The officers questioned Christian on how he was able to afford the purchased belt, and accused him of using a fraudulent card. He was handcuffed, detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated further. He was later released after the police contacted Chase Bank to verify ownership of the card.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/23/justice/new-york-profiling-lawsuit/ |title=Student sues Barneys department store, NYPD, alleges racial profiling |last=Winsor |first=Morgan |work=[[CNN]] |date=25 October 2013}}</ref>

Another African American shopper, Kayla Phillips, came forward with a similar claim after she purchased a $2,500 [[Céline (brand)|Céline]] handbag with her debit card. Both shoppers believe they were targeted because of their race after they purchased costly items and have stated they intend on filing discrimination lawsuits against the store.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57609296/barneys-nypd-under-fire-for-alleged-racial-profiling/ |title=Barneys, NYPD under fire for alleged racial profiling |work=[[CBS News]] |date=25 October 2013}}</ref>

As a result of these high-profile cases, [[Al Sharpton]] threatened to boycott the store in October 2013. Sharpton compared Barneys practice of racial profiling to the controversial [[New York City stop-and-frisk program|stop-and-frisk]] policy practiced by the NYPD.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/26/us-usa-newyork-barneys-macys-idUSBRE99P08420131026 |title=Macy's joins Barneys in brewing NYC 'shop-and-frisk' scandal |website=[[Reuters]] |date=26 October 2013}}</ref> Within days of Sharpton’s boycott announcement, fans petitioned rapper and businessman [[Jay-Z]] to sever ties with the retailer with whom he had a partnership.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brown |first=August |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-jay-z-barneys-collection-protest-racial-profiling-20131025,0,1707034.story#axzz2isWfSEyK/ |title=Jay Z's Barneys collection protested after racial profiling claims |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 October 2013}}</ref> Jay-Z responded saying that he would look into the matter more thoroughly rather than make a snap judgment stating, "I move and speak based on facts and not emotion."<ref name=":1">{{cite web |last=Danton |first=Eric |title=Jay Z Hits Back on Criticism Over Barneys Partnership |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-hits-back-on-criticism-over-barneys-partnership-20131028 |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=28 October 2013 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref> In November 2013, Jay-Z stated that his deal with Barneys would continue as planned, with the condition that he be placed in a leadership role on a committee specifically organized to deal with racial profiling in the store.<ref name=":2">{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Julee |title=Jay Z Confirms Barneys Collaboration Is Still On, But With A Few Conditions |date=16 November 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/16/jay-z-barneys-deal-on-conditions_n_4287086.html |newspaper=Huff Post |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Other conditions required that all of the proceeds of the BNY SCC collection be donated to Jay-Z's charity, the Shawn Carter Scholarship Foundation. This was a major increase from the 25% of the proceeds that was initially agreed upon. As well, Barneys agreed to donate 10% of all retail of all stores nationwide as well as its web store, Barneys.com, on November 20, 2013, which would guarantee a total of at least one million dollars.<ref name=":2" />

===Live butterfly display===
In 2018, Barneys used live butterflies to introduce a new line of jewelry and accessories, asking customers and employees to interact with [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]] as they flitted around display cases in the Beverly Hills store.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jean |last=Palmieri |title=Barneys Bans Butterflies |url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/barneys-bans-butterflies-1202769223/ |journal=Women's Wear Daily |date=2 August 2018 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] reported "that there were many dead and dying butterflies languishing around the display area, behind plants and in plant beds." Barneys responded by banning the use of live butterflies from any future promotions and making a donation to PETA as an apology.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Moen |title=Barneys Lets Butterflies Fly Away |url=http://www.papermag.com/barneys-butterflies-2592239944.html |magazine=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] |date=3 August 2018}}</ref>

=== Labor issues ===
The [[union busting]] firm Kulture Consulting, LLC was hired in 2015. According to a Department of Labor document, Kulture “presented informational meetings to company employees relative to the process of unionization” at Barney's locations in Beverly Hills, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://olms.dol-esa.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=631558&rptForm=LM10Form |title=LM10Form Barneys & Kulture Consulting Agreement 2015 |website=Office of Labor-Management Standards - OLMS}}</ref> In Chicago representatives from the labor union [[Workers United]] reported that "management called workers into one-on-one meetings" and engaged in "scare tactics".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-barneys-union-1013-biz-20151012-story.html |title=Chicago employees of Barneys New York reject union |last=Janssen |first=Kim |website=chicagotribune.com |language=en-US |access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> In December 2018, Barneys hired Kulture Consulting to present "informational meetings" with employees at its Las Vegas location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://olms.dol-esa.gov/query/orgReport.do?rptId=686792&rptForm=LM20Form |title=LM20Form Barneys & Kulture Consulting Agreement 2018 |website=Office of Labor-Management Standards - OLMS}}</ref>
