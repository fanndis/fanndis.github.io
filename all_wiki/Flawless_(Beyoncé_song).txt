"'''Flawless'''" (stylized as "'''***Flawless'''") is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé Knowles]] from her [[Beyoncé (album)|self-titled fifth studio album]] (2013). Knowles wrote the track with [[HAZE|Rashad Muhammad]], [[Terius Nash]], [[Chauncey Hollis]] and [[Rey Reel|Raymond DeAndre Martin]], with production handled by Hollis, Knowles, Martin, Muhammad, and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]]. An early version of the song, titled "'''Bow Down / I Been On'''", was released onto the Internet by Beyoncé in March 2013.

Musically, "Flawless" consists of two parts&nbsp;– "Bow Down" and "Flawless", divided by a speech titled "[[We Should All Be Feminists]]" delivered by Nigerian writer [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]] at a [[TED (conference)#TEDx|TEDxEuston]] conference. It is a [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]]-influenced song, with a dirty groove and a clattering beat. After being released as a radio single, the song peaked at number 41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], in addition to charting on several of the [[Billboard charts|magazine's component charts]].

A music video for the song was directed by [[Jake Nava]], and includes choreography by [[Les Twins]] and Chris Grant. It was released on the [[iTunes Store]] through ''Beyoncé'' itself on December 13, 2013. "Flawless" was performed live by Beyoncé during the last, European leg of [[The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour]] and her co-headlining [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] with [[Jay-Z]]. It was also performed at the [[2014 MTV Video Music Awards]] where the singer sang a medley of songs from her fifth studio album.

In December 2013, Beyoncé explained the idea behind "Bow Down" on [[iTunes Radio]]: "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that felt the need to defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates you. Imagine a person that doesn't believe in you. And look in the mirror and say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before."<ref name="IBTimes">{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/beyonce-explains-bow-down-it-was-beyonce-was-angry-1515280 |title=Beyoncé Explains 'Bow Down': 'It Was The Beyoncé That Was Angry' |first=Amethyst |last=Tate |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=December 19, 2013 |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Idolator iTunes Radio">{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7498577/beyonce-itunes-radio-song-introduction-justin-timberlake-sia-boots-bow-down |title=Beyonce Introduces 'Beyonce': Justin Timberlake, Pageants & Her Incredible "Bow Down" Explanation |first=Mike |last=Wass |publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |date=December 17, 2013 |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref>

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie praised the song, stating that she "likes the idea that Beyonce's song might make girls feel that they can ask to try to do these things" and further said "I have had young people in Nigeria who probably would have never heard of my TED talk without Beyonce and who are now talking about feminism."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/story/chimamanda-beyonce-is-helping-feminist-talk_4151377 |title=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie - Chimamanda: Beyonce is helping feminist talk |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=April 11, 2014 |access-date=June 17, 2014}}</ref>

{{cquote|
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller. We say to girls, 'You can have ambition, but not too much. 
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful. Otherwise you will threaten the man.'
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important. Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support. But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors – not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men. We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.

''The Guardian'''s [[Mikki Kendall]] wrote, "In 'Flawless' (a track that leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We should all be feminists', adroitly addressing the idea that she is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like a lot of black American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her as much as anything else in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun."<ref name="Guardian feminist">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-flawless-feminism |title=Beyonce's new album should silence her feminist critics |first=Mikki |last=Kendall |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=December 13, 2013 |access-date=December 14, 2013}}</ref>

However, Catherine A. Traywick of ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' magazine criticized the singer, commenting that "On a track called 'Flawless', Beyonce samples Adichie's April 2013 Ted Talk, which is a thoughtful, amusing examination of subtle sexism in everyday life. Beyonce bookends Adichie's words with distinctly less thoughtful lyrics of her own: She shallowly trumpets material wealth and physical beauty and, working in a few lines from her spring single, advises others to 'Bow down, bitches.'" She continued, "Beyonce gives us a heavily-edited, watered-down version of Adichie's speech that aligns with the singer's banal brand of beginner feminism: She reduces Adichie's powerful message to an overly simplistic, inoffensive pro-girl anthem that does little to challenge trenchant gender ideals."<ref name="Foreign Policy">{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/13/beyonces_new_album_got_FP_global_thinker_chimamanda_adichie_all_wrong |title=Beyonce's New Album Got FP Global Thinker Chimamanda Adichie All Wrong |first=Catherine A. |last=Traywick |work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] |date=December 13, 2013 |access-date=December 15, 2013}}</ref> In the annual [[Pazz & Jop]] mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, "Flawless" was ranked at number 72.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazznjop/singles/2013/ |title=The Village Voice's 41st Pazz & Jop Music Critics Poll: The Last Word on the Year in Music |work=[[The Village Voice]] |access-date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> The following year, "Flawless" was ranked at number nine on the same poll for the best music of 2014, tied with [[DJ Snake]] and [[Lil Jon]]{{'}}s "[[Turn Down for What]]".

The video opens with original footage from ''Star Search'', with young Beyoncé and other members of Girl's Tyme being announced by McMahon. It transitions to other scenes shot in [[black-and-white]], showing Beyoncé [[headbanging]] and [[moshing]] with members of a [[punk subculture]], as well as dancing with a team of street dancers in a graffiti covered alley. Throughout the video, she is seen lip-syncing the lyrics of the song and moving in accordance with its melody while the camera focuses only on her.
