''[[Invictus]]'' is a poem by [[William Ernest Henley]]. Liz recognizes the poem from the 2009 film ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'' and wonders aloud, "Who was the white guy in that?" She is thinking of [[Matt Damon]], who had formerly portrayed her boyfriend [[List of 30 Rock characters#Carol Burnett|Carol]] on ''30 Rock''.<ref name="tinafeytalks">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/01/05/30-rock-exclusive-tina-fey-talks-matt-damons-return-and-angie-jordans-reality-show/|title='30 Rock' exclusive: Tina Fey talks Matt Damon's return and Angie Jordan's reality show|last=Armstrong|first=Jennifer|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 5, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2012}}</ref> Kim Jong-il mentions that [[Laura Ling]] left North Korea because "she can't party as hard as we can".

At the end of the episode, there is another clip (possibly from the same movie as the first clip) starring Tracy Jordan and Kim Jong-il. The scene starts out with the "Coffee's for closers" bit from ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (a movie in which [[Alec Baldwin]], who plays Jack Donaghy, played the part of Blake) before Kim Jong-il says, "Luke, I am your father" (which is a [[misquotation|misquoted]] line from ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''), then says "Ghostbusters!" (in reference to the film).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30rockquotes.net/seasons/season_5/30rockquotes_everything_sunny_all_the_time_always.cfm|title=Everything Sunny All the Time Always|date=2012|accessdate=June 26, 2012}}</ref>
