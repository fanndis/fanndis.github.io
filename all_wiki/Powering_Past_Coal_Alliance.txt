The '''Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA)''' is a group of 104 countries, cities, regions and organisations aiming to accelerate the [[Fossil fuel phase-out|fossil-fuel phase out]] of [[coal-fired power station]]s, except the very few which have [[carbon capture and storage]].<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Blondeel|first1=Mathieu|last2=Van de Graaf|first2=Thijs|last3=Haesebrouck|first3=Tim|date=January 2020|title=Moving beyond coal: Exploring and explaining the Powering Past Coal Alliance|journal=Energy Research & Social Sciences|volume=59|pages=101304|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2019.101304|ref=Exploring|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Shrestha |first1=Priyanka |title=National Grid ESO joins Powering Past Coal Alliance |url=https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/15/national-grid-eso-joins-powering-past-coal-alliance/ |accessdate=21 January 2020 |work=Energy Live News |date=15 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-britain-coal-phase-out-1.4406410|title=Canada and U.K. form alliance to phase out coal to combat climate change|last=Rabson|first=Mia|date=17 November 2017|work=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|access-date=20 January 2020}}</ref> It has been described as a "non-proliferation treaty" for fossil fuels.<ref name="NPT">{{cite news |last1=Blondeel |first1=Thijs |last2=Van de Graaf |first2=Mathieu |title=Growing anti-coal alliance could become non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuel |url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/10/02/growing-anti-coal-alliance-become-non-proliferation-treaty-fossil-fuel/ |accessdate=21 January 2020 |work=Climate Home News |date=10 February 2019}}</ref> The project was undertaken with financial support from the [[Government of Canada]], through their environmental department known as [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/about|title=Our mission {{!}} Powering Past Coal Alliance|website=Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA)|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> 

==History==
The Alliance was launched by [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] at the [[COP23]] climate summit in November 2017. Announcing the launch, [[Climate Action Network]]-Canada Executive Director Catherine Abreu said:

{{quotation|"Canada and the UK are right to kick-start the Alliance, as science tells us that [[OECD]] countries need to phase out coal by 2030 at the latest”.<ref name ="energyMixPPCLaunch">{{cite news |last1=Beer |first1=Mitchell |title=BREAKING: 25 JURISDICTIONS JOIN CANADA, UK IN COAL PHASEOUT ALLIANCE |url=https://theenergymix.com/2017/11/16/breaking-25-jurisdictions-join-canada-uk-in-coal-phaseout-alliance/ |accessdate=21 January 2020 |work=The Energy Mix |date=26 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="openeduLaunch">{{cite web |title=Canada & UK launch coal phaseout plan |url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/nature-environment/environmental-studies/canada-uk-launch-coal-phaseout-plan |accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}

By the end of the summit, membership had grown to include over 20 countries, regions and organizations.<ref name="abcnet20">{{cite web |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance: 20 countries sign up to phase out coal power by 2030 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/20-countries-have-signed-up-to-phase-out-coal-power-by-2030/9161056 |accessdate=29 September 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}</ref> Within a month membership had grown to over 50 .<ref name="cleantechnica50">{{cite news |last1=Hill |first1=Joshua |title=Powering Past Coal Alliance Membership Blows Out Past 50 |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/13/powering-past-coal-alliance-membership-blows-past-50/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=[[CleanTechnica]] |date=17 December 2017}}</ref>  Its purpose is to establish a new international norm, or “standard of appropriate behaviour”, that coal should not be burned for power.<ref name=":0" />

In April 2018 a research partnership was announced with [[Bloomberg Philanthropies]].<ref name="bloombergApr2018">{{cite web |last1=Cochran |first1=Lee |title=Bloomberg Philanthropies Announces Partnership with Powering Past Coal Alliance to Strengthen Global Efforts to Phase Out Coal |url=https://www.bloomberg.org/press/releases/bloomberg-philanthropies-announces-partnership-powering-past-coal-alliance-strengthen-global-efforts-phase-coal/|website=Bloomberg Philanthropies |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>

In October 2018 the South Korean province of [[South Chungcheong]] became the first jurisdiction in Asia and the largest user of coal power to join the Alliance.<ref name="SauerSK">{{cite news |last1=Sauer |first1=Natalie |title=South Korean province joins international coal phase-out club |url=https://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/10/03/south-korean-province-joins-international-coal-phaseout-club/ |accessdate=21 January 2020 |work=Climate Home News |date=10 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="nrdsSChungcheong">{{cite news |last1=Chen |first1=Han |title=Korean Province to Phase Out Coal: Implications for Asia |url=https://www.nrdc.org/experts/han-chen/korean-province-phase-out-coal-implications-asia |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |date=2 October 2018}}</ref> In December 2018 [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Scotland]], [[Scottish Power]], [[Senegal]] and [[Israel]] also joined<ref name="ccnDec2018">{{cite news |last1=Sauer |first1=Natalie |title=Sydney and Melbourne vow to ditch coal power |url=http://www.climatechangenews.com/2018/12/13/sydney-melbourne-vow-ditch-coal-power/ |accessdate=15 December 2018 |work=Climate Home News |date=13 December 2018}}</ref> and in September 2019 seven new members joined including [[Germany]] and [[Slovakia]].<ref name="NPT" /><ref name="PPCANewMembersSep2019">{{cite web |title=Germany and Slovakia head list of new Alliance members at UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://poweringpastcoal.org/news/PPCA-news/new-alliance-members-un-climate-action-summit |website=poweringpastcoal.org |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref>

==Aims==
Alliance members agree that:<ref name="cleantechnica50" />

* Governments/states will phase out existing traditional coal power.
* Governments/states will create a moratorium on any new traditional coal power stations without operational carbon capture and storage.
* Businesses/organisations will power operations without coal.
* Members will ensure policies and investments support clean power.
* Members will restrict financing for traditional coal power without carbon capture and storage.

==Reaction==
Reacting to the launch, Tracy Carty of [[Oxfam]] said the Alliance:

Business change organisation [[The B Team]] welcomed the Alliance, and argued that exiting coal must happen as a [[Just Transition|just transition]] that protects vulnerable workers and communities such as [[Coal-mining region|coal mining communities]].<ref name="planbTransition">{{cite web|url=https://bteam.org/our-thinking/thought-leadership/powering-past-coal-is-right-move-but-we-cant-do-it-without-a-just-transition|title=Powering past coal is right move, but we can't do it without a just transition|last=Burrow|first=Sharan|last2=Robinson|first2=Mary|date=2020|website=The B Team|accessdate=December 15, 2019}}</ref>
