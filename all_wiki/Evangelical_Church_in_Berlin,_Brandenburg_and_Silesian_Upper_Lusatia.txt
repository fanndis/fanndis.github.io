The '''Evangelical Church Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia''' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz - EKBO}}) is a [[United Protestant]] [[Landeskirche|church body]] in the [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Brandenburg]], [[Berlin]] and a part of [[Saxony]] (historical region of [[Silesia]]n [[Upper Lusatia]]).

The seat of the church is in [[Berlin]]. It is a full member of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland - EKD}}), and is a church of the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]]. The leader of the church is bishop Dr. [[Markus Dröge]] (2010). The EKBO is one of 20 [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]], and [[United church]]es of the EKD and is itself a United church. The church has 940,419 members (December 2018<ref>[https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2018.pdf Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland – Kirchemitgliederzahlen Stand 31. Dezember 2018] EKD, January 2020</ref>) in 1,770 parishes. The church is a member of the [[Union Evangelischer Kirchen|Union of Evangelical Churches]] ({{lang-de|Union Evangelischer Kirchen - UEK}}) and the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]]. In Berlin and [[Görlitz]] the church runs two academies. [[St. Mary's Church, Berlin]], is the church of the [[bishop]] of the EKBO with the [[Berlin Cathedral]] being under joint supervision of all the member churches of the UEK.

== Some theological statements ==
The theology of the church goes back to [[Martin Luther]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Since 1927 the [[ordination of women]] has been allowed, and the [[blessing of same-sex unions]] has been allowed by the [[synod]] but depends on the local [[Presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]] ({{lang-de|Gemeindekirchenrat}}).

==History==
After the [[Second World War]] the integrated [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] (under this name 1922–1953, then renamed into ''Evangelical Church of the Union'') was transformed into an umbrella organization. In 1947 its ecclesiastical provinces ({{lang-de|Kirchenprovinzen}}), as far as their territories were not annexed by Poland or the Soviet Union, became independent church bodies of their own.

===Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg===
The ''March of Brandenburg'' ecclesiastical province (including Berlin, but after 1945 without the territory east the [[Oder-Neiße line]]), which until 1933 was headed in rotation by the [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|general superintendents]] of [[Kurmark]], [[Neumark]]-[[Lower Lusatia]], and Berlin, became the ''Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg''. After 1945, the church covered only the territory still in Germany.

From 1972 on this church body ran double administrative structures in [[West Berlin]] and [[East Berlin]] - also competent for [[Brandenburg]] - because the communist government of [[East Germany]] did not allow pastors and church functionaries to travel freely between East and West. The two church bodies reunited in 1991.

===Evangelical Church of Silesia(n Upper Lusatia)===
In 1946 the Silesian ecclesiastical province, presided over by [[Ernst Hornig]], held its first post-war provincial synod in then already Polish [[Świdnica]] (formerly Schweidnitz). But on 4 December 1946 Poland deported Hornig from [[Wrocław]] (formerly Breslau) beyond the Lusatian Neiße, where he took his new seat in the German part of the now divided city of [[Görlitz]] of the former Prussian [[Lower Silesia Province (Prussia)|province of Lower Silesia]]. In 1947 the Polish government also expelled the remaining members of the Silesian [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]], which temporarily could continue to officiate in Wrocław. Görlitz became the seat of the tiny territorial rest of the Silesian ecclesiastical province, constituting on May 1, 1947 as the independent ''Evangelical Church of Silesia'' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche von Schlesien}}) - comprising the small parts of [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]] remaining with Germany after 1945. 

All of the church property east of the Oder-Neiße Line, parochial and provincial alike, was expropriated without compensation, and the church buildings were mostly taken over by the Roman Catholic Church in Poland. A small number of Silesian churches are owned today by Protestant congregations of the [[Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland]] (see e.g. [[Churches of Peace]]). 

On April 9, 1968 East Germany adopted its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|second constitution]], accounting for the de facto transformation into a communist dictatorship. Thus the East German government deprived the church bodies of their status as statutory bodies ({{lang-de|Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts}}) and abolished the [[church tax]], by which parishioners' contributions had been automatically collected as a surcharge on the income tax. Now parishioners would have to fix the level of their contributions and to transfer them again and again on their own. This together with ongoing discrimination of church members, which resulted in many people leaving the church, effectively eroded the financial situation of the church bodies in the East.

In 1968, churches were reclassified as civic associations, and the East German government required the Evangelical Church of Silesia to remove the word "Silesia" from its name. The church body then chose the new name ''Evangelical Church of the Görlitz Ecclesiastical Region''. 

With the end of the East German dictatorship in 1989, the things changed decisively. In 1992 the ''Evangelical Church of the Görlitz Ecclesiastical Region'' dropped its unwanted name and chose the new name of ''Evangelical Church of Silesian Upper Lusatia''. 

Due to increasing [[irreligion]], the low birth rates in Germany since the 1970s, and low numbers of Protestant immigrants, the Protestant church bodies in Germany are undergoing a severe shrinking of parishioners and thus of parishioners' contributions. So church bodies are forced to reorganise their efforts also with respect to the financial situation. 

In 2004 the Evangelical Church of the Silesian Upper Lusatia merged with the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg to become the present church body. The [[Ordination of women]] were allowed. In June 2017, the church votes to allow [[blessing of same-sex unions|same-sex marriages]] in its churches.<ref>[https://www.ekbo.de/feiern/lebensfeste/trauung/trau-dich-trauung-fuer-alle.html EKBO.de:  Die evangelische Kirche in Berlin-Brandenburg traut ab sofort Paare (German)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422131515/https://www.ekbo.de/feiern/lebensfeste/trauung/trau-dich-trauung-fuer-alle.html |date=2017-04-22 }}, June 2017</ref>

== Leading persons and bishops in history ==
Today the leading bishop is elected for ten years from the synod and can be reelected for a second term. Since 1817, when the Lutheran, Calvinist and newly founded united congregations formed a common administrative umbrella, later called [[Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces|Evangelical Church in Prussia's older Provinces]], the area comprised by today's church body formed part of the two old-Prussian ecclesiastical provinces of Silesia ({{lang-de|link=no|Kirchenprovinz Schlesien}}) and of the March of Brandenburg ({{lang-de|link=no|Kirchenprovinz Mark Brandenburg}}). Until 1933/1934 the spiritual leaders of the Evangelical church were called general superintendents ({{lang-de|link=no|Generalsuperintendent[en]}}) with regional competences. The adulteration of the church constitution by the Nazi-submissive [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]] was accompanied by new titles (provincial bishop, {{lang-de|link=no|Provinzialbischof}}) with hierarchical supremacy over parishioners and church employees, and renamings (provosts {{lang-de|link=no|Propst}} instead of general superintendents). After 1945 the offices of general superintendents as spiritual leaders were reconstituted. The two ecclesiastical provinces assumed independence as the [[Evangelical Church of Silesia]] (as of 1947) and the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg (as of 1948) when their respective provincial synods legislated new church constitutions. Both independent [[Landeskirche|regional Protestant church bodies]] created its office of an elected chairperson called bishop, in Protestant tradition of course without hierarchical supremacy. After the merger of both churches in 2004 [[Wolfgang Huber]] has been elected the first bishop of the merged Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia ({{lang-de|link=no|Evangelische Kirche Berlin-Brandenburg-schlesische Oberlausitz; EKBO}}.

====Bishopric of the March of Brandenburg====
In 1933 the Prussian government imposed new leaders, who reshaped the structures. The evangelical church (then named [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]]) underwent a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] into a schismatic streamlined Nazi-obedient branch and a steadfast, truly Protestant branch, clinging to the [[Confessing Church]]. The bishops were subordinate to the newly instituted State Bishop ({{lang-de|Landesbischof}}) of the ''Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union'', [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)|Ludwig Müller]]. During Church Affair Minister [[Hanns Kerrl]]'s attempt to force the Confessing Church and the officially recognised hierarchy to reunite, 1935–1937, many outspoken Nazi protagonists were furloughed. After the attempts to compromise the Confessing Church opposition turned out less successful than expected many functions remained simply vacant and the Church Affair Ministry and its favourites usurped direct influence by orders and ordinances.

===General superintendents since 1945===
In 1945 the pre-1933 structures were provisionally restituted. The provisionally leading ''advisory council'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Beirat}}) reconfirmed Dibelius as general superintendent of the Kurmark (i.e. Electoral March). The Beirat also commissioned Dibelius to serve per pro the vacant general superintendencies of Berlin and the New March-Lower Lusatia. The Soviet occupational power agreed that Dibelius would use the title of Bishop, better recognisable for the Soviets as clerical title than the term general superintendent mostly unknown in Russian. In 1949 the Kurmark ceded deaneries to the [[New March]]-[[Upper Lusatia]] general superintendency which had lost almost all the New March, Polish annexed in March 1945, by the flight and expulsion of its parishioners living there. The New March-Upper Lusatia general superintendency was renamed into Cottbus after its seat. In 1963 the new Eberswalde general superintendency was partitioned from the Kurmark, which was renamed on that occasion to Neuruppin (and again into Potsdam in 2010). The Eberswalde general superintendency remerged in that of Neuruppin in 1996. In 2003, with the merger of the Evangelical Church in Silesian Upper Lusatia, its region became a subdivision of the EKBO.
