==History==
CEO Coppy Holzman founded Charitybuzz out of his [[Westport, Connecticut]] home in April 2005 with partners Serena Chew and Brad Reisner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Chris|title=Todd Wagner Acquires Controlling Stake in Auction Platform Charitybuzz|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/todd-wagner-acquires-controlling-stake-830586|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=11 September 2020|date=8 October 2015}}</ref> After a conversation with [[Chevy Chase]] and President [[Bill Clinton]] at a reception to benefit the [[Clinton Library]] in late 2004.<ref name="Entrepreneur 2012">{{cite web|last=Moran|first=Gwen|title=Charitybuzz's Big Idea: Altruistic Online Auctions|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/222472|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>  They launched Charitybuzz a few months later with one employee and a directive from Chase to raise funds for [[The Center for Environmental Education]]. Holzman and his team persuaded 70 celebrities and luxury brands into donating meet-and-greets, VIP tickets, vacations and other gifts for the company’s first auction. The first experience auctioned was a Caddyshack golf outing with Bill Murray and Chase.<ref name="Entrepreneur 2012" /> After a segment with Chase on the TODAY show, the online auction site raised $250,000 within two weeks.<ref name="Lady Luxe">{{cite web|last=Sweet|first=Katherine|title=Charitybuzz: Online luxe auctions that make a difference|url=http://www.ladylux.com/style/site/article/charitybuzz-online-luxe-auctions-that-make-a-difference/|publisher=Lady Luxe|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> After its initial success, Charitybuzz's business grew quickly through word of mouth.<ref name="Entrepreneur 2012" />

Holzman ran Charitybuzz part-time until the fall of 2007, when he committed to operating the business full-time and moved the company out of his home and into an office space. In 2008, he registered Charitybuzz as a sub-chapter S in Delaware and secured a board of directors which included [[Kerry Kennedy]], [[Peter Borish]], Jonah Goodhart, Jon Melzer, Stuart Sundlow, and Jayni Chase.<ref name=Crunchbase>{{cite web|title=Charitybuzz|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/charitybuzz|publisher=Crunchbase|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

Soon after, during the height of the recession in 2009, the company marked $100 million in bids and one million unique visitors.<ref name="Entrepreneur 2012" /> By 2010, with more than 1,500 online charity auctions complete, Charitybuzz doubled in size by expanding its focus to include corporate philanthropy support.  The company subsequently moved its headquarters and staff from Connecticut to an 8,000 square foot office at 437 Fifth Avenue in New York City. <ref name="Crain's New York">{{cite web|last=Souccar|first=Miriam|title=Charitybuzz, in growth mode, moves to Manhattan|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100922/FREE/100929935|publisher=Crain's New York|accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=Bloomberg>{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Patrick|title=Jay-Z's New Year's Eve, LeBron Jersey Fuel Charitybuzz Auctions|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-27/jay-z-s-new-year-s-eve-lebron-jersey-fuel-charitybuzz-auctions.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="People's Sexiest">{{cite web|last=Hacket|first=Larry|title=Editor's Letter|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20443731,00.html|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="Reuters Christie's">{{cite news|last=Michaud|first=Chris|title=Artists, designers join forces for green auction|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/us-finearts-auction-green-idUSTRE70I21420110119|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 January 2011|date=19 January 2011}}</ref><ref name="IBTimes AP">{{cite web|last=Zinderman|first=Carly|title=Charitybuzz and Audemars Piguet Watches Join Forces for Charity|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/contents/20100528/charitybuzz-and-audemars-piguet-watches-join-forces-charity.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="People Macy's">{{cite web|title=Have Jessica Simpson’s Christmas Tree in Your Home this Holiday|url=http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2011/11/10/macys-tree-jessica-simpson/|publisher=People StyleWatch|accessdate=10 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114232820/http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2011/11/10/macys-tree-jessica-simpson/#|archive-date=14 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
