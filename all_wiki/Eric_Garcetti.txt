Voters approved the bond with just over 76% of the vote, making it the largest clean water bond in the United States.<ref name="SmartVoter" />

In 2005, Garcetti helped found the Los Angeles Neighborhood Land Trust. He authored two of the nation's most far-reaching municipal green building ordinances: the first requires all city buildings to be built to the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED-certified standard]], and the second mandates that all [[commercial buildings]] of more than {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} in Los Angeles be built to a LEED standard.

In July 2010, Garcetti, then council president, weakened a 2009 lawn watering ordinance, allowing watering three days per week instead of two. The ordinance restricting watering to two days a week had been passed 13 months earlier by Mayor [[Antonio Villaraigosa]]. While it helped the city cut its water use and cope with ongoing [[Droughts in California|drought]], the measure was unpopular and was accused of causing pressure fluctuations and water main breaks.

==== Budget policy ====
In a memo in October 2013, Garcetti instructed department heads to develop a "starting point" budget based on the 5% cut from the previous year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/05/14/eric-garcettis-first-budget-shows-that-changes-come-slowly-to-la-city-hall |title=Eric Garcetti's First Budget Shows That Changes Come Slowly to L.A.

His financial proposal of $8.1&nbsp;billion required approval from the city council and closed the $242&nbsp;million gap "in part by relying on increased tax revenue projections and reductions in vacant positions".<ref name=GarcettiBudget /> That August, he announced he would begin his annual review of every city general manager as part of his commitment to improve accountability among Los Angeles officials.<ref name=citygeneralmanagers>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140805/la-mayor-eric-garcetti-begins-performance-reviews-of-city-general-managers |title=L.A.

The financial plan assumed the city's workforce, which included police officers and firefighters, would not receive raises in the coming year. One of the proposed changes was to merge the city's police and fire dispatch centers to streamline and improve response time to [[9-1-1|911]] calls for emergencies and fires. Mayoral aides said such a change would take multiple years to complete.<ref name=GarcettiBudget /> Garcetti said he hoped to increase funding for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], the department making up nearly 44% of the fund already and most of the increase would go towards new technology for officers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lopez |first=Andrew |url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Los-Angeles-Mayor-Eric-Garcetti-to-Unveil-Budget-Proposal-255197041.html |title=Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti Unveils Budget Proposal |date=April 14, 2014 |publisher=NBC Southern California |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505053453/http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Los-Angeles-Mayor-Eric-Garcetti-to-Unveil-Budget-Proposal-255197041.html |archive-date=May 5, 2014 }}</ref> The plan was scheduled to go into effect on July 1, adding eight hours per week to the city's branch library operations. The number of code enforcement officers assigned to look for unpermitted construction and other neighborhood issues, would increase from 25 to 38. He also announced other changes, such as creating a $1.4&nbsp;million innovation fund to transform city services, breaking the command structure at the [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] into four geographic regions, and hiring 140 firefighters to cope with attrition.<ref name=GarcettiBudget>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-garcetti-budget-20140414,0,5027977.story#axzz2zTu15QmX |title=Eric Garcetti's 'Back to Basics' budget offers modest service upgrades |date=April 14, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417130803/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-garcetti-budget-20140414,0,5027977.story#axzz2zTu15QmX |archive-date=April 17, 2014 }}</ref>

==== Economic policy ====
In May 2014, Garcetti announced he was bringing aboard [[Krisztina Holly]] and Amir Tehrani, two [[Entrepreneur in Residence|entrepreneurs in residence]], to develop policies for "helping business startup and entrepreneurs in Los Angeles grow". "We want L.A. to be the leading destination for people starting new businesses, and there are no better guides for our efforts than successful entrepreneurs themselves," he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://westsidetoday.com/2014/05/03/mayor-eric-garcetti-bring-two-entrepreneurs-residence/ |title=Mayor Eric Garcetti to Bring on Two Entrepreneurs in Residence |publisher=westsidetoday.com |date=May 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503185932/http://westsidetoday.com/2014/05/03/mayor-eric-garcetti-bring-two-entrepreneurs-residence/ |archive-date=May 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140502/city-of-los-angeles-now-has-entrepreneurs-in-residence |last=Orlov |first=Rick |title=City of Los Angeles now has 'entrepreneurs in residence' |date=May 2, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503190009/http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140502/city-of-los-angeles-now-has-entrepreneurs-in-residence |archive-date=May 3, 2014 }}</ref>

That summer, Garcetti met with [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] and legislative leaders during his first visit to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] since taking office as mayor. He pushed the governor to expand the current film production tax credit, awarding $100&nbsp;million annually, to stop productions from leaving the state.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80421604/ |title=In Sacramento, L.A.

He wanted $420&nbsp;million, equal to [[New York (state)|New York's]] credit. The amount was also four times the size of California's current $100&nbsp;million offering.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81077906 |title=Garcetti sees progress on film tax credit negotiations |first=Chris |last=Megerian |date=August 13, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81077906 |archive-date=October 6, 2012 }}</ref>
[[File:-RaisetheWageLA (15003971968).jpg|thumb|Garcetti speaking at a rally for increasing the minimum wage in 2014]]
On September 1, 2014, Garcetti led a rally at a park in [[South Los Angeles]], where he proposed creating a [[minimum wage]] in Los Angeles that could reach $13.25 after three years. He received support from several members of the city council, who would have to approve of the increase. He released an economic analysis, which was prepared by academics at [[University of California, Berkeley]], that stated an "L.A. wage of $13.25—$4.25 more than the state minimum of $9—would significantly improve the lot of low-income workers and impose minimal burdens on business."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81237432/ |title=Garcetti calls for boosting minimum wage to $13.25 after three years |first=James |last=Rainey |date=September 1, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81237432/ |archive-date=October 6, 2012 }}</ref> Business leaders warned that boosting pay too quickly could stifle the slowly rebounding local economy (California's minimum wage then was $9, having increased from $8 on July 1). His proposed ordinance would require businesses to increase workers' pay from the state minimum to at least $10.25 in 2015, $11.75 in 2016 and $13.25 in 2017. Beginning in 2018, additional adjustments in Los Angeles would be automatically tied to an inflation index.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81239079/ |title=Garcetti calls for $13.25 minimum wage by 2017 |date=September 1, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81239079/ |archive-date=October 6, 2012 }}</ref> Later that month, he expressed his support for the city council to vote on a new citywide law requiring large hotels to pay $15.37 an hour, adding that it would not conflict with his drive to raise the city's minimum wage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140919/mayor-eric-garcetti-raising-los-angeles-minimum-wage-is-part-of-an-american-moment |date=September 19, 2014 |first=Dakota |last=Smith |title=Mayor Eric Garcetti: Raising Los Angeles minimum wage is part of 'an American movement' |newspaper=Daily News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921060657/http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140919/mayor-eric-garcetti-raising-los-angeles-minimum-wage-is-part-of-an-american-moment |archive-date=September 21, 2014 }}</ref> He aligned himself with the [[Fight for 15]] movement when he signed legislation in 2015 to gradually raise the minimum wage in Los Angeles to $15 per hour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20160701/higher-minimum-wage-goes-into-effect-in-los-angeles |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302115221/http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20160701/higher-minimum-wage-goes-into-effect-in-los-angeles |archive-date=2017-03-02 }}</ref>

==== Immigration policy ====
In July 2014, Garcetti announced the Los Angeles Police Department would stop honoring most federal requests for detaining arrestees so they can be investigated for deportation. He stated that Los Angeles was joining with other jurisdictions to end the practice of detaining people for being in the United States illegally with no judicial review and uttered that the detainment policy was expensive to local government and erodes public trust in the police department. "The federal government has the luxury of waiting to act," he said. "Here at the local level, we are carrying out what the federal government should be doing."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140707/garcetti-los-angeles-to-reject-federal-governments-requests-to-detain-immigrants?source=most_viewed |title=Garcetti: Los Angeles to reject federal government's requests to detain immigrants |date=July 7, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |first=Rick |last=Orlov |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711150856/http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140707/garcetti-los-angeles-to-reject-federal-governments-requests-to-detain-immigrants?source=most_viewed |archive-date=July 11, 2014 }}</ref> Later that month, he confirmed Los Angeles would help shelter immigrant children who have been detained after crossing the border and had begun talks with a federal agency about doing so.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80812940/ |title=L.A. to help shelter detained immigrant children, Mayor Garcetti says |date=July 15, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Emily Albert |last=Reyes |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80812940/ |archive-date=October 6, 2012 }}</ref>

==== Police relations ====
[[File:EricMichaelGarcetti.jpg|thumb|Garcetti with police chief [[Charlie Beck]] discussing crime statistics in 2014]]
In July 2014, the [[Los Angeles Police Protective League]] stated its plans to file an unfair labor practices complaint with the city's Employee Relations Board to block Garcetti and [[Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department|police chief]] [[Charlie Beck]] from discussing directly with officers the proposed one-year contract that had been previously rejected. The proposal provided $70&nbsp;million in overtime for that year and $50&nbsp;million to buy back some of the $120&nbsp;million in banked overtime while also containing no cost-of-living increase.
Protective League President Tyler Izen said that while the union understood the mayor's intentions, he believed speaking directly to the officers could violate fair bargaining rules.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140722/union-objects-to-la-mayor-eric-garcetti-police-discussing-contract |title=Union objects to L.A.

Garcetti found a way around the legal threats by posting a video on [[YouTube]] on July 24, noting that under the proposed contract, salaries for officers hired during the recession would be increased and overtime would no longer be given as time off, instead paid in cash. "The sacrifices you made on overtime were emergency measures—never intended to be permanent. And I understand the toll these emergency measures have taken. Not just on your pocketbook but on the LAPD as a whole", Garcetti said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/24/45552/mayor-garcetti-turns-to-youtube-to-communicate-dir/ |title=Mayor Garcetti turns to YouTube to communicate directly with LAPD officers about contract (updated) |date=July 24, 2014 |publisher=89.3 KPCC |first=Alice |last=Walton |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808221029/http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/24/45552/mayor-garcetti-turns-to-youtube-to-communicate-dir/ |archive-date=August 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2014/07/mayor_video_takes_his_mes.php |title=Mayor's video takes his message directly to LAPD officers |first=Kevin |last=Roderick |publisher=LA Observed |date=July 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725200747/http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2014/07/mayor_video_takes_his_mes.php |archive-date=July 25, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80895904/ |title=Garcetti uses YouTube to appeal to LAPD officers on contract offer |date=July 24, 2014 |first=Catherine |last=Saillant |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url-status=live |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80895904/ |archive-date=October 6, 2012 }}</ref>

In August 2013, Garcetti said he would sign off on a proposed four-year contract with [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power]] workers. Officials estimated the contract would save $6.1&nbsp;billion over 30 years.<ref name=LADN /> In large part, the deal was expected to save money by cutting the pension benefits of new hires and workers going without raises in pay for three years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/22/local/la-me-dwp-deal-struck-20130823 |date=August 22, 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |title=DWP deal is a mixed win for Eric Garcetti in his 1st duel with labor |first1=David |last1=Zahniser |first2=Catherine |last2=Saillant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407123432/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/22/local/la-me-dwp-deal-struck-20130823 |archive-date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref> The deal was largely worked out before Garcetti took office the previous month; he initially balked at the contract before coming around when negotiators tweaked the proposal to allow for further talks on the issue.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2013/08/22/mayor-eric-garcetti-trumpets-victory-on-new-contract-with-dwp-workers |title=Mayor Eric Garcetti Trumpets Victory on New Contract With DWP Workers |date=August 22, 2013 |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |newspaper=LA Weekly |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714181550/http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2013/08/22/mayor-eric-garcetti-trumpets-victory-on-new-contract-with-dwp-workers |archive-date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>

In July 2013, Garcetti called for "calm in the streets" after the [[acquittal]] of [[George Zimmerman]] three days earlier.

In April 2014, the mayor was joined by current and former [[NBA]] players to praise the disciplinary actions taken by the league against [[Los Angeles Clippers|L.A.

In May 2014, Officer Shaun Hillmann received a 65-day suspension after recorded remarks of him referring to an African-American man as a "monkey" were aired on television.

==== Sustainability ====
On his first full day as mayor, Garcetti proclaimed that Los Angeles was beginning to leave behind its culture of [[car ownership]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/In-Los-Angeles-Where-Car-Is-King-Smartphones-May-Cut-Traffic.html |title=Where Car Is King, Smartphones May Cut Traffic |date=July 12, 2013 |newspaper=New York Times |first=Ian |last=Lovett |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102180639/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/In-Los-Angeles-Where-Car-Is-King-Smartphones-May-Cut-Traffic.html |archive-date=November 2, 2017 }}</ref> Promoting the Great Streets Initiative, he said the effort represents "a shift from the way that our neighborhoods have been planned in Los Angeles", with a new focus on "walkability and transit". Seeking to bolster the street-level health of the city, he encouraged developing plans to make several dozen boulevards more hospitable to pedestrians, cyclists and small businesses. A pedestrian-friendly project in downtown on [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]] finished up in December 2014 that widened the sidewalks and replaced the parking lane with planters, chairs and round café tables with red umbrellas.<ref>Hawthorne, Christopher (December 6, 2014) [https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-latino-immigration-architecture-20141206-story.html "'LATINO URBANISM' INFLUENCES A LOS ANGELES IN FLUX"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208115952/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-latino-immigration-architecture-20141206-story.html |date=2014-12-08 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''; accessed December 8, 2017.</ref>

In April 2014, Garcetti signed into law a new waste franchise agreement, which was planned to expanded recycling to businesses and apartments. He had first proposed the program three years earlier, when he was serving on the city council. Contrasting it with the recycling program used in the city's residential areas, he said, "What we have had on the commercial and apartment side has been the Wild West, with multiple trucks on the same street, with no standards." He stated his goal was to have 90% of all trash recycled by 2025.<ref>{{cite news |last=Orlov |first=Rick |url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140415/eric-garcetti-signs-waste-franchise-plan-to-expand-recycling |title=Eric Garcetti signs waste franchise plan to expand recycling |date=April 15, 2014 |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506163554/http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140415/eric-garcetti-signs-waste-franchise-plan-to-expand-recycling |archive-date=May 6, 2014 }}</ref>

That same year, Garcetti co-founded [[Mayors National Climate Action Agenda]], along with [[List of mayors of Houston|Houston mayor]] [[Annise Parker]] and [[List of mayors of Philadelphia|Philadelphia mayor]] [[Michael Nutter]].

In April 2015, Garcetti released a long-range plan for making the city more economically and environmentally sustainable. The city's first-ever 'Sustainable City Plan' consists of both short-term (by 2017) and long-term (by 2025 and 2035) goals in 14 categories related to our environment, our economy, and equity encompassing water conservation, clean energy, waste, green jobs, transportation, housing, and neighborhood livability.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mayor Launches L.A.'s First-Ever Sustainable City Plan |url=http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_launches_l_a_s_first_ever_sustainable_city_plan |website=lamayor.org |accessdate=April 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412050503/http://www.lamayor.org/mayor_launches_l_a_s_first_ever_sustainable_city_plan |archive-date=April 12, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mayor Launches 'First-Ever' Sustainability Plan For LA Economy, Environment |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/04/08/la-mayor-to-outline-plan-for-economic-environmental-sustainability |publisher=CBS Local |accessdate=April 9, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411021750/http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/04/08/la-mayor-to-outline-plan-for-economic-environmental-sustainability/ |archive-date=April 11, 2015 }}</ref>

On April 3, 2014, Garcetti was joined by [[Bill Clinton]] in hosting a half-day conference on alternate energy and improvements of infrastructure. It was the first time the two men had appeared together since his run for mayor the previous year, where Clinton had endorsed Wendy Greuel. Referencing the election, the former president accidentally said that Garcetti had been elected president, not mayor. Clinton told Garcetti that he "may become president one day".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynews.com/environment-and-nature/20140403/president-bill-clinton-mayor-eric-garcetti-talk-environmental-issues |title=President Bill Clinton, Mayor Eric Garcetti talk environmental issues |newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News |date=April 3, 2014 |first=Dakota |last=Smith |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065455/http://www.dailynews.com/environment-and-nature/20140403/president-bill-clinton-mayor-eric-garcetti-talk-environmental-issues |archive-date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.myfoxla.com/story/25159872/bill-clinton-and-eric-garcetti-ake-us-into-the-future-at-city-hall |title=Bill Clinton and Eric Garcetti Take Us into The Future at City Hall |publisher=FOX 11 LA KTTV |date=April 3, 2014 |first=Phil |last=Shuman |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084725/http://www.myfoxla.com/story/25159872/bill-clinton-and-eric-garcetti-ake-us-into-the-future-at-city-hall |archive-date=April 7, 2014}}</ref>
