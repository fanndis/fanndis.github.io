==Early life==
Rodgers was born in the [[Lower East Side]], [[New York City]], on September 19, 1952, to Beverly Goodman. She gave birth to Rodgers when she was 13. His biological father, Nile Rodgers Sr. –  a traveling [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]] who specialized in [[Afro-Cuban]] beats –  was rarely present as Rodgers grew up; although influential in his life, Rodgers saw his father only a "handful" of times prior to his death in 1970.<ref name="t">{{Cite news|url=https://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/mr-rodgerss-neighborhood/|title=Mr. Rodgers's Neighborhood|last=Rodgers|first=Nile|work=New York Times Magazine|access-date=September 19, 2018}}</ref> In 1959, Goodman married Bobby Glanzrock, whom Rodgers described in his 2011 autobiography as a "[[beatnik]] PhD, whose observations had angles that would make [[Miles Davis]] contemplate his cool."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c046acd2-f8cb-11e0-ad8f-00144feab49a|title=Chic to Chic|last=Hobart|first=Mike|date=October 23, 2011|work=Financial Times|access-date=October 4, 2018}}</ref> [[Richard Pryor]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Lenny Bruce]] often visited their home in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/fashion/mens-style/nile-rodgers-still-chic-after-all-these-years.html|title=Nile Rodgers: Still Chic After All These Years|access-date=August 14, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Glanzrock and Goodman were addicted to [[heroin]], and Rodgers began using drugs at 13.<ref name="The Guardian">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/22/nile-rodgers-my-family-were-high-functioning-addicts-i-inherited-that-gene|title=Nile Rodgers: 'My family were high-functioning addicts.

==Career==
===1970s: Formation of Chic, "Le Freak", Sister Sledge===
Rodgers met bassist [[Bernard Edwards]] in 1970 while working as a touring musician for the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' stage show. Together they formed The Big Apple Band, and worked as back-up musicians for the vocal group [[New York City (band)|New York City]] ("[[I'm Doin' Fine Now]]"). New York City's one hit allowed them to tour extensively, opening for [[The Jackson 5]] on the American leg of their first world tour in 1973.<ref name="Independent">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/groove-is-in-his-heart-chics-nile-rodgers-on-the-unlikely-inspiration-for-le-freak-1749306.html|title=Groove is in his heart: Chic's Nile Rodgers on the unlikely|work=The Independent|access-date=August 8, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="Interview">{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/nile-rodgers|title=Nile Rodgers – Interview Magazine|date=November 6, 2013|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=September 19, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The band dissolved after their second album failed to yield a hit, but Nile and Bernard joined forces with drummer [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]], and worked and recorded as a funk rock band called The Boys, which played numerous gigs up and down the East Coast. Although there was label interest, record companies passed on the band after discovering its members were black, believing that black rock artists would be too hard to promote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bigread.mojo4music.com/2013/08/nile-rodgers/|title=Nile Rodgers' Second Act {{!}} MOJO|website=bigread.mojo4music.com|language=en|access-date=August 14, 2018}}</ref>

As the Big Apple Band, Rodgers and Edwards worked with [[Ashford & Simpson]], [[Luther Vandross]], and many others. Since another New York artist, [[Walter Murphy]], had a band called The Big Apple Band, Rodgers and Edwards were forced to change their band's name to avoid confusion. Thus, in 1977 the band was renamed as [[Chic (band)|Chic]].

Inspired by [[Roxy Music]], Chic developed a sound that was a fusion of jazz, soul, and funk grooves with melodies and lyrics with a European influence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/nile-rodgers-le-freak-book-excerpt|title="Le Freak" by Nile Rodgers Book Excerpt|last=Rodgers|first=Nile|date=October 18, 2011|work=GQ|access-date=October 7, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Between gigs, they recorded the song "Dance, Dance, Dance", with then-boss [[Luther Vandross]] on vocals.<ref name="Washington Post 2">{{cite news |last1=Tucker |first1=Neely |title=Always & Forever: Luther's Legacy |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/04/AR2007120402295.html?noredirect=on |access-date=September 4, 2018 |work=Washington Post |date=December 5, 2007}}</ref> Originally released by [[Buddah Records]], it was a hit when it was re-released by Atlantic in the summer of 1977.

===The Hitmaker===
Rodgers plays a 1960 Fender [[Stratocaster]] with a 1959 neck, nicknamed [[The Hitmaker]], which he acquired as a trade-in at a shop in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. Exceptionally light, it has a maple fingerboard and a worn white finish. Rodgers claims it has a unique sound. After Rodgers purchased the guitar, Edwards taught him how to play it in a [[chop chord]] style, which he called "chucking". In his autobiography, Rodgers wrote:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/books/201110/nile-rodgers-le-freak-book-excerpt|title=Nile Rodgers, "Chic Sh*t Happens: The Rise and Call of the Disco Revolution", extract from ''Le Freak, An Upside Down Story of Family, Disco and Destiny'', GQ.com, October 18, 2011|work=GQ|access-date=September 28, 2014}}</ref> "He fingered the chords with his left hand, and his right hand would continuously play sixteen notes to the bar while accenting the main parts of the rhythm ... One lesson was all I needed. For the next few nights straight, while my roommate pursued all manner of trysts, I was having a love affair in the bathroom with my new ax. In just a few days, I'd emerge as a chucking funk guitarist who knew more jazz chord inversions than most of my R&B counterparts."

The Fender Custom Shop introduced a limited edition Nile Rodgers Hitmaker Stratocaster, a recreation of Rodgers' guitar, in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/custom-shop/series/artist/nile-rodgers-tribute-hitmaker-stratocaster-maple-fingerboard-olympic-white/|title="Nile Rodgers Tribute 'Hitmaker' Stratocaster", ''Fender.com''|publisher=Fender.com|access-date=September 28, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013134849/http://www.fender.com/custom-shop/series/artist/nile-rodgers-tribute-hitmaker-stratocaster-maple-fingerboard-olympic-white/|archive-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, Rodgers woke up in the hospital to learn that his heart had stopped eight times, and he was alive only due to the actions of the doctor filling out his death certificate. He stopped using drugs and alcohol in 1994 after a friend showed him a tape of a poor performance.<ref name="htmiitmb2">{{cite episode|title=Episode 2|series=Nile Rodgers: How to Make It in the Music Business|airdate=August 25, 2018|network=[[BBC4]]}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Rodgers was in a relationship with Kenyan singer [[Lamya]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Rodgers, N. |date=2011|title=Le Freak: An Upside Down Story of Family, Disco, and Destiny|publisher=Spiegel & Grau Publishing}}</ref>

Rodgers was diagnosed with an aggressive form of [[prostate cancer]] in October 2010. He documented his illness on a blog called ''Walking on Planet C''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nilerodgers.com/blogs/planet-c-in-english |title=Walking on Planet C, Nile Rodger's Cancer Blog |publisher=Nilerodgers.com |access-date=March 26, 2012}}</ref>  He was given the all-clear in 2013. In 2017, a growth on his right kidney was diagnosed as two different cancers within one mass. The mass was surgically removed in November 2017. He said he expected a 100% recovery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42255264|title=Nile Rodgers has cancer surgery|date=2017-12-06|access-date=2019-02-03|language=en-GB}}</ref> At his performance at the Hollywood Bowl, on July 4, 2019, Rodgers announced that he was "100% cancer-free."
