The '''leader of the Labour Party''' is the highest ranked politician within the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. He or she serves as the [[parliamentary leader]] and leading [[spokesperson]] of the party. Since [[2017 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|1 August 2017]], the office has been held by [[Jacinda Ardern]], who is the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Albert]].<ref name="Trevett 2017">{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11897537 | title=Jacinda Ardern elected as new Labour leader | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=1 August 2017 | accessdate=1 August 2017 | first1=Claire | last1=Trevett}}</ref>

==History==
The post of leader of the Labour Party was officially created upon the party's inception in 1916, though the title "leader" was often substituted and/or complemented with the title "chairman".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=John Thomas |title=Humanism in Politics; New Zealand Labour Party Retrospect |date=1946 |publisher=The University of Michigan |pages=64–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NA8kAAAAMAA |accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref> In [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became the first New Zealand Labour Party [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], following a landslide victory. In 1963, [[Arnold Nordmeyer]] became the first New Zealand-born leader of the party; three previous leaders had been born in Australia and one each in England and Scotland. The most electorally successful Labour leader to date is [[Helen Clark]], who won three elections, in [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999]], [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]] and [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]]. Clark is also the party's longest-serving leader, having served for 14 years, 346 days between 1993 and 2008.<ref name="nzh_labour_leader">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10491916 |title=Clark beats record of longest-serving Labour leader – probably |author=Audrey Young |date=12 February 2008 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 February 2008}}</ref> [[Peter Fraser]] is the longest-serving Labour Prime Minister, serving 9 years, 261 days between 1940 and 1949.

==Selection==
She or he must be a member of Parliament (MP). A new leader is elected whenever a vacancy arises, whether due to resignation, incapacitation, or following a [[motion of no confidence]] by the parliamentary [[caucus]].<ref name="constitution_leader">{{cite web|title=Constitution and Rules |url=https://elections.nz/assets/Party-rules/labour-party-rules-and-constitution.pdf |publisher=New Zealand Labour Party |pages=63–64 |date=2019 |via=New Zealand Electoral Commission |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref> Each candidates is put forward by a nominator and seconder in the caucus.<ref name="constitution_sched5">{{cite web|title=Constitution and Rules |url=https://elections.nz/assets/Party-rules/labour-party-rules-and-constitution.pdf |publisher=New Zealand Labour Party |pages=99 |date=2019 |via=New Zealand Electoral Commission |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref> Since 2013, the leader in a contested election is determined by a vote split among the party's caucus, party members and party affiliates ([[trade union]]s) in a 40/40/20 split respectively.<ref name=daterules>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11113310|title=Date confirmed for new Labour leader|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |publisher=[[APN News & Media]] |accessdate=25 August 2013|date=23 August 2013}}</ref> Prior to 2013, the Leader was elected solely by the caucus (this practice remains for the Deputy Leadership). No later than three months following a general election, there must be a caucus vote to endorse the Leader; if the Leader fails to receive endorsement then an election is triggered.<ref name="constitution_leader"/>

==Role==
When the Labour Party forms the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|Parliamentary Opposition]], the leader of the party usually acts as the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|leader of the Opposition]], and chairs a [[Shadow Cabinet (New Zealand)|Shadow Cabinet]]. Likewise, when the party is in [[New Zealand Government|Government]], as it currently is, the leader typically becomes the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]].

Unique to Labour, the party's caucus possesses the right to elect MPs to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], rather than the leader choosing them. The practice began following the [[1940 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|1940 leadership election]].<ref name="DNZB Fraser">{{DNZB|Beaglehole|Tim|4f22|Fraser, Peter|11 December 2011||Tim Beaglehole}}</ref> [[Michael Joseph Savage]] was the only leader to solely appoint his own cabinet following the election victories in [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935]] and [[1938 New Zealand general election|1938]].
