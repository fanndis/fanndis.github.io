The '''People's Party''' (''Stronnictwo Ludowe'', SL) was a Polish [[political party]], active from 1931 in the [[Second Polish Republic]]. An agrarian populist party, its power base was mostly farmers and rural population.

In 1931 it was created from the merger of three other, smaller, peasant-based parties: centre-right [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] (PSL "Piast"), centre-left [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"]] (PSLW) and left wing [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie]] (SCh).<ref name="Lerski1996">{{cite book|author=Halina Lerski|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luRry4Y5NIYC&pg=PA425|date=19 January 1996|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-03456-5|pages=425–426}}</ref><ref name="Lerski19962">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luRry4Y5NIYC&pg=PA457|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945|author=Halina Lerski|date=19 January 1996|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-03456-5|page=457}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]] it was known as 'Stronnictwo Ludowe Roch' and its military arm, [[Bataliony Chłopskie]], was part of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]].

After the end of the war, the People's Party under the leadership of [[Wincenty Witos]] decided to support [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]]. However at the same time [[Polish communists]] named one of their proxy parties {{ill|Stronnictwo Ludowe (1944–1949)|lt=Stronnictwo Ludowe|pl|Stronnictwo Ludowe (1944–1949)}}, and the old People's Party, now loyal to Mikołajczyk, changed its name into [[Polish People's Party (1945–1949)|Polish People's Party]] (PSL).

After Mikołajczyk's defeat in the rigged [[1947 Polish legislative election]], the remains of the Polish People's Party were merged (in 1949) into the communist-allied [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL).
