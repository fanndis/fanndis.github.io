'''''The Baltimore Sun''''' is the largest general-circulation daily newspaper based in [[Maryland]] and provides coverage of local and regional news, events, issues, people, and industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0714.html|title=Bluesheets: (Baltimore) The Sun|publisher=Thomson Reuters|access-date=May 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710122729/http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0714.html|archive-date=July 10, 2011|date=September 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Founded in 1837, it is currently owned by [[Tribune Publishing]].

==History==
''The Sun'' was founded on May 17, 1837, by printer/editor/publisher/owner [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell]] (often listed as "A. S. Abell") and two associates, [[William Moseley Swain]], and Azariah H. Simmons, recently from [[Philadelphia]], where they had started and published the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' the year before. Abell was born in [[Rhode Island]], became a journalist with the ''Providence Patriot'' and later worked with [[Media in New York City|newspapers in New York City]] and [[List of newspapers in Massachusetts|Boston]].<ref name="doren">Van Doren, Charles and Robert McKendry, ed., ''Webster's American Biographies''. (Springfield, Massachusetts: Merriam-Webster, 1984) p. 5.</ref>

The Abell family and descendants owned ''The Sun'' until 1910, when the local Black and Garrett families invested  in the paper at the suggestion of former rival owner/publisher of [[Baltimore News-American|''The News'']], [[Charles H. Grasty]], and they, along with Grasty gained a [[controlling interest]]; they retained  the name A. S. Abell Company for the parent publishing company. That same year ''The Evening Sun'' was established under reporter, editor/columnist [[H.L. Mencken]] (1880–1956). From 1947 to 1986, ''The Sun'' was the owner of Maryland's first [[television]] station, [[WMAR-TV]] (Channel 2), founded 1947 and longtime affiliate of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] ([[CBS]]) television network, along with several radio stations.

The newspaper opened its first foreign bureau in [[London]] in 1924. Between 1955 and 1961, it added four new foreign offices. As [[Cold War]] tensions grew, it set up shop in [[Bonn, Germany|Bonn, West Germany]], in February 1955. (The bureau later moved to [[Berlin]].) Eleven months later, ''The Sun'' opened a [[Moscow]] bureau, becoming one of the first U.S. newspapers to do so. A [[Rome]] office followed in July 1957, and in 1961, The Sun expanded to [[New Delhi]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/218883492/|title=The Baltimore Sun opens bureau in India|date=1961-01-17|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref> At its height, ''The Sun'' ran eight foreign bureaus, giving rise to its boast in a 1983 advertisement that "The Sun never sets on the world."<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-10-07/business/0510070289_1_bureaus-chicago-tribune-sun|title=Sun cuts foreign bureaus from 5 to 3|last=Madigan|first=Nick|date=2005-10-07|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref>

The paper was sold by [[Reg Murphy]] in 1986 to the [[Times-Mirror Company]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. The same week, a 115 year old rivalry ended.  The oldest paper in the city, the ''[[Baltimore News American|News American]]'', a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] paper since the 1920s, but with roots to 1773, folded.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last1 = Walsh| first1 = Sharon Warren| last2 = R| first2 = Eleanor| last3 = olph| last4 = Ifill| first4 = Washington Post Staff Writers; Staff writers Gwen| last5 = repo| first5 = Steve Luxenberg also contributed to this| title = Baltimore Sun Papers Sold to Times Mirror Co.| work = Washington Post| access-date = 2018-06-10| date = 1986-05-29| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/05/29/baltimore-sun-papers-sold-to-times-mirror-co/d34d13fc-c0dc-4348-aa58-2ca6b50a433b/}}</ref> A decade later in 1997, ''The Sun'' acquired the [[The Howard County Times|Patuxent Publishing Company]], a local suburban newspaper publisher that had a stable of 15 weekly papers and a few magazines in several communities and counties.<ref>[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-06-11/news/1997162002_1_patuxent-publishing-baltimore-sun-john-sturm "Baltimore Sun to buy Patuxent Publishing Columbia company has 15 newspapers, magazines in region"], ''Baltimore Sun''</ref>

In the 1990s and 2000s, ''The Sun'' began cutting back its foreign coverage. In 1995 and 1996, the paper closed its [[Tokyo]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Berlin]] bureaus. Two more—[[Beijing]] and [[London]]—fell victim to cost-cutting in 2005.<ref name="auto"/> The final three foreign bureaus—Moscow, Jerusalem, and Johannesburg, South Africa—fell a couple of years later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2006-07-07/business/0607070011_1_bureaus-chicago-tribune-sun|title=Tribune Co. is closing Sun's foreign bureaus|last=Madigan|first=Nick|date=2006-07-06|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref> All were closed by 2008, as the Tribune Co. streamlined and downsized the newspaper chain's foreign reporting.

==Editions==
From 1910 to 1995 there were two distinct newspapers—''The Sun'' in the morning and ''The Evening Sun'' in the afternoon—each with its own separate reporting and editorial staff. ''The Evening Sun'' was first published in 1910 under the leadership of [[Charles H. Grasty]], former owner of the ''Evening News'', and a firm believer in the evening circulation. For most of its existence, ''The Evening Sun'' led its morning sibling in circulation. In 1959, the afternoon edition's circulation was 220,174, compared to 196,675 for the morning edition.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-06-26/news/1995177152_1_evening-sun-hearst-corp-pages|title=As the end draws closer for The Evening Sun...|date=1995-06-26|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref> However, by the 1980s, cultural, technological and economic shifts in America were eating away at afternoon newspapers' market share, with readers flocking to either morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-07-14/business/9907140121_1_central-newspapers-afternoon-papers-eugene-s-pulliam|last=Jones|first=Tim|title=Sun Setting On Another Afternoon Newspaper|date=1999-07-14|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref> In 1992, the afternoon paper's circulation was 133,800.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-06-20/news/1993171127_1_evening-sun-read-the-sun-kevin-cowherd|last=Imhoff|first=Ernest|title=They Hate To See That Ev'nin' Sun Go Down|date=1993-06-20|newspaper=The (Baltimore) Evening Sun|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref> By mid-1995, ''The Evening Sun''{{'}}s readership—86,360—had been eclipsed by ''The Sun''—264,583.<ref name="auto1"/> ''The Evening Sun'' ceased publication on September 15, 1995.

===Daily===
After a period of roughly a year during which the paper's owners sometimes printed a two-section product, ''The Baltimore Sun'' now has three sections every weekday: News, Sports and alternating various business and features sections. On some days, comics and such features as the horoscope and TV listings are printed in the back of the Sports section. After dropping the standalone business section in 2009, ''The Sun'' brought back a business section on Tuesdays and Sundays in 2010, with business pages occupying part of the news section on other days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondonewspapers.com/newspaper/baltimore-sun.html|title=Baltimore Sun—The No. 31 Newspaper in the USA|publisher=Mondo Code|access-date=May 28, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010134544/http://www.mondonewspapers.com/newspaper/baltimore-sun.html|archive-date=October 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Features sections debuting in 2010 included a Saturday "Home" section, a Thursday "Style" section and a Monday section called "Sunrise." The sports article written by [[Peter Schmuck]] is published only on week-days.

===Sunday===
The ''Sunday Sun'' for many years was noted for a locally produced [[rotogravure]] Maryland pictorial magazine section, featuring works by such acclaimed photographers as [[A. Aubrey Bodine]]. The ''Sunday Sun'' dropped the Sunday ''Sun Magazine'' in 1996 and now only carries ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine weekly. A quarterly version of the ''Sun Magazine''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunmag.com|title=Entertainment - Baltimore Sun|website=www.thesunmag.com}}</ref> was resurrected in September 2010, with stories that included a comparison of young local doctors, an interview with actress Julie Bowen and a feature on the homes of a former Baltimore anchorwoman. Newsroom managers plan to add online content on a more frequent basis.

===baltimoresun.com===
The company introduced its website in September 1996. A redesign of the site was unveiled in June 2009, capping a six-month period of record online traffic. Each month from January through June, an average of 3.5 million unique visitors combined to view 36.6 million Web pages. ''Sun'' reporters and editors produce more than three dozen blogs on such subjects as technology, weather, education, politics, Baltimore crime, real estate, gardening, pets and parenting. Among the most popular are Dining@Large, which covers local restaurants; The Schmuck Stops Here, a Baltimore-centric sports blog written by Peter Schmuck; Z on TV, by media critic [[David Zurawik]]; and Midnight Sun, a nightlife blog. A ''Baltimore Sun'' iPhone app was released September 14, 2010.

In 2018, in response to the European cookie law, baltimoresun.com began blocking visitors with European IP addresses rather than go to the effort of obtaining permission-requesting software, with the result that many European visitors (and those from some non-European countries) must visit the site via proxies, potentially muddling the website's analytics.

[[Image:1baltimore sun south.jpg|thumb|right|Sun Park in Port Covington]]
The first issue of ''The Sun'', a four-page tabloid, was printed at 21&nbsp;[[Light Street (Baltimore)|Light Street]] in downtown Baltimore in the mid-1830s. A five-story structure, at the corner of Baltimore and South streets, was built in 1851. The "Iron Building", as it was called, was destroyed in the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904.

In 1906, operations were moved to [[Maryland Route 139|Charles]] and [[Baltimore Street|Baltimore]] streets, where ''The Sun'' was written, published and distributed for nearly 50&nbsp;years. In 1950, the operation was moved to a larger, modern plant at [[Calvert Street (Baltimore)|Calvert]] and [[Centre Street (Baltimore)|Centre]] streets. In 1979, ground was broken for a new addition to the Calvert Street plant to house modern pressroom facilities. The new facility commenced operations in 1981.

In April 1988, at a cost of $180&nbsp;million, the company purchased {{convert|60|acre}} of land at [[Port Covington]] and built "Sun Park". The new building houses a satellite printing and packaging facility, as well as the distribution operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/about/bal-about-baltsun,0,2763999.htmlstory|title=About The Baltimore Sun|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=May 28, 2008}}</ref> ''The Sun''{{'}}s printing facility at Sun Park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area. To keep pace with the speed of the presses and Automated Guided Vehicles; "intelligent" electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses.

In 1885, ''The Sun'' constructed a [[Sun Building|building for its Washington Bureau]] at 1317 F Street, NW.<ref>''Washington Post'', April 9, 1903</ref>  The building is on the [[National Register of Historic Places|National Register]].

==Controversies==
* The paper became embroiled in a controversy involving the former [[governor of Maryland]], [[Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.]] (R). Ehrlich had issued an executive order on November 18, 2004, banning state executive branch employees from talking to ''Sun'' columnist [[Michael Olesker]] and reporter [[David Nitkin]], claiming that their coverage had been unfair to the administration. This led ''The Sun'' to file a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] lawsuit against the Ehrlich administration. The case was dismissed by a [[U.S. District Court]] judge, and ''The Sun'' appealed to the [[4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]], which upheld the dismissal.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bal-md.circuit16feb16,0,1938753.story "Court Favors Ehrlich on Ban"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', February 16, 2006</ref>
* The same Olesker was forced to resign on January 4, 2006, after being accused of [[plagiarism]].  The ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'' reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar (although not identical) to material previously published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''The Sun''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010402179.html |title=Sun Columnist Dismissed; Attribution Issues Cited |work=The Washington Post |date=January 5, 2006  |access-date=September 14, 2010}}</ref>  Several of his colleagues both in and out of the paper were highly critical of the forced resignation, taking the view that the use of previously published [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] material was common [[newsroom]] practice, and Olesker's alleged plagiarism was in line with that practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11362 |title=On Background |work=Baltimore City Paper |date=January 18, 2006 |access-date=September 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814155056/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11362 |archive-date=August 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
* Between 2006 and 2007, [[Thomas Andrews Drake]], a former [[National Security Agency]] executive, allegedly leaked classified information to Siobhan Gorman, then a national security reporter for ''The Sun''. Drake was charged in April 2010 with 10 felony counts in relation to the leaks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-04-15/news/bs-md-nsa-classified-leak-case-20100415_1_lucy-dalglish-shield-law-howard-county-man |title=Ex-NSA worker from Md. charged in classified leak case |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=April 15, 2010 |access-date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> In June 2011, all 10 original charges were dropped, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower, who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Drake was the 2011 recipient of the [[The Ridenhour Prizes|Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling]].
* Entering an ongoing controversy labeled as racist attacks by Donald Trump against congressional members who had criticized him that had begun to include numerous attacks against Baltimore Congressman [[Elijah Cummings]] and was naming him personally responsible for the presence of rodents in Baltimore neighborhoods, on July 27, 2019, ''The Baltimore Sun'' responded with an editorial entitled, "Better to have a few rats than to be one".<ref>Baltimore Sun Editorial Board, "[https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0728-trump-baltimore-20190727-k6ac4yvnpvcczlaexdfglifada-story.html Better to have a few rats than to be one]", ''The Baltimore Sun'', Saturday, July 27, 2017.</ref>

==Portrayal in ''The Wire''==
''The Baltimore Sun'' was featured in the American crime drama television series ''[[The Wire]]'' in 2008 ([[The Wire (season 5)|season 5]]), which was created by former ''Sun'' reporter [[David Simon]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Linda | last2 = Guo | first2 = Jing | last3 = McCaffrey | first3 = Raymond | last4 = Hills | first4 = Paul | author-link1 = Linda Steiner | title = ''The Wire'' and repair of the journalistic paradigm | journal = Journalism | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–720 | doi = 10.1177/1464884912455901 | date = August 2012 }}</ref>

Like all of the institutions featured in ''The Wire'', the ''Sun'' is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff. The season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in [[City Hall (Baltimore)|City Hall]] and the priorities of the [[Baltimore Police Department]]. Additionally, the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the ''Sun'', on the orders of the [[Tribune Company]], the ''Sun''{{'}}s corporate owner.

One storyline involves a troubled ''Sun'' reporter named [[Scott Templeton]], and his escalating tendency to sensationalize and falsify stories. ''The Wire'' portrays the managing editors of the ''Sun'' as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor, in the managing editors' zeal to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. The show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media, and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[The Washington Post]]'' is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the ''Sun''.

[[The Wire (season 5)|Season 5]] was ''The Wire''{{'}}s last. The finale episode, "[[-30- (The Wire episode)|-30-]]", features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters. It shows Templeton at [[Columbia University]] with the senior editors of the fictional ''Sun'', accepting the Pulitzer Prize, with no mention being made as to the aftermath of Templeton's career. Alma Gutierrez is shown being exiled to the Carroll County bureau past the suburbs.
