'''''ER''''' is<!--"is" not "was"; it doesn't stop being a TV show after the final episode --> an American [[medical drama]] television series created by novelist and medical doctor [[Michael Crichton]] that aired on [[NBC]] from September 19, 1994, to April 2, 2009, with a total of 331 episodes spanning 15 seasons. It was produced by Constant c Productions and [[Amblin Television]], in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]]. ''ER'' follows the inner life of the [[emergency department|emergency room]] (ER) of fictional County General Hospital in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], and various critical issues faced by the room's physicians and staff. The show is the second longest-running [[prime time|primetime]] medical drama in [[American television history]] behind ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and the 5th longest medical drama across the globe (behind [[BBC]]'s ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and ''[[Holby City]],'' and [[TVP2|Poland's]] ''[[Na dobre i na złe]]''). It won 23 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including the 1996 Outstanding Drama Series award, and received 124 Emmy nominations. ''ER'' won 116 awards in total, including the [[Peabody Award]], while the cast earned four [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series|Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Ensemble Performance in a Drama Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/ER/about/|title=About the Hit NBC TV Show ER|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=October 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028193641/http://www.nbc.com/ER/about/|archive-date=October 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As of 2014, ''ER'' has grossed over {{US$|3 billion|long=no}} in television revenue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tait |first=R.

===Development===
[[File:MichaelCrichton 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Crichton]], the show's creator.|alt=Michael Crichton wearing a suit.]]

In 1974, author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote a screenplay based on his own experiences as a [[medical student]] in a busy hospital emergency room.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobs|first=Jason|title=Body Trauma TV: The New Hospital Dramas|publisher=British Film Institute|year=2003|edition=illustrated|page=[https://archive.org/details/bodytraumatvnewh0000jaco/page/24 24]|isbn=0-85170-880-3|url=https://archive.org/details/bodytraumatvnewh0000jaco/page/24}}</ref> The screenplay went nowhere and Crichton focused on other topics. In 1990, he published the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', and in 1993 began a collaboration with director [[Steven Spielberg]] on the [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] of the book.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981691-2,00.html | title=Television: Angels with Dirty Faces | last=Richard | first=Zoglin |author2=Smilgis, Martha | date=October 31, 1994 | magazine=Time | accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref> Crichton and Spielberg then turned to ''ER'', but decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film.<ref>{{cite book | last=Keenleyside | first=Sam | title=Bedside manners: George Clooney and ER |publisher=ECW Press | year=1998 | edition=Illustrated | page=129 | isbn=1-55022-336-4}}</ref> Spielberg's [[Amblin Entertainment]] provided [[John Wells (TV producer)|John Wells]] as the show's executive producer.

The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in 1974. The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 were that the Susan Lewis character became a woman and the Peter Benton character became African-American, and the running time was shortened by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV.<ref>{{cite video | people=Crichton, Michael (Creator) | date=February 24, 2004 | title=[[ER (season 1)|ER: The Complete First Season]] | medium=DVD | publisher=[[Warner Bros.]] | accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Because of a lack of time and money necessary to build a set, the pilot episode of ''ER'' was filmed in the former [[Linda Vista Hospital]] in Los Angeles, an old facility that had ceased operating in 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/CA6083/# | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418050155/http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/CA6083/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=April 18, 2005 | title=Linda Vista Hospital | publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation | accessdate=June 28, 2009 }}</ref> A set modeled after [[LAC+USC Medical Center|Los Angeles County General Hospital]]'s emergency room was built soon afterward at the [[Warner Bros.]] studios in [[Burbank, California]], although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city's famous [[Chicago 'L'|"L"]] train platforms.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carter | first=Bill | title=Desperate Networks | publisher=Doubleday | year=2006 | edition=illustrated | page=[https://archive.org/details/desperatenetwork00cart/page/30 30] | isbn=0-385-51440-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/desperatenetwork00cart/page/30 }}</ref>

[[Warren Littlefield]], running NBC Entertainment at the time, was impressed by the series: "We were intrigued, but we were admittedly a bit spooked in attempting to go back into that territory a few years after ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''."<ref name="Saying goodbye to 'ER'">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7288557915e143d093978f906f0a5cbf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918124825/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i7288557915e143d093978f906f0a5cbf | archive-date=September 18, 2010 | title=Saying goodbye to 'ER' | magazine=Hollywood Reporter | date=April 1, 2009 | accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> After Spielberg had joined as a producer, NBC ordered six episodes. "''ER'' premiered opposite a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game on ABC and did surprisingly well. Then we moved it to Thursday and it just took off", commented Littlefield.<ref name="Saying goodbye to 'ER'"/> ''ER''{{'}}s success surprised the networks and critics alike, as [[David E. Kelley]]'s new medical drama ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' was expected to crush the new series.<ref name="MSNBC">{{cite web | url=http://www.today.com/id/29843242 | title='ER' closes door, leaves behind satisfying legacy | publisher=Today.com | date=March 24, 2009 | accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>

Spielberg left the show after one year as a producer, having made one critical decision with lasting effects: the Carol Hathaway character, who died at the end of the original pilot episode script, was retained. Crichton remained executive producer until his death in November 2008, although he was still credited as one throughout that entire final season. Wells, the series' other initial executive producer, served as [[showrunner]] for the first three seasons. He was one of the show's most prolific writers and became a regular director in later years. [[Lydia Woodward]] was a part of the first season production team and became an executive producer for the third season. She took over as showrunner for the fourth season while Wells focused on the development of other series, including ''Trinity'', ''[[Third Watch]]'', and ''[[The West Wing]]''. She left her executive producer position at the end of the sixth season but continued to write episodes throughout the series' run.

Joe Sachs, who was a writer and producer of the series, believed keeping a commitment to medical accuracy was extremely important: "We'd bend the rules but never break them. A medication that would take 10 minutes to work might take 30 seconds instead. We compressed time. A 12- to 24-hour shift gets pushed into 48 minutes. But we learned that being accurate was important for more reasons than just making real and responsible drama."<ref name="Saying goodbye to 'ER'"/>

Woodward was replaced as showrunner by [[Jack Orman]]. Orman was recruited as a writer-producer for the series in its fourth season after a successful stint working on CBS's ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]''. He was quickly promoted and became an executive producer and showrunner for the series' seventh season. He held these roles for three seasons before leaving the series at the end of the ninth season. Orman was also a frequent writer and directed three episodes of the show.

[[David Zabel]] served as the series' head writer and executive producer in its later seasons. He initially joined the crew for the eighth season and became an executive producer and showrunner for the twelfth season onward. Zabel was the series' most frequent writer, contributing to 41 episodes. He also made his directing debut on the series. [[Christopher Chulack]] was the series' most frequent director and worked as a producer on all 15 seasons. He became an executive producer in the fourth season but occasionally scaled back his involvement in later years to focus on other projects.

Other executive producers include writers [[Carol Flint]], [[Neal Baer]], [[R. Scott Gemmill]], [[Dee Johnson (TV producer)|Dee Johnson]], [[Joe Sachs]], [[Lisa Zwerling]], and [[Janine Sherman Barrois]]. Several of these writers and producers had background in healthcare: Joe Sachs was an [[emergency medicine|emergency physician]], while Lisa Zwerling and Neal Baer were both [[pediatrician]]s. The series' crew was recognized with awards for writing, directing, producing, film editing, sound editing, casting, and music.

[[Ming-Na Wen]] debuted in the middle of the first season as medical student [[Jing-Mei "Deb" Chen]], but did not return for the second season; she returns in season 6 episode 10. [[Gloria Reuben]] and [[Laura Innes]] would join the series as Physician Assistant [[Jeanie Boulet]] and Dr. [[Kerry Weaver]], respectively, by the second season.<ref name="Memories of 'ER'">{{cite web | url=http://www.military.com/entertainment/television/memories-of-er | title=Memories of 'ER' | publisher=Military.com | date=March 30, 2009 | accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>

In the third season, a series of cast additions and departures began that would see the entire original cast leave over time. Stringfield was the first to exit the series, reportedly upsetting producers who believed she wanted to negotiate for more money, but the actress did not particularly care for "fame."

In addition to the main cast, ''ER'' featured a large number of frequently seen recurring cast members who played key roles such as paramedics, hospital support staff, nurses, and doctors. ''ER'' also featured a sizable roster of well-known guest stars, some making rare television appearances, who typically played patients in single episode appearances or multi-episode arcs.

===Broadcasting===
Following the broadcast of its two-hour pilot movie on September 19, 1994, ''ER'' premiered Thursday, September 22 at 10:00.

===Episodes===
{{Main|List of ER episodes}}
{{:List of ER episodes}}

A typical episode centered on the ER, with most scenes set in the hospital or surrounding streets. In addition, most seasons included at least one storyline located completely outside of the ER, often outside of Chicago. Over the span of the series, stories took place in the Democratic Republic of The Congo, France, Iraq and Sudan. One early storyline involved a road trip taken by Dr. Ross and Dr. Greene to California and a season eight episode included a storyline in Hawaii featuring Dr. Greene and Dr. Corday. Beginning in season nine, storylines started to include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], featuring Dr. Kovac, Dr. Carter, and Dr. Pratt.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Julie |last1=Cupples |first2=Kevin |last2=Glynn |year=2013 |title=Postdevelopment Television?

We had a bigger audience than a nightly newscast will ever see, making 25 to 30 million people aware of what was going on in Africa," ''ER'' producer, John Wells said. "The show is not about telling people to eat their vegetables, but if we can do that in an entertaining context, then there's nothing better."<ref name="MSNBC"/> The series also focused on sociopolitical issues such as [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], organ transplants, [[mental illness]], [[racism]], [[human trafficking]], [[euthanasia]], [[poverty]] and [[gay rights]].<ref name="MSNBC"/>

Some episodes used creative formats, such as the 1997 "Ambush", which was broadcast live twice, once for the east coast and again three hours later for the west coast;<ref name="Saying goodbye to 'ER'"/> and 2002's "Hindsight", which ran in reverse time as it followed one character, Dr. Kovac, through the tragic events of a Christmas Eve shift and the Christmas party that preceded it.

====Crossover with ''Third Watch''====
{{See also|Third Watch#Crossovers}}
The episode "Brothers and Sisters" (first broadcast on April 25, 2002) begins a crossover that concludes on the ''[[Third Watch]]'' episode "Unleashed" in which Susan enlists the help of Officers Maurice Boscorelli and Faith Yokas to find her sister and niece.

===Format===
''ER'' was filmed in [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] from the start, even though it was not broadcast in widescreen until the seventh season when it began appearing in the [[1080i]] HD format.<ref>[https://slate.com/culture/2002/02/why-the-sopranos-and-er-put-those-black-bands-across-your-screen.html Why The Sopranos and ER put those black bands across your screen]. Slate. 6 February 2002.</ref> Since the sixth episode of season 7, it has appeared in [[letterbox]] format when in standard definition. As a result, the U.S. DVD box set features the widescreen versions of the episodes, including those episodes originally broadcast in 1.33:1 (full frame) format. The episodes also appear in 1080i widescreen when rerun on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT HD]] and [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Pop]], though the first six seasons still run in full frame 1.33:1 on the digital [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] network. Only the live episode "Ambush" at the beginning of the fourth season (recorded in [[NTSC]] [[Professional video camera|video]]) and the title sequence for the first six seasons originated in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

In its first year, ''ER'' attracted an average of 19 million viewers per episode, becoming the year's second most watched television show, just behind ''[[Seinfeld]]''. In the following two seasons (1995–1997), ''ER'' was the most watched show in North America. For almost five years, ''ER'' battled for the top spot against ''Seinfeld'', but in 1998, ''Seinfeld'' ended and then ''ER'' became number one again. The [[series finale]] attracted 16.4 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002091 | work=Variety | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton | title='ER' series finale scores with auds | date=April 3, 2009}}</ref> The show's highest rating came during [[ER (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Hell and High Water (ER)|Hell and High Water]]," with 48 million viewers and a 45% market share. It was the highest for a regularly scheduled drama since a May 1985 installment of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' received a 46. The share represents the percentage of TVs in use tuned in to that show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/er/hell-and-high-water-25591 | work=TV.com | title=ER - Season 2, Episode 7: Hell and High Water}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Chicago downtown view from Sears.JPG|thumb|Chicago skyline]]
Throughout the series ''ER'' received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. It scored 80 on [[Metacritic]], meaning "generally favorable reviews", based on 21 critics. [[Marvin Kitman]] from [[Newsday]] gave the show a very positive review, saying: "It's like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' with just the helicopters showing up and no laughs. ''E.R.'' is all trauma; you never get to know enough about the patients or get involved with them. It's just treat, release and move on". [[Richard Zoglin]] from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' stated that it's "probably the most realistic fictional treatment of the medical profession TV has ever presented".

Critical reactions for ''ER''{{'}}s first season were very favorable. [[Alan Rich]], writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', praised the direction and editing of the pilot<ref name="variety1">ER Review (Variety Magazine) – Rich, Alan:  [https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117909056.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 ''ER - Pilot Review''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412194437/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117909056.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |date=April 12, 2009 }} (from 19 September 1994), accessed on December 31, 2008</ref> while Eric Mink, writing for the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', said that the pilot of ''ER'' "was urban, emergency room chaos and young, committed doctors." However some reviewers felt the episodes following the pilot did not live up to it with Mink commenting that "...the great promise of the "E.R." pilot dissolves into the kind of routine, predictable, sloppily detailed medical drama we've seen many times before."<ref name="nydaily1">Deja Vu: 'ER' (New York Daily News) – Minke, Eric:  [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/09/21/2008-09-21_daily_news_deja_vu_er-1.html?print=1&page=all ''Chicago Hope looks healthier than 'E.R''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414002527/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/09/21/2008-09-21_daily_news_deja_vu_er-1.html?print=1&page=all |date=April 14, 2009 }} (from 22 September 2008), accessed on December 31, 2008</ref>

NBC launched the show at the same time that [[CBS]] launched its own medical drama ''[[Chicago Hope]]''; many critics drew comparisons between the two. Eric Mink concluded that ''ER'' may rate more highly in the Nielsens but ''Chicago Hope'' told better stories,<ref name="nydaily1" /> while Rich felt both shows were "riveting, superior TV fare."<ref name="variety1" /> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote in 1996: "Not being able to follow what on earth is going on remains one of the peculiar charms of the breakneck American hospital drama, ''ER''".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hammond|first1=Michael|last2=Mazdon|first2=Lucy|title=The Contemporary Television Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p9Sv7-llzyUC&q=er+television&pg=PA217|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date=January 30, 2007|page=219|isbn=978-0-7486-1901-6}}</ref>

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''ER'' No. 22 on their list of "TV's Top 50 Shows", making it the second highest ranked medical drama on the list (after ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' at #20).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|last=Cosgrove-Mather|first=Bootie|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref> Also, the season 1 episode "[[Love's Labor Lost (ER)|Love's Labor Lost]]" was ranked No. 6 on [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time]] list having earlier been ranked #3.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |issue=June 28 – July 4 }}</ref> The show also placed No. 19 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} "New TV Classics" list.<ref>{{cite news|title=The New Classics: TV|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 6, 2012|date=June 18, 2007}}</ref> British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked it No. 29 in their list of the "50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time" and said the best episode was "Hell And High Water" ([[ER (season 2)|Season 2]], Episode 7) where "[[Doug Ross]] ([[George Clooney]]) saves a young boy from drowning during a flood."<ref>{{cite web|title=Empire Features: ''ER''|url=https://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=29|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=February 6, 2012|year=2008}}</ref> In 2012, ''ER'' was voted Best TV Drama on ABC's ''20/20'' special episode "[[Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time]]".<ref>{{cite news|title='Best In TV: The Greatest TV Shows Of All Time': Which Classic Comedy Is America's All-Time Favorite?

The first six DVD box sets of ''ER'' are unusual in the fact that they are all in [[anamorphic widescreen]] even though the episodes were broadcast in a standard 4:3 format. Only the live episode "Ambush" is not in the widescreen format.

In 2018 Hulu struck a deal with Warner Bros Domestic Television Distribution to stream all 15 seasons of the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/er-streaming-hulu-deal-330-episodes-1202664169/|title='ER' Finally Makes Streaming Debut With Hulu Pact|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2018-01-14|work=Variety|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
In 1996, [[Atlantic Records]] released an album of music from the first two seasons, featuring [[James Newton Howard]]'s theme from the series in its on-air and full versions, selections from the weekly scores composed by Martin Davich (Howard scored the two-hour pilot, Davich scored all the subsequent episodes and wrote a new theme used from 2006–2009 until the final episode, when Howard's original theme returned) and songs used on the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=E.R.: Original Television Theme Music and Score - Original TV Score : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/er-original-television-theme-music-and-score-mw0000076128|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>
