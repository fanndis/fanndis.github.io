'''Indonesia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Indonesia.ogg|ˌ|ɪ|n|d|ə|ˈ|n|iː|ʒ|ə}} {{Respell|IN|də|NEE|zhə}}), officially the '''Republic of Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Republik Indonesia|links=yes}} {{IPA-id|reˈpublik ɪndoˈnesia||3=Id-Indonesia.ogg}}),{{efn|name=efn0|Sometimes the nationalistic name of the '''Unitary State of Republic of Indonesia''' (''Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia'', NKRI) is used.}} is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Oceania]], between the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. It consists of more than [[List of islands of Indonesia|seventeen thousand islands]], including [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Borneo]] ([[Kalimantan]]), [[Sulawesi]], and [[New Guinea]] ([[Western New Guinea|Papua]]). Indonesia is the world's largest [[island country]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|14th-largest country by land area]], at {{convert|1,904,569|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}. With over {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN Population|Indonesia}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million people, it is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|4th-most populous country]] as well as the most populous [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority country]]. Java, the world's [[List of islands by population|most populous island]], is home to more than half of the country's population.

The [[sovereign state]] is a [[President of Indonesia|presidential]], [[Republic|constitutional republic]] with an elected [[People's Consultative Assembly|legislature]]. It has [[Provinces of Indonesia|34 provinces]], of which five have [[Autonomous administrative division|special status]]. The country's capital, [[Jakarta]], is the [[List of largest cities|second-most populous urban area in the world]]. The country shares [[Template:Borders of Indonesia|land borders]] with [[Papua New Guinea]], [[East Timor]], and the [[East Malaysia|eastern part]] of [[Malaysia]]. Other neighbouring countries include [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], the [[Philippines]], [[Australia]], [[Palau]], and [[India]]'s [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the [[Megadiverse countries|world's highest levels of biodiversity]].

The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the 7th century when [[Srivijaya]] and later [[Majapahit]] traded with entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries and [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhist]] kingdoms flourished. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] traders and [[Sufism|Sufi]] scholars brought [[Islam in Indonesia|Islam]], while Europeans introduced [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christianity]] through [[European colonisation of Southeast Asia|colonisation]]. Although sometimes interrupted by the [[Portuguese colonialism in the East Indies|Portuguese]], [[French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies|French and British]], the [[Dutch East Indies#History|Dutch]] were the foremost [[Dutch Empire|colonial power]] for much of their 350-year presence in the archipelago. The concept of "Indonesia" as a nation-state [[Indonesian National Awakening|emerged]] in the early 20th century<ref>Robert Elson, ''The idea of Indonesia: A history'' (2008) pp 1–12</ref> and the country [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]] in 1945. However, it was not until 1949 that the Dutch recognised [[United States of Indonesia|Indonesia's sovereignty]] following an [[Indonesian National Revolution|armed and diplomatic conflict]] between the two.

Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Indonesia|linguistic groups]], with the largest one being the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. A shared identity has developed with the motto ''"[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]"'' ("Unity in Diversity" ''literally'', "many, yet one"), defined by a national language, ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The [[economy of Indonesia]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|16th]] largest by nominal GDP and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|7th]] by GDP at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]]. Indonesia is the only [[regional power]] in Southeast Asia and is considered a [[middle power]] in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the [[United Nations]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[G20]], and a founding member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]], [[ASEAN|Association of Southeast Asian Nations]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[East Asia Summit]], [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]], and [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

== Etymology ==
{{further|Names of Indonesia}}

The Hindu [[Majapahit]] kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under [[Gajah Mada]], its influence stretched over much of present-day Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a "Golden Age" in Indonesian history.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The next great empire|last=Lewis|first=Peter|journal=Futures|volume=14|issue=1|year=1982|pages=47–61|doi=10.1016/0016-3287(82)90071-4}}</ref>

[[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|The earliest evidence of Islamized populations]] in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern [[Sumatra]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=3–14}} Other parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in [[Java]] and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century.

[[File:Nicolaas Pieneman - The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock.jpg|thumb|left|The submission of [[Diponegoro|Prince Diponegoro]] to [[Hendrik Merkus de Kock|General De Kock]] at the end of the [[Java War]] in 1830|alt=]]
The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by [[Francisco Serrão]], [[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|sought to monopolise]] the sources of [[nutmeg]], [[cloves]], and [[Piper cubeba|cubeb pepper]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=22–24}} Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and became the dominant European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1800 following bankruptcy, and the [[Batavian Republic|Netherlands]] established the [[Dutch East Indies]] as a nationalised colony.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|p=24}}

For most of the [[History of Indonesia#Colonial era|colonial period]], Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous. Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions both on and off Java. The influence of local leaders such as [[Prince Diponegoro]] in central Java, [[Imam Bonjol]] in central Sumatra, [[Pattimura]] in [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and bloody [[Aceh War|30-year war in Aceh]] weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.{{sfn|Schwarz|1994|pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Ricklefs |1991|p=142}}{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/indonesiandestin00theo/page/21 21]}} Only in the early 20th century did the Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.{{sfn|Friend|2003|p=[https://archive.org/details/indonesiandestin00theo/page/21 21]}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|1991|pp=61–147}}{{sfn|Taylor|2003|pp=[https://archive.org/details/indonesia00jean/page/209 209–278]}}{{sfn|Vickers|2005|pp=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmoderni00adri/page/n27 10–14]}}

More cooling climate types do exist in mountainous regions that are {{convert|1,300|to|1,500|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} above sea level. The oceanic climate (Köppen ''Cfb'') prevails in highland areas adjacent to rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical highland climate (Köppen ''Cwb'') is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Some regions, such as [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], experience only slight differences in rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry season, and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tend to be dry. The almost uniformly warm waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that temperatures on land remain relatively constant. [[Humidity]] is quite high, at between 70 and 90%. Winds are moderate and generally predictable, with [[monsoon]]s usually blowing in from the south and east in June through October, and from the northwest in November through March. [[Typhoon]]s and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in channels, such as the [[Lombok Strait|Lombok]] and [[Sape Strait|Sape]] straits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/29.htm|title=Climate|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=22 August 2020|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190324065541/http://countrystudies.us/indonesia/29.htm |archivedate=24 March 2019}}</ref>

Most civil disputes appear before the State Court (''Pengadilan Negeri''); appeals are heard before the High Court (''Pengadilan Tinggi''). The [[Supreme Court of Indonesia]] (''Mahkamah Agung'') is the highest level of the judicial branch, and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]] (''Mahkamah Konstitusi'') that listens to constitutional and political matters and the Religious Court (''Pengadilan Agama'') that deals with codified Islamic Law (''sharia'') cases.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cammack |first1=Mark E. |last2=Feener|first2=R.

Since 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all [[Elections in Indonesia|legislative elections]] since the fall of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]], no political party has managed to win an overall majority of seats. The [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDI-P), which secured the most votes in the [[2019 Indonesian general election|2019 elections]], is the party of the incumbent president, [[Joko Widodo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/asia/jakarta-governor-joko-widodo.html|title=Governor of Jakarta Receives His Party's Nod for President|last=Cochrane|first=Joe|work=The New York Times|date=15 March 2014|accessdate=3 February 2017|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170203052210/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/15/world/asia/jakarta-governor-joko-widodo.html |archivedate=3 February 2017}}</ref> Other notable parties include the [[Golkar|Party of the Functional Groups]] (''Golkar''), the [[Great Indonesia Movement Party]] (''Gerindra''), the [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]], and the [[Prosperous Justice Party]] (PKS).

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}
Indonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level is that of the provinces, with five out of a total of 34 having a [[Autonomous administrative division|special status]]. Each has a legislature (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah'', DPRD) and an elected governor. This number has evolved, with the most recent change being the split of [[North Kalimantan]] from [[East Kalimantan]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|title=House Agrees on Creation of Indonesia's 34th Province: 'North Kalimantan'|newspaper=The Jakarta Globe|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2017|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170816153022/http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/ |archivedate=16 August 2017}}</ref> The second level is that of the regencies (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), led by regents (''bupati'') and mayors (''walikota'') respectively and a legislature (''DPRD Kabupaten/Kota''). The third level is that of the [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'', ''distrik'' in [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], or ''kapanewon'' and ''kemantren'' in [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]]), and the fourth is of the [[Villages of Indonesia|villages]] (either ''desa'', ''kelurahan'', ''kampung'', ''nagari'' in West Sumatra, or ''gampong'' in [[Aceh]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

The village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (''rukun warga'', RW), which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'', RT). In Java, the village (''desa'') is divided into smaller units called ''dusun'' or ''dukuh'' (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected village head (''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insideindonesia.org/the-village-head-as-patron-2|title=The village head as patron|publisher=Inside Indonesia|author=Berenschot, Ward |author2=Sambodho, Prio|date=9 May 2017|accessdate=16 August 2020|url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180329193633/https://www.insideindonesia.org/the-village-head-as-patron-2 |archivedate=29 March 2018}}</ref>

The most dominant has traditionally been [[Architecture of India|Indian]]; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant.
