The '''China Youth Corps''' ({{zh|t=中國靑年救國團|l=China Youth National Salvation Corps|labels=no}}; until 2000: {{zh|t=中國靑年反共救國團|l=China Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps|labels=no}}), often known simply as CYC ({{zh|救國團|labels=no}}), is a [[youth organization]] in the [[Republic of China]].

The CYC was established in 1952, on the recommendation of the then president [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; its first chairperson was his son [[Chiang Ching-Kuo]]. The original purpose of the CYC was to provide basic military training to youths before they were [[conscription|conscripted]] into the Nationalist armed forces. At that time the CYC was very much a quasi-governmental, quasi-political organization with close ties to the [[Kuomintang]] regime, similar in many ways to the [[Communist Youth League]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].

Over the decades the CYC has lost much of its militaristic character, shifting its focus into providing recreational services to Taiwanese and [[Overseas Chinese]] alike (such as through the annual [[Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China]]), although [[military camp]]s remain one of the many activities it offers. Indeed, the CYC continued to provide military education textbooks to high school students until as recently as the 1990s.

On 28 August 1989 the CYC became a [[non-governmental organization]], thereby officially severing its ties with the Kuomintang regime; nonetheless many Taiwanese today still regard the CYC's senior management as being supportive towards the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]]. On 25 October 2000, the CYC officially dropped "Anti-Communist" from its official name.
