'''T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.''' is an American [[public company|publicly owned]] global [[investment management]] firm that offers [[mutual fund|funds]], advisory services, account management, and [[pension|retirement plans]] and services for individuals, institutions, and financial intermediaries. The firm, with assets under management of more than $1.3 trillion at the end of 2019, is headquartered at [[100 East Pratt Street]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and its 16 international offices serve clients in 47 countries around the world.<ref name="10K2017" />

It was founded in 1937 by [[Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.]] who is best known for developing the [[growth stock]] philosophy of investing.

As of 2019, the company is focused on active management after strategically deciding against a major initiative in passive investment.<ref name=":0" />

==Business philosophy==
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and [[account manager]] at Baltimore-area [[brokerage firm|brokerages]], but disliked the operating models of sales-oriented firms at the time. When he founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in 1937, his firm diverged from the norm in three major ways: charging fees based on [[assets under management]] rather than sales volume, [[active management|actively managing]] his clients' accounts strictly as a [[fiduciary]], and investing in [[growth stocks]] instead of [[value stocks]]. He became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by ''[[Forbes]]''.<ref name="Investopedia">{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/greatest/thomasroweprice.asp|title=The Greatest Investors: Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. |publisher=Investopedia|date=2003-12-01|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/t-rowe-price-was-right-for-his-clients-portfolios|title=T.

==History==
===1937-1986===
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at [[Bank of America Building (Baltimore)|10 Light Street]] and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left [[Legg Mason]]'s precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/free_forbes/2005/0131/102.html| title=Price Is Right|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=2005-01-10|accessdate=2017-02-20}}</ref> Initially a very small firm focused on [[wealth management]] and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.<ref name="Investopedia"/><ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/t-rowe-price| title=T. Rowe Price Associates -- International Directory of Company Histories| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|date=2006|accessdate=2017-02-20}}</ref>

Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like [[Xerox]], [[IBM]], and [[Boeing]].<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new [[One Charles Center]] building designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] nearby in downtown Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-1241.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places: One Charles Center, Baltimore|accessdate=2017-02-20}}</ref> At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid [[inflation]] he predicted would [[1973–75 recession|dominate the 1970s]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaii.com/journal/article/the-t-rowe-price-approach-to-investing-in-growth-stocks|title=T. Rowe Price Approach to Investing in Growth Stocks|publisher=American Association of Individual Investors Journal|date=1996|accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref> In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its [[Fixed income|Fixed Income Division]], and began to modernize and diversify its operations.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at [[100 East Pratt Street]] and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a [[joint venture]] with British asset manager [[Robert Fleming & Co.]] named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/t-rowe-price-acquires-flemings-interest-in-international-joint-venture-renames-it-t-rowe-price-international-inc-72772712.html |title=T.

===1986-2010===
T. Rowe Price held its [[initial public offering]], valued at nearly $200 million, in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/19/business/t-rowe-price-plans-stock-offer.html|title=T. Rowe Price Plans Stock Offer|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=1986-02-19|accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a [[Jardine House|Hong Kong office]] in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as [[USF&G]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/03/your-money/03iht-mrb3.html|title=Briefcase: T. Rowe Price Encourages Trend to Drop Sales Charge|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=1992-10-03|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref> This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with [[Sumitomo Bank]] and [[Daiwa Securities]] in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the [[S&P 500 Index]].<ref name="S&P">{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-10-17/business/9910160346_1_index-funds-index-effect-rowe-price | title=Baltimore's T.

On the strength of its ethic of [[risk aversion]], fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the [[dot-com bubble]] of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that ''The [[Wall Street Journal]]'' expressed surprise at the firm's moderation with then-profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.<ref name="Dotcom">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB952292958756965887 |title=T.

=== 2010-present ===
As of 2019, T.
