'''Nordstrom, Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔr|d|s|t|r|ə|m}}) is an American [[Luxury goods|luxury]] [[department store]] chain. Founded in 1901 by [[John W. Nordstrom]] and Carl F. Wallin, it originated as a shoe store and evolved into a full-line retailer with departments for clothing, footwear, handbags, jewelry, accessories, cosmetics, and fragrances. Some stores feature home furnishings and wedding departments, and several have in-house cafes, restaurants, and espresso bars.

As of 2020, Nordstrom operates 100 stores in 40 [[U.S. state]]s, and three [[Canadian province]]s since entering the market in 2014. The company opened a store in [[Puerto Rico]] in 2015, and exited the market during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nordstrom permanently closing 16 stores and three boutiques.

Its subsidiaries include the [[off-price]] department store chain [[Nordstrom Rack]] and the members-only online store [[HauteLook]].

==Early history==
John W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the town of [[Luleå]] in Northern Sweden.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Spector|first1=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KNirQkGPw8C&q=John+Nordstrom+potato+farm+in+arlington&pg=PT16|title=The Nordstrom Way to Customer Service Excellence: The Handbook For Becoming the "Nordstrom" of Your Industry|last2=McCarthy|first2=Patrick D.|date=2012-02-07|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-23653-6|language=en}}</ref> In 1887, Nordstrom [[Immigration|immigrated]] to the United States at the age of 16.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Romeo|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKYM9LW5csoC&q=John+W.+Nordstrom+immigrated+to+the+US+from+sweden&pg=PT139|title=Business's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Corporate Greed, Eccentric Entrepreneurs, and Management Oddities|date=2005-05-31|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61234-255-9|language=en}}</ref> His name at birth was Johan Nordström, which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} potato farm in [[Arlington, Washington]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1897, he joined the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in Canada's [[Yukon Territory]]. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.<ref name=":0" /> Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.<ref name=":0" />

==Operations during 20th century==
===Wallin & Nordstrom and Nordstrom Best===
Nordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.<ref name=":1" /> Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.<ref name=":0" /> John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, [[Everett Nordstrom|Everett W.]] (1903), [[Elmer Nordstrom|Elmer J.]] (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/nordstrom/#7bcf4f5f28db|title=Nordstrom family|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19930405&slug=1694426|title=Family Patriarch Elmer Nordstrom Dead At Age 88 {{!}} The Seattle Times|website=archive.seattletimes.com|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>

In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom's. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2011/07/07/seattle-history-nordstrom-through-the-years/|title=Seattle History: Nordstrom through the years|last=McNerthney|first=Casey|date=July 8, 2011|publisher=Seattle PI|language=en-US|access-date=September 28, 2016}}</ref>

By 1958, Nordstrom's had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.<ref name="Nordstrom History">{{cite web|url=http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/company-history|title=Nordstrom History|website=shop.nordstrom.com|access-date=November 26, 2016}}</ref>

===Following renaming to Nordstrom===
[[File:Old Nordstrom store in downtown Seattle 1984.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior of the original Nordstrom flagship store in Seattle (1984)]]
In 1971, the company was taken public on [[NASDAQ]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/nordstrom-family-may-take-the-company-private/|title=Nordstrom family weighs buyout for Seattle retailer, with its legacy — and billions — on the line|date=2017-06-08|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-US}}</ref> It was moved to the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.<ref name="Nordstrom History" />

By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into [[Alaska]] (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing [[Alaska Commercial Company|Northern Commercial Company]] and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at [[South Coast Plaza]] in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berg|first1=Tom|last2=Mangan|first2=Timothy|last3=Liddane|first3=Lisa|title=Maker of a Metropolis|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=February 21, 2015|page=News 6}}</ref> By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the [[Tysons Corner Center]] in Virginia (1988), the Midwest  in the [[Oakbrook Center]] in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.<ref>The Nordstrom Way (1996), 133</ref>

In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.<ref>Dow Jones News Services. "Nordstrom-Place Two -2-: To Close 3 Stores, Convert 1." April 26, 1994.</ref> The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nordstrom To Close Last Of Its Place Two Stores {{!}} The Seattle Times|url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19950120&slug=2100400|website=archive.seattletimes.com|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref> The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division<ref>The Nordstrom Way, 213</ref> led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. Currently, it has distribution centers in [[Ontario, California]]; [[Newark, California]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Dubuque, Iowa]]; [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland]]; and [[Gainesville, Florida]].

Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], with its customer contact center in [[Centennial, Colorado]]. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. Other rewards include Nordstrom Notes which are redeemed or used like cash in stores for new purchases and the Nordstrom Signature VISA card also has an optional travel/leisure rewards feature. The Nordstrom Rewards program features 4 levels of status depending on annual spending and offers various promotional times throughout the year to earn double, triple and even ten-times points.<ref>[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=25916209 Nordstrom fsb: Private Company Information – Businessweek].

In 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State<ref>{{Cite news|last=Vizard|first=Mary McAleer|date=1995-01-08|title=A New Mall for the City of 1,000 Stores|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/08/realestate/a-new-mall-for-the-city-of-1000-stores.html|access-date=2020-05-31|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>. It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City.

Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. After John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/John-Whitacre-former-Nordstrom-CEO-was-a-team-1101449.php | title=John Whitacre, former Nordstrom CEO, was a team player|first=Christine|last=Frey|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=November 20, 2002|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}</ref> In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former [[Frederick & Nelson]] building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nordstrom to Unveil its Renovated Downtown Seattle Flagship Store|url=https://www.seattlemag.com/article/nordstrom-unveil-its-renovated-downtown-seattle-flagship-store|date=2016-07-25|website=Seattle Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref> At {{convert|383000|sqft|m2}}, the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in [[Salem, Oregon]], with a total area of just under {{convert|72000|sqft|m2}}. This location has been since closed.

Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain [[Façonnable]] in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup.

===2010&ndash;2019===
In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of [[HauteLook]], an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year "earn-out" payment based on [[HauteLook]]'s financial performance.<ref>[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/nordstrom-to-acquire-online-retailer-hautelook/ Nordstrom to Acquire Online Retailer HauteLook], New York Times Dealbook, February 17, 2011.</ref> On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] [[Circle Center]] Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, "We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing."<ref>[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=211996&p=irol-newsArticle_print&ID=1568239&highlight= Nordstrom.com – Press Room – Press Release].

In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]], New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/business/nordstrom-opens-treasurebond-in-new-york-city.html|title=Nordstrom in New York to Use an Alias|date=August 16, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
