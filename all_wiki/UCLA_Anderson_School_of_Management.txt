==History==
[[Image:UCLA Anderson School Collins Center.jpg|thumb|left|Collins Center at the UCLA Anderson School of Management]]
The School of Management at UCLA was founded in 1935, and the MBA degree was authorized by the [[UC Regents]] four years later.  In its early years the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of [[Neil H. Jacoby]] as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the U.S. for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees.  Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered.

In 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration.  Five years later it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school’s name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management.

In 1987, [[John E. Anderson]] (1917–2011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA’s campus. He later donated additional $25 million. The 6-building, {{convert|285000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility, was designed by [[Henry N. Cobb]] of the architectural firm [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] and Executive Architects [[Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Associates]]. It cost $75 million to construct and opened officially in 1995.

On May 13, 2015, Marion Anderson, widow of the late John Anderson, announced a $100 million donation (4th single-largest donation to a business school in the United States) to the school for fellowships and research, along with $40 million earmarked for initiating development of what is now known as the Marion Anderson Hall.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.anderson.ucla.edu/anderson/2017/10/marion-anderson-hall-a-link-to-the-past-a-bridge-to-the-future.html|title=Marion Anderson Hall: A Link to the Past, a Bridge to the Future|website=UCLA Anderson School of Management Blog|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>

Recently, the school has been mostly self-funded, with only $6 million of government funding out of its $96 million budget in 2010-11.<ref name="insidehighered">''Pushback on a B-School's Bold Plan'', Inside Higher Ed., November 23, 2010, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/23/ucla URL]</ref> In fall 2010, the school proposed "financial self-sufficiency": Giving up all state funding, in return for freedom from some state rules and freedom to raise tuition.<ref name="insidehighered" /> Critics called this proposal "privatization", but the school rejected this description, with former Dean Judy Olian saying, "This is not privatization.... We will continue to be part of UCLA and part of the state."<ref name="insidehighered" /> The proposal met objections in the UCLA Academic Senate (faculty members from all UCLA departments),<ref name="insidehighered" /> and is still pending.

Update:  This decision was approved by the University of California President Mark Yudof in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-26/ucla-wins-right-to-take-mba-program-private|title=UCLA Wins Right to Take MBA Program Private|date=15 May 2019|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref> In July 2018, Judy D.

==Campus==
[[Image:Atrium Marion Anderson Hall UCLA.jpg|thumb|right|Marion Anderson Hall Atrium]]
The school is located on north part of the UCLA campus. The four main buildings, Mullin, Cornell, Entrepreneurs, and Gold, form an inner circle at the corner of [[Sunset Boulevard]] and Westwood Plaza, which is the extension of [[Westwood Boulevard]]. Connected to the Gold building is the Collins building, which is named for alumnus James A. Collins, who is the chairman emeritus of [[Sizzler|Sizzler International, Inc.]] and who funded the [[John R. Wooden]] statue in front of [[Pauley Pavilion]].<ref>Rebecca Kendall, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-unveils-statue-of-coach-john-240152.aspx UCLA unveils statue of Coach John Wooden outside new Pauley Pavilion], UCLA Newsroom, October 26, 2012</ref>

The new Marion Anderson Hall addition opened February 12, 2020. The 64,000 square-foot campus addition is estimated to cost $80 million and is one hundred percent donor-funded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/about/office-of-development/campaign-priorities/marion-anderson-hall|title=Marion Anderson Hall|website=UCLA Anderson School of Management|language=en|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref> Marion Anderson Hall is designed by a collaboration of [[Gensler]], leading the interior architecture, and exterior design by [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], the same architectural firm that designed the original Anderson complex. The new building features four floors, interactive work, learning and event spaces, LEED Platinum certification, and will serve as the prominent entrance to the Anderson complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gensler.com/projects/ucla-anderson-marion-anderson-hall?q=marion%20anderson%20hall|title=Marion Anderson Hall|website=Gensler|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>

Anderson also offers an Applied Management Research Program (AMR), consisting of a two-quarter team-based strategic consulting field study project required during the second year of study in lieu of the comprehensive exam for the master's degree.  Students complete strategic projects for companies partnering with the school, ultimately presenting recommendations to senior management.  The program has been around since the late 1960s and is presently led by Professor Gonzalo Freixes, its Faculty Director. In 2004, two alternatives to the field study were introduced: a Business Creation Option, and a research study option.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
