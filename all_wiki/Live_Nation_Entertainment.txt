'''Live Nation Entertainment, Inc''' is an [[United States|American]] global [[Entertainment|entertainment company]], founded in 2010, following the [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] of [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]] and [[Ticketmaster]]. The company promotes, operates, and manages ticket sales for live entertainment in the United States and internationally. It also owns and operates entertainment venues, and manages the careers of music artists.

== History ==
In 2009, [[Live Nation (events promoter)|Live Nation]] and [[Ticketmaster]], a concert promotion firm and ticketing company, reached an agreement to merge. The new company received regulatory approval and was named Live Nation Entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/business/global/23ticketmaster.html|title=British Regulator Supports Live Nation-Ticketmaster Merger|last=Nicholson|first=Chris V.|date=22 December 2009|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/live-nation-ticketmaster-merger-official-79083|title=Live Nation, Ticketmaster merger official|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref> [[Michael Rapino]], then-CEO of Live Nation, became the new company's CEO, while Ticketmaster CEO [[Irving Azoff]] was named executive chairman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ticketmaster-livenation-idUSTRE5194DL20090210|title=Live Nation to buy Ticketmaster|date=2009-02-10|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-07-16|language=en}}</ref>

The merger was opposed in the U.S. by some regulators, artists, fans, and competing firms, who argued it would reduce competition in the industry and increase ticket costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bruce-springsteen-furious-at-ticketmaster-rails-against-live-nation-merger-97368/|title=Bruce Springsteen "Furious" At Ticketmaster, Rails Against Live Nation Merger|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2009-02-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ticketnews.com/Ticketmaster-Live-Nation-merger-twenty-five-thousand-contact-DOJ-to-oppose-the-deal11019818|title=Ticketmaster / Live Nation merger: 25,000 contact DOJ to oppose the deal|author=Branch, Alfred Jr.|date=January 19, 2010|accessdate=January 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122153341/http://www.ticketnews.com/Ticketmaster-Live-Nation-merger-twenty-five-thousand-contact-DOJ-to-oppose-the-deal11019818|archivedate=January 22, 2010|url-status=dead|publisher=TicketNews}}</ref> Artist [[Bruce Springsteen]] was one vocal opponent of the merger at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/04/bruce-springsteen-furious-at-ticketmaster-rails-against-live-nation-merger/|title=Bruce Springsteen "Furious" At Ticketmaster, Rails Against Live Nation Merger|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-19|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

=== Investments and growth ===
In 2013, the company acquired Voodoo Music & Arts Experience and announced a joint venture with [[Insomniac Events]], a promoter focused on [[electronic dance music]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/06/electric-daisy-carnival-insomniac-dick-clark-productions-edm-awards-2014/|title=Electronic Daisy Chain|work=Spin|access-date=2018-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/1567396/live-nation-teams-with-insomniac-events-in-creative-partnership|title=Live Nation Teams With Insomniac Events in 'Creative Partnership'|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/5770406/live-nation-acquires-voodoo-music-arts-experience-in-new-orleans/|title=Live Nation Acquires Voodoo Music & Arts Experience in New Orleans|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> The company later acquired [[C3 Presents]] (2014),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6414053/live-nation-completes-deal-for-c3-presents|title=Live Nation Completes Deal for C3 Presents|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref> Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival (2015),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-live-nation-buys-controlling-stake-in-bonnaroo-20150428-story.html|title=Live Nation Entertainment buys controlling stake in Bonnaroo festival|last=Faughnder|first=Ryan|website=latimes.com|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> and Founders Entertainment (2016), the parent company of Governors Ball Music Festival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/business/media/live-nation-adds-governors-ball-to-its-music-festival-lineup.html/|title=Live Nation Adds Governors Ball to Its Music Festival Lineup|work=NYTimes|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref> In October 2016, Live Nation Entertainment bought AC Entertainment, a Knoxville Tennessee music company,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/2016/10/31/live-nation-buys-ac-entertainment/93074100/|title=Live Nation buys AC Entertainment|newspaper=The Tennessean|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> as well as several international companies.<ref name=":5" /> The company continued to invest in music festivals and promoters in 2017, purchasing a controlling interest in [[BottleRock Napa Valley]] Music Festival,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Live-Nation-acquires-major-stake-in-BottleRock-10853961.php|title=Live Nation acquires major stake in BottleRock festival|work=SF Chronicle|access-date=2018-08-11}}</ref> Salt Lake City-based concert promoter United Concerts,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldextra.com/entertainment/music/live-nation-acquires-salt-lake-s-united-concerts/article_aeba440c-9fe6-55b9-921a-8e3f21ddb343.html|title=Live Nation acquires Salt Lake's United Concerts|last=Fox|first=Doug|website=Daily Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> and CT Touring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/01/live-nation-acquires-ct-touring/|title=Live Nation acquires CT Touring|date=2017-01-20|website=IQ Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> In 2017, Live Nation Entertainment reported revenue of $10.3 billion.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ampthemag.com/the-real/live-nation-reports-10-billion-revenue-2017-financial-earnings/|title=Live Nation Reports Over $10 Billion in Revenue in 2017 Financial Earnings|date=2018-02-27|website=Amplify|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> In 2018, the company expanded its concert promotion segment by acquiring a majority stake in a number of companies including Frank Productions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8093967/live-nation-acquires-frank-productions|title=Live Nation Acquires Frank Productions: Exclusive|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref> Emporium Presents,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8477654/live-nation-acquires-emporium-presents|title=Live Nation Acquires Emporium Presents|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-12-12|language=en-us}}</ref> and Red Mountain Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al.com/entertainment/2018/06/live_nation_buys_birminghams_l.html|title=Live Nation buys Red Mountain Entertainment, Birmingham's largest concert promoter|last=Colurso|first=Mary|date=2018-06-27|website=al.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-17}}</ref>

Also in 2018, the [[United States Department of Justice]] launched an investigation following complaints by AEG that Live Nation pressured them into using [[Ticketmaster]] and intentionally avoided booking acts for AEG venues.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/arts/music/live-nation-ticketmaster.html|title=Live Nation Rules Music Ticketing, Some Say With Threats|first1=Ben|last1=Sisario|first2=Graham|last2=Bowley|date=1 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> Live Nation stated that decisions in selecting venues were not punitive, and were instead based on size and management.<ref name=":2" />

Live Nation Entertainment has acquired a majority stake in the David Grutman owned Groot Hospitality, a Miami-based company. The portfolio includes LIV nightclub located inside the historic Fontainebleau Hotel, which opened in 2008 as host to the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2008. The portfolio includes restaurants and nightlife venues, to include Story (2012), Komodo (2015), Swan & Bar Bevy with Pharrell Williams(2018) and Papi Steak (2019).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533661/live-nation-david-grutman-groot-hospitality|title=Live Nation Acquires David Grutman's Groot Hospitality|work=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>

In 2020, Live Nation has been hit particularly hard by the novel coronavirus pandemic, with essentially all concerts and sporting events around the world on hold. The company has been sued as it has been reluctant to offer full refunds to customers, though it has since amended its refund rules to address those complaints. The company's share price is down by more than 40 percent from January 1, thanks largely to the pandemic.

The government of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has acquired a 5.7 percent stake in Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster.

The Saudi Public Investment Fund disclosed the stake, comprising 12,337,569 shares in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday morning.

Based on Live Nation's share prices as of 28 April 2020, the investment is valued at just shy of $500 million. Live Nation's share price jumped at the news, rising by more than 2 percent in the first few minutes of trading. The investment is passive, and was purchased on the open market. The Saudi Public Investment Fund is now the company's third-largest shareholder, with John Malone's Liberty Media the largest individual shareholder with a 33 percent stake.
