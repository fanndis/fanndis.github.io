The '''Organization of American States''' ({{lang-es|Organización de los Estados Americanos}}, {{lang-pt|Organização dos Estados Americanos}}, {{lang-fr|Organisation des États américains}}, {{lang-nl|Organisatie van Amerikaanse Staten}}), or the '''OAS''' or '''OEA''', is a continental [[organization]] that was founded on 30 April 1948, for the purposes of solidarity and cooperation among its member states within the [[Western Hemisphere]].

During the [[Cold War]], the United States hoped the OAS would be a bulwark against the spread of [[communism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/organization-american-states|title=The Organization of American States|last=|first=|date=|website=Council on Foreign Relations|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since the 1990s, the organization has focused on [[election monitoring]].

Headquartered in the [[United States]]' capital [[Washington, D.C.]], the OAS's members are the 35 independent states of the [[Americas]]. As of 26 May 2015, the [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|Secretary General of the OAS]] is [[Luis Almagro]].<ref name="Miami Herald">{{cite web |last = Wyss |first = Jim |title = As a Uruguayan is poised to head the OAS, questions swirl about Venezuela |url = http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article15196958.html|website=Miami Herald |publisher=Miami Herald|access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref>

== History ==

{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!--very few citations-->

[[File:Pan American between 1910 and 1920 (cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The Pan American Union shortly after its construction in 1910]]

The notion of an international union in the [[New World]] was first put forward during the liberation of the Americas by [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]]<ref>{{cite web |title = Panama: A Country Study |location = Washington |publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress |year = 1987 |url = http://countrystudies.us/panama/4.htm }}</ref> who, at the 1826 [[Congress of Panama]] (still being part of Colombia), proposed creating a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. This meeting was attended by representatives of [[Gran Colombia]] (comprising the modern-day countries of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panama]] and  [[Venezuela]]), [[Argentina]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], The [[United Provinces of Central America]], and [[Mexico]] but the grandly titled "Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation" was ultimately ratified only by Gran Colombia. Bolívar's dream soon floundered with civil war in Gran Colombia, the disintegration of Central America, and the emergence of [[Nationalism|national]] rather than New World outlooks in the newly independent American republics. Bolívar's dream of American unity was meant to unify Hispanic American nations against external powers.

The pursuit of regional solidarity and cooperation again came to the forefront in 1889–1890, at the First [[International Conference of American States]]. Gathered together in Washington, D.C., 18 nations resolved to found the International Union of American Republics, served by a permanent secretariat called the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics (renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference in 1901–1902). These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception to which the OAS and its General Secretariat trace their origins.

At the fourth [[International Conference of American States]] ([[Buenos Aires]], 1910), the name of the organization was changed to the Union of American Republics and the Bureau became the Pan American Union. The [[Pan American Union Building]] was constructed in 1910, on [[Constitution Avenue]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]]

[[File:Pan American Union, Washington, DC in 1943.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pan American Union Building|Pan American Union headquarters building]] in Washington, D.C., 1943.]]

In the mid-1930s, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] organized an inter-American conference in Buenos Aires. One of the items at the conference was a "[[League of Nations]] of the Americas", an idea proposed by Colombia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.<ref>Special to the New York Times. [https://www.nytimes.com/1936/04/13/archives/league-of-nations-in-americas-urged-by-3-latin-states-this-is-one.html?sq=League+of+nations+in+Americas&scp=1&st=p "League of Nations in Americas urged by 3 Latin states"], ''The New York Times''. April 13, 1936. p. 1.</ref> At the subsequent Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 21 nations pledged to remain neutral in the event of a conflict between any two members.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1936/12/20/archives/americas-adopt-neutrality-pact-21-nations-pledge-a-joint-attitude.html?sq=League+of+nations+in+Americas&scp=6&st=p "Americas adopt neutrality pact"], ''The New York Times''. December 20, 1936.</ref> The experience of [[World War II]] convinced hemispheric governments that unilateral action could not ensure the territorial integrity of the American nations in the event of external aggression. To meet the challenges of global conflict in the postwar world and to contain conflicts within the hemisphere, they adopted a system of [[collective security]], the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] (Rio Treaty) signed in 1947 in [[Rio de Janeiro]].

The ninth [[International Conference of American States]] was held in [[Bogotá]] between March and May 1948 and led by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[George Marshall]], a meeting which led to a pledge by members to fight communism in the [[western hemisphere]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/Organization-of-American-States |title=Organization of American States |website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref> This was the event that saw the birth of the OAS as it stands today, with the signature by 21 American countries of the [[Charter of the Organization of American States]] on 30 April 1948 (in effect since December 1951). The meeting also adopted the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], the world's first general human rights instrument.

The transition from the Pan American Union to OAS would have been smooth if it had not been for the assassination of Colombian leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]]. The Director General of the former, [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]], became the Organization's first [[Secretary General of the Organization of American States|Secretary General]]. The current Secretary General is former Uruguayan minister of foreign affairs [[Luis Almagro]].

Significant milestones in the history of the OAS since the signing of the Charter have included the following:
*1959: [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] created.
*1959: [[Inter-American Development Bank]] created.
*1960: First application of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]] against the regime of [[Rafael Trujillo]] in [[Dominican Republic]]
*1961: Charter of Punta del Este signed, launching the [[Alliance for Progress]].
*1962: OAS suspends [[Cuba]].
*1969: [[American Convention on Human Rights]] signed (in force since 1978).
*1970: [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] established as the Organization's supreme decision-making body.
*1979: [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] created.
*1991: Adoption of Resolution 1080, which requires the Secretary General to convene the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] within ten days of a [[coup d'état]] in any member country.
*1994: First [[Summit of the Americas]] ([[Miami]]), which resolved to establish a [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] by 2005.
*2001: [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]] adopted.
*2009: OAS revokes 1962 suspension of [[Cuba]].
*2009: OAS suspends Honduras due to the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup]] which ousted president [[Manuel Zelaya]].
*2010: The OAS intervened in the [[Haiti 2010 Presidential election]], demanding that the third-place candidate be permitted to participate in a runoff election with the first-place candidate,<ref>{{cite web

Instead of ordering time stamps on voting tally sheets chronologically, they were ordered alphabetically, leading to the "inexplicable change in trend" alleged by the OAS in the preliminary count. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/09/oas-evo-morales-bolivia-coup-fraud-cepr|title=The OAS Accusation of Electoral Fraud Against Evo Morales is Bullshit — And Now We Have the Data to Prove It|first=Resnick |last=David|date=September 5, 2020|publisher=Jacobin Magazine}}</ref>

== Goals and purpose ==
In the words of Article 1 of the Charter, the goal of the member nations in creating the OAS was "to achieve an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence." Article 2 then defines eight essential purposes:
*To strengthen the [[world peace|peace]] and security of the continent.
*To promote and consolidate [[representative democracy]], with due respect for the [[principle of non-intervention]].
*To prevent possible causes of difficulties and to ensure the pacific settlement of disputes that may arise among the member states.
*To provide for common action on the part of those states in the event of aggression.
*To seek the solution of political, judicial, and economic problems that may arise among them.
*To promote, by cooperative action, their [[right to development|economic, social, and cultural development]].
*To [[poverty reduction|eradicate extreme poverty]], which constitutes an obstacle to the full democratic development of the peoples of the hemisphere.
*To achieve an effective limitation of conventional weapons that will make it possible to devote the largest amount of resources to the economic and social development of the member states.

Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in [[Latin America]], and the thrust toward [[globalization]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:

*Strengthening democracy: Between 1962 and 2002, the Organization sent multinational observation missions to oversee free and fair elections in the member states on more than 100 occasions. The OAS also works to strengthen national and local government and electoral agencies, to promote democratic practices and values, and to help countries detect and defuse official corruption.
*Working for peace: Special OAS missions have supported peace processes in [[Nicaragua]], [[Suriname]], [[Haiti]], and [[Guatemala]]. The Organization has played a leading part in the removal of landmines deployed in member states and it has led negotiations to resolve the continents' remaining border disputes ([[Guatemala]]/[[Belize]]; [[Peru]]/[[Ecuador]]). Work is also underway on the construction of a common inter-American counter-terrorism front.
*[[Human rights defenders|Defending human rights]]: The agencies of the inter-American human rights system provide a venue for the denunciation and resolution of human rights violations in individual cases. They also monitor and report on the general human rights situation in the member states.
*Fostering free trade: The OAS is one of the three agencies currently engaged in drafting a treaty aiming to establish an [[Free Trade Area of the Americas|inter-continental free trade area]] from [[Alaska]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]].
*Fighting the drugs trade: The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission was established in 1986 to coordinate efforts and crossborder cooperation in this area.
*Promoting [[sustainable development]]: The goal of the OAS's Inter-American Council for Integral Development is to promote economic development and combating poverty. OAS technical cooperation programs address such areas as river basin management, the conservation of biodiversity, preservation of cultural diversity, planning for global climate change, [[sustainable tourism]], and natural disaster mitigation.

== Organizational structure ==
[[File:Secretary Pompeo Delivers Remarks at the Organization of American States Headquarters (46863388441).jpg|thumb|US Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]] speaks at the OAS Permanent Council in January 2019]]

The Organization of American States is composed of an Organization of American States General Secretariat, the Permanent Council, the Inter-American Council for Integral Development, and a number of committees.

The General Secretariat of the Organization of American States consists of six [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariats]].
*[[Organization of American States Secretariat for Political Affairs|Secretariat for Political Affairs]]

*Secretariat for External Relations

The various committees of the Organization of American States include:
* The Committee on Juridical and Political Affairs
* The Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Affairs
* The Committee on Hemispheric Security
* The Committee on Inter-American Summits Management and Civil Society Participation in OAS Activities

The various commissions of the Organization of American States include: 
* [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM)
* [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (CIDH)

== Funding ==
The OAS has two funds, one for the General Secretariat, and one for specific programs and initiatives. The General Assembly asks for contributions from each member country based on its capacity to pay. In 2018 the General Secretariat's budget was $85 million of which the US contributed $50 million. In 2017 the US contributed $17 million to the fund for specific programmes which was almost a third of the total contributions for that year.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Organization of American States |url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/organization-american-states |website=Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>

== General Assembly ==
[[File:Organization of American States General Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|A session of the OAS's thirty-fifth General Assembly in [[Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], June 2005.]]
{{main|General Assembly of the Organization of American States}}

The [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]] is the supreme decision-making body of OAS. It convenes once every year in a regular session. In special circumstances, and with the approval of two-thirds of the member states, the [[Permanent Council of the Organization of American States|Permanent Council]] can convene special sessions.

The Organization's member states take turns hosting the General Assembly on a rotating basis. The states are represented at its sessions by their chosen delegates: generally, their ministers of foreign affairs, or their appointed deputies. Each state has one vote, and most matters—except for those for which the Charter or the General Assembly's own rules of procedure specifically require a two-thirds majority—are settled by a simple majority vote.

The General Assembly's powers include setting the OAS's general course and policies by means of resolutions and declarations; approving its budget and determining the contributions payable by the member states; approving the reports and previous year's actions of the OAS's specialized agencies; and electing members to serve on those agencies.

=== Canada and the OAS ===
Although [[Canada]] was a founding member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1919<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url = https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/league-of-nations |title=League of Nations|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref> and has joined international organizations since that date, it chose not to join the OAS when it was first formed, despite its [[Canada-United States relations|close relations with the United States]]. Canada became a Permanent Observer in the OAS on 2 February 1972. Canada signed the Charter of the Organization of American States on 13 November 1989 and this decision was ratified on 8 January 1990.

In 2004–2005, Canada was the second largest contributor to the OAS, with an annual assessed contribution representing 12.36 percent of the OAS Regular Budget (US$9.2 million) and an additional C$9 million in voluntary contributions to specific projects.<ref>[http://geo.international.gc.ca/cip-pic/geo/oas-oae-en.aspx Canada and the Organization of American States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123015807/http://geo.international.gc.ca/cip-pic/geo/oas-oae-en.aspx |date=2009-01-23 }}, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada (DFAIT), 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1967/sep-oct/kos.html Canada and the Organization of American States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123223353/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1967/sep-oct/kos.html |date=2007-11-23 }} by Dr. Ludwil J.

=== Sanctions against the Dominican Republic ===
During the 6th Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States (OAS) in [[Costa Rica]], from 16 to 20 August 1960, a conviction against the State of the Dominican Republic was agreed to unanimously. The penalty was motivated because the foreign ministers checked the veracity of the claim that the [[Rafael Trujillo]] regime had sponsored an attack against [[Rómulo Betancourt]], at that time, constitutional president of Venezuela. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers from 21 American nations, including [[Cuba]], which at that time had not yet been expelled from the inter-American system.

All countries, including the [[United States]] and [[Haiti]], broke off diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. Additionally an economic blockade that affected the exports of sugar was applied, which at that time was the pillar of the Dominican economy.

It was the first application of the [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]], which had been adopted at the OAS on July 29, 1960.

=== Status of Cuba ===
{{further|Cuba–OAS relations}}

The current government of Cuba was excluded from participation in the Organization under a decision adopted by the Eighth Meeting of Consultation in [[Punta del Este]], [[Uruguay]], on 31 January 1962. The vote was passed by 14 in favor, with one against (Cuba) and six abstentions (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Mexico). The operative part of the resolution reads as follows:

{{quote
|#That adherence by any member of the Organization of American States to Marxism-Leninism is incompatible with the inter-American system and the alignment of such a government with the communist bloc breaks the unity and solidarity of the continents.
#That the present Government of Cuba, which has officially identified itself as a Marxist-Leninist government, was incompatible with the principles and objectives of the inter-American system.
#That this incompatibility excluded the present Government of Cuba from participation in the inter-American system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Six Report on the Situation of Political Prisoners in Cuba |work=[[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1979-12-14 |url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba79eng/intro.htm}}</ref>
}}

This meant that the Cuban nation was still technically a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and attendance at meetings and of participation in activities. The OAS's position was that although Cuba's participation was suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], etc. still hold: for instance, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] continued to publish reports on Cuba's human rights situation and to hear individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states.

Cuba's position was stated in an official note sent to the Organization "merely as a courtesy" by Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. [[Raúl Roa]] on 4 November 1964: "Cuba was arbitrarily excluded ... The Organization of American States has no juridical, factual, or moral jurisdiction, nor competence, over a state which it has illegally deprived of its rights."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Situation of Human Rights in Cuba: Seventh Report |work=[[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1983-10-04 |url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/countryrep/Cuba83eng/intro.htm}}</ref>

The reincorporation of Cuba as an active member regularly arose as a topic within the inter-American system{{spaced ndash}} for instance, it was intimated by the outgoing ambassador of Mexico in 1998<ref>{{cite press release |title=Mexico Calls for Cuba's Reinstatement into the OAS |publisher=Organization of American States |date=1998-02-04 |url=http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press2002/en/Press98/020498ce.htm}} Organization of American States.</ref>{{spaced ndash}}but most observers did not see it as a serious possibility while the present government remained in power. Since 1960, the Cuban administration had repeatedly characterized the OAS as the "Ministry of Colonies" of the United States of America.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869814,00.html |title=The Testing of the OAS |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1960-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1972/19720426.html |title=Castro admits problems in education |work=Siempre |publisher=Latin American Network Information Center, University of Texas at Austin |first=Marta |last=Solis |date=1972-04-26 |pages=40–41}}</ref> On 6 May 2005, President [[Fidel Castro]] reiterated that the island nation would not "be part of a disgraceful institution that has only humiliated the honor of Latin American nations."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&language=EN |title=Fidel Castro: OAS Is an Instrument of the US |work=[[Prensa Latina]] |location=Havana, Cuba |date=2006-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011190122/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B2355B35C-068E-4DFE-879E-3E8836A38EA4%7D&language=EN |archivedate=2008-10-11 }}</ref> After Fidel Castro's recent retirement and the ascent of his brother [[Raúl Castro|Raúl]] to power, this official position was reasserted.

On 17 April 2009, after a "trading of warm words" between the administrations of U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro, OAS Secretary General [[José Miguel Insulza]] said he would ask the 2009 General Assembly to annul the 1962 resolution excluding Cuba.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30261514 |title=U.S., Cuba trade warm words ahead of summit |work=NBC News |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}</ref>

On 3 June 2009, foreign ministers assembled in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Honduras]], for the OAS's 39th [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|General Assembly]], passed a vote to lift Cuba's suspension from the OAS. The United States had been pressuring the OAS for weeks to condition Cuba's readmission to the group on democratic principles and commitment to human rights. Ecuador's Foreign Minister [[Fander Falconí]] said there will be no such conditions. "This is a new proposal, it has no conditions—of any kind," Falconí said.

== Official languages ==
[[File:Socha Izabely I Katolickej.JPG|thumb|Statue of Isabella I the Catholic Queen in front of the seat of the Organization of American States in Washington D.C.]]

The Organization's [[List of official languages by institution|official languages]] are [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]]. The Charter, the basic instrument governing OAS, makes no reference to the use of official languages. These references are to be found in the Rules of Procedure governing the various OAS bodies. Article 51 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly,<ref>General Assembly of the OAS, [http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/agres_1737_xxxo00.htm Amendments to the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly], 5 June 2000</ref> the supreme body of the OAS, which meets once a year, states that English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish are the four official languages. Article 28 stipulates that a Style Committee shall be set up with representatives of the four official languages to review the General Assembly resolutions and declarations. Article 53 states that proposals shall be presented in the four official languages. The Rules of Procedure and Statutes of other bodies, such as the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CIDI), the Permanent Executive Committee of the Inter-American Council for Integral Development (CEPCIDI), the [[Inter-American Commission of Women]] (CIM), the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (IACHR) and the Inter-American Juridical Committee (CJI), technical bodies of the OAS, also mention the four official languages in which their meetings are to be conducted. Policy is therefore dictated through these instruments that require use of the four official languages at meetings.<ref>Marguerite Groves (Coordinator, Division of Language Services, OAS), [http://www.cslf.gouv.qc.ca/Seminaire/Conferences/MargueriteGroves.doc Information on the use of language at the OAS: multilingualism] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070203222344/http://www.cslf.gouv.qc.ca/Seminaire/Conferences/MargueriteGroves.doc |date=February 3, 2007 }}, ''Inter-American Languages Management Seminar'', [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Quebec)|Conseil supérieur de la langue française]] ([[Quebec]]), [[Quebec City]], 20 to 22 August  2002</ref>

Although a number of other languages have official status in one or more member states of OAS ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] in Suriname; [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] alongside French in Haiti; [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia; [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] in Paraguay), they are not official languages of the Organization.
