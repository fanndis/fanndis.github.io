==History==
===Founding===
The newspaper was founded by an Edinburgh-born printer called [[John Mennons]] in January 1783 as a weekly publication called the ''Glasgow Advertiser''. Mennons' first edition had a global scoop: news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|treaties of Versailles]], reached Mennons via the [[Lord Provost of Glasgow]] just as he was putting the paper together. War had ended with the American colonies, he revealed. ''The Herald'', therefore, is as old as the United States of America, give or take an hour or two.{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=11}}

The story was, however, only carried on the back page. Mennons, using the larger of two fonts available to him, put it in the space reserved for late news.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=xiv}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u5ZQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SzQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5172%2C37000|publisher=Glasgow Advertiser|date=27 January 1783|page=4|title=Glasgow}}</ref>

===First sale and renaming===
In 1802, Mennons sold the newspaper to Benjamin Mathie and Dr James McNayr, former owner of the ''Glasgow Courier'', which along with the ''Mercury'', was one of two papers Mennons had come to Glasgow to challenge.{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=13}} Mennons' son Thomas retained an interest in the company.<ref name="Cowan" /> The new owners changed the name to ''The Herald and Advertiser and Commercial Chronicle'' in 1803. In 1805 the name changed again, this time to ''The Glasgow Herald'' when Thomas Mennons severed his ties to the paper.<ref name="Maclehose">{{Cite book|title = Memoirs and portraits of one hundred Glasgow men who have died during the last thirty years and in their lives did much to make the city what it now is|last = Maclehose|first = James|publisher = James Maclehose & Sons|year = 1886|location = Glasgow|url = http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/mlemen/mlemen073.htm|page=259}}</ref>

===George Outram===
From 1836 to 1964, ''The Glasgow Herald'' was owned by [[George Outram]] & Co.<ref name="Glasgow Almanac">{{cite book | title=Glasgow Almanac: An A–Z of the City and Its People | publisher=Neil Wilson Publishing | author=Terry, Stephen | year=2011 | location=Glasgow | at=Chapter 2, last page}}</ref> becoming the first daily newspaper in Scotland in 1858.<ref name="Glasgow Almanac" /> The company took its name from the paper's editor of 19 years, George Outram, an Edinburgh advocate best known in Glasgow for composing light verse.{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=48}} Outram was an early Scottish nationalist, a member of the [[National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights]]. ''The Glasgow Herald'', under Outram, argued that the promised privileges of the Treaty of Union had failed to materialise and demanded that, for example, that the heir to the British throne be called "Prince Royal of Scotland". "Any man calling himself a Scotsman should enrol in the National Association," said ''The Herald''.{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=49}}

In 1895, the publication moved to a building in Mitchell Street designed by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], which now houses the architecture centre, [[The Lighthouse, Glasgow|The Lighthouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/arts/design/mackintoshs-classic-designs-abound-in-glasgow.html?_r=0|title=Mackintosh's Classic Designs Abound in Glasgow|first=Christopher D.|last=Shea|work=The New York Times|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref> In 1980, the publication moved to offices in Albion Street in Glasgow into the former ''Scottish Daily Express'' building.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is now based in a purpose-built building in Renfield Street, Glasgow.

One of the most traumatic episodes in the history of ''The Glasgow Herald'' was the battle for control and ownership of the paper in 1964.{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=152}} Two millionaires, [[Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander]] and [[Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet]], whose newspaper empire included ''The Glasgow Herald''{{'}}s archrival, ''[[The Scotsman]]'', fought for control of the title for 52 days. Hugh Fraser, 1st Baron Fraser of Allander was to win. The paper's then editor James Holburn was a "disapproving onlooker".{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=157}} The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] condemned the battle as "big business at its worst".{{sfn|Phillips|1983|p=157}}

The newspaper changed its name to ''The Herald'' on 3 February 1992, dropping Glasgow from its title, but not its masthead.{{sfn|Griffiths|1992|p=305}} That same year the title was bought by Caledonia Newspaper Publishing & Glasgow. In 1996 was purchased by [[Scottish Television]] (later called the Scottish Media Group).<ref name="Glasgow Almanac" /> As of 2013, the newspaper along with its related publications, the ''[[Evening Times]]'' and ''[[Sunday Herald]]'', were owned by the [[Newsquest]] media group.<ref name="Glasgow Almanac" />
