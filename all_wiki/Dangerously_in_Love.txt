'''''Dangerously in Love''''' is the debut solo [[studio album]] by American singer [[Beyoncé]]. It was released on June 17, 2003, through [[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]].<ref name="RIAA"/> During the recording of [[Destiny's Child]]'s third studio album ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios, during the hiatus of her then-group Destiny's Child. As executive producer of the album, Beyoncé took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.

The tracks in the album are a mixture of uptempo songs and [[ballad]]s, which are basically [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] songs; it also features elements of [[soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Arabic music]]. Although Beyoncé remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs, its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then-boyfriend and well-known rapper [[Jay-Z]]. ''Dangerously in Love'' received positive reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]] upon its release, with critics praising Knowles' "artistic leap". The album also received numerous accolades, earning Beyoncé five [[Grammy Award]]s at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] on February 8, 2004.

''Dangerously in Love'' reached international commercial success, earning [[music recording sales certification|multi-platinum certifications]] in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 317,000 copies in its first week, earning Beyoncé the highest debut sales among Destiny's Child members' solo albums. ''Dangerously in Love'' has sold over 11 million copies worldwide<ref name="rapfix" /> and produced two US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles–"[[Crazy in Love]]" and "[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)|Baby Boy]]", as well as two top five singles–"[[Me, Myself and I (Beyoncé song)|Me, Myself and I]]" and "[[Naughty Girl (Beyoncé song)|Naughty Girl]]".

==Background and development==
Beyoncé launched her career as lead singer to [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] group [[Destiny's Child]] in the late 1990s. According to Corey Moss of [[MTV News]], "fans are eager to see" how Beyoncé, after years with the group, performs solo.<ref name="1Corey">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Beyoncé: Genuinely In Love – Part 1 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_062703/ |publisher=[[MTV News]].

With different types of music for each member to produce, the albums were not intended to compete on the charts.<ref name="Kaufman">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/destinys_child.jhtml |publisher=MTV News.

Beyoncé also starred in ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]'' and recorded another solo single. In August 2002, she collaborated with boyfriend [[Jay-Z]] as featured vocalist on the song "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]". The single earned Beyoncé credibility and paved the way for the release of ''Dangerously in Love''.<ref name="Kaufman" /><ref name="Louie">{{cite news |last=Louie |first=Rebecca |title=Crazy in love with Beyonce |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2007/08/05/2007-08-05_crazy_in_love_with_beyonce.html |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=Daily News, L.P |date=August 6, 2007|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

Before Beyoncé began recording for ''Dangerously in Love'', she selected the producers with whom she would collaborate. For two days, she held meetings with prospective producers from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] across the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], and had interviews with them.<ref name="Garfield">{{Cite news |last=Garfield |first=Simon |title=Uh-oh!

As she did on ''Survivor'', Beyoncé took a wider role in the production of ''Dangerously in Love'', co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and [[master recording|mastering]] of tracks.<ref name="Thread">{{Cite news |title=Beyoncé's debut Album, Dangerously in Love |url=http://www.thread.co.nz/article/554 |work=Thread |accessdate=May 8, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080329210018/http://www.thread.co.nz/article/554 |archivedate = March 29, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although Beyoncé did not create [[beat (music)|beats]], she came up with [[melody|melodies]] and ideas she shared with the producers. With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album<ref name="1Tyrangiel" />— Beyoncé is credited as co-writer and co-producer,<ref name="2Corey" /> as well as the album's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles.

Beyoncé felt that recording an album without her group mates was "liberating and therapeutic", coming into the studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators.<ref name="Thread" /> The dependency she developed with Destiny's Child, however, meant it was harder "to be on [her] own creatively".<ref name="Thread" /> As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyoncé contacted other artists with a view to forming a collaborative partnership. When the collective finished writing several songs, she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective guest artists. She talked to them by phone for possible collaboration, eventually gaining their approval. Besides Jay-Z, Beyoncé was able to work with [[Jamaica]]n artist [[Sean Paul]], American rapper [[Missy Elliott]], among others. In contrast, some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé, which were eventually produced. Beyoncé also worked with Elliott and [[Timbaland]] on a track titled "Wrapped Around Me", but it ultimately failed to appear on the album.<ref name="Corey7">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458738/20021115/destinys_child.jhtml |title=Beyonce Working It With Missy Elliott On Solo Album – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV News.

''Dangerously in Love'' was originally a [[Dangerously in Love 2|song of the same title]] which Beyoncé had written for ''Survivor''. The song was deemed too sophisticated compared to other songs on ''Survivor'', and the group decided not to release it as a [[single (music)|single]] off the album. After recording several tracks for ''Dangerously in Love'', Beyoncé decided to add "Dangerously in Love", after realizing that it fit the overriding theme of the album.<ref name="TheMaking" /> Since the album's release date was postponed to capitalize on the success of "Dilemma", Beyoncé had been offered the chance to further enhance the album.<ref name="2Corey">{{cite web |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Beyoncé: Genuinely In Love – Part 2 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_062703/index2.jhtml |publisher=MTV News.

This allowed her to record more songs, including the album's lead single, "[[Crazy in Love (Beyoncé song)|Crazy in Love]]". In late 2002, Beyoncé paused working on ''Dangerously in Love'' for a holiday tour with Destiny's Child.<ref name="Corey7" /> With a few weeks left for recording in March 2003, Beyoncé was still collaborating with other guests on the album, including Sean Paul and [[Sean Combs|P.

The creative output of the sessions for ''Dangerously in Love'' left several tracks ready for another album pressing.<ref name="Kaufman" /><ref name="Patel">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484202/20040107/Beyoncé_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonce Puts Off Second Solo LP To Reunite Destiny's Child|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=January 7, 2004|publisher=MTV News.

When "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]" was released as a single in late 2002, critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay-Z were having a mutual affair.<ref name="People">{{cite web |title=Beyoncé: Biography – Part 1 |url=http://www.people.com/people/beyonce_Beyoncé/biography |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref> Despite widespread rumors, they remained silent about their relationship.<ref name="2Corey" /> According to critics, the title itself of the album sounded "more intriguing" with Beyoncé singing personal songs.<ref name="1Corey" /> Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album, "most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship";<ref name="2Corey" /> however, there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship. In the song "Signs", Beyoncé sings about being in love with a Sagittarius,  which coincidentally is Jay-Z's [[zodiac]] sign.<ref name="2Corey" /> In response to the persistent rumors about them, Beyoncé stated, "People can come to whatever conclusion they like... That's the beauty of music... I'm a singer, I'll talk about writing songs all you want. But when it comes to certain personal things any normal person wouldn't tell people they don't know, I just feel like I don't have to [talk about it]."<ref name="2Corey" />

Beyoncé said that ''Dangerously in Love'' is lyrically similar to Destiny's Child's albums. But because she only had to write for herself, Beyoncé had the chance to compose personally deeper songs than her previous records with the group.<ref name="Thread" /> With a theme that is based upon different stages of a romantic relationship, ''Dangerously in Love'' contains songs that speak of love and honesty. In addition, Beyoncé admitted that there are songs about love-making.<ref name="1Tyrangiel" /> The personal content of the album, however, was not generally attributed to Beyoncé's own experiences—although some were based from hers—instead, the theme kept recurring in her mind. Beyoncé later explained: "I wanted to have an album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I'm alive and even after... Love is something that never goes out of style. It's something everybody experiences, and if they are not in love, people usually want to feel that..."<ref name="1Corey" /> While some songs merely focus on the "beauty of love", the album also explores another side of love, with songs that "celebrate breakup" and songs that narrate a woman's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship.<ref name="1Corey" /> The album's hidden track, "Daddy", is a tribute to Beyoncé's father, [[Mathew Knowles]], who fronted Destiny's Child as their manager. The song is an account of Beyoncé wanting her future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father's.<ref name="2Corey" /> Originally, Beyoncé did not intend to include the track in the album, having thought its lyrics would make her appear immature. However, considering it one of the songs that reflected her life at that transitional moment, she instead relegated "Daddy" as the closing track.<ref name="2Tyrangiel">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,460207-2,00.html|title=Destiny's Adult|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|date=June 22, 2003|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=December 21, 2008}}</ref>

Beyoncé said that she had trouble convincing executives at [[Columbia Records]] to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: "In 2003, I had my first solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five.

== Impact and legacy ==
The success of ''Dangerously in Love'' incited the public to infer that it signals Destiny's Child to finally part ways, as had [[pop music|pop]] singer Justin Timberlake "could not go back to [['N Sync]] after tasting solo success".<ref name="Kaufman" /> However, Beyoncé said that their side projects were only "a brief diversion in the juggernaut that has become Destiny's Child".<ref name="AP" /> As time did not permit, Beyoncé's musical aspirations were put on hiatus for her to concentrate on her [[Super Bowl]] performance, wherein she was slated to sing [[The Star-Spangled Banner|the US national anthem]], and the recording of Destiny's Child's fourth album, ''[[Destiny Fulfilled]]'';<ref name="Kaufman" /><ref name="Patel" /> the group finally disbanded in 2006.

After the group's formal disbandment, Beyoncé recorded and released her second album ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' on her twenty-fifth birthday on September 4, 2006. The album gave Beyoncé her second number one in the United States, and its debut week sales exceeded that of ''Dangerously in Love'', the former having sold 541,000 units.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469358/beyonce-notches-4th-billboard-200-no-1-with-4|title=Beyonce Notches 4th Billboard 200 No. 1 with '4'|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=July 6, 2011|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Despite the album's first two singles' average commercial performance—neither of which reached the peak of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]—its "handsome debut" was noted by Keith Caulfield of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as having generated "by goodwill earned from the performance of [Beyoncé's] smash first album ''Dangerously in Love''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/rock-and-pop/lady-gaga-and-beyonce-do-new-singles-soft-1005173762.story|title=Lady Gaga and Beyonce: Do New Singles' Soft Numbers Spell Trouble for Their Albums?|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|date=May 6, 2011|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>
