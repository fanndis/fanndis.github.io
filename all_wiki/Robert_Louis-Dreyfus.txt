Robert Louis-Dreyfus was initially a bad student who failed his [[Baccalauréat]],<ref name='FigMad' /> but he excelled at poker, winning considerable amounts of money from his friends at the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. In 1967, he spent time at a [[kibbutz]] and was involved in the [[Six-Day War]]. He later secured a place at [[Harvard Business School]] with a presentation about his experiences during the war.<ref name=IndObit/> He spent the early years of his working life mentored by [[Siegmund Warburg]], in the family business of the Louis-Dreyfus Group.

== Business career ==
In 1982 Louis-Dreyfus joined [[IMS Health|IMS]], the US pharmaceutical research company enjoying spectacular monetary success. His original {{US$|400,000}} grew twentyfold by the time the company was sold in 1988. He served as CE at [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], the United Kingdom-based [[advertising agency]] from 1989 to 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/904/479395/text/ |title="Mister Adidas" ist tot |publisher=Sueddeutsche.de |accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref> Louis-Dreyfus invested his own money in Saatchi and Saatchi and during his tenure the agency grew considerably.

He proved equally successful when in 1994 he took the top job at [[Adidas]], the German-based sporting goods maker. Louis-Dreyfus added to the brand by streamlining the product line and adding new companies to the group, including the [[Salomon Group|Salomon]] ski-wear and golf company in 1997. He remained CEO of Adidas until 2001, combining this position with chairmanship of [[Neuf Telecom]] with whom he served until 2004. He also served as a director of [[Neuf Cegetel]].

Robert Louis-Dreyfus re-joined the family company, [[Louis-Dreyfus Group]], in May 2000, and restructured this major commodities trading and merchandising firm.

In 2005, he decided to relaunch the [[Le Coq Sportif]] sports company through a Swiss investment company, Airesis.

== Sporting interests ==
In 1996 Louis-Dreyfus became the largest shareholder of [[Olympique de Marseille]], a French [[association football|football]] team who had been rocked by a match fixing scandal and relegated to the French second division. Louis-Dreyfus, with Adidas and the telecommunications company Neuf, sponsored the team; Louis-Dreyfus invested heavily in rebuilding the Marseille squad, marketing the team to the new immigrant populations in Marseille. The financial fortunes of the club improved with shirt sales rocketing. However, success, if judged purely on trophies won, eluded the club despite reaching the final of the [[UEFA Cup]] on two occasions and twice losing in the final of the [[Coupe de France]]. Olympique de Marseille also missed out on the [[Ligue 1]] title during Louis-Dreyfus's tenure, though shortly before his death they finished second to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]] and qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Louis-Dreyfus was also a shareholder in the Belgium football club [[Standard Liege]], and was involved in the creation of Infront Sports & Media in 2002 (transition from the former KirchSport completed in February 2003) acting as the company's chairman of the board. The Swiss-based sports marketing agency was handling the media rights distribution of the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[FIFA World Cup 2002|2002]] and [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006]]. Today it is the marketing partner of 130 sports federations and clubs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== FIFA World Cup bribery scandal ==
In October 2015 the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that the bidding committee for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006]] had set-up a slush fund that Louis-Dreyfus, at the time CEO of Adidas, filled with 10.3 million Swiss francs in 2000. Allegedly these funds were used to bribe FIFA officials and secure Germany's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, whilst a FIFA report had strongly criticised England's 'unprofessional' bid presentation. According to internal FIFA documents, Louis-Dreyfus demanded a repayment of the funds in 2004, which were transferred as €6.7 million via a FIFA account in Geneva to an account held by Louis-Dreyfus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fussball-wm-2006-wurde-mutmasslich-gekauft-a-1057829.html |title=Fifa Fußball-WM 2006 mutmaßlich vom DFB gekauft - SPIEGEL ONLINE |website=Spiegel.de |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>
