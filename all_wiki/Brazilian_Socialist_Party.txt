The '''Brazilian Socialist Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Socialista Brasileiro}}, '''PSB''') is a [[political party]] in [[Brazil]]. It was founded in 1947, before being abolished by the military regime in 1965 and re-organised in 1985 with the re-democratisation of Brazil. It elected six Governors in 2010, becoming the second largest party in number of state governments, behind only [[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|PSDB]]. In addition to that, it won 34 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]<ref name="cham">{{in lang|pt}} [http://g1.globo.com/especiais/eleicoes-2010/noticia/2010/10/saiba-nova-composicao-da-camara.html "Saiba a nova composição da Câmara"].

In 2014 the party went into opposition, advocating greater [[economic stability]], low inflation, high economic growth, [[sustainable development]], and [[social welfare programs]].<ref name="Agência Brasil">{{in lang|pt}} [http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/politica/noticia/2014-06/chapa-unidos-pelo-brasil-oficializa-apoio-eduardo-campos?SL_ClassKey=1 "Chapa Unidos pelo Brasil oficializa apoio a Eduardo Campos"]</ref>

==History==

===The first PSB (1947–1965)===
The name Brazilian Socialist Party or variants had been used by several small [[History of socialism in Brazil|socialist]] parties of brief existence prior to the foundation of PSB on 1947.

PSB has its origins at the end of [[Getúlio Vargas]]' [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] regime, when the Democratic Left (''Esquerda Democrática – ED'') emerged as a faction of the [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (''União Democrática Nacional – UDN'') in 1945.<ref name="His">{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.psbnacional.org.br/index.php/content/view/4155/Histrico.html História do PSB]. Brazilian Socialist Party official website. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103014308/http://www.psbnacional.org.br/index.php/content/view/4155/Histrico.html |date=3 November 2010 }}</ref> Its goals were to combine the social changes of the period with broad civil and political liberties.<ref name="His" /> ED's ideology was based on a broad left-wing concept: it advocated that socialism had to be built gradually and legally, through the defence of democracy and a national identity.<ref name="His" /> In this sense, it differed greatly from other opposition parties, such as UDN, which advocated [[free market]] policies, and the [[Communist Party of Brazil|Communist Party]] (PCB), which advocated the authoritarian socialism of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="His" />

As UDN became increasingly a [[right-wing|right-leaning]] party, binding itself with the [[Brazilian Army]]<ref>{{in lang|pt}} Gaio, André Moysés. [http://www.dhi.uem.br/publicacoesdhi/dialogos/volume01/vol6_mesa2.htm "Affinities Between the National Democratic Union (UDN) and the Brazilian Army"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706161844/http://www.dhi.uem.br/publicacoesdhi/dialogos/volume01/vol6_mesa2.htm# |date=6 July 2011 }}. ''Diálogos''. Maringá State University. Department of History.</ref> and the aspirations of urban middle classes,<ref name="MIA">{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.marxists.org/portugues/dicionario/verbetes/u/uni_demo_nacional.htm "Dicionário Político – União Democrática Nacional (UDN)"]. [[Marxists Internet Archive]]. Reproduced from CPDOC/[[Fundação Getulio Vargas]].</ref> ED's Socialist proposals were extremely at odds with the party, which led to a split and the subsequent foundation of PSB. On 6 August 1947, the Brazilian Socialist Party was founded, maintaining the same program and proposals it had as a faction of the UDN.<ref name="His" /> In its 1947 manifesto, the PSB sought to represent an alternative to the main left-wing parties of that period: Vargas' [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB) and the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] (PCB). PSB opposed the centralism and authoritarianism of Vargas, as well as the rigid labour union structure supported by PTB. They opposed PCB's [[cult of personality]] and radical [[Marxism]], which placed the PSB in the centre-left spectrum, between radical [[Marxism]] and [[social democracy]].

PSB proposed to be a party of "everyone who relies on their own work".<ref name="His" /> It advocated immediate reforms, such as the nationalisation of economically strategic areas, the expansion of workers' rights, the ensuring of [[public health]] and [[public education|education]], and the development of democracy through means of [[public participation|popular participation]].<ref name="His" /> Its structure brought a new experience which characterised PSB's democratic profile: the Base Centres (''núcleos de base'').<ref name="His" /> Through them, Socialist militants could get involved in the party project, discuss national issues and form the orientation and the target of partisan action.<ref name="His" />

In the [[1950 Brazilian presidential election|1950 election]], PSB's candidate, João Mangabeira won only 0.12% of the vote and the PSB elected only one deputy from [[Sergipe]]. At the same time, the PSB approached the PCB, banned in 1947 and operating underground. A number of communists ran for office under the PSB's endorsement.

In the [[1955 Brazilian presidential election|1955 election]], the PSB endorsed the UDN candidate, [[Juarez Távora]]. In [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], the PSB supported the electoral endeavors of [[Jânio Quadros]]: first in the São Paulo mayoral election in 1953 and Quadros' successful bid for Governor in 1954. However, the PSB's support for Quadros, a rather middle-class reformer, split the party, a split which ended with the expulsion of Quadros supporters from the party. In the [[1960 Brazilian presidential election|1960 election]], won by Quadros, the PSB supported the candidacy of [[Teixeira Lott]].

The PSB had limited legislative representation between 1947 and 1964, but in 1962 it elected one Senator, Aurélio Viana defeated the UDN's candidate, Juracy Magalhães in [[Guanabara State]].

The party supported left-wing President [[João Goulart]], who was overthrown by the military in 1964, which later abolished all parties, including the PSB, in 1965. Most Socialists joined the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB), the only opposition party recognised by the military regime.<ref name="His" /> Following the fall of the military in 1985, a number of former PSB members joined the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] or the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] (PT).

===The second PSB===
Following the return to a democracy in the country, a Brazilian Socialist Party was re-organised on the 1947 manifesto. At first, it achieved limited electoral success, though it elected some legislators and mayors. In the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 presidential election]], it supported the PT candidate, [[Luís Inácio Lula da Silva]].

In 1990, [[Pernambuco]] Governor Miguel Arraes joined the party, giving the PSB a certain electoral boost in subsequent elections. In the [[1994 Brazilian general election|1994 election]], the party again endorsed Lula. In the same election, Arraes was re-elected Governor with 54% by the first round, and the PSB elected another governor, João Capiberibe, in [[Amapá]], as well as a Senator in [[Pará]]. The party continued to grow with the adhesion of several officeholders in 1995 and 1996, but it did not endorse the left-wing candidacy of [[Ciro Gomes]] in the 1998 election, preferring to endorse Lula. The same year, Arraes was defeated in Pernambuco but the party gained the governorship of [[Alagoas]].

In 2000, the Governor of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Anthony Garotinho]] joined the PSB following a feud with [[Leonel Brizola]], the leader of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]]. The adhesion of Garotinho caused several members of the PSB to leave the party to join Lula's PT. The PSB supported Garotinho's candidacy in the [[2002 Brazilian presidential election|2002 election]], winning 17.9% in the first round.

However, Garotinho's membership proved a source of controversy and division, notably with President Lula's government. The split was resolved when Garotinho left the party in 2003. The party unofficially supported Lula's re-election in 2006 and won 27 deputies in the [[2006 Brazilian general election|2006 election]]. After that election, the PSB had three Governors: Cid Gomes ([[Ceará]]), Eduardo Campos ([[Pernambuco]]) and [[Wilma de Faria]] ([[Rio Grande do Norte]]).

[[Ciro Gomes]] joined the PSB in 2003, and was expected to be the PSB's candidate in the [[2010 Brazilian general election|2010 election]]; however, the PSB decided not to run a presidential candidate.

The PSB did well overall in the 2010 elections; it picked up 7 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for a total of 34 seats, and regained representation in the Senate, winning 3 Senate seats. While it lost the governorship of Rio Grande do Norte, it easily retained the governorships of Ceará and Pernambuco and also overwhelmingly won the governorship of [[Espírito Santo]]. Following runoffs, it also won the governorships of [[Amapá]], [[Paraíba]], and [[Piauí]], for a total of 6 state governorships.

Despite its socialist name and identity, the PSB was criticised by many on the Brazilian political scene, especially on the left, for its efforts to attract right-wing Brazilian politicians like senator Heraclito Fortes, and to support the candidacy of [[Eduardo Campos]] and, later, [[Marina Silva]]. These positions led many traditional socialists and social-democrats in Brazil to leave the party for more left-wing outfits such as the PSOL and PDT.

In [[2014 Brazilian general election|2014 general elections]], the PSB did not support Rousseff and was part of the [[United for Brazil]] coalition, which supported [[Marina Silva]] as its presidential candidate. The party did well in the legislative elections, electing 34 deputies and 7 senators.

The party later voted in favour of the [[impeachment of Dilma Rousseff]] and formed a coalition government with Brazil's new president, [[Michel Temer]].

In May 2017, the PSB withdrew its support from Temer and went into opposition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/psb-quer-renuncia-de-temer-e-fara-oposicao-diz-secretario-geral.ghtml|title=PSB anuncia oposição ao governo Michel Temer e passa a defender renúncia|work=G1|access-date=2018-06-27|language=pt-BR}}</ref>

In the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 general election]] PSB did not support any candidate (although some members of the party supported [[Ciro Gomes]] of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]]) in the first round; it later endorsed [[Fernando Haddad]] of the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pleno.news/brasil/eleicoes-2018/psb-declara-apoio-a-fernando-haddad-no-segundo-turno.html|title=PSB declara apoio a Fernando Haddad no segundo turno|website=pleno.news|language=pt|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref> The party saw a decrease in support in the parliamentary election, winning 32 deputies and 2 senators. PSB later joined the opposition to [[Jair Bolsonaro]].

On 30 August 2019 the Brazilian Socialist Party withdrew from the [[Foro de São Paulo|Foro de Sao Paulo]], denouncing its support of [[Nicolás Maduro|Nicolas Maduro]]'s presidency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esmaelmorais.com.br/2019/08/psb-aprova-saida-de-foro-de-sao-paulo-e-critica-maduro/|title=PSB aprova saída de Foro de São Paulo e critica Maduro|last=Morais|first=Esmael|date=2019-08-30|website=Blog do Esmael|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>

== International relations ==
Despite being a socialist party, the PSB has never been a member of the Socialist International (position held by the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]]). However, in 2013, it joined the newly formed [[Progressive Alliance]].

In 1991 the party joined the [[Foro de São Paulo|Foro de Sao Paulo]], an association of South American leftist parties which also included the majority of Brazilian left-wing formations ([[Brazilian Communist Party|PCB]], [[Communist Party of Brazil|PCdoB]], [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]], [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|PDT]] and, until 2004, [[Cidadania|PPS]]). However, in 2019 PSB withdrew from the Foro, denouncing its support for the authoritarian regime of [[Nicolás Maduro|Nicolas Maduro]] in [[Venezuela]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esmaelmorais.com.br/2019/08/psb-aprova-saida-de-foro-de-sao-paulo-e-critica-maduro/|title=PSB aprova saída de Foro de São Paulo e critica Maduro|last=Morais|first=Esmael|date=2019-08-30|website=Blog do Esmael|language=pt-BR|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>
