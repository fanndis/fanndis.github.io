==History==
Originally opened in 1912 as ''Vereniging Voor Effectenhandel'' In [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] under the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Dutch East Indies|colonial government]] acting as a branch of ''[[Euronext Amsterdam|Amsterdamse Effectenbeurs]]''. it was re-opened in 1977 after several closures during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. After being reopened in 1977, the exchange was under the management of the newly created Capital Market Supervisory Agency (''Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal'', or Bapepam), which answered to the Ministry of Finance. Trading activity and [[market capitalisation]] grew alongside the development of Indonesia's financial markets and [[private sector]] - highlighted by a major [[market trend#Bull market|bull run]] in 1990. On 13 July 1992, the exchange was privatised under the ownership of Jakarta Exchange Inc. As a result, the functions of Bapepam changed to become the Capital Market Supervisory Agency. On 22 March 1995 JSX launched the Jakarta Automated Trading System (JATS). In September 2007, Jakarta Stock Exchange and Surabaya Stock Exchange merged and named Indonesian Stock Exchange by Indonesian Minister of Finance.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.idx.co.id/en-us/about-idx/history-milestone/|title=Brief history of Indonesia Stock Exchange|website=Indonesia Stock Exchange|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}</ref> The current location of the Indonesian Stock Exchange is located in the IDX building in the Sudirman Central Business District, [[South Jakarta]], near the current site of the [[Pacific Place Jakarta]].

===Merger===
Both Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (SSX) merged to form a new entity "Indonesia Stock Exchange" (''Bursa Efek Indonesia'').<ref name=":0" /> After the merger, the new entity has seven directors.

Currently, there are approximately 30 corporate stocks listed on the JII.<ref>Asean Law Association, Indonesian Legal System, 2004</ref> The [[FTSE Group|FTSE]]/ASEAN Indices were launched by the five [[ASEAN]] exchanges ([[Singapore Exchange]], [[Bursa Malaysia]], The [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]], Jakarta Stock Exchange, and The [[Philippine Stock Exchange]]) and global index provider FTSE on 21 September 2005. The indices, covering the five ASEAN markets, are designed using international standards, free float adjusted, and based on the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] (ICB). The indices comprise FTSE/ASEAN Benchmark Index and FTSE/ASEAN 40 tradable index. The FTSE/ASEAN 40 index is calculated on a real-time basis from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and the closing index is calculated at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. (Singapore time).
