Four passenger [[airliner]]s which had departed from airports in the [[northeastern United States]] bound for [[California]] were [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 al-Qaeda terrorists]]. Two of the planes, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] complex in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|towers collapsed]]. Debris and the resulting fires caused a partial or complete [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex]], including the 47-story [[7 World Trade Center]] tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, [[American Airlines Flight 77]], was crashed into [[the Pentagon]] (the headquarters of the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]) in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], which led to a partial collapse of the building's west side. The fourth plane, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], was initially flown toward [[Washington, D.C.]], but crashed into a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania]], after passengers thwarted the hijackers.

Suspicion quickly fell onto al-Qaeda. The United States responded by launching the [[War on Terror]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invading Afghanistan]] to depose the [[Taliban]], which had failed to comply with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite their leader [[Osama bin Laden]]. Many countries strengthened their [[anti-terrorism legislation]] and expanded the powers of [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] and [[intelligence agencies]] to prevent terrorist attacks.

The destruction of the World Trade Center and nearby infrastructure seriously harmed the economy of New York City and had a significant effect on global markets.

Many [[Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks|closings, evacuations, and cancellations]] followed, out of respect or fear of further attacks.

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to 1979 when the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan]]. Osama bin Laden travelled to [[Afghanistan]] and helped to organize Arab [[mujahideen]] to resist the [[Soviet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[BBC News Online]]|title=Al-Qaeda's origins and links|date=July 20, 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1670089.stm|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> Under the guidance of [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], bin Laden became more radical.{{Sfnp|Gunaratna|2002|pp=23–33}} In 1996, bin Laden issued his first ''[[Fatwa|fatwā]]'', calling for American soldiers to leave [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |title=Bin Laden's fatwā (1996) |publisher=PBS |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011031024057/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html |archivedate=October 31, 2001 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>

In a second ''fatwā'' in 1998, bin Laden outlined his objections to [[Foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]] with respect to [[Israel]], as well as the continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="1998FatwaPBS">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military-jan-june98-fatwa_1998/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128194258/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/military/jan-june98/fatwa_1998.html|archivedate=November 28, 2013 |title=Al Qaeda's Second Fatwa |website=[[PBS NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |url-status=live |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref> Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances were reversed. [[Ulama|Muslim legal scholars]] "have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the [[jihad]] is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries", according to bin Laden.<ref name="1998FatwaPBS" />

In 2004, Bin Laden claimed that the idea of destroying the towers had first occurred to him in 1982, when he witnessed Israel's bombardment of high-rise apartment buildings during the [[1982 Lebanon War]].<ref>Summers and Swan (2011), pp. 211, 506n.</ref><ref>Lawrence (2005), p. 239.</ref> Some analysts, including Mearsheimer and Walt, also claimed that U.S. support of Israel was one motive for the attacks.<ref name=isrsources /><ref name="guardian-20010926" /> In 2004 and 2010, bin Laden again connected the September 11 attacks with U.S. support of Israel, although most of the letter expressed bin Laden's disdain for President Bush and bin Laden's hope to "destroy and bankrupt" the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html%20online%20here|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=August 24, 2016|date=November 4, 2004}}</ref><ref>In his taped broadcast from January 2010, Bin Laden said "Our attacks against you [the United States] will continue as long as U.S. support for Israel continues. ...

Other motives have been suggested in addition to those stated by bin Laden and al-Qaeda. Some authors suggested the "humiliation" that resulted from the Islamic world falling behind the Western world—this discrepancy was rendered especially visible by the globalization trend<ref>Bernard Lewis, 2004. In [[Bernard Lewis]]'s 2004 book ''[[The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror]]'', he argues that animosity toward the West is best understood with the decline of the once powerful [[Ottoman empire]], compounded by the import of western ideas—[[Arab socialism]], [[Liberal movements within Islam|Arab liberalism]] and [[Secularism in the Middle East|Arab secularism]]</ref><ref>In "The spirit of terrorism", [[Jean Baudrillard]] described 9/11 as the first global event that "questions the very process of globalization". {{cite web |url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/baudriterror.htm |title=The spirit of terrorism |last=Baudrillard |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref> and a desire to provoke the U.S. into a broader war against the Islamic world in the hope of motivating more allies to support al-Qaeda. Similarly, others have argued that 9/11 was a strategic move with the objective of provoking America into a war that would incite a [[pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] revolution.<ref>In an essay entitled "Somebody Else's Civil War", [[Michael Scott Doran]] argues the attacks are best understood as part of a religious conflict within the Muslim world and that Bin Laden's followers "consider themselves an island of true believers surrounded by a sea of iniquity". Hoping that U.S. retaliation would unite the faithful against the West, bin Laden sought to spark revolutions in Arab nations and elsewhere. Doran argues the [[Osama bin Laden videos]] attempt to provoke a visceral reaction in the Middle East and ensure that Muslim citizens would react as violently as possible to an increase in U.S. involvement in their region.

Bin Laden provided leadership and financial support, and was involved in selecting participants.{{sfnp|Bergen|2006|p=283}} He initially selected [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], both experienced jihadists who had fought in [[Bosnian war|Bosnia]]. Hazmi and Mihdhar arrived in the United States in mid-January 2000.

There is some idea that 9/11 was selected by the hijackers as the date of the attack because of its resemblance to [[9-1-1]], the phone number to report emergencies in the U.S. However, [[Lawrence Wright]] wrote that the hijackers chose it because September 11, 1683 is when the King of Poland began the [[Battle of Vienna|battle]] that turned back the Muslim armies from the Ottoman Empire that were attempting to capture Vienna. For Osama bin Laden, this was a date when the West gained some dominance over Islam, and by attacking on this date, he hoped to make a step in Islam "winning" the war for worldwide power and influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/05/03/how-jihadists-schedule-terrorist-attacks/|title=How jihadists schedule terrorist attacks|last=Hudson|first=John|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>

===Prior intelligence===
{{Main|September 11 intelligence before the attacks}}
In late 1999, al-Qaeda associate [[Walid bin Attash]] ("Khallad") contacted Mihdhar, telling him to meet him in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia; Hazmi and [[Abu Bara al Yemeni]] would also be in attendance. The [[NSA]] intercepted a telephone call mentioning the meeting, Mihdhar, and the name "Nawaf" (Hazmi). While the agency feared "Something nefarious might be afoot", it took no further action. The CIA had already been alerted by Saudi intelligence about the status of Mihdhar and Hazmi as al-Qaeda members, and a CIA team broke into Mihdhar's [[Dubai]] hotel room and discovered that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. While [[Alec Station]] alerted intelligence agencies worldwide about this fact, it did not share this information with the FBI. The [[Malaysian Special Branch]] observed the January 5, 2000 meeting of the two al-Qaeda members, and informed the CIA that Mihdhar, Hazmi, and Khallad were flying to [[Bangkok]], but the CIA never notified other agencies of this, nor did it ask the [[State Department]] to put Mihdhar on its watchlist. An FBI liaison to Alec Station asked permission to inform the FBI of the meeting but was told: "This is not a matter for the FBI."{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=310–12}}

By late June, senior counter-terrorism official [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] and CIA director [[George Tenet]] were "convinced that a major series of attacks was about to come", although the CIA believed the attacks would likely occur in Saudi Arabia or Israel.{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=235–36}} In early July, Clarke put domestic agencies on "full alert", telling them, "Something really spectacular is going to happen here. soon." He asked the FBI and the State Department to alert the embassies and police departments, and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] to go to "Threat Condition Delta".{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=344}}{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=236–37}} Clarke would later write: "Somewhere in CIA there was information that two known al Qaeda terrorists had come into the United States. Somewhere in FBI there was information that strange things had been going on at flight schools in the United States. . . . They had specific information about individual terrorists from which one could have deduced what was about to happen. None of that information got to me or the White House."{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|pp=242–43}}

On July 13, Tom Wilshire, a CIA agent assigned to the FBI's international terrorism division, emailed his superiors at the CIA's [[Counterterrorism Center]] (CTC) requesting permission to inform the FBI that Hazmi was in the country and that Mihdhar had a U.S. visa. The CIA never responded.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=340}}

The same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and they were not given Mihdhar's date of birth nor passport number.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=340–43}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=352–53}}

Also in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York alerting them to "the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges". The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; "months later", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was "The Big Wedding" and that it involved airplanes.{{sfnp|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}

On August 6, 2001, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief ("PDB"), designated "For the President Only", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S."]] The memo noted that FBI information "indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Osama bin Laden File: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>

In mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI about [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked "suspicious questions". The FBI found that Moussaoui was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his French visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=350–51}}

The failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance to reveal "sensitive sources and methods" such as tapped phones.{{sfnp|Wright|2006|pp=342–43}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the "single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents".{{sfnp|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote: "There were failures in the organizations failures to get information to the right place at the right time."{{sfnp|Clarke|2004|p=238}}

[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]

Early on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]]s and two [[Boeing 767]]s) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in Los Angeles and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in San Francisco) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name="911-ch1" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be full of fuel.<ref name="Chap7" /><!-- weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome? -->

The four flights were:
* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59{{nbsp}}a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the northern facade of the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 8:46{{nbsp}}a.m.
* [[United Airlines Flight 175]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 8:14{{nbsp}}a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of nine and 51 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the southern facade of the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City at 9:03{{nbsp}}a.m.
* [[American Airlines Flight 77]]: a Boeing 757 aircraft, departed Washington Dulles International Airport at 8:20{{nbsp}}a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of six and 53 passengers, not including five hijackers. The hijackers flew the plane into the western facade of the Pentagon in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], at 9:37{{nbsp}}a.m.
* [[United Airlines Flight 93]]: a Boeing 757 aircraft, departed Newark International Airport at 8:42{{nbsp}}a.m.<!-- wasn't it late taking off, which allowed the passengers to hear of the others? --> en route to San Francisco, with a crew of seven and 33 passengers, not including four hijackers. As passengers attempted to subdue the hijackers, the aircraft crashed into a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], at 10:03{{nbsp}}a.m.

[[Media documentation of the September 11 attacks|Media coverage]] was extensive during the attacks and aftermath, beginning moments after the first crash into the World Trade Center.<ref>See, for example, news coverage by CNN: {{cite journal|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/us/2011/09/07/natpkg-911-aircheck-timeline.cnn.html|title=Breaking News Videos from CNN.com}}</ref>

The destruction of all three staircases in the tower when Flight 11 hit made it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact died as well.<ref name="NISTcasualties" />

In the South Tower, one stairwell, [[Stairwell A]], was left intact after Flight 175 hit, allowing 14 people located on the floors of impact (including [[Stanley Praimnath|one man who saw the plane coming at him]]) and four more from the floors above to escape.

In the United States, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was created by the [[Homeland Security Act]] to coordinate domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The [[USA Patriot Act]] gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions.

The FBI was quickly able to identify the hijackers, including leader Mohamed Atta, when his luggage was discovered at Boston's Logan Airport. Atta had been forced to check two of his three bags due to space limitations on the 19-seat commuter flight he took to Boston. Due to a new policy instituted to prevent flight delays, the luggage failed to make it aboard American Airlines Flight 11 as planned. The luggage contained the hijackers' names, assignments, and al-Qaeda connections.

Authorities in the United States and United Kingdom also obtained electronic intercepts, including telephone conversations and electronic bank transfers, which indicate that [[Mohammed Atef]], a bin Laden deputy, was a key figure in the planning of the 9/11 attacks. Intercepts were also obtained that revealed conversations that took place days before September 11 between bin Laden and an associate in [[Pakistan]]. In those conversations, the two referred to "an incident that would take place in America on, or around, September 11" and they discussed potential repercussions. In another conversation with an associate in [[Afghanistan]], bin Laden discussed the "scale and effects of a forthcoming operation."
