The track was written and produced by Swift and Antonoff and is the first song that Swift has written to an existing track.

Featuring heavy synths and percussion, Antonoff described that the song is given an arrangement that combines both 1980s and modern elements. A [[Yamaha DX7]] is used for the 1980s-tinged sounds apparent on most parts of the song, but they are countered with the [[Minimoog Voyager]] during the chorus sections, in which he explained, "That sounds extremely modern to me. It's that back-and-forth."<ref name="USA Today" /> Antonoff also provided backing vocals. He said, "I just chopped this piece of my voice singing and started looping it over and over. Then I started banging on some drums I had in the room and stomping on the floor and sampling all these sounds to make this big bombastic looping beat with the sample on top of it."<ref name="USA Today" /> In an October 2014 interview with [[NPR]], Swift provided a detailed explanation of the lyrics:
<blockquote>
That line is in there because it's not only the actual, literal narration of what happened in a particular relationship I was in, it's also a metaphor. "Hit the brakes too soon" could mean the literal sense of, we got in an accident and we had to deal with the aftermath. But also, the relationship ended sooner than it should've because there was a lot of fear involved. And that song touches on a huge sense of anxiety that was, kind of, coursing through that particular relationship, because we really felt the heat of every single person in the media thinking they could draw up the narrative of what we were going through and debate and speculate. I don't think it's ever going to be easy for me to find love and block out all those screaming voices.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Melissa Block|title='Anything That Connects': A Conversation With Taylor Swift|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/31/359827368/anything-that-connects-a-conversation-with-taylor-swift|publisher=NPR|accessdate=30 January 2015|format=Audio upload and transcript|date=31 October 2014}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
The video starts with the caption "She lost him."  Next, Swift is first seen on the beach barefoot and only wearing a blue dress. She runs through what appears to be enchanted woods that formed around her, chased by a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] who tear at her blue dress as she struggles to escape as some wooden roots constantly follow her. Then she finds herself in different locations representing the four basic elements of nature throughout the video like the snowy mountains, an ocean, a barren landscape, a muddy location, and a burning forest. At the end of the video, the "woods" she was crawling through disappear as she finds a beach, where another version of her is waiting by the shore as she reaches for her. The video ends with the caption "She lost him, but she found herself, and somehow that was everything.", which was part of the secret messages in her song "Clean" in the lyric-booklet of her ''1989'' record.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1976527/taylor-swift-1989-hidden-messages/ | title=Here Are The Secret Messages Taylor Swift Hid On Her '1989' Album | publisher=MTV News | date=October 27, 2014 | accessdate=January 2, 2016}}</ref>
