== History ==

ICICI Bank was established by the '''Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)''', an Indian financial institution, as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1994 in [[Vadodara]]. The parent company was formed in 1955 as a joint-venture of the [[World Bank]], India's public-sector banks and public-sector insurance companies to provide project financing to Indian industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=NOS on ICICI|url=http://www.nos.org/srsec319/319-20.pdf|publisher=NOS org|access-date=5 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322123605/http://www.nos.org/srsec319/319-20.pdf|archive-date=22 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=about ICICI|url=http://www.lloydstsb.com/current_accounts/india_banking_service_faqs.asp|publisher=lloydstsb|access-date=5 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223023101/http://www.lloydstsb.com/current_accounts/india_banking_service_faqs.asp|archive-date=23 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The bank was founded as the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Bank, before it changed its name to ICICI Bank. The parent company was later merged with the bank.

ICICI Bank launched [[Internet Banking]] operations in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/bto/pointofview/pdf/MoIT11_ICICInterview_F.pdf|title=The CEO as CIO: An interview with K.

ICICI's shareholding in ICICI Bank was reduced to 46&nbsp;percent, through a public offering of shares in India in 1998, followed by an equity offering in the form of [[American depositary receipt]]s on the [[NYSE]] in 2000.<ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com">{{cite web|title=ICICI Bank|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/icici-bank-ltd/infocompanyhistory/companyid-9194.cms|publisher=Economic Times}}</ref> ICICI Bank acquired the ''[[Bank of Madura]] Limited'' in an all-stock deal in 2001 and sold additional stakes to institutional investors during 2001–02.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bank of Madura, ICICI Bank merger - a synergy for better service | url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2000/12/28/stories/0628000c.htm|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>

In the 1990s, ICICI transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services group, offering a wide variety of products and services, both directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like ICICI Bank. In 1999, ICICI become the first Indian company and the first bank or a financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICICI Bank _NYSE|url=http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/icici-bank-joins-icic-as-indian-companies-listed-on-the-nyse/|publisher=Mondovisione}}</ref>

In 2008, following the [[2008 financial crisis]], customers rushed to ICICI ATMs and branches in some locations due to rumours of an adverse financial position of ICICI Bank. The Reserve Bank of India issued a clarification on the financial strength of ICICI Bank to dispel the rumours.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICICI Financial Rumours|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rbi-scotches-icici-bank-rumours-govt-says-d/368045/|work=Indian Express}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Inhumane debt recovery methods===

A few years after its rise to prominence in the banking sector, ICICI bank faced allegations on the recovery methods it used against loan payment defaulters. A number of cases were filed against the bank and its employees for using "brutal measures" to recover the money. Most of the allegations were that the bank was using goons to recover the credit card payments and that these "recovery agents" exhibited inappropriately and in some cases, inhuman behaviour. Incidents were reported wherein the defaulters were put to "public shame" by the recovery agents.

The bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the "recovery agents" and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank's employees asking the defaulters to "sell everything in the house including family members", were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported wherein the suicide notes spoke of the bank's recovery methods as the cause of the suicide. This led to legal battles and the bank paying huge compensation.<ref name="RBI warns ICICI Bank on recovery agents">{{cite news|last=PTI|title=RBI warns ICICI Bank on recovery agents|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-11-21/india-business/27978291_1_recovery-agents-icici-bank-private-banks|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=21 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="How to deal with rising abuse of bank recovery agents">{{cite news|last=Sarang|first=Bindisha|title=How to deal with rising abuse of bank recovery agents|url=http://www.firstpost.com/investing/how-to-deal-with-rising-abuse-of-bank-recovery-agents-487476.html|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=first post|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>
