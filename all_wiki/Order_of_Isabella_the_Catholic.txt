The '''Order of Isabella the Catholic''' ({{lang-es|'''Orden de Isabel la Católica'''}}) is a Spanish civil order in which membership is granted in recognition of services that benefit the country.  The Order is not open to Spaniards exclusively, and it has been used to award many foreigners.

The Order was created on 14 March 1815 by [[King Ferdinand VII]] in honor of [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]] with the name of "Royal and American Order of Isabella the Catholic"<ref>''Real y Americana Orden de Isabel la Católica''</ref> with the intent of "rewarding the firm allegiance to Spain and the merits of Spanish citizens and foreigners in good standing with the Nation and especially in those exceptional services provided in pursuit of territories in America and overseas."<ref>"''premiar la lealtad acrisolada a España y los méritos de ciudadanos españoles y extranjeros en bien de la Nación y muy especialmente en aquellos servicios excepcionales prestados en favor de la prosperidad de los territorios americanos y ultramarinos''"</ref>  The Order was reorganized by royal decree on 26 July 1847, as the modern "Royal Order of Isabella the Catholic" with a broader focus than the Americas.

==History==
The Order of Isabel the Catholic was instituted by King Ferdinand VII on 14 March 1815 as the Royal American Order of Isabel the Catholic. The original statutes of the Order were approved by Royal Decree of 24 March, with membership made in three classes: Grand Cross, and Knights of First and Second Class. Ferdinand VII was declared the Order's Founder, Head, and Sovereign. On 7 October 1816, at the suggestion of the Chapter of the Order, the Knights of the first class were renamed Commanders and the second class were renamed Knights.

Under the reign of Isabel II, the four royal orders in existence in Spain at the time: the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of the Languages of Aragon and Castile, the [[Order of Charles III]], and the Order of Isabella the Catholic was reorganised by royal decree of 26 July 1847. The latter was reserved to reward exclusively the services rendered in the Overseas territories. The classes of the order became Knight, Commander, Commander by Number, and Grand Cross. The concession and tests of nobility was suppressed in all the Royal Orders. By royal decree of 28 October 1851, no concessions of Grand Cross of any orders were to be made without the proposal of the [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]] and concessions for the lower classes with the proposal of the Secretary of State.

After the establishment of the First Republic, the Order was declared to be extinguished by Decree of 29 March 1873 as deemed to be incompatible with the Republican Government. Use of the various insignias was allowed to those who possessed them. When King Alfonso XII ascended to the throne, the Order was reestablished by Decree of 7 January 1875.

During the minority of Alfonso XIII, his mother and Regent, Maria Cristina, signed the royal decrees of 15 April 1889 and 25 October 1900. Among other things, they sought to impose entry into the Order by the category of Knight, to prohibit the use of decorations until the corresponding title was obtained, and to ratify the obligation that the Grand Cross be awarded with the agreement of the Council of Ministers and for conferees to be published in the Official Gazette. By Royal Decree of 14 March 1903, the Silver Cross of the Order was created, and by Royal Decree of 15 April 1907, the Silver and Bronze Medals.<!--; The latter, in order to reward the services provided by the troop and seafaring classes and the sub-alternates officers and private servants, on the occasion of His Majesty's travels and the visits of Sovereigns and Heads of State. -->

In Royal Decree 1118, of 22 June 1927, the superior grade of Knights of the Collar was created, to be awarded to prominent personalities of extraordinary merit. It also provides that women can also be decorated with either the ''lazo'' or ''banda''

The Provisional Government of the Republic, by decree of 24 July 1931, abolished all orders under the Ministry of State, except for the Order of Isabella the Catholic. The regulations approved by decree of 10 October 1931 introduced a new degree: Officer (Oficial). By decree of 8 August 1935, it was established that the first degree in the Order of Isabella the Catholic was that of the Grand Cross, the Collar being reserved exclusively for very exceptional cases.

In 1938, General Franco, by decree of 15 June, restored the Order in its traditional meaning: to reward meritorious services rendered to the country by nationals and foreigners. The order's regulations were approved by Decree of 29 September 1938. According to the 1938 regulations, the order consisted of the following grades: Knight of the Collar, Knight Grand Cross, Commander by Number, Commander, Knight, and Silver Cross. Decree 1353/1971, of 5 June, re-incorporated the rank of Officer, placing it between the grades of Knight and Commander. Thus, the Order consisted of the following grades: Knight of the Collar, Knight of the Grand Cross, ''Banda de Dama'' (denomination of the Grand Cross when granted to ladies), Commander by Number, Commander, Officer, Knight, ''Lazo de Dama'' (the degree of Knight when it is granted to ladies), and Cruz de Plata.

The order's current regulations date from 1998 as approved by Royal Decree 2395/1998, of 6 November. Among its provisions, the categories of ''Banda de Dama'', ''Cruz de Caballero'' and ''Lazo de Dama'' were repealed to avoid possible interpretations of there being gender discrimination. Notwithstanding this, for aesthetic and functional reasons, the ladies who are decorated use reduced versions of the insignia of each degree of the Order.

Women appointed to an applicable grade are not called Knights (''Caballeros''). Women are instead appointed as Dames of the Collar (''Damas del Collar''), Dames Grand Cross (''Damas Gran Cruz'') or Dame's Cross (''Cruz de Damas'').<ref name="RD2395/1998"/>

==Order decoration==
The decoration is a red-enameled cross, with a golden frame.  The outer peaks are fitted with small gold balls.  The center of the medallion contains the inscription "''A La Lealtad Acrisolada''" (To Proven Loyalty) and "''Por Isabel la Católica''" (For Isabella the Catholic) on white enamel.  Above the cross is a green enameled laurel wreath with the band ring.

The ribbon is yellow with a white central stripe,<ref>[http://www.medals.org.uk/spain/spain010.htm Spain: Order of Isabella the Catholic]</ref> except the "Collar", the wearing of which can be replaced by a gold-yellow sash with white stripes on the edges.
