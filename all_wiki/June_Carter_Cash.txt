Prior to her marriage to Cash, she was professionally known as '''June Carter''' and occasionally was still credited as such after her marriage (as well as on songwriting credits predating it).

She played guitar, [[banjo]], harmonica, and [[autoharp]], and acted in several films and television shows. Carter Cash won five [[Grammy Award]]s and was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| year = 2009 | title = Awards|url= http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm | publisher= Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum | accessdate = April 15, 2013 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515174455/http://hallmuseum.com/9awards.htm|archivedate = May 15, 2012}}</ref> 

==Early life==
June Carter Cash was born Valerie June Carter in [[Maces Spring, Virginia]], to [[Maybelle Carter]] and [[Ezra Carter]]. Her parents were country music performers and she performed with the Carter Family from the age of 10, in 1939. In March 1943, when the Carter Family trio stopped recording together at the end of the [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] contract, Maybelle Carter, with encouragement from her husband Ezra, formed "[[The Carter Sisters|Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters]]" with her daughters, [[Helen Carter|Helen]], [[Anita Carter|Anita]], and June. The new group first aired on radio station [[WRNL]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on June 1. Doc (Addington) and Carl (McConnell)—Maybelle's brother and cousin, respectively, known as "The Virginia Boys", joined them in late 1945. June, then 16, was a co-announcer with Ken Allyn and did the commercials on the radio shows for Red Star Flour, Martha White, and [[Thalhimers|Thalhimers Department Store]], just to name a few.<ref name="JUNE CARTER CASH BIOGRAPHY">{{Citation | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | title = Artists | contribution = June Carter Cash | type = biography | publisher = CMT}}</ref> For the next year, the Carters and Doc and Carl did show dates within driving range of Richmond, through [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. She attended John Marshall High School during this period.<ref>{{cite web | title = Walk the line, drive the road |url= http://www.virginia.org/WalktheLineDrivetheRoad/|publisher = Virginia}}</ref> June later said she had to work harder at her music than her sisters, but she had her own special talent—comedy.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bufwack | first = Mary | year = 1998 | contribution = Carter Sisters | title = The Encyclopedia of Country Music | editor-first = Paul | editor-last = Kingsbury | place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 85}}</ref> A highlight of the road shows was her "Aunt Polly" comedy routine. With her thin and lanky frame, June Carter often played a comedic foil during the group's performances alongside other Opry stars [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Carl McConnell wrote in his memoirs that June was "a natural-born clown, if there ever was one." Decades later, Carter revived Aunt Polly for the 1976 TV series ''Johnny Cash & Friends''. 

After Doc and Carl dropped out of the music business in late 1946, Maybelle and her daughters moved to [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman's]] "Old Dominion Barn Dance" on the WRVA Richmond station. After a while there, they moved to WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee, where they met [[Chet Atkins]] with Homer and Jethro.

In 1949, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with their lead guitarist, Atkins, were living in [[Springfield, Missouri]], and performing regularly at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]]. Ezra "Eck" Carter, Maybelle's husband and manager of the group, declined numerous offers from the [[Grand Ole Opry]] to move the act to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], because the Opry would not permit Atkins to accompany the group onstage. Atkins' reputation as a guitar player had begun to spread, and studio musicians were fearful that he would displace them as a 'first-call' player if he came to Nashville. Finally, in 1950, Opry management relented and the group, along with Atkins, became part of the Opry company. Here the family befriended [[Hank Williams]] and [[Elvis Presley]] (to whom they were distantly related), and June met Johnny Cash.

June and her sisters, with mother Maybelle and aunt Sara joining in from time to time, reclaimed the name "The Carter Family" for their act during the 1960s and '70s.

==Career highlights==
While June Carter Cash may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |contribution=June |title=Johnny Cash.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813152000/http://www.johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |archivedate=August 13, 2008 }}</ref> Director [[Elia Kazan]] saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting. She studied with [[Lee Strasberg]] and [[Sanford Meisner]] at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in New York. Her acting roles included Mrs. "Momma" Dewey in [[Robert Duvall]]'s 1998 movie ''[[The Apostle]]'', Sister Ruth, wife to Johnny Cash's character Kid Cole, on ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'' (1993–97), and Clarise on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in 1957. June was also Momma James in ''[[The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lapostexaminer.com/jesse-james-part-2-dad-especially-mom/2014/08/05 |title=Jesse James: Dad and especially mom (Part 2) |first=Stephen |last=Goode |date=5 August 2014 |access-date=7 February 2019 |work=Los Angeles Post-Examiner}}</ref> She also acted in occasional comedy skits for various Johnny Cash TV programs.

As a singer, she had both a solo career and a career singing with first her family and later her husband. As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s such as "Jukebox Blues" and, with her exaggerated breaths, the comedic hit "No Swallerin' Place" by Frank Loesser. June also recorded "The Heel" in the 1960s along with many other songs.

In the early 1960s, June Carter wrote the song "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter [[Merle Kilgore]]. June wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Johnny Cash and she offered the song to her sister Anita. [[Anita Carter]] was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Johnny recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup, and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music.

Her first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on "[[It Ain't Me Babe]]", a [[Bob Dylan]] composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album ''[[Orange Blossom Special (album)|Orange Blossom Special]]''. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of "[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]", which was followed by a collaboration album, ''[[Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter]]''. All these releases antedated her marriage to Cash (upon which event she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash). She continued to work with Cash on record and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' from 1969-1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After ''Carryin' On'', June Carter Cash recorded one more direct collaboration album, ''[[Johnny Cash and His Woman]]'', released in 1973, and along with her daughters was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album ''[[The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me]]''. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, ''[[Return to the Promised Land]]''

Although she provided vocals on many recordings, and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, ''[[Appalachian Pride]]'', released in 1975, ''[[Press On]]'' (1999), and ''[[Wildwood Flower (album)|Wildwood Flower]]'', released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, [[John Carter Cash]]. ''Appalachian Pride'' is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while ''Press On'' is notable for featuring June Carter Cash singing her original arrangement of "Ring of Fire".

One of her final appearances was a nonspeaking/nonsinging appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT Flameworthy]] awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend.

She won a Grammy award in 1999 for, ''Press On''. Her last album, ''Wildwood Flower'', won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in [[Hiltons, Virginia]], on September 18–20, 2002. The songs on the album include "Big Yellow Peaches", "Sinking in the Lonesome Sea", "Temptation", and the trademark staple "[[Wildwood Flower]]". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when ''[[Out Among the Stars]]'' was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals.

Her autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, ''From the Heart'', almost 10 years later.<ref name = "mtv" />
