'''Prairie Chapel Ranch''' is a 1,583-[[acre]] (6.4&nbsp;km²) [[Estate (house)|ranch]] in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[McLennan County, Texas|McLennan County]], [[Texas]], located {{convert|7|mi|km}} northwest of [[Crawford, Texas|Crawford]] (about {{convert|25|mi|km}} from [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]). The property was acquired by [[George W. Bush]] in 1999 and was known as the [[Western White House]] during his presidency. Bush spent vacation time at the house, where he also entertained visiting dignitaries from around the world. The ranch received its name from the Prairie Chapel School which was built nearby on land donated by mid-19th century [[Germans|German]] immigrant Heinrich Engelbrecht from [[Stemwede|Oppenwehe]], [[Germany]], who owned the land that now comprises the Bush ranch. Engelbrecht also donated land for the nearby Canaan Baptist Church (the "Prairie Chapel").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prairiechapel.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Ranch-usgs-bush.jpg|thumb|250px|USGS aerial photograph of the ranch before Bush built his house. The elongated objects at the top are hog barns (on Mill Road). They were demolished and the drive extended to build Bush's house. He enlarged the lake on the upper right. In the lower right are more hog barns and the original Englebrecht house which is now called the "Governor's House." All of the lower barns except one were demolished. At the top is the Middle Bosque River. Prairie Chapel Road ends at the intersection in the lower-left corner and becomes Rainey Road.]]
Engelbrecht and his heirs raised turkeys and hogs. The original Engelbrecht ranch house is about {{Convert|4400|ft|m}} from the main house on Rainey Road and is now called the "Governor's House" and is used to accommodate overflow guests. The Bushes stayed in the house during construction of the new house.

In 1999, a year before he became President, shortly after earning a $14.3 million profit from the sale of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], then-[[Texas Governor]] Bush bought the land for an estimated $1.3 million from the Engelbrecht family. Assisting Bush in arrangements for the purchase was the then [[Texas Secretary of State]] [[Elton Bomer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherrigreen.com/W's%20ranch.htm|title=W's Ranch|publisher=sherrigreen.com|accessdate=June 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307074731/http://www.sherrigreen.com/W's%20ranch.htm|archive-date=2012-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bush removed five large hog barns on Mill Road leading into the compound in order to construct a new house, guest house, and garage.<ref>[http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=4516 CINDY SHEEHAN Guide to Bush Ranch - ntimc.org - Posted August 7, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419024724/http://www.ntimc.org/newswire.php?story_id=4516 |date=April 19, 2012}}.</ref>

On May 10, 2008, the ranch played host to the wedding of [[Jenna Bush Hager|Jenna Bush]] to Henry Hager, a son of former Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, [[John H. Hager]]. The ceremony was relatively simple and was attended by some two hundred friends and family members.

==House and grounds==

===House===
[[David Heymann]], then an associate professor of architecture at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], designed the four-bedroom,<ref name=autogenerated1>"Reporter's Notebook; Creatures and Creature Comforts at the President's Ranch," ''New York Times'', August 10, 2006</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday.com/news/washington/2001-04-13-bush-house.htm|title='Texas White House' a refuge from stress|work=USA Today|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref> {{convert|4,000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} honey-colored native [[limestone]] single-level home with painted white galvanized [[tin]] roof manufactured and installed on the site. Heymann said the house was built from the less sought after portion of the local "Lueders limestone". The middle portion of each block of stone has a cream color, while the edges are multicolored. "We bought all this throwaway stone. It's fabulous. It's got great color and it is relatively inexpensive," Heymann said.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In addition there is an open {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} limestone porch that encircles the house. The house was built by Byron Bottoms Builder from nearby [[Elm Mott, Texas]], and wasn't completed until after Bush's inauguration because of needed accommodations for security, meeting space, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cowboysindians.com/articles/archives/1202/bush.html |title=The Telegraph Blog |work=Cowboys and Indians Magazine |accessdate=9 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319062017/http://www.cowboysindians.com/articles/archives/1202/bush.html |archivedate=19 March 2006 }}</ref>

Laura Bush said they decided to keep a single level ranch design because "We wanted our older parents to feel comfortable here... We also want to grow old here ourselves."<ref name=autogenerated2 />

The passive-solar house is positioned to absorb winter sunlight, warming the interior walkways and walls of the residence. [[Geothermal power|Geothermal]] [[heat pump]]s circulate water through pipes buried {{convert|300|ft|m}}) deep in the ground. A {{convert|25,000|USgal|m3|adj=on}} underground [[cistern]] collects rainwater gathered from roof urns; wastewater from sinks, toilets, and showers cascades into underground purifying tanks and is also funneled into the cistern. The water from the cistern is then used to irrigate the landscaping around the home.

The one-story, eight-room, ground-level house runs east and west. There are no stairs, even at entrances. There are no thresholds. For the most part, the house is one room wide, making for easy ventilation. The porch is the usual route from one room to another. A few rooms have interior doors.

"Every room has a relationship with something in the landscape that's different from the room next door," Heymann says. "Each of the rooms feels like a slightly different place." In the guest bathroom, for example, when you look up from the sink, you look out on an oak tree rather than into a mirror, which is on a side wall.

"There’s a great grove of oak trees to the west that protects it from the late afternoon sun," Heymann says. "Then there is a view out to the north looking at hills, and to the east out over a lake, and the view to the south running out to beautiful hills."

Heymann says most of the rooms are relatively small and have high ceilings. The living-family room and the kitchen-dining room in the east end of the house are large, laid out for frequent entertaining and family gatherings. The living room has a series of glass picture doors. The tin roof of the house extends beyond the porch. When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.

The Bushes installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, which uses about 25% of the electricity that traditional heating and air-conditioning systems consume. Several holes were drilled {{convert|300|ft|m}} deep, where the temperature is a constant {{convert|67|°F|°C}}. Pipes connected to a heat pump inside the house circulate water into the ground, then back up and through the house, heating it in winter and cooling it in summer. The water for the outdoor pool is heated with the same system, which proved so efficient that initial plans to install solar energy panels were cancelled.

===Other structures===
In addition to the house there is a guest house and a garage in separate buildings to the southwest of the main house.

The facility includes a helicopter hangar which has been used as an auditorium on the rare occasions when the former president has held a press conference at the ranch.

In 2002, the ranch was wired for what Bush described in a 2003 tour of the ranch as "real time, secure videoconferencing" to be used for his briefings from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and other secured communications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/30/AR2008123002845.html |title=Bush's Time at Ranch in Crawford, Tex., Coming to Quiet End |last=Hernandez |first=Nelson |date=2008-12-31 |language=en-US |access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref>

Overnight visitors stay in the main house, its associated guest house, the original Englebrecht farmhouse, or in a five-bedroom three-bath [[mobile home]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />

News reporters stayed in hotels in [[Waco]]. Press conferences that didn't involve the President were conducted in the gymnasium of Crawford Middle School, {{convert|10|mi|km}} away from the ranch. The barn often seen behind TV correspondents during their live reports was actually on private property behind the school.

===Grounds===
[[File:President George Bush and 2005 Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong take a ride together.jpg|thumb|President Bush and [[Lance Armstrong]] on grounds in 2005]]
The land includes seven canyons and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} of frontage along [[Rainey Creek]] and the Middle [[Bosque River]]. In August 2001 while touring the canyons with reporters Bush noted that the [[Juniperus ashei|cedars]] in the canyons would be a good nesting ground for the endangered [[golden-cheeked warbler]] although the warblers have not actually been seen on the compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2889/is_35_37/ai_79087395|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>

Bush added an {{Convert|11|acre|adj=on}} man-made pond that he stocked with 600 [[largemouth bass]] and 30,000 bait fish. There are also [[bluegill]] and red ear sunfish. The pond has a maximum depth of {{Convert|17|ft|m}}. In May 2006, when asked to name the best moment in his administration, Bush jokingly said: "I would say the best moment was when I caught a {{convert|7+1/2|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=sqbr}} largemouth bass on my lake."<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002979449_bushfish08.html "Best moment as president was catching a largemouth bass, Bush says," ''Seattle Times'', May 8, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807150647/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002979449_bushfish08.html |date=August 7, 2007}}</ref>

At the urging of his daughters, Bush also built a swimming pool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0814/p1s3-uspo.html|title=No grocery, $5 haircuts - and the Bush ranch|first=Francine|last=Kiefer|date=14 August 2001|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref> over the objections of Heymann who thought it would interrupt the stark views. Bush referred to it as "the whining pool"—whine long enough and you get it. It offers a respite from the hot Texas summers, and is heated by the same geothermal system as the house is during the winter.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

==Activities==
A prized souvenir from the ranch is a gray Under Armour athletic shirt emblazoned with a Texas star encircled by the words ''The President's 100-Degree Club.'' In order to qualify a visitor must run {{Convert|3|mi|km}}, or bike for 10, when the thermometer hits triple digits.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

When he was president, Bush used the ranch for vacations, meetings, and entertaining foreign dignitaries. In the less formal setting, dress code for meetings called for an open collar and no tie. Guests were typically treated to meals of [[Cuisine of the Southwestern United States|Southwestern cuisine]]. When not holding meetings or briefings, Bush spent his time mountain biking, jogging, fishing, bird hunting, and clearing brush.

Bush made clear his preference for spending some time away from his official residence at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, DC]]. In 2001, he said, "I think it is so important for a president to spend some time away from Washington, in the heartland of America."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/07/20010730-7.html|title=Videotaped Remarks by the President for Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree|publisher=|accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>

==Security considerations==
The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had a full-time {{convert|3|nmi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} [[Prohibited airspace|no fly zone]], designated "Prohibited Area 49" (P-49), around the ranch during the Bush Presidency. When President Bush was in residence at the ranch, a [[Temporary Flight Restriction]] was issued, expanding the radius to {{convert|10|nmi|km}}, with lesser restrictions extending to {{convert|30|nmi|km}}, containing some exceptions for [[Waco Regional Airport]] nearby. The size of the restricted area P-49<ref>Federal Register [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/03/31/2010-7242/revision-of-prohibited-area-p-49-crawford-tx "Revision of Prohibited Area P-49; Crawford, TX"], Published March 30, 2010. Retrieved on 12 September, 2018.</ref> was reduced in June, 2010 to a {{convert|2|nmi|km|spell=in|adj=on}} radius up to an altitude of 2,000 feet, which is still in effect.

Bush normally flew in and out of [[TSTC Waco Airport]] (the former Connally Air Force Base that is now owned by [[Texas State Technical College System|Texas State Technical College]]) on [[Air Force One]], and was shuttled on [[Marine One]] to the ranch.

==Future of the ranch==

At the close of the Bush presidency, the Bushes purchased a home in [[Dallas]]. Laura Bush confirmed that they would make that their permanent residence, while spending weekends and holidays at the ranch.
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' quoted an unnamed White House official: "They'll have their place in Crawford. He just loves it."
