==History==

The station was founded in 1951 as '''WSOK'''. WSOK's original format was rhythm and blues and [[urban gospel]] music. WSOK was the first station in the Nashville market to program primarily to the city's [[African-American]] community. After a change in ownership in 1957, the call letters were changed to '''WVOL''', but the station continued its focus on the local African-American community.

In 1980, The Phoenix Communication Group acquired WVOL. The station dropped live programming and affiliated with [[Satellite Music Network]] in 1988. The network, impressed with the station, launched a format based on WVOL's sound. WVOL aired satellite-fed programming until 1993. Around that time, the station was sold to Dickey Brothers Broadcasting.<ref>[http://wvol1470.net/page.php?page_id=6192 WVOL history page]</ref>

In a transaction that closed in April 2000, WVOL was purchased by John Heidelberg, an African-American [[entrepreneur]] who was a former employee of both WVOL and [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], from Dickey Brothers Broadcasting in exchange for cash and an FM construction permit that would later become WRQQ (now [[WLVU (FM)|WLVU]]). WVOL's format was [[urban gospel]] during the day, and [[jazz]] overnight. In 1970, when Heidelberg was acting program director of WVOL, he was the first person to employ [[Oprah Winfrey]], then a local high school student, as a broadcaster. Eventually becoming a news anchor on WVOL, Winfrey later launched her TV career as an anchor with [[WTVF|WLAC-TV]] in Nashville, before becoming an iconic national [[talk show]] host.

WVOL switched to its current format of [[urban adult contemporary]], [[urban oldies]] and [[Talk radio|talk shows]] in March 2001.

In March 2011, WVOL suffered $1 million in damage when vandals cut the transmission lines to all six of the station's towers.<ref>http://www.radio-info.com/news/vandals-cause-1-million-damage-to-tennessee-radio-station</ref>
