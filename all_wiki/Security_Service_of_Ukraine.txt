{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''Security Service of Ukraine''' ({{lang-ua|Служба безпеки України (СБУ)}}; ''Sluzhba bezpeky Ukrayiny'') or '''SBU''' is [[Ukraine]]'s law-enforcement authority and main government [[security agency]] in the areas of counterintelligence activity and combating terrorism.

==Duties and responsibilities==
The Security Service of Ukraine is vested, within its competence defined by law, with the protection of national sovereignty, constitutional order, territorial integrity, economical, scientific, technical, and defense potential of Ukraine, legal interests of the state, and civil rights, from intelligence and subversion activities of foreign special services and from unlawful interference attempted by certain organizations, groups and individuals, as well with ensuring the protection of state secrets.<ref name=SBU-Objectives/>

Other duties include combating crimes that endanger the peace and security of mankind, terrorism, corruption, and organized criminal activities in the sphere of management and economy, as well as other unlawful acts immediately threatening Ukraine's vital interests.

==Organization==
The general structure and operational methods of SBU appear to be very similar to that of its predecessor (KGB of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]) with exception of Ukrainian Border Guards and department responsible for security of high-rank state officials. Both of them became independent institutions. However the SBU keeps under control special operation units [[Alpha Group (Ukraine)|Alpha]] with bases in every Ukrainian province. According to British political expert [[Taras Kuzio]] the organizational structure of SBU remains to be as bloated in size as the Soviet Ukrainian KGB because the total number of active officers as high as 30,000. It is six times larger than British domestic [[MI5]] and external [[MI6]] combined together.<ref name=kuzio>{{cite book |last=Kuzio|first=Taras|date=2015 |title= Ukraine.

==History==
===[[Ukrainian People's Republic]]/[[Ukrainian State]]===
On 14 January 1918 the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] founded its Security Services.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/>

In May 1918 the Department of the State Guard of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the [[Ukrainian State]] started to form a new intelligence service.<ref name="969SecSevUkr">{{in lang|uk}} [https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/28969341.html Ukrainian intelligence services. Victory and defeat of the last century], [[Radio Svoboda]] (14 January 2018)</ref> This was a much more effective agency than its predecessor due to the incorporation of former employees of [[Okhrana]] (the secret police force  of the [[Russian Empire]]).<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> After the fall of the Ukrainian State and the return of power of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) in December 1918, the new UNR authorities destroyed virtually all of the state infrastructure of the Ukrainian State.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> Therefore, the new secret services founded in January 1919 (with two divisions - domestic and foreign) had to start practically from scratch.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/><ref name="SecSevUkrnev">{{in lang|uk}} [https://m.dt.ua/HISTORY/nevidimiy-front-specsluzhbi-chasiv-ukrayinskoyi-revolyuciyi-_.html "Invisible Front": Special Forces of the Times of the Ukrainian Revolution], m.dt.ua (November 26, 2018)</ref> It never became as well lead, nor successful, as the security services of the Ukrainian State.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/><ref name="SecSevUkrnev"/> The security services of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] on the other hand were well-organized.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> The West Ukrainian People's Republic were formed in March 1919 as the Field Gendarmerie of the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] (it also served as [[military police]]).<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> There was no cooperation between the West Ukrainian People's Republic and Ukrainian People's Republic security services.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/>

In 1924 former (April–July 1919) head of intelligence of the Ukrainian People's Republic [[Mykola Chebotarov]] started intelligence work on his own initiative for the Ukrainian People's Republic [[government in exile]] on the territory of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].<ref name="cle1mw8t8html"/>

===Soviet era===
The All-Ukrainian Cheka was formed on December 3, 1918 in [[Kursk]]<ref name=vuchk/> on the initiative from [[Yakov Sverdlov]] and [[Lenin]]'s orders. The commission was formed on the decree of the Provisional Workers' Peasant Government of the Ukrainian SSR and later adopted on May 30, 1919 by the [[Central Executive Committee (Ukraine)|All Ukrainian Central Executive Committee]]. To support the Soviet government in Ukraine in Moscow was formed a corps of special assignment with 24,500 soldiers as part of the All-Ukrainian Cheka. In spring 1919 there was created the Council in fight against counterrevolution and consisted of [[Adolph Joffe]], [[Stanislav Kosior]], and [[Martin Latsis]]. In its early years the security agency fought against the "kulak-nationalistic banditry"<ref name=Lek-AUCEC/> (peasants who resisted having their land confiscated and being forced into collective farms). On August 19, 1920 the All Ukrainian Cheka arrested all members of the [[All Ukrainian Conference of Mensheviks]] after accusing them in counterrevolution.<ref name=Day100819/> On December 10, 1934 the State Political Directorate of Ukraine was dissolved, becoming part of the NKVD of Ukraine.<ref name=vuchk/>

===1990s–2005===
[[Image:Будинок Губернської Земської управи.JPG|thumb|270px|right|SSU Headquarters in [[Kyiv]]]]

The SBU is a successor of the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]'s Branch of the Soviet [[KGB]], keeping the majority of its 1990s personnel.<ref name=wpusbfrs/> Many of whom came from the [[KGB#Directorates|KGB's 5th directorate]].<ref name=wpusbfrs>{{cite news |last=Sishkin |first=Phillip |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-spy-games-are-sabotaging-ukraines-intelligence-agency-1426127401 |title=How Russian Spy Games Are Sabotaging Ukraine’s Intelligence Agency |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=11 March 2015 |access-date=19 October 2020 |archive-date=2017-05-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519154556/https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-spy-games-are-sabotaging-ukraines-intelligence-agency-1426127401}}</ref> It was created in September 1991 following the August 1991 [[independence of Ukraine]].<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> The last  Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's Branch head Colonel-General [[Nikolai Golushko]] stayed on as chairman of the newly formed Security Service of Ukraine for four months before moving to [[Russia]].<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/> (Golushko headed the Russian [[Federal Counterintelligence Service]] in Golushko in 1993 and 1994.<ref name="969SecSevUkr"/>)

Since 1992, the agency has been competing in [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] functions with the [[Chief directorate of intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine|intelligence branch of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense]]. Despite this, a former Military Intelligence Chief and career [[GRU]] technological espionage expert, [[Ihor Smeshko]], served as an SBU chief until 2005.

According to [[Taras Kuzio]] during the 1990s in some regions of Ukraine (Donetsk) the SBU teamed up with local criminals taking part in privatization of state property (so-called ''prykhvatizatsiya'') ignoring its operational objectives and sky-rocketing level of local violence. A notorious incident took place in December 1995 in Western Ukraine when a local citizen Yuriy Mozola was arrested by SBU agents, interrogated and brutally tortured for three days. He refused to confess in trumped up murder charges and died in SBU custody. Later it turned out that the real killer was [[Anatoly Onoprienko]]. He was arrested the next year.<ref name=kuzio/>

Reports of SBU involvement in arms sales abroad began appearing regularly in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].<ref name=wpusbfrs/> Ukrainian authorities have acknowledged these sales and arrested some alleged participants.<ref name=wpusbfrs/>

In 2004, the SBU's Intelligence Department was reorganized into an independent agency called [[Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine]]. It is responsible for all kinds of intelligence as well as for external security. As of 2004, the exact functions of the new service, and respective responsibilities of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine]] were not regulated yet. On November 7, 2005 the President of Ukraine created the Ukraine State Service of special communications and protection of information, also known as Derzhspetszvyazok (StateSpecCom) in place of one of the departments of SBU and making it an autonomous agency. The SBU subsumed the Directorate of State Protection of Ukraine ({{lang-uk|Управління державної охорони України}}), the personal protection agency for the most senior government officials, which was the former Ninth Directorate of the Ukrainian KGB.

The SBU's State Directorate of Personal Protection is known for its former Major [[Mykola Mel'nychenko]], the [[communications protection]] agent in President [[Leonid Kuchma]]'s [[bodyguard]] team. Mel'nychenko was the central figure of the [[Cassette Scandal]] (2000)—one of the main events in Ukraine's post-independence history. SBU became involved in the case when Mel'nychenko accused Leonid Derkach, SBU Chief at the time, of several crimes, e.g., of clandestine relations with [[Russian mafia]] leader [[Semyon Mogilevich]]. However, the UDO was subsumed into the SBU after the scandal, so Mel'nychenko himself has never been an SBU agent.

Later, the SBU played a significant role in the [[Criminal procedure|investigation]] of the [[Georgiy R. Gongadze|Georgiy Gongadze]] murder case,<ref name=UP050630/> the crime that caused the [[Cassette Scandal]] itself.

In 2004, General Valeriy Kravchenko, SBU's intelligence representative in Germany, publicly accused his agency of political involvement, including overseas spying on Ukrainian [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] politicians and German TV journalists. He was fired without returning home. After a half-year of hiding in Germany, Kravchenko returned to Ukraine and surrendered in October 2004 (an investigation is underway).

Later, the agency commanders became involved in the scandal around the [[poison]]ing of [[Viktor Yushchenko]]—a main candidate in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]. Yushchenko felt unwell soon after supper with SBU Chief Ihor Smeshko, at the home of Smeshko's first deputy. However, neither the politician himself nor the investigators have ever directly accused these officers. It is also important to note that the Personal Protection department has been officially responsible for Yushchenko's personal security since he became a candidate. During the [[Orange Revolution]], several SBU veterans and [[cadet]]s publicly supported him as president-elect, while the agency as a whole remained neutral.

===2005–2010===
In 2005, soon after the elections, sacked SBU Chief Smeshko and other intelligence agents stated their own version of the revolution's events. They claimed to have prevented [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|militsiya]] from violently suppressing the protests, contradicting the orders of President Kuchma and threatening ''militsiya'' with armed involvement of SBU's [[special forces]] units. This story was first described by the American journalist C.J. Chivers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and has never been supported with documents or legally.

The SBU is widely suspected of illegal [[surveillance]] and [[eavesdropping]] of offices and phones.

An episode of human rights abuse by SBU happened during the case of [[serial killer]] [[Anatoly Onoprienko]]. Yuriy Mozola, an initial suspect in the investigation, died in SBU custody in [[Lviv]] as a result of [[torture]]. Several agents were convicted in the case.<ref name=UNHCR090717/> The SBU remains a political controversial subject in Ukrainian politics.<ref name=IFUA081226/>

===2010–2014===
The former Security Service of Ukraine Head [[Valeriy Khoroshkovsky]] was involved in several controversies during his tenure. The rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv [[Borys Gudziak]] heavily criticized a visit from the SBU, forcing Khoroshkovskiy to apologize. Later the head of the Kyiv Bureau of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], [[Nico Lange]], was detained for a short while and released only after several high-ranking officials from the ''[[German Chancellery]]'' vouched for him. The Security Service described the incident as a misunderstanding.<ref>Cicero. Berlin. August 2019 p. 38 (in german)</ref> 
Khoroshkovskiy, as the Chairman of the SBU, eliminated the main competition of Ukrainian TV-giant ''[[Inter (TV channel)|Inter]]'',{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} officially owned by his wife Olena Khoroshkovskiy, in the face of ''[[TVI (channel)|TVi]]'' and ''[[5 Kanal (Ukraine)|Channel 5]]''. In July 2010, Konrad Schuller of the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' wrote that Khoroshkovskiy had connections with [[RosUkrEnergo]].<ref name=Unian100720/><ref name=FAZ100719/><ref name=FAZ100714/> The most important source of Khoroshkovskiy's{{clarify|date=December 2014}} came from RosUkrEnergo.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The President's spokesperson, [[Hanna Herman]], in an interview with this newspaper, did not dispute that [[Dmytro Firtash]] was one of the sponsors of the Presidential [[Party of Regions]], with the help of which Khoroshkovskiy was appointed to the position of the State Security chairman. Khoroshkovskiy denied any connections to RosUkrEnergo. However it is a fact{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} that Firtash possesses certain privileges in Inter. Schuller also stated that the SBU acts in direct association with RosUkrEnergo, arresting their main opponents (see [[RosUkrEnergo#RosUkrEnergo no more middleman between Gazprom and Naftohaz Ukrainy|RosUkrEnergo]]) in order to recover their invested money in the recent{{which|date=November 2014}} presidential campaign. Khoroshkovskiy having declined to give an interview to ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', Schuller posted a quote from one of his other interviews:
{{cquote|''All my experience until now indicates that I am a patriot. ... I see through economic intrigues, crime, know methods of money laundering, banks that illegally exchange currency. ... My knowledge is much wider than most of those who work here.''}}

When [[Ministry of Finance (Ukraine)|Minister of Finance]] Fedir Yaroshenko resigned on January 18, 2012, Khoroshkovsky replaced him in the post on the same day.<ref name=KP120119-Khor/> Khoroshkovsky is also the owner of [[U.A. Inter Media Group]] which owns major shares in various [[Television in Ukraine|Ukrainian TV channels]] including [[Inter TV]].<ref name=KP100612/> 238 members of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted for Khoroshkovsky, however the head of the parliamentary committee for the National Security and Defense [[Anatoliy Hrytsenko]] stated that the committee accepted the decision to recommend [[Verkhovna Rada]] to deny the candidature of Khoroshkovskiy on the post of the chairman of Security Service of Ukraine.<ref name=Unian100311/>

Khoroshkovskiy said the SBU's main duty was to protect the president rather than the interests of Ukraine. On July 26, 2010 it arrested an internet blogger, producing a warrant for his arrest the next day. SBU accused the blogger of threatening the [[President of Ukraine]], citing his comment "May thunder strike Yanukovych!"; he was released after a short discussion.<ref name=Glav100802/> However, SBU showed a rather passive reaction to the statements of the Russian state official who claimed that [[Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol]] belong to the [[Russian Federation]].<ref name=GR100722/> [[Protest group]] [[FEMEN]] said that after [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|the early 2010 election]] of [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] the SBU attempted to intimidate the FEMEN activists.<ref name=FEMENHell/>

On May 22, 2012 Volodymyr Rokytskyi, Deputy Head of the SBU, was photographed in public wearing a $32,000 [[luxury goods|luxury]] [[wristwatch]] despite the fact that its price amounts to his yearly official income. The instance happened at a joint Ukrainian-American event dedicated to fighting the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].<ref name=UP120523/>

The SBU uncovered seven spies and 16 special service agents in 2009.<ref name=IFU091230/>

A large number of arrests and searches occurred in 2011.<ref name=EP120111/>

===2014–present===
In February 2014, numerous documents, hard drives, and flash drives, including data on over 22,000 officers and informants, were stolen or destroyed in a raid on the SBU allegedly ordered by President [[Viktor Yanukovych]].<ref name=Mash141230/>

Late February 2014 opposition MP [[Hennadiy Moskal]] released papers that showed the SBU had allegedly infiltrated the late 2013-February 2014 anti-government [[Euromaidan]] protest.<ref name="usbbbc28214">[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26368479 Ukraine: Security services 'infiltrated protest groups'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423173806/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26368479 |date=2016-04-23 }}, [[BBC News]] (28 February 2014)</ref> According to [[BBC Ukrainian|BBC Ukraine]] analyst [[Olexiy Solohubenko]] many tactics discussed in the paper had indeed been performed.<ref name="usbbbc28214"/>

After the overthrow of Yanukovich in the February [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] the new SBU head [[Valentyn Nalyvaichenko]] claimed to have found his new office building empty, saying "the agency’s former leadership had all fled to [[Russia]] or [[Crimea]]. There were no operative files, no weapons. Institutionally, the place was totally destroyed".<ref name="voausb26715">[http://m.voanews.com/a/2877981.html Ex-Ukrainian Spy Chief: Russian Camps Spreading Chaos], [[Voice of America]] (26 July 2015)</ref> Nalyvaichenko also claimed that at that time the agency was heavily infiltrated by Russian spies.<ref name="voausb26715"/> Indeed,  Nalyvaichenko predecessor [[Oleksandr Yakymenko (politician)|Oleksandr Yakymenko]] with about 15 former SBU top officials surfaced in Russia a few days later.<ref name=Mash141230/> Allegedly in the months following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution thousands of Ukrainian spies switched sides and began reporting to Russia during the [[2014 Crimean crisis]] and the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|pro-Russian unrest]] in [[East Ukraine|east]] and [[south Ukraine]].<ref name=Mash141230/> At the end of 2014 235 SBU agents, including the former counterintelligence chief and his cousin, and hundreds of other operatives had been arrested and 25 high treason probes against Yanukovych-era SBU officials had been launched; also all regional directors had been changed, as well as half of their deputies.<ref name=Mash141230/> In July 2015 Nalyvaichenko claimed “There’s no longer a total infiltration of Russian agents. The danger is no longer widespread”.<ref name="voausb26715"/> The arrested agents were replaced by new recruits from [[western Ukraine]], many of them in their early twenties.<ref name=Mash141230/> To test loyalty, all SBU agents are subjected to recurrent interrogations and [[lie detector]] tests.<ref name=Mash141230/>

In June 2015, the ''[[Kyiv Post]]'' reported that a deputy chief of the SBU, Vitaly Malikov, had supported events leading to the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].<ref name=KP150628/> According to February 2016 official figures of the [[Ukrainian parliament]]ary  Committee on National Security, after Russia's annexation 10% of SBU personnel left Crimea.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/02/8/7098237/ After the annexation left only 10% of staff SBU] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209094509/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2016/02/8/7098237/ |date=2016-02-09 }}, [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (8 February 2016)</ref> According to the SBU itself (in November 2017) 13% did so.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/11/7/7160923/ After the annexation, only 217 SBU officers went to the mainland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108035802/http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/11/7/7160923/ |date=2017-11-08 }}, [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (7 November 2017)</ref>

In December 21, 2017, two Ukrainian civil servants were arrested by the SBU for spying on behalf of Russia, one of them being an SBU employee while the other, Stanislav Yezhov, worked for various cabinet ministers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sharkov |first=Damian |url=https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-two-russian-spies-arrested-double-agents-inside-kievs-own-ranks-755504 |title=Ukraine Arrests Two 'Russian Spies' as Double Agents Inside Kiev's Ranks |date=21 December 2017 |access-date=19 October 2020}}</ref>
