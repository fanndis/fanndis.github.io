The '''''Berliner Zeitung''''' ({{IPA-de|bɛʁˈliːnɐ ˈtsaɪtʊŋ|lang}}, ''Berlin Newspaper'') is a daily newspaper based in [[Berlin]], Germany. It was founded in [[East Germany]] in 1945 and continued publication after [[Reunification of Germany|reunification]].

==History and profile==
''Berliner Zeitung'' was first published on 21 May 1945 in [[East Berlin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stalin's Drive to the West, 1938-1945: The Origins of the Cold War|year=1995|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|page=122|url=https://www.questia.com/read/34690120/stalin-s-drive-to-the-west-1938-1945-the-origins|author=R. C. Raack|accessdate=14 October 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref> The paper, a [[center-left]] daily, is published by [[Berliner Verlag]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the paper was bought by [[Gruner + Jahr]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. Gruner + Jahr later became sole owners and relaunched it in 1997 with a completely new design. A stated goal was to turn the ''Berliner Zeitung'' into "Germany's ''[[Washington Post]]''". The daily says its journalists come "from east and west", and it styles itself as a "young, modern and dynamic" paper for the whole of [[Germany]]. It is the only East German paper to achieve national prominence since [[German reunification|reunification]].<ref name=cw13>{{cite journal|last=Wilder|first=Charly|title=Digitizing the GDR: East German Papers Offer Glimpse of History|journal=Der Spiegel|date=27 June 2013|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/east-german-newspapers-digitized-and-posted-online-a-908216.html|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> In 2003, the ''Berliner'' was Berlin's largest subscription newspaper—the weekend edition sells approximately 207,800 copies, with a readership of 468,000. The current editor-in-chief is [[Brigitte Fehrle]].

Gruner + Jahr decided to leave the newspaper business and sold the ''Berliner Zeitung'' in 2002 to the publishing group [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Georg von Holtzbrinck]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual report 2002|url=http://www.bertelsmann.com/media/investor-relations/annual-reports/annual-report-2002.pdf|work=Bertelsmann|accessdate=3 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503155651/http://www.bertelsmann.com/media/investor-relations/annual-reports/annual-report-2002.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> This sale was blocked by the German antitrust authorities since Holtzbrinck already owned another major Berlin newspaper, ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''. The ''Berliner Zeitung'' was then sold in the fall of 2005 for an estimated 150–180 million euros to the British company [[Mecom Group]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Helen Pidd|title=Montgomery axes 30 journalists at German paper Berliner Zeitung|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/24/pressandpublishing.mediabusiness|accessdate=3 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503161110/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/24/pressandpublishing.mediabusiness|archive-date=3 May 2015}}</ref> and the American company [[Veronis Suhler Stevenson]]. The employees criticized this sale vehemently, fearing that journalistic quality could suffer as a result of excessive profit expectations by Mecom boss [[David Montgomery (newspaper executive)|David Montgomery]].

The ''Berliner Zeitung'' was the first German newspaper to fall under the control of foreign investors.<ref>Brooks (2005)</ref> [[Andrew Marr]], former editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', which like the ''Berliner Zeitung'' was taken over by David Montgomery, said of the ''Berliner Zeitung'' that "[a]nyone who was working at ''The Independent'' in the mid to late Nineties will find all this wearisomely familiar. David's obsession at that time was removing as much traditional reporting as possible from the paper and turning it into a [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]]-style [[scandal sheet]] for [[yuppies]]."<ref>As quoted in a [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/david-montgomery-they-never-saw-him-coming-481099.html 2006 article] ''The Independent'' (Elkins and Burrell 2006).</ref>

On 23 March 2009, it was announced that the Berliner Verlag would be sold by Mecom to the publisher M. DuMont Schauberg (MDS) in Cologne. The price was about 152 million Euro. Mecom was forced to sell its publishing interests in Germany as well as Norway because of heavy debts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0508/politik/0068/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210184237/http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/0508/politik/0068/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 February 2013|title=Die Kölner können kommen|work=Berliner Zeitung|date=23 March 2009|language=de|accessdate=11 May 2009}}</ref>

[[Holger Friedrich]] and his wife Silke bought the Berliner Verlag in September 2019 from M. DuMont Schaumberg. This company published beside Berliner Zeitung also [[Berliner Kurier]] and [[Berliner Abendblatt]].<ref>https://kress.de/news/detail/beitrag/143584-berliner-verleger-silke-und-holger-friedrich-wir-sind-branchenfremd-aber-sehen-das-als-chance.html</ref> Friedrich wrote in the first number after he bought Berliner Zeitung, that their vision was to make politics and society more interesting again.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://meedia.de/2019/11/08/berliner-zeitung-neu-eigentuemer-silke-und-holger-friedrich-setzen-erste-akzente/|title=“Berliner Zeitung”: Neu-Eigentümer Silke und Holger Friedrich setzen erste Akzente|publisher=[[Meedia]]|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>
