== Definition ==
Although human trafficking can occur at local or domestic levels, it has international implications, as recognized by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the ''Trafficking Protocol'' or the ''Palermo Protocol''), an international agreement under the UN [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (CTOC) which entered into force on 25 December 2003. The protocol is one of three which supplement the CTOC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html |title=Convention on Transnational Organized Crime |publisher=Unodc.org |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> The ''Trafficking Protocol'' is the first global, legally binding instrument on trafficking in over half a century, and the only one with an agreed-upon definition of trafficking in persons. One of its purposes is to facilitate international cooperation in investigating and prosecuting such trafficking. Another is to protect and assist human trafficking's victims with full respect for their rights as established in the [[UDHR|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The ''Trafficking Protocol'', which had 117 signatories and as of November, 2018 173 parties,<ref name="treaties.un.org">{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-a&chapter=18&lang=en%7ctitle=UNTC%7cwork=un.org%7ctitle=UNTC%7cwork=un.org|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}</ref> defines human trafficking as:
{{quote|(a) [...] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having [[Abusive power and control|control]] over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation or the [[prostitution]] of others or other forms of [[sexual exploitation]], [[unfree labour|forced labour]] or services, [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the [[Organ harvesting|removal, manipulation or implantation of organs]];<br />
(b) The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this article shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used;<br />
(c) The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered "trafficking in persons" even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in sub-paragraph (a) of this article;<br />
(d) "Child" shall mean any person under eighteen years of age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf |title=United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime And The Protocols Thereto |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref>}}

==Usage of the term==
[[File:Human Trafficking petition hand in (5592456228).jpg|thumb|Human trafficking activists at [[10 Downing Street]], London]]
Trafficked people are held against their will through acts of coercion, and forced to work for or provide services to the trafficker or others. The work or services may include anything from bonded or forced labour to commercial sexual exploitation.<ref name="Unodcvhhhorg" /><ref name="Amnesty.org.au"/> The arrangement may be structured as a work contract, but with no or low payment, or on terms which are highly exploitative. Sometimes the arrangement is structured as [[debt bondage]], with the victim not being permitted or able to pay off the debt.

'''[[Bonded labor|Bonded labour]]''', or [[debt bondage]], is probably the least known form of labour trafficking today, and yet is the most widely used method of enslaving people. Victims become "bonded" when their labour, the labour which they themselves hired and the tangible goods they have bought are demanded as a means of repayment for a loan or service whose terms and conditions have not been defined, or where the value of the victims' services is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt. Generally, the value of their work is greater than the original sum of money "borrowed".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/fact_labor.pdf|title=Labor trafficking fact sheet|work=National Human Trafficking Resource Center|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527205216/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/trafficking/about/fact_labor.pdf|archive-date=27 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

'''[[Forced labor|Forced labour]]''' is a situation in which people are forced to work against their will under the threat of violence or some other form of punishment; their freedom is restricted and a degree of ownership is exerted. Men and women are at risk of being trafficked for unskilled work, which globally generates US$31 billion according to the [[International Labour Organization]].<ref>"A global alliance against forced labour", ILO, 11 May 2005.</ref> Forms of forced labour can include domestic servitude, agricultural labour, [[sweatshop|sweatshop factory labour]], janitorial, food service and other service industry labour, and begging.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Some of the products that can be produced by forced labour are: clothing, cocoa, bricks, coffee, cotton, and gold.<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Ryan|title=13 Products Most Likely to Be Made By Child or Forced Labor|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/18/child-labor-products_n_798601.html#s210960title=13_Carpets|work=Huffington Post|access-date=8 October 2013|date=18 December 2010}}</ref>

The [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM), the single largest global provider of services to victims of trafficking, reports receiving an increasing number of cases in which victims were subjected to forced labour. A 2012 study observes that "… 2010 was particularly notable as the first year in which IOM assisted more victims of labour trafficking than those who had been trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iom.int/files/live/sites/iom/files/What-We-Do/docs/Annual_Report_2011_Counter_Trafficking.pdf|title=Counter-Trafficking and Assistance to Vulnerable Migrants, Annual Report of activities 2011|location=Geneva|work=International Organization for Migration}}</ref> The IOMs' main focus is "to provide secure, reliable, flexible and cost-effective services for persons who require international migration assistance. To enhance the humane and orderly management of migration and the effective respect for the human rights of migrations in accordance with international law. To offer advice, research, technical cooperation and operational assistance to States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders, in order to build national capacities and facilitate international, regional and bilateral cooperation on migration matters..."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/mission|title=Mission|date=2014-07-08|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}</ref>

'''[[Child labour]]''' is a form of work that may be hazardous to the physical, mental, spiritual, moral, or social development of children and can interfere with their education. According to the International Labour Organization, the global number of children involved in child labour has fallen during the past decade{{snd}}it has declined by one third, from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million children in 2012.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/child-labour/lang--en/index.htm#a2|title=Child Labour|website=www.ilo.org}}</ref> Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the highest incidence of child labour, while the largest numbers of child-workers are found in Asia and the Pacific.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

The [[UN Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) has further assisted many [[non-governmental organizations]] in their fight against human trafficking. The 2006 armed conflict in [[Lebanon]], which saw 300,000 domestic workers from [[Sri Lanka]], [[Ethiopia]] and the [[Philippines]] jobless and targets of traffickers, led to an emergency information campaign with NGO Caritas Migrant to raise human-trafficking awareness. Additionally, an April 2006 report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, helped to identify 127 countries of origin, 98 transit countries and 137 destination countries for human trafficking. To date, it is the second most frequently downloaded UNODC report. Continuing into 2007, UNODC supported initiatives like the Community Vigilance project along the border between [[India]] and [[Nepal]], as well as provided subsidy for NGO trafficking prevention campaigns in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/prevention.html?ref=menuside |title=Preventing Human Trafficking |publisher=Unodc.org |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref>

The Global Report recorded victims of 137 different nationalities detected in 142 countries between 2012 and 2016, during which period, 500 different flows were identified. Around half of all trafficking took place within the same region with 42 per cent occurring within national borders. One exception is the Middle East, where most detected victims are East and South Asians. Trafficking victims from East Asia have been detected in more than 64 countries, making them the most geographically dispersed group around the world. There are significant regional differences in the detected forms of exploitation. Countries in Africa and in Asia generally intercept more cases of trafficking for forced labour, while sexual exploitation is somewhat more frequently found in Europe and in the Americas. Additionally, trafficking for organ removal was detected in 16 countries around the world. The Report raises concerns about low conviction rates{{snd}} 16 per cent of reporting countries did not record a single conviction for trafficking in persons between 2007 and 2010.

===Council of Europe===
On 3 May 2005, the Committee of Ministers adopted the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] (CETS No. 197).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/197.htm |title=Council of Europe – Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 197) |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref> The Convention was opened for signature in [[Warsaw]] on 16 May 2005 on the occasion of the 3rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe. On 24 October 2007, the Convention received its tenth ratification thereby triggering the process whereby it entered into force on 1 February 2008. As of June 2017, the Convention has been ratified by 47 states (including Belarus, a non-Council of Europe state), with Russia being the only state to not have ratified (nor signed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures?p_auth=Gn9RcCwG|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}</ref>

While other international instruments already exist in this field, the Council of Europe Convention, the first European treaty in this field, is a comprehensive treaty focusing mainly on the protection of victims of trafficking and the safeguard of their rights. It also aims to prevent trafficking and to prosecute traffickers. In addition, the Convention provides for the setting up of an effective and independent monitoring mechanism capable of controlling the implementation of the obligations contained in the Convention.

The Convention is not restricted to Council of Europe member states; non-member states and the European Union also have the possibility of becoming Party to the Convention. In 2013, [[Belarus]] became the first non-Council of Europe member state to accede to the Convention.<ref name="conventions.coe.int">{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=197&CM=8&DF=24/10/2005&CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=coe.int}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/default_en.asp|title=Action against Trafficking in Human Beings|work=coe.int}}</ref>

The Convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the Convention through country reports. As of 1 March 2013, GRETA has published 17 country reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/trafficking/Docs/Publications/default_en.asp |title=Council of Europe – Action against Trafficking in Human Beings: Publications |access-date=2 March 2012}}</ref>

Complementary protection against [[sex trafficking]] of children is ensured through the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] (signed in [[Lanzarote]], 25 October 2007). The Convention entered into force on 1 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/QueVoulezVous.asp?NT=201&CM=1&CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=coe.int}}</ref> As of November 2020, the Convention has been ratified by 47 states, with Ireland having signed but not yet ratified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/201/signatures|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}</ref>

===Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe===
{{Main|Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe}}

In 2003, the OSCE established an anti-trafficking mechanism aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against human trafficking are coordinated by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe#Human dimension (third dimension)|Office of the Special Representative for Combating the Traffic of Human Beings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/cthb |title=Combating Trafficking in Human Beings – Secretariat – Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings |publisher=Osce.org |date=3 October 2011 |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref> In January 2010, [[Maria Grazia Giammarinaro]] became the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings. Dr. Giammarinaro (Italy) has been a judge at the Criminal Court of Rome since 1991. She served from 2006 until 2009 in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security in Brussels, where she was responsible for work to combat human trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, as well as for penal aspects of [[illegal immigration]] within the unit dealing with the fight against organized crime. During this time, she co-ordinated the Group of Experts on Trafficking in Human Beings of the European Commission. From 2001 to 2006 she was a judge for preliminary investigation in the Criminal Court of Rome. Prior to that, from 1996 she was Head of the Legislative Office and Adviser to the Minister for Equal Opportunities. From 2006 to December 2009, the office was headed by [[Eva Biaudet]], a former Member of Parliament and Minister of Health and Social Services in her native Finland.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The activities of the Office of the Special Representative range from training law enforcement agencies to tackle human trafficking to promoting policies aimed at rooting out corruption and organised crime. The Special Representative also visits countries and can, on their request, support the formation and implementation of their anti-trafficking policies. In other cases the Special Representative provides advice regarding implementation of the decisions on human trafficking, and assists governments, ministers and officials to achieve their stated goals of tackling human trafficking.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===India===
[[File:Preity Zinta at ACT (Against Child Trafficking) (2).jpg|thumb|Preity Zinta at ACT (Against Child Trafficking) (2)]]
In India, the trafficking in persons for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriages and domestic servitude is considered an organized crime. The Government of India applies the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013, active from 3 February 2013, as well as Section 370 and 370A IPC, which defines human trafficking and "provides stringent punishment for human trafficking; trafficking of children for exploitation in any form including physical exploitation; or any form of sexual exploitation, slavery, servitude or the forced removal of organs." Additionally, a Regional Task Force implements the SAARC Convention on the prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children.<ref name="Port">{{cite web|title=Launching of Web Portal on Anti Human Trafficking|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=104002|website=Print Release Print Press Information Bureau Government of India Ministry of Home Affairs|publisher=Government of India|access-date=15 December 2014|date=20 February 2014}}</ref>

Shri R.P.N. Singh, India's Minister of State for Home Affairs, launched a government web portal, the Anti Human Trafficking Portal, on 20 February 2014. The official statement explained that the objective of the on-line resource is for the "sharing of information across all stakeholders, States/UTs[<nowiki />[[Union Territories]]<nowiki />] and civil society organizations for effective implementation of Anti Human Trafficking measures."<ref name="Port" /> The key aims of the portal are:

* Aid in the tracking of cases with inter-state ramifications.
* Provide comprehensive information on legislation, statistics, court judgements, United Nations Conventions, details of trafficked people and traffickers and rescue success stories.
* Provide connection to "Trackchild", the National Portal on Missing Children that is operational in many states.<ref name="Port" />

Also on 20 February, the Indian government announced the implementation of a Comprehensive Scheme that involves the establishment of Integrated Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in 335 vulnerable police districts throughout India, as well as capacity building that includes training for police, prosecutors and judiciary. As of the announcement, 225 Integrated AHTUs had been made operational, while 100 more AHTUs were proposed for the forthcoming financial year.<ref name="Port" />

===Singapore===
As of 2016, Singapore acceded to the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol and affirmed on 28 September 2015, the commitment to combat people trafficking, especially women and children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mha.gov.sg/Newsroom/press-releases/Pages/Singapore-Accedes-to-the-United-Nations-Trafficking-in-Persons-Protocol.aspx|title=Singapore Accedes to the United Nations Trafficking in Persons Protocol|website=Ministry of Home Affairs|publisher=Singapore Inter-Agency Taskforce on Trafficking in Persons|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303154607/https://www.mha.gov.sg/Newsroom/press-releases/Pages/Singapore-Accedes-to-the-United-Nations-Trafficking-in-Persons-Protocol.aspx|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=20 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Singapore appears to be a popular destination for human trafficking with women and girls from India, Thailand, the Philippines and China.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Department Of State.

According to the latest US Government’s Trafficking in Person’s Report from 2018, Singapore is making significant efforts to eliminate human trafficking as it imposes strong sentences against convicted traffickers, improve freedom of movement for adult victims and increases migrant workers’ awareness of their rights. However, it still does not meet the minimum standards as numerous migrant workers’ work conditions indicate labor trafficking, but conviction is not secured.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Refugees |first1=United Nations High Commissioner for |title=2018 Trafficking in Persons Report - Singapore |url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/5b3e0a8a4.html |website=Refworld |publisher=United States Department of State |access-date=19 May 2020 |language=en}}</ref>
In November 2019, a couple of Indian nationals were convicted for exploiting migrant women, making it the first conviction in the state. This conviction showed that Singapore decided to take strong actions against human trafficking.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore vows 'strong' action on labor trafficking after first conviction |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-singapore-labour-trafficking/singapore-vows-strong-action-on-labor-trafficking-after-first-conviction-idUSKBN1XT1M0 |work=Reuters |date=19 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

===The Anti-trafficking Policy Index===
The '3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index' measured the effectiveness of government policies to fight human trafficking based on an evaluation of policy requirements prescribed by the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (2000).<ref>Cho, Seo-Young, Axel Dreher, and Eric Neumayer. "The Spread of Anti-trafficking Policies-Evidence from a New Index." Available at SSRN 1776842 (2011).</ref>

The policy level was evaluated using a five-point scale, where a score of five indicates the best policy practice, while score 1 is the worst. This scale was used to analyze the main three anti-trafficking policy areas: (i) prosecuting (criminalizing) traffickers, (ii) protecting victims, and (iii) preventing the crime of human trafficking. Each sub-index of prosecution, protection and prevention was aggregated to the overall index with an unweighted sum, with the overall index ranging from a score of 3 (worst) to 15 (best). It is available for up to 177 countries annually for 2000 to 2015 (the 2015 report, published in 2016, is the last as of 26.11.2018).

In 2015, three countries demonstrated the highest possible rankings in policies for all three dimensions (overall score 15). These countries were Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom. There were four countries with a near perfect score of 14 (Belgium, Philippines, Armenia, and South Korea). Four more scored 13 points, including the USA. The worst score, the minimum possible, is 3. In addition to North Korea, Libya, Syria, Eritrea and the BES Islands scored 3 with both Iran and Russia scoring only 4 (along with Kiribati, Yemen, and Equatorial Guinea).{{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=Assertions prior this point are as of 2015, and are unsupported by a cite of a source dated 2015 or later.}} For more information view the Human Trafficking Research and Measurement website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.human-trafficking-research.org |title=Human-trafficking-research.org |publisher=Human-trafficking-research.org |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref>

=== Vulnerable groups ===
''Trafficking in Persons Report'' released in June 2016 states that "refugees and migrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals; religious minorities; people with disabilities; and those who are stateless" are the most at-risk for human trafficking.

Traffickers in children may take advantage of the parents' extreme poverty. Parents may sell children to traffickers in order to pay off debts or gain income, or they may be deceived concerning the prospects of training and a better life for their children.

The [[International Labour Organization]] claims that forced labour in the sex industry affects 4.5 million people worldwide.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm|title=Forced labour, human trafficking and slavery|work=ilo.org}}</ref> Most victims find themselves in coercive or abusive situations from which escape is both difficult and dangerous.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siddharth Kara|title=Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2009}}</ref>

Trafficking for sexual exploitation was formerly thought of as the organized movement of people, usually women, between countries and within countries for sex work with the use of physical coercion, deception and bondage through forced debt. However, the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000]] (US),<ref name="State.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312050500/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 March 2009 |title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 |publisher=State.gov |access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> does not require movement for the offence. The issue becomes contentious when the element of coercion is removed from the definition to incorporate facilitation of consensual involvement in prostitution. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] incorporated trafficking for sexual exploitation but did not require those committing the offence to use coercion, deception or force, so that it also includes any person who enters the UK to carry out sex work with consent as having been "trafficked."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf |title=Colla UK_Sarah_final |publisher=Gaatw.net |access-date=22 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304151334/http://www.gaatw.net/Collateral%20Damage_Final/CollateralDamage_UK.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In addition, any minor involved in a commercial sex act in the US while under the age of 18 qualifies as a trafficking victim, even if no force, fraud or coercion is involved, under the definition of "Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons" in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.<ref name="State.gov"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chapman-Schmidt|first=Ben|date=2019-04-29|title='Sex Trafficking' as Epistemic Violence|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/384|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=12|pages=172–187|doi=10.14197/atr.2012191211|issn=2287-0113}}</ref>

Trafficked women and children are often promised work in the domestic or service industry, but instead are sometimes taken to [[brothel]]s where they are required to undertake [[sex work]], while their passports and other identification papers are confiscated. They may be beaten or locked up and promised their freedom only after earning&nbsp;– through prostitution&nbsp;– their purchase price, as well as their travel and visa costs.<ref>Migration Information Programme.

A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml|title=BBC – Ethics – Forced Marriages: Introduction|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> ''Servile marriage'' is defined as a marriage involving a person being sold, transferred or inherited into that marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/21-40/rip32.html|title=Forced and servile marriage in the context of human trafficking|work=aic.gov.au}}</ref> According to [[ECPAT]], "Child trafficking for forced marriage is simply another manifestation of trafficking and is not restricted to particular nationalities or countries".<ref name="ecpat.org.uk"/>

A forced marriage can qualify as a form of human trafficking in certain situations and certain countries, such as China and its Southeast Asian neighbours from which many women are moved to China, sometimes through promises of work, and forced to marry Chinese men. Whether such practices constitute exploitation and should be considered as trafficking is doubtful: ethnographic research with women from Myanmar<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Re-evaluating Palermo: The case of Burmese women as Chinese brides|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/92/112|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121546}}</ref> and Cambodia<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://un-act.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Final_UN-ACT_Forced_Marriage_Report.pdf|title=A Study on Forced Marriage between Cambodia and China|date=2016|publisher=United Nations Action for Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons (UN-ACT)}}</ref> found that many women eventually get used to their life in China and prefer it to the one they had in their home countries.

===Trafficking for organ trade===
Trafficking in organs is a form of human trafficking. It can take different forms. In some cases, the victim is compelled into giving up an organ. In other cases, the victim agrees to sell an organ in exchange of money/goods, but is not paid (or paid less). Finally, the victim may have the organ removed without the victim's knowledge (usually when the victim is treated for another medical problem/illness{{snd}} real or orchestrated problem/illness). Migrant workers, homeless persons, and illiterate persons are particularly vulnerable to this form of exploitation. Trafficking of organs is an organized crime, involving several offenders:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-organ-trade.html|title=Trafficking for organ trade|work=ungift.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109112345/http://www.ungift.org/knowledgehub/en/about/trafficking-for-organ-trade.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

* the recruiter
* the transporter
* the medical staff
* the middlemen/contractors

Trafficking for organ trade often seeks [[kidney]]s. Trafficking in organs is a lucrative trade because in many countries the waiting lists for patients who need transplants are very long.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Crimes/Human-trafficking/Types-of-human-trafficking|title=Types of human trafficking|work=interpol.int}}</ref>

== Types of criminal liability ==
There are two types of criminal liability: individual and corporate. Generally, individuals are prosecuted for their role in human trafficking, but the state's law-enforcement agencies struggle to punish corporations for a range of reasons, including that criminal procedure to pursue corporations is inadequate, punishments do not punish the most culpable individuals, and inadequate effort is made to calculate the true cost to restore and compensate victims of trafficking because they were victims of crime.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|date=2020-05-11|title=Prosecuting Corporate Crime in Indonesia: Recruitment Agencies that Traffic Migrant Workers|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2194607820000058/type/journal_article|journal=Asian Journal of Comparative Law|volume=15|language=en|pages=23–44|doi=10.1017/asjcl.2020.5|issn=2194-6078}}</ref>

==Efforts==
There are many different estimates of the number of victims of human trafficking. According to scholar Kevin Bales, author of Disposable People (2004), estimates that as many as 27 million people are in "modern-day slavery" across the globe.<ref name="bales">Bales, Kevin.

The enactment of the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act]] (TVPA) in 2000 by the [[United States Congress]] and its subsequent re-authorizations established the Department of State's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]], which engages with foreign governments to fight human trafficking and publishes a [[Trafficking in Persons Report]] annually. The Trafficking in Persons Report evaluates each country's progress in anti-trafficking and places each country onto one of three tiers based on their governments' efforts to comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as prescribed by the TVPA.<ref>U.S. Department of State. Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, n.d. Web. 1 April 2013.</ref> However, questions have been raised by critical anti-trafficking scholars about the basis of this tier system, its heavy focus on compliance with state department protocols, its overreliance on prosecutions and convictions as success in combating trafficking,<ref name=":0" /> its use to serve US political and economic interests and lack of systemic analysis,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/28/without-trafficking-global-wealth-productivity-trafficking-in-persons-report|title=Without trafficking, what would happen to global wealth and productivity?|last=Gallagher|first=Anne|date=28 July 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref> and its failure to consider "risk" and the likely prevalence of trafficking when rating the efforts of diverse countries.<ref name="Horning, A. 2014">{{cite journal | last1 = Horning | first1 = A. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = C. | last3 = Henninger | first3 = A.

In particular, there were three main components of the TVPA, commonly called the three P's:

* ''Protection'': The TVPA increased the US government's efforts to protect trafficked foreign national victims including, but not limited to: Victims of trafficking, many of whom were previously ineligible for government assistance, were provided assistance; and a non-immigrant status for victims of trafficking if they cooperated in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers (T-Visas, as well as providing other mechanisms to ensure the continued presence of victims to assist in such investigations and prosecutions). In T-Visa cases, a forensic psychiatric examination can assist the fact-finder.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garuba|first=Miriam|title=Human Trafficking: What is the Role of the Forensic Psychiatrist?|url=http://www.aapl.org/docs/newsletter/April%202014.pdf|journal=AAPL Newsletter|pages=10}}</ref>
* ''Prosecution'': The TVPA authorized the US government to strengthen efforts to prosecute traffickers including, but not limited to: Creating a series of new crimes on trafficking, forced labour, and document servitude that supplemented existing limited crimes related to slavery and involuntary servitude; and recognizing that modern-day slavery takes place in the context of fraud and coercion, as well as force, and is based on new clear definitions for both trafficking into sexual exploitation and labour exploitation: Sex trafficking was defined as, "a commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age". Labour trafficking was defined as, "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labour or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery".
* ''Prevention'': The TVPA allowed for increased prevention measures including: Authorizing the US government to assist foreign countries with their efforts to combat trafficking, as well as address trafficking within the United States, including through research and awareness-raising; and providing foreign countries with assistance in drafting laws to prosecute trafficking, creating programs for trafficking victims, and assistance with implementing effective means of investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endslaveryandtrafficking.org/fy2014/Relevant-Authorization-Statutes.php|title=ATEST GUIDE 2014: Summary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) and Reauthorizations|work=endslaveryandtrafficking.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131121205448/http://www.endslaveryandtrafficking.org/fy2014/Relevant-Authorization-Statutes.php|archive-date=21 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Then Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] later identified a fourth P, "partnership", in 2009 to serve as a "pathway to progress in the effort against modern-day slavery."

==Structural factors==
A complex set of factors fuel human trafficking, including [[poverty]], unemployment, social norms that discriminate against women, institutional challenges, and [[globalization]].

===Poverty and globalization===
[[Poverty]] and lack of educational and economic opportunities in one's hometown may lead women to voluntarily migrate and then be involuntarily trafficked into sex work.<ref name="berger">{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = Stephanie M | year = 2012 | title = No End In Sight: Why The "End Demand" Movement Is The Wrong Focus For Efforts To Eliminate Human Trafficking | journal = Harvard Journal of Law & Gender | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 523–570 }}</ref><ref name="weitzer">Weitzer, Ronald.

Less wealthy countries have fewer options for livable wages. The economic impact of globalization pushes people to make conscious decisions to migrate and be vulnerable to trafficking. [[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] that hinder women from participating in the formal sector also push women into informal sectors.<ref name="janie">{{cite journal | last1 = Chuang | first1 = Janie | year = 2006 | title = Beyond a snapshot: Preventing human trafficking in the global economy | url = https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1323&context=ijgls| journal = Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 137–163 | doi=10.1353/gls.2006.0002}}</ref>

Long waiting lists for organs in the United States and Europe created a thriving international black market. Traffickers harvest organs, particularly kidneys, to sell for large profit and often without properly caring for or compensating the victims. Victims often come from poor, rural communities and see few other options than to sell organs illegally.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scheper-Hughes|first=Nancy|title=Organs Without Borders|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2005/01/05/organs_without_borders|work=Foreign Policy|access-date=22 January 2014}}</ref> Wealthy countries' inability to meet organ demand within their own borders perpetuates trafficking.

Globalization and the rise of Internet technology has also facilitated human trafficking. Online classified sites and social networks such as Craigslist have been under intense scrutiny for being used by clients and traffickers in facilitating sex trafficking and sex work in general. Traffickers use explicit sites (e.g. Craigslist, Backpage, MySpace) to market, recruit, sell, and exploit women. Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites are suspected for similar uses. According to the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], online classified ads reduce the risks of finding prospective customers.<ref>Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking: Hearings on H.R. 5575, Before the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, 111th Cong. 145 (2010) (statement of Ernie Allen, president and CEO, National Center for Missing & Exploited Children).</ref> Studies have identified the Internet as the single biggest facilitator of commercial sex trade, although it is difficult to ascertain which women advertised are sex trafficking victims.<ref>Shared Hope International, Demand: A Comparative Examination of Sex Tourism and Trafficking in Jamaica, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States, n.d., 5.</ref> Traffickers and pimps use the Internet to recruit minors, since Internet and social networking sites usage have significantly increased especially among children.<ref>Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, "Online child grooming: A literature review on the misuse of social networking sites for grooming children for sexual offences", Australian Institute of Criminology Research and Public Policy Series 103, 2009, ii–xiv.</ref> At the same time, critical scholars have questioned the extent of the role of internet in human trafficking and have cautioned against sweeping generalisations and urged more research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Musto|first1=J.

While globalization fostered new technologies that may exacerbate human trafficking, technology can also be used to assist law enforcement and anti-trafficking efforts. A study was done on online classified ads surrounding the [[Super Bowl]]. A number of reports have noticed increase in sex trafficking during previous years of the Super Bowl.<ref name="newsweek.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/01/30/the-superbowl-of-sex-trafficking.html|title=Michelle Goldberg, "The Super Bowl of Sex Trafficking", Newsweek, January 30, 2011.}}</ref> For the 2011 Super Bowl held in Dallas, Texas, the Backpage for Dallas area experienced a 136% increase on the number of posts in the Adult section on Super Bowl Sunday; in contrast, Sundays typically have the lowest number of posts. Researchers analyzed the most salient terms in these online ads, which suggested that many escorts were traveling across state lines to Dallas specifically for the Super Bowl, and found that the self-reported ages were higher than usual. Twitter was another social networking platform studied for detecting sex trafficking. Digital tools can be used to narrow the pool of sex trafficking cases, albeit imperfectly and with uncertainty.<ref name="mark">Latonero, Mark.

===Political and institutional challenges===
Corrupt and inadequately trained police officers can be complicit in human trafficking and/or commit violence against sex workers, including trafficked victims.<ref name="holly"/> Human traffickers often incorporate abuse of the legal system into their control tactics by making threats of deportation <ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2016/258756.htm 2016 Trafficking in Persons Report], U.S. Department of State</ref> or by turning victims into the authorities, possibly resulting in the incarceration of the victims.<ref>[https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/a-victim-centered-approach-to-sex-trafficking-cases A Victim-Centered Approach to Sex Trafficking] Alvarez, Larry MS and Cañas-Moreira, Jocelyn.</ref>

Anti-trafficking agendas from different groups can also be in conflict. In the movement for [[Sex worker rights|sex workers' rights]], sex workers establish unions and organizations, which seek to eliminate trafficking. However, law enforcement also seek to eliminate trafficking and to prosecute trafficking, and their work may infringe on sex workers' rights and agency. For example, the sex workers union DMSC (Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee) in Kolkata, India, has "self-regulatory boards" (SRBs) that patrol the red light districts and assist girls who are underage or trafficked. The union opposes police intervention and interferes with police efforts to bring minor girls out of brothels, on the grounds that police action might have an adverse impact on non-trafficked sex workers, especially because police officers in many places are corrupt and violent in their operations.<ref name="holly">{{cite journal | last1 = Burkhalter | first1 = Holly | year = 2012 | title = Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability | journal = Anti Trafficking Review | volume = 1 | pages = 122–133 }}</ref> A recent seven-country research by the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women found that sex worker organisations around the world assist women in the industry who are trafficked and should be considered as allies in anti-trafficking work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/941-sex-workers-organising-for-change|title=Sex Workers Organising for Change: Self-representation, community mobilisation, and working conditions|date=2018|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women}}</ref>

Criminalization of sex work also may foster the underground market for sex work and enable sex trafficking.<ref name="berger"/>

Difficult political situations such as civil war and social conflict are push factors for migration and trafficking. A study reported that larger countries, the richest and the poorest countries, and countries with restricted press freedom are likely to have higher levels of trafficking. Specifically, being in a transitional economy made a country nineteen times more likely to be ranked in the highest trafficking category, and gender inequalities in a country's labour market also correlated with higher trafficking rates.<ref name="rao">Rao, Smriti, & Christina Presenti, ''Understanding Human Trafficking Origin: A Cross-Country Empirical Analysis'', in ''Feminist Economics'', vol. 18, no. 2 (April 2012), pp. 231–263, esp. pp. 233–234.</ref>

===Commercial demand for sex===
Abolitionists who seek an end to sex trafficking explain the nature of sex trafficking as an economic supply and demand model. In this model, male demand for prostitutes leads to a market of sex work, which, in turn, fosters sex trafficking, the illegal trade and coercion of people into sex work, and pimps and traffickers become 'distributors' who supply people to be sexually exploited. The demand for sex trafficking can also be facilitated by some pimps' and traffickers' desire for women whom they can exploit as workers because they do not require wages, safe working circumstances, and agency in choosing customers.<ref name="berger"/> The link between demand for paid sex and incidences of human trafficking, as well as the "demand for trafficking" discourse more broadly, have never been proven empirically and have been seriously questioned by a number of scholars and organisations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gaatw.org/resources/publications/913-moving-beyond-supply-and-demand-catchphrases-assessing-the-uses-and-limitations-of-demand-based-approaches-in-anti-trafficking|title=Moving Beyond 'Supply and Demand' Catchphrases: Assessing the uses and limitations of demand-based approaches in Anti-Trafficking|last=Ham|first=Julie|date=2011|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Is Trafficking in Human Beings Demand Driven?

===For victims ===
Human trafficking victims face threats of violence from many sources, including customers, pimps, brothel owners, madams, traffickers, and corrupt local law enforcement officials and even from family members who don't want to have any link with them . Because of their potentially complicated legal status and their potential language barriers, the arrest or fear of arrest creates stress and other emotional trauma for trafficking victims. Victims may also experience physical violence from law enforcement during raids.<ref name="ditmore"/><ref>Cianciarulo, Marisa Silenzi.

LJ 7 (2006): 826.</ref> The challenges facing victims often continue after their removal from coercive exploitation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Denise|last2=Plambech|first2=Sine|date=2018-04-29|title=Editorial: Moving Forward—Life after trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/317|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=10|doi=10.14197/atr.201218101|issn=2287-0113}}</ref> In addition to coping with their past traumatic experiences, former trafficking victims often experience [[social alienation]] in the host and home countries. [[Stigmatization]], [[social exclusion]], and [[Toleration|intolerance]] often make it difficult for former victims to integrate into their host community, or to reintegrate into their former community. Accordingly, one of the central aims of protection assistance, is the promotion of reintegration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bearup|first=Luke S|date=2016-08-01|title=Reintegration as an Emerging Vision of Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking|journal=International Migration|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=164–176|doi=10.1111/imig.12248|issn=1468-2435}}</ref><ref name="ia-forum.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ia-forum.org/Content/ViewInternalDocument.cfm?ContentID=8625|title=Interview with Dr. Luke S.

===Psychological===

====Short-term impact – psychological coercion====
The use of coercion by perpetrators and traffickers involves the use of extreme control. Perpetrators expose the victim to high amounts of [[psychological stress]] induced by threats, fear, and physical and emotional violence. Tactics of coercion are reportedly used in three phases of trafficking: recruitment, initiation, and indoctrination.<ref name=Hopper>Hopper, E. and Hidalgo, J. (2006). Invisible chains: Psychological coercion of human trafficking victims. "Intercultural Human Rights Law, 1", 185–209.</ref> During the initiation phase, traffickers use [[foot-in-the-door]] techniques of [[persuasion]] to lead their victims into various trafficking industries. This [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] creates an environment where the victim becomes completely dependent upon the authority of the trafficker.<ref name=Hopper/> Traffickers take advantage of family dysfunction, homelessness, and history of childhood abuse to psychologically manipulate women and children into the trafficking industry.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = B. | last2 = Butler | first2 = L.

One form of psychological coercion particularly common in cases of [[sex trafficking]] and [[forced prostitution]] is [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Many women entering into the sex trafficking industry are minors whom have already experienced prior sexual abuse.<ref name=McClain>{{cite journal | last1 = McClain | first1 = N. M. | last2 = Garrity | first2 = S. E. | year = 2011 | title = Sex trafficking and the exploitation of adolescents | journal = JOGNN | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 243–252 | doi =  10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01221.x| pmid = 21284727 }}</ref> Traffickers take advantage of young girls by luring them into the business through force and coercion, but more often through false promises of love, security, and protection. This form of coercion works to recruit and initiate the victim into the life of a sex worker, while also reinforcing a "[[trauma bond]]", also known as [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Stockholm syndrome is a psychological response where the victim becomes attached to his or her perpetrator.<ref name=McClain/><ref name=Hardy>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardy | first1 = V. L. | last2 = Compton | first2 = K. D. | last3 = McPhatter | first3 = V.

The goal of a trafficker is to turn a human being into a slave. To do this, perpetrators employ tactics that can lead to the psychological consequence of [[learned helplessness]] for the victims, where they sense that they no longer have any autonomy or control over their lives.<ref name=Wilson/> Traffickers may hold their victims captive, expose them to large amounts of alcohol or use drugs, keep them in [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], or withhold food or sleep.<ref name=Wilson/> During this time the victim often begins to feel the onset of depression, [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[self-blame]], anger and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]], and sleep disturbances, [[PTSD]], numbing, and extreme stress. Under these pressures, the victim can fall into the hopeless mental state of learned helplessness.<ref name=Hopper/><ref name=Segerstron>{{cite journal | last1 = Segerstron | first1 = S.

''The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine: Daphne'', 1–28.</ref>

For victims specifically trafficked for the purpose of forced prostitution and sexual slavery, initiation into the trade is almost always characterized by violence.<ref name=Wilson/> Traffickers employ practices of sexual abuse, torture, [[brainwashing]], repeated rape and physical assault until the victim submits to his or her fate as a sexual slave. Victims experience verbal threats, [[social isolation]], and [[intimidation]] before they accept their role as a prostitute.<ref name=Hodge>{{cite journal | last1 = Hodge | first1 = D. R. | last2 = Lietz | first2 = C. A. | year = 2007 | title = The international sexual trafficking of women and children: A review of the literature | journal = Affilia | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 163–174 | doi = 10.1177/0886109907299055 | s2cid = 145243350 }}</ref>

For those enslaved in situations of forced labor, learned helplessness can also manifest itself through the trauma of living as a slave. Reports indicate that captivity for the person and financial gain of their owners adds additional psychological trauma. Victims are often cut off from all forms of social connection, as isolation allows the perpetrator to destroy the victim's sense of self and increase his or her dependence on the perpetrator.<ref name=Hopper/>

====Long-term impact====
Human trafficking victims may experience complex trauma as a result of repeated cases of intimate relationship trauma over long periods of time including, but not limited to, [[sexual abuse]], [[domestic violence]], forced prostitution, or gang rape. [[Complex trauma]] involves multifaceted conditions of depression, anxiety, self-hatred, dissociation, substance abuse, self-destructive behaviors, medical and somatic concerns, despair, and [[revictimization]]. Psychology researchers report that, although similar to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), Complex trauma is more expansive in diagnosis because of the effects of prolonged trauma.<ref name=Courtois>{{cite journal | last1 = Courtois | first1 = C.

Victims of sex trafficking often get "branded"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/31/us/sex-trafficking-branding/index.html|title=Old mark of slavery is being used on sex trafficking victims|author=Sara Sidner|website=CNN|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> by their traffickers or pimps. These tattoos usually consist of bar codes or the trafficker's name or rules. Even if a victim escapes their trafficker's control or gets rescued, these tattoos are painful reminders of their past and results in emotional distress. To get these tattoos removed or covered-up can cost hundreds of dollars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ink180.com/the-ink180-story/|title=Ink180 » The INK 180 Story|website=ink180.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbc.co.uk/news/extra/VSUj7yai4n/debranding-my-body|title=De-branding my body|website=BBC News|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>

Psychological reviews have shown that the chronic stress experienced by many victims of human trafficking can compromise the immune system.<ref name=Wilson/> Several studies found that chronic stressors (like trauma or loss) suppressed cellular and humoral immunity.<ref name=Segerstron/> Victims may develop STDs and HIV/AIDS.<ref name=Galjic-Veljanoski>{{cite journal | last1 = Galjic-Veljanoski | first1 = O. | last2 = Steward | first2 = D.

Children are especially vulnerable to these developmental and psychological consequences of trafficking due to their age.

===Economic impacts===
{{as of|2018}}, profits from human trafficking were about around US$150 billion each year ranking it along with drug trafficking as one of the most profitable transnational crimes.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://jfsdigital.org/articles-and-essays/2018-2/challenging-human-trade-in-sub-saharan-africa-reconstructing-the-narrative-of-human-trafficking-for-the-creation-of-a-more-enabling-environment-in-2037/|title=Challenging Human Trade in Sub-Saharan Africa: Reconstructing the Narrative of Human Trafficking for the Creation of a More Enabling Environment in 2037|date=2018-10-25|journal=Journal of Futures Studies|volume=23|issue=1|language=en-US|doi=10.6531/jfs.201809_23(1).0004|access-date=2018-12-13|author1=Ricardo-Raymond Schnug}}</ref>

The following is the breakdown of profits by sector: $99 billion from commercial sexual exploitation; $34 billion in construction, manufacturing, mining and utilities; $9 billion in agriculture, including forestry and fishing; $8 billion is saved annually by private households that employ domestic workers under conditions of forced labour. Although only 19% of victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation, it makes up 66% of the global earnings of human trafficking.<ref name="auto4">{{cite web |title=Human Trafficking by the Numbers |url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/human-trafficking-numbers |website=Human Rights First}}</ref> The average annual profits generated by each woman in forced sexual servitude ($100,000) is estimated to be six times more than the average profits generated by each trafficking victim worldwide ($21,800).<ref name="auto4"/>

The low risk, high reward dynamic has created a breeding ground for the human trafficking transactions to thrive. The traffickers expect to generate huge profit from the business yet face minimal punishment or legal consequence. Human trafficking is one of the most profitable illegal industries that is second to the drug trade. While drugs are consumables, human beings can be sold repeatedly from one employer to another. The costs are low, and the profits are extremely high. Similar to employers, consumers desire to pay the lowest price and receive the highest benefit. The demand for cheap goods stimulates employers to demand cheap labour from human traffickers. High demand drives the volume of supply. 
Corporations maximise profit at the expense of trafficked labours. The low cost of illegal immigrant labour and trafficked labour in such enterprises tends to depress wages for legal labourers.<ref>{{cite web |title=What Fuels Human Trafficking? |url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692 |website=UNICEF USA}}</ref>

According to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=U.N. GIFT and UNODC |title=An Introduction to Human Trafficking |date=2008}}</ref><ref name="auto6">{{cite journal |title=Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress |journal=Congressional Research Service |date=February 19, 2013}}</ref> Related crimes associated with human trafficking reportedly include the following: fraud, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, bribery, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, car theft, migrant smuggling, kidnapping, document forgery, and gambling.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=UNODC |title=Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns |date=April 2006}}</ref><ref name="auto6"/>

Organised criminal groups intend to establish or invest in a wide range of legitimate businesses to conceal the profit earned from human trafficking. Businesses are set up to launder money and not necessarily to make profits. Legitimate businesses may be possibly held in competition against enterprises that are financially backed by human traffickers with illegally acquired income. Fair competition may be undermined when human trafficking victims are exploited for cheap labour, driving down production costs, thereby indirectly causing a negative economic imbalance.<ref name="auto5">{{cite web |last1=Grewal |first1=Silky |title=Human Trafficking: Threat To Economic Security Of A Nation |website=BusinessWorld}}</ref>

By definition, human trafficking is an organised crime, executed into action by several actors at the source, transit and destination points of trafficking. Huge profits with minimal risk incur from this offence, that is exclusively meant for the gains of its organisers and the exploiters. The revenue accrued from the Illegal industry of human trafficking does not contribute to a nation's GDP. On the contrary, it is a loss to the economy and national security of a nation, as it is a vicious cycle where this illegal activity can be accountable for funding other illegal activities. The exploitation continuously generates large sums of illegal income for criminal networks, with a corresponding threat on other legitimate businesses which have positive economic impacts.<ref name="auto5"/>

Human trafficking is a national threat as it blocks national growth and development. Economic costs that have been associated with human trafficking include lost labour productivity, human resources, taxable revenues, and migrant remittances, as well as unlawfully redistributed wealth and heightened law enforcement and public health costs.<ref name="auto6"/>

Trafficking of migrants specifically has a negative impact on the potential financial gains of the migrants themselves, government and legitimate employers as income is redirected to traffickers and their associates. All indications lead to the fact that profits generated by related organized crime are significant and global. As a major component of organized crime, with significant financial influence, human trafficking has a complex and interlocking negative impact across human, social, political and economic spheres.<ref name="auto5"/>

==Criticism==
Both the public debate on human trafficking and the actions undertaken by the anti-human traffickers have been criticized by numerous scholars and experts, including Zbigniew Dumienski, a former research analyst at the S.

===Problems with statistics and data===

A 2012 article in the [[International Communication Gazette]] examined the effect of two communication theories (agenda-building and agenda-setting) on media coverage on human trafficking in the United States and Britain. The article analyzed four newspapers including the Guardian and the Washington Post and categorized the content into various categories. Overall, the article found that sex trafficking was the most reported form of human trafficking by the newspapers that were analyzed (p.&nbsp;154). Many of the other stories on trafficking were non-specific.<ref>{{cite journal|title=International human trafficking: An agenda-building analysis of the US and British press|journal=International Communication Gazette|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=145–158|doi=10.1177/1748048511432600 | last1 = Marchionni | first1 = D.

===Problems with the concept===
According to Zbigniew Dumienski, the very concept of human trafficking is murky and misleading.<ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /> It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it may be an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal.<ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /> [[Laura María Agustín|Laura Agustin]] argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, they go into debt'.<ref name="Agustin, Laura 2008"/> Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.<ref name="rsis.edu.sg" /> British scholar Julia O'Connell Davidson has advanced the same argument.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Modern slavery : the margins of freedom|last=O'Connell Davidson, Julia, 1960-|isbn=978-1-137-29727-3|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|oclc=909538560}}</ref> Furthermore, anti-trafficking actors often conflate clandestine migratory movements or voluntary sex work with forms of exploitation covered in human trafficking definitions, ignoring the fact that a migratory movement is not a requirement for human trafficking victimization.

The critics of the current approaches to trafficking say that a lot of the violence and exploitation faced by irregular migrants derives precisely from the fact that their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gülçür | first1 = Leyla | last2 = İlkkaracan | first2 = Pınar | title = The "Natasha" experience: Migrant sex workers from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in Turkey | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 411–421 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00278-9 | date = July–August 2002|url=http://www.walnet.org/csis/papers/NATASHA.PDF}}</ref>

The international [[Save the Children]] organization also stated: "The issue, however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se…trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other…On account of the historical conflation of trafficking and prostitution both legally and in popular understanding, an overwhelming degree of effort and interventions of anti-trafficking groups are concentrated on trafficking into prostitution."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking – Save the Children Nepal |access-date=2010-01-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archive-date=20 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Claudia Aradau of Open University, claims that NGOs involved in anti-sex trafficking often employ "politics of pity," which promotes that all trafficked victims are completely guiltless, fully coerced into sex work, and experience the same degrees of physical suffering. One critic identifies two strategies that gain pity: denunciation{{snd}} attributing all violence and suffering to the perpetrator{{snd}} and sentiment{{snd}} exclusively depicting the suffering of the women. NGOs' use of images of unidentifiable women suffering physically help display sex trafficking scenarios as all the same. She points out that not all trafficking victims have been abducted, abused physically, and repeatedly raped, unlike popular portrayals.<ref name="aradau">{{Cite journal | last1 = Aradau | first1 = Claudia | title = The perverse politics of four-letter words: risk and pity in the securitisation of human trafficking | journal = Millennium: Journal of International Studies | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–277 | doi = 10.1177/03058298040330020101 | date = March 2004| s2cid = 26554777 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/35828760ce77da5e321d87c9c0ce6b6cb1319bc4 }}</ref> A study of the relationships between individuals who are defined as sex-trafficking victims by virtue of having a procurer (especially minors) concluded that assumptions about victimization and human trafficking do not do justice to the complex and often mutual relationships that exist between sex workers and their third parties.<ref name="marcus">{{Cite journal | last1 = Marcus | first1 = Anthony | title = Conflict and agency among sex workers and pimps: A closer look at domestic minor sex trafficking | journal = The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science | volume = 653 | issue = 1 | pages = 225–246 | doi = 10.1177/0002716214521993 | date = May 2014| s2cid = 145245482 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Another common critique is that the concept of human trafficking focuses only on the most extreme forms of exploitation and diverts attention and resources away from more "everyday" but arguably much more widespread forms of exploitation and abuse that occur as part of the normal functioning of the economy. As Quirk, Robinson, and Thibos write, "It is not always possible to sharply separate human trafficking from everyday abuses, and problems arise when the former is singled out while the latter is pushed to the margins."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Quirk|first1=Joel|last2=Robinson|first2=Caroline|last3=Thibos|first3=Cameron|date=2020-09-28|title=Editorial: From Exceptional Cases to Everyday Abuses: Labour exploitation in the global economy|url=https://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/486/375|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=15|pages=1–19|doi=10.14197/atr.201220151|issn=2287-0113}}</ref> O' Connell Davidson too argues that the lines between the crimes of human trafficking/[[Slavery in the 21st century|modern slavery]] and the legally sanctioned exploitation of migrants (such as lower wages or restrictions on freedom of movement and employment) is blurry.<ref name=":1" />

===Problems with anti-trafficking measures===
Groups like [[Amnesty International]] have been critical of insufficient or ineffective government measures to tackle human trafficking. Criticism includes a lack of understanding of human trafficking issues, poor identification of victims and a lack of resources for the key pillars of anti-trafficking{{snd}} identification, protection, prosecution and prevention. For example, Amnesty International has called the UK government's new anti-trafficking measures "not fit for purpose."<ref>{{cite web |title=Anti-trafficking measures 'not fit for purpose' and breach international law – new report |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18820 |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk}}</ref> 

==== Collateral damage ====
Rights groups have called attention to the negative impact that the implementation of anti-trafficking measures have on the [[human rights]] of various groups, especially migrants, sex workers, and trafficked persons themselves. The [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]] drew attention to this "collateral damage" already in 2007.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/244286837|title=Collateral damage : the impact of anti-trafficking measures on human rights around the world|date=2007|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|others=Global Alliance against Traffic in Women.|isbn=9789748371924|location=Bangkok, Thailand|oclc=244286837}}</ref> These negative impacts include various restrictions on women's right to migrate and undertake certain jobs,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932422315|title=No easy exit : migration bans affecting women from Nepal|date=2015|publisher=ILO|others=International Labour Office.

====Victim identification and protection in the UK====
In the UK, human trafficking cases are processed by the same officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much lower than that of EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=A Lie More Disastrous than the Truth: Asylum and the identification of trafficked women in the UK|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/25|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.201216}}</ref> High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the asylum system is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.

[[Laura Agustin]] has suggested that, in some cases, "anti-traffickers" ascribe victim status to [[immigrants]] who have made conscious and rational decisions to cross the borders knowing they will be selling sex and who do not consider themselves to be victims.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kerry Howley |date=26 December 2007 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2007/12/26/the-myth-of-the-migrant |title=The Myth of the Migrant – Reason Magazine |publisher=Reason.com |access-date=21 January 2012}}</ref> There have been instances in which the alleged victims of trafficking have actually refused to be rescued<ref>'[http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/article831672.ece/Chinese-prostitutes-resist-effort-to-rescue-them-from-Africa Chinese Prostitutes Resist Efforts to Rescue Them from Africa]', 2011, Times LIVE, 1 January.</ref> or run away from the anti-trafficking shelters.<ref>{{cite web |last=Siddharth |first=Kumar |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/oct/231010-sex-workers-rescue-shelter-Hadapsar.htm |title=Sex Workers Don't Want Rescue |publisher= Mid-day.com |date=23 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soderlund|first=Gretchen|date=2005|title=Running from the Rescuers: New U.S. Crusades against Sex Trafficking and the Rhetoric of Abolition|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=17|issue=3|pages=64–87|issn=1040-0656|jstor=4317158|doi=10.2979/NWS.2005.17.3.64|s2cid=143600365}}</ref>

====Law enforcement and the use of raids====
In the U.S., services and protections for trafficked victims are related to cooperation with law enforcement. Legal procedures that involve prosecution and specifically, raids, are thus the most common anti-trafficking measures. Raids are conducted by law enforcement and by private actors and many organizations (sometimes in cooperation with law enforcement). Law enforcement perceive some benefits from raids, including the ability to locate and identify witnesses for legal processes, to dismantle "criminal networks", and to rescue victims from abuse.<ref name="ditmore">{{cite journal |last1=Ditmore |first1=Melissa |last2=Thukral |first2=Juhu |title=Accountability and the Use of Raids to Fight Trafficking |journal=Anti-Trafficking Review |date=2012 |issue=4 |doi=10.14197/atr.201218}}</ref>

The problems against anti-trafficking raids are related to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The [[Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005]] (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid was, and what the outcomes of the raid would be.<ref name="ditmore" /><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2016-09-30|title=How to Stage a Raid: Police, media and the master narrative of trafficking|url=http://antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/199/196|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=7|doi=10.14197/atr.20121773}}</ref> Another study found that the majority of women "rescued" in anti-trafficking raids, both voluntary and coerced sex workers, eventually returned to sex work but had amassed huge amounts of debt for legal fees and other costs while they were in detention after the raid and were, overall, in a worse situation than before the raid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sangram.org/resources/RAIDED-E-Book.pdf|title=Raided: How anti-trafficking strategies increase sex workers' vulnerability to exploitative practices|date=2018|publisher=Sangram}}</ref>

Law enforcement personnel agree that raids can intimidate trafficked persons and render subsequent law enforcement actions unsuccessful.
Social workers and attorneys involved in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids. Service providers report a lack of uniform procedure for identifying trafficking victims after raids. The 26 interviewed service providers stated that local police never referred trafficked persons to them after raids. Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.<ref name="ditmore" />

As raids occur to brothels that may house sex workers as well as sex trafficked victims, raids affect sex workers in general. As clients avoid brothel areas that are raided but do not stop paying for sex, voluntary sex workers will have to interact with customers underground. Underground interactions means that sex workers take greater risks, where as otherwise they would be cooperating with other sex workers and with sex worker organizations to report violence and protect each other. One example of this is with HIV prevention. Sex workers collectives monitor condom use, promote HIV testing, and cares for and monitor the health of HIV positive sex workers. Raids disrupt communal HIV care and prevention efforts, and if HIV positive sex workers are rescued and removed from their community, their treatments are disrupted, furthering the spread of AIDS.<ref name="ahmed">{{Cite journal|author=Aziza Ahmed and Meena Seshu|title="We Have the Right Not to Be 'rescued'…"*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|journal=Anti Trafficking Review|volume=1|date=June 2012|pages=149–19|publisher=Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812011153/http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/journals/images/documents/issue1/TheReview_article9.pdf|archive-date=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Scholars Aziza Ahmed and [[Meena Seshu]] suggest reforms in law enforcement procedures so that raids are last resort, not violent, and are transparent in its purposes and processes. Furthermore, they suggest that since any trafficking victims will probably be in contact with other sex workers first, working with sex workers may be an alternative to the raid and rescue model.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title="We have the right not to be 'rescued'..."*: When Anti-Trafficking Programmes Undermine the Health and Well-Being of Sex Workers|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/28|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.201219|s2cid=55688730}}</ref>

===="End Demand" programs====
Critics argue that [[End Demand]] programs are ineffective in that prostitution is not reduced, "[[John school]]s" have little effect on deterrence and portray prostitutes negatively, and conflicts in interest arise between law enforcement and NGO service providers. A study found that Sweden's legal experiment (criminalizing clients of prostitution and providing services to prostitutes who want to exit the industry in order to combat trafficking) did not reduce the number of prostitutes, but instead increased exploitation of sex workers because of the higher risk nature of their work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019|reason=No proper citation given for this study.}} The same study reported that johns' inclination to buy sex did not change as a result of john schools, and the programs targeted johns who are poor and colored immigrants. Some john schools also intimidate johns into not purchasing sex again by depicting prostitutes as drug addicts, HIV positive, violent, and dangerous, which further marginalizes sex workers. John schools require program fees, and police's involvement in NGOs who provide these programs create conflicts of interest especially with money involved.<ref name="desiree">Wortley, S., Fischer, B., & Webster, C.

However, according to a 2008 study, the Swedish approach of criminalizing demand has "led to an equality-centered approach that has drawn numerous positive reviews worldwide."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Picarelli |first1=John |last2=Jonsson |first2=Anna |title=Fostering Imagination in Fighting Trafficking: Comparing Strategies and Policies to Fight Sex Trafficking in the U.S. and Sweden |journal=NCJRS |date=June 2008 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223060.pdf |access-date=31 July 2020}}</ref>

==Modern feminist perspectives==

There are different feminist perspectives on sex trafficking. The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on "sexualized domination", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents as capable of reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex workers rights, and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Johanna|title=Selling Sexual Services: A Socialist Feminist Perspective|url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article34256|website=Europe Solidaire Sans Frontières|publisher=Système de Publication pour un Internet Partagé}}</ref><ref name="shelley" /><ref name="auto3">{{cite web|title=Feminist Manifesto in Support of Sex Workers' Rights|url=https://feministsforsexworkers.com/|website=Feminists for Sex Workers|publisher=Wordpress|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref>

[[Third-wave feminism]] harmonizes the thoughts that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers that women who are trafficked and face oppression do not all face the same kinds of oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression and privilege in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.<ref name="auto2"/><ref name="shelley" /><ref name="auto3"/>

[[Third-wave feminism|Third-wave]] feminist perspective of sex trafficking is loosely related to [[Amartya Sen]]'s and [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s visions of the human capabilities approach to development. It advocates for creating viable alternatives for sex trafficking victims. Nussbaum articulated four concepts to increase trafficking victims' capabilities: education for victims and their children, microcredit and increased employment options, labor unions for low-income women in general, and social groups that connect women to one another.<ref name="shelley">CAVALIERI, SHELLEY.

Legal Collection. Web. 6 March 2013.</ref>

The clash between the different feminist perspectives on trafficking and sex work was especially evident at the negotiations of the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children|Palermo Protocol]]. One feminist group, led by the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], saw trafficking as the result of globalisation and restrictive labour migration policies, with force, fraud and coercion as its defining features. The other feminist group, led by the [[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] saw trafficking more narrowly as the result of men's demand for paid sex. Both groups tried to influence the definition of trafficking and other provisions in the Protocol. Eventually, both were only partially successful;<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-04-30|title=Purity, Victimhood and Agency: Fifteen years of the UN Trafficking Protocol|url=http://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/90/111|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|issue=4|doi=10.14197/atr.20121544}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex slaves and discourse masters : the construction of trafficking|last=Doezema, Jo.|date=2010|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-415-7|location=London|oclc=650365532}}</ref> however, scholars have noted that this rift between feminist organisations led to the extremely weak and voluntary victim protection provisions of the Protocol.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chuang|first=Janie A.|date=2010|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1655–1728|issn=0041-9907|jstor=25682362|title=Rescuing Trafficking from Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform and Anti-Trafficking Law and Policy}}</ref>

===Social norms===
According to modern Feminists, women and girls are more prone to trafficking also because of [[social norms]] that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination both at home and in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-03-08|title=Born a girl: bad karma?|url=http://oecdinsights.org/2013/03/08/born-a-girl-bad-karma/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=OECD Insights Blog|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Enrile|first=Annalisa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw4sDgAAQBAJ&q=bad+karma|title=Ending Human Trafficking and Modern-Day Slavery: Freedom's Journey|date=2017-08-31|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-5063-1675-8|language=en|quote=...are that women are born women because of their bad karma (Brown, 2000).}}</ref> further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.<ref name="yvonne">{{cite journal | last1 = Rafferty | first1 = Yvonne | year = 2007 | title = Children for sale: Child trafficking in Southeast Asia | journal = Child Abuse Review | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 401–422 | doi=10.1002/car.1009}}</ref>
