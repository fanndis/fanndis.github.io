'''KYW-TV''', [[virtual channel]] 3 ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 30), is a [[CBS]] [[Owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], United States. The station is owned by the [[CBS Television Stations]] subsidiary of [[ViacomCBS]], as part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] with [[The CW|CW]] [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] [[WPSG]] (channel 57). The two stations share studios on Hamilton Street north of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]]; KYW-TV's transmitter is located in the [[Roxborough, Philadelphia|Roxborough]] section of Philadelphia.

==History==

===As WPTZ (1932–1953)===
The channel 3 facility in Philadelphia is one of the world's oldest television stations. It began in 1932 as '''W3XE''', an experimental station owned by Philadelphia's [[Philco|Philco Corporation]], at the time and for some decades to come one of the world's largest manufacturers of radio and television sets. Philco engineers created much of the station's equipment, including cameras. When the station began operations as W3XE, it was based within Philco's production plant, at C and East Tioga streets in [[North Philadelphia]], complete with a small studio and transmitter. In 1941, it began sharing programs with W2XBS (later WNBT and now [[WNBC]]) in [[New York City]], becoming [[NBC]]'s second television [[network affiliate|affiliate]], and creating a link between the station and the network that would last for 54 years.<ref>[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/bp1/3history.html W3XE/WPTZ-TV's early history, from the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]</ref>

On July 1, 1941, W3XE received a commercial license—the third in the United States, and the first outside of New York City—as '''WPTZ'''. The station signed on for the first time on September 1, becoming the first licensed television station in Pennsylvania. Philco then moved WPTZ's studios to the penthouse suite of the Architect's Building, at 17th and Sansom streets in downtown Philadelphia, while retaining master control facilities at the Philco plant. The station originally broadcast from a tower in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania|Wyndmoor]]. It significantly cut back operations after the U.S. entered [[World War II]], but returned to a full schedule in 1945. Channel 3 relocated its entire operation to the Wyndmoor transmitter facility during World War II, when the station aired little programming. It then became one of three stations (along with WNBT and [[Schenectady, New York]]'s [[WRGB]], now a fellow CBS affiliate) that premiered NBC's regular television service in 1946, although all three stations did share occasional programs just before and during the war. When full broadcasting was resumed, the station reactivated its studio in the Architect's Building, remaining there until 1947. WPTZ then moved into unused space at 1619 [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut Street]] in Center City, where KYW radio was housed. What is now KYW-TV has been based in Center City ever since.<ref>[http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/bp/51penny.html Another page on W3XE/WPTZ's early history, from the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia]</ref>

The [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], owner of Philadelphia's longtime [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] affiliate KYW, purchased WPTZ in 1953 for a then-record price of $8.5 million.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/53-OCR/BC-1953-02-23-OCR-Page-0027.pdf "Westinghouse buys WPTZ (TV) for record $8.5 million."]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]'', February 23, 1953, pp. 27.</ref> The WPTZ call letters are now used for the [[WPTZ|NBC affiliate]] in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]].

===As an NBC-owned station (1955–1965)===
In May 1955, Westinghouse agreed to trade WPTZ and KYW radio to NBC in exchange for [[WKYC|WNBK television]] and [[WTAM|WTAM-AM]]-[[WMJI|FM]] in [[Cleveland]], and $3 million in cash compensation.<ref>"NBC, WBC trade properties in Cleveland, Philadelphia."

Shortly after NBC took control of channel 3, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) collapsed the [[Lehigh Valley]], most of northern [[Delaware]] and southern [[New Jersey]] (including [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]) into the Philadelphia market. NBC realized WRCV-TV's existing tower was inadequate for this enlarged market. In 1957, channel 3 moved to a new {{convert|1100|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tower in Roxborough. The tower was co-owned with WFIL-TV (channel 6, now [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] owned-and-operated station [[WPVI-TV]]) and added much of Delaware, the Lehigh Valley, and southern New Jersey to the station's city-grade coverage. The new transmitter enabled channel 3 to broadcast in color for the first time.

However, almost immediately after the trade was finalized, Westinghouse complained to the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] about NBC's alleged [[coercion]] and a lengthy investigation was launched.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/6b1NviavV?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BC-IDX/56-OCR/1956-01-02-BC-OCR-Page-0058.pdf "NBC-Westinghouse swap approved; FCC stirs Justice Dept. interest."] ''Broadcasting'', January 2, 1956, pg. 58.</ref><ref>"Justice Dept. hauls NBC into court."

===As a Westinghouse station (1965–1995)===
[[File:5th Street (SEPTA station) and the old KYW (AM)-KYW-TV building.jpg|thumb|right|The former KYW Building on [[Independence Mall East]], used by the station from 1972 to 2007. This building has since been demolished and replaced by the [[National Museum of American Jewish History]].]]
Despite its status as NBC's largest affiliate, KYW-TV spent much of the thirty years that followed the 1965 trade reversal preempting many NBC programs, choosing to air local or syndicated programming instead. The production arm of Westinghouse Broadcasting was partially responsible for the preemptions, as channel 3 (along with its sister stations in the Group W chain) aired shows produced and syndicated by Group W, such as ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' (whose production moved from Cleveland to the Walnut Street studio Philadelphia in 1965, and then taped at Independence Mall East until 1978), ''The [[David Frost]] Show'' and the Westinghouse franchise ''[[Evening Magazine]]'' (with was broadcast on non-Westinghouse owned stations airing their own versions of the latter show as ''PM Magazine''). Preempted network programming was usually lower-rated daytime [[game show]]s, [[soap opera]]s, or [[rerun]]s of prime time programs with an average of two hours per day. At one point, in the fall of 1980, KYW-TV preempted NBC's entire morning schedule after the ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'' show. Over the years, NBC contracted [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] [[WPHL-TV]], [[WTXF-TV|WTAF-TV/WTXF-TV]], [[WKBS-TV (Philadelphia)|WKBS-TV]], and [[WGTW-TV]] to air programs preempted by channel 3; most of the preempted programs aired on [[WMGM-TV]], which served as the NBC affiliate for Atlantic City until 2014. However, at the time NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other networks and was rather perturbed at losing valuable advertising in the nation's fourth-largest market.

Like most affiliates that preempt underperforming network programs, KYW-TV used the preemptions in order to gain an increase in local advertising rates which potentially come with ratings increases. This proved to be a very profitable decision at first, as KYW-TV was either first or second in the Philadelphia television ratings for most of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the station (and NBC) faltered in the late 1970s, and by 1980, KYW-TV was the lowest-rated network affiliate in Philadelphia. It stayed in the ratings basement even when NBC rebounded to become the nation's most-watched network by 1985. For the rest of its tenure as an NBC affiliate, KYW-TV was the network's lowest-rated major-market affiliate during a very prosperous period for NBC as a whole. It continued to heavily preempt NBC programming, much to the network's chagrin.

On June 16, 1994, [[Baltimore]] sister station [[WJZ-TV]] lost its affiliation with ABC after that network announced a deal with the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] to [[KNXV|switch]] [[WFTS|three]] of Scripps' television stations to ABC; one of the Scripps-owned stations joining ABC was Baltimore's NBC affiliate, [[WMAR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Zurawik|first=David|title=ABC-TV to Switch from WJZ to WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-06-17/news/1994168105_1_wmar-scripps-affiliates|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref> This deal, which was spurred by an affiliation agreement between [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[New World Communications]], did not sit well with Westinghouse, who felt betrayed by ABC after nearly half a century of loyalty. As a safeguard, Group W intensified a search (which had begun prior to WJZ's affiliation loss) for affiliation deals of its own. Group W eventually struck an agreement to switch KYW-TV, WBZ-TV, and WJZ-TV to CBS (Westinghouse already had two CBS affiliates in its portfolio at the time, [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] and [[KPIX-TV]] in [[San Francisco]]). CBS was initially skeptical about including KYW-TV in the deal. While KYW-TV was a poor third, CBS-owned [[WCAU|WCAU-TV]] (channel 10) was a solid runner-up to long-dominant ABC-owned WPVI-TV. However, after Westinghouse offered to sell CBS a minority stake in KYW-TV, CBS agreed to move its affiliation to channel 3 and put channel 10 up for sale.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollenberg|first=Skip|title=CBS, Westinghouse Agree on Broad TV Station Partnership|url=https://www.apnews.com/1d51b34c4bc24b7cff7273bd81e8cda3|work=AP|date=15 July 1994}}</ref>

===As a CBS-owned station (1995–present)===
{{main|1994–1996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}
While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=From the official archives of the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia |url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in late 1994. NBC traded [[KCNC-TV]] in [[Denver]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]] (which NBC had acquired earlier that year) to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade—displacing their respective longtime network affiliates, [[KMGH-TV]] and [[KSL-TV]]. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, [[WTVJ|NBC]] and [[WFOR-TV|CBS]] traded broadcasting facilities in [[Miami]]. The deal officially took effect at 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on September 10, 1995.<ref>{{cite news|last=McClellan|first=Steve|title=CBS, NBC complete 4-market station switch|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15908144.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329055442/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15908144.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 29, 2015|accessdate=July 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=November 28, 1994}}</ref> The final NBC program aired on KYW-TV was a rerun of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which began at 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on September 9, 1995; NBC moved all of its programming locally to WCAU after the program ended. Westinghouse bought CBS outright in late 1995, making KYW-TV a CBS owned-and-operated station.

In 2000, the combined company was purchased by [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]]. The deal brought KYW-TV under common ownership with Philadelphia's [[UPN]] station, WPSG, which relocated to the KYW Building on [[Independence National Historical Park|Independence Mall]]. When Viacom became [[CBS Corporation]] in 2006 (after spinning off its [[Viacom Media Networks|basic cable networks]] and the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount film studio]] into [[Viacom (2005–2019)|a new Viacom]]), CBS retained all related terrestrial broadcasting interests, including KYW-AM-TV and WPSG.

On April 2, 2007, KYW-TV and WPSG moved to a new broadcast complex located at 1555 Hamilton Street near [[Center City Philadelphia]], across from the [[Community College of Philadelphia]]<ref>[http://cbs3.com/slideshows/local_slideshow_089133214 cbs3.com – The New Home of CBS 3<! – Bot generated title – >] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726154143/http://cbs3.com/slideshows/local_slideshow_089133214 |date=July 26, 2007 }}</ref> and near Fairmount Park. The new building, which is wired for [[high-definition television|high definition]] newscasts, is the fourth studio in the station's 75-year history. Channel 3 had been broadcasting from Independence Mall East since July 1972.

KYW-TV was effectively separated from its radio counterpart in November 2017, when [[CBS Radio]] merged into [[Entercom]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Entercom-CBS Radio Merger Is Complete|url=https://radioink.com/2017/11/17/entercom-cbs-radio-merger-complete/|website=RadioInk.com|accessdate=November 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118222655/https://radioink.com/2017/11/17/entercom-cbs-radio-merger-complete/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="variety-cbsentercom">{{cite web|title=CBS Sets Radio Division Merger With Entercom|url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/cbs-entercom-radio-division-merger-1201976392/|website=Variety|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/02/cbs-entercom-radio-merger/|title=CBS and Entercom Are Merging Their Radio Stations|website=Fortune|access-date=February 2, 2017}}</ref>

On October 21, 2014, CBS and [[Weigel Broadcasting]] announced the launch of a new [[digital subchannel]] service called [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]], scheduled to launch on all CBS-owned stations in 2015, including on KYW-TV on channel 3.2.<ref name="Decades">[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/cbs-stations-weigel-partner-oldies-digi-net-decades/134996 CBS Stations, Weigel Partner on Oldies Digi-Net Decades] ''Broadcasting & Cable'' (October 21, 2014)</ref> On January 16, 2015, Decades started after eight minutes of a [[test card|test pattern]] that occurred first with the CBS Philly Plus ticker and then one minute later with a test pattern without the CBS Philly Plus ticker. On September 3, 2018, Decades was replaced by Start TV.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KYW-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition [[UHF]] channel 26.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |format=PDF |accessdate=March 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829004251/http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |archivedate=August 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="YouTube video of KYW-TV's analog to digital conversion.">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTUDSG8L5Jw</ref><ref name="FCCForm387">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn=101231413&formid=387&fac_num=25453 CDBS Print]</ref> Through the use of [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]], digital television receivers display the station's [[virtual channel]] as its former VHF analog channel 3. KYW-TV was the only Philadelphia market station participating in the "[[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|Analog Nightlight]]" program, and did so through July 12, 2009.<ref name="FCC Nightlight">[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-291375A1.pdf]</ref> The analog-to-digital conversion began way back to a series of experimental patterns starting with the B&W wheel followed by [[Jackie Johnson]] announcing "You're watching KYW-TV.

===Spectrum reallocation===
KYW-TV and WPSG both shifted their frequencies on August 1, 2019 as part of the FCC's 5G network [[spectrum reallocation]], with KYW-TV shifting from channel 26 to channel 30, and experiencing technical issues with over-the-air reception due to the repack. As with many stations, KYW-TV also had to launch the new frequency on a lower power. The station expects to return to full power following the installation of new 1-megawatt transmission antennas in November 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=CBS3 Engineering Crews Install New Antennas Atop TV Transmission Tower In Roxborough |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itLXcsfVKU4}}</ref>

[[File:CBSPhillyintheWildwoods.jpg|thumb|CBS Philadelphia van in the [[The Wildwoods|Wildwoods]] of New Jersey]]

From 1965 to 2003, KYW-TV's logo was a distinct "Stylized 3" in the font made famous by Group W (which introduced in 1963 upon the introduction of the Westinghouse Broadcasting's corporate imaging, while the station was still in Cleveland, now [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]]-owned WKYC). It was the longest continuously-used logo in Philadelphia television history until 2006, when WPVI-TV's simple "6" logo passed it. The only major change came in February 1998, when the [[CBS#The CBS Eye Logo|CBS Eye]] was placed in front of the "3". The logo was finally retired after KYW-TV rebranded as ''CBS 3''.

==Programming==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=August 2020}}
Under the terms of Westinghouse's deal with CBS, KYW-TV began carrying the entire CBS schedule in pattern with no preemptions except for extended breaking news or severe weather coverage. If a situation arises to where CBS programming is preempted by local news coverage, the programs can be shifted to sister station WPSG.

===Sports programming===
Channel 3 has had a long history of carrying Philadelphia-area sports teams through NBC and CBS. From [[1948 Philadelphia Phillies season|1948]] to [[1989 Philadelphia Phillies season|1989]], through [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC's broadcast contract with Major League Baseball]], select [[Philadelphia Phillies]] contests were aired on channel 3, which included their victory in the [[1980 World Series]]. After [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] assumed the broadcast contract to what had become the [[American Football Conference]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] in [[1970 Philadelphia Eagles season|1970]], the station also aired all [[Philadelphia Eagles]] games in which they played host to an AFC team, doing so until [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|1995]]; they resumed broadcasting Eagles games (again, usually when the team plays against the AFC team at home) after the station joined [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] when the network acquired the AFC package from NBC in the 1998 season. From [[1990–91 Philadelphia 76ers season|1990]] to [[1994–95 Philadelphia 76ers season|1995]], [[Philadelphia 76ers]] games also aired on Channel 3 by way of [[NBA on NBC|NBC's broadcast contract with the NBA]].

[[File:KYW-TV open.png|thumb|left|Former news open seen nightly at 11.]]
KYW-TV presently broadcasts 37½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 5 minutes each weekday; 3 hours, 5 minutes on Saturdays and 4½ hours on Sundays). KYW-TV cooperates with sister station [[WCBS-TV]] in the production and broadcast of statewide New Jersey political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], they will pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations cooperate in the gathering of news in New Jersey where their markets overlap; sharing reporters, live trucks, and helicopters. Like other CBS-owned stations, KYW-TV offers a web-only newscast called ''CBS 3 At Your Desk'', shown daily.

Shortly after Westinghouse regained control of KYW-TV in 1965, news director [[Al Primo]] popularized the [[Eyewitness News]] format and branding. This format has the reporters actually presenting their stories instead of having an anchor read them.<ref>[http://www.mrpophistory.com/popculturefiles/askmrpophistory_q173.htm Pop history: First use of the 'Eyewitness News' slogan]</ref> Primo used the cue "007" from the film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' as the theme. Within a few years, Group W's other television stations had adopted the format. Around this same time, sister station KYW radio became one of the first [[all-news radio]] stations in the country. Channel 3's newscasts, anchored by Vince Leonard starting in 1958 (during its stint as NBC-owned WRCV-TV), had long been second behind WCAU-TV, but the new format catapulted KYW-TV to first place. Also seen on the air during that time were future talk show host Tom Snyder and Marciarose Shestack. Primo took the concept with him to New York City's [[WABC-TV]] in 1968, albeit an improved version that introduced the concept of chatter among the anchors ("happy talk"). It was this modified format that was emulated throughout the United States.

Channel 3 dominated the ratings for the rest of the 1960s, but faced a new challenger after WFIL-TV introduced ''[[Action News]]'' to Philadelphia. For most of the 1970s, KYW-TV traded first place with WFIL/WPVI. In 1972, KYW-TV hired Philadelphia-area native [[Jessica Savitch]] as a reporter, and later co-anchor alongside Leonard. [[Mort Crim]] also joined as an anchor during that period, forming what native Philadelphians called the "Camelot of television news". Leonard, Crim and Savitch were joined at the anchor desk in 1976 by native Philadelphian [[Jack Jones (reporter)|Jack Jones]], who at WCAU-TV had become the city's first African-American news anchor. However, in 1977, WPVI beat KYW-TV in most timeslots by a wide margin during a sweeps period. In a case of especially bad timing, Crim left for [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] in May 1977, and Savitch left for [[NBC News]] three months later. Channel 3's ratings went into rapid decline. The station tried to stop the decline by adopting a new format called "Direct Connection", with reporters assigned to "beats" such as medical, consumer, entertainment and gossip, among others. While this concept was at least a decade ahead of its time, it was not enough to stop the ratings slide. By the time Jones departed for [[WLS-TV]] in Chicago in 1979 and Leonard left for [[KPNX]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1980, ''Eyewitness News'' had crashed into last place.

Having seen its quartet of top-rated anchors move on, KYW-TV attempted a reformat of its newscasts, hiring new talent from outside the Philadelphia market to take center stage. Despite the presence of personalities such as [[Maria Shriver]], [[Maury Povich]], Ron Hunter, Stan Bohrman, and Patrick Emory, ''Eyewitness News'' stayed in the ratings basement. For most of the next 20 years, KYW-TV was a very distant third behind WPVI-TV and WCAU-TV. In the late 1980s the station also produced news updates for [[USA Network]], titled ''USA Updates''; these were anchored by [[Steve Bell (news anchor)|Steve Bell]], who came to channel 3 in 1986 from [[ABC News]]. but during the changes later in 1991, production was moved over to [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s [[All News Channel]], where they were produced until 2000.

In 1991, KYW-TV rebranded itself as ''KYW 3'' after being known on-air as simply "channel 3" for most of its history (except for the ''Direct Connection'' era, when it was known as ''3 For All''). It also abandoned the longstanding ''Eyewitness News'' name after 26 years and experimented with giving each newscast a different name. The morning and noon news became ''Newsday'', the 6 p.m. news as ''Newsbeat'', and the 11 p.m. news as ''The News Tonight''. It also started using a theme based on the five-note musical sounder of its radio sister, one of the top all-news stations in the country and the highest-rated radio station in Philadelphia for most of the last 40 years; indeed, their news director during this era was previously at KYW radio. Group W hoped to gain the trust of viewers who already associated KYW radio with high-quality news. However, neither of these fixes worked—mainly because of putting unknown anchors Bruce Hamilton (who had previously anchored in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] at [[WESH]] and [[WKMG-TV|WCPX]], and after his stint here, returned to Florida at [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]'s [[WJXX]] and [[WJXT]]) and Jennifer Ward (previously of [[Toronto]]'s [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]]) at the helm of the evening newscasts, while the more familiar personalities were relegated to weekends and mornings. As a result, channel 3 stayed in the ratings basement. The experiment with different newscast names ended after almost three years in 1994, just before it became a CBS station, when the station began calling its newscasts ''KYW News 3'', with familiar Philadelphia anchors [[Larry Kane]] (from rival WCAU-TV) and Stephanie Stahl (from Miami's [[WSVN]]) coming on board. Kane anchored the 11 p.m. broadcast solo, while Stahl anchored the 6 p.m. report, first with Bruce Hamilton, then with Pittsburgh's [[Don Cannon (news anchor)|Don Cannon]] (though due to potential confusion with a local radio DJ also named Don Cannon, he went under his birth name of Don Clark while at KYW; he left in 1998 for sister KDKA). The ''Eyewitness News'' name was restored in early 1998.

KYW-TV used music packages based on KYW radio's musical signature until 2003, even in the period immediately after rebranding as "CBS 3". That year, it adopted "News in Focus" by composer John Hegner as its theme song. This package, like the majority of themes for CBS' owned-and-operated stations, is based on "Channel 2 News", written in 1975 for WBBM-TV in Chicago (known as "I Love Chicago, Chicago, My Home"; ironically, WCAU-TV used music based on this theme for its last decade as a CBS-owned station). Channel 3 used an updated version written in 2003 for New York City sister station WCBS-TV. The change to "News In Focus" came just after KYW began calling itself "CBS 3". In 2005, KYW-TV ditched "News In Focus" in favor of another "Channel 2 News"-based tune, "The Enforcer" (a.k.a. "The CBS Enforcer Music Collection") also composed by [[Frank Gari]].

Also in 2003, KYW-TV became a factor in the Philadelphia news race for the first time in over 20 years. The previous summer, it persuaded WPVI-TV's longtime 5 p.m. anchor, Marc Howard, to jump ship to anchor its 11 p.m. news. Kathy Orr, weekend weathercaster at WCAU, also moved to channel 3. Then, in September 2003, the station lured [[Larry Mendte]] away from WCAU. Mendte had been the lead anchor at that station when it defeated WPVI in the ratings for the first time in 30 years. [[Alycia Lane]], a weekend anchor at Miami's WTVJ, was added to complement Mendte, and they became the station's new top anchor team, anchoring KYW's 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts.

The 5 p.m. news was moved to 4 p.m. and Howard moved off the 11 p.m. newscast to anchor with Denise Saunders. The change proved successful, as KYW moved ahead of WCAU at 11 p.m. and came within a point of knocking off WPVI in the time slot. Saunders left the station in 2004 and was replaced by Angela Russell. Russell left the station on December 26, 2008. The 4 p.m. newscast moved back to the 5 p.m. timeslot with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' ending in 2011 and WPVI starting its own 4 p.m. newscast. The 4 p.m. timeslot on KYW was given to the ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' program. For the last decade, KYW-TV has waged a spirited battle with WCAU for second place behind WPVI. It is currently second in most timeslots, while WPVI continues to dominate with its newscasts despite having its digital signal on interference-prone channel 6. On August 6, 2018 the station relaunched a new 4 p.m. newscast called ''CBS3@4'' anchored by Natasha Brown and Alexandria Hoff, moving ''Dr. Phil'' to 3 p.m. which was occupied by reruns of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (which airs on sister station WPSG) until August 3, 2018.

In April 2007, KYW-TV became the third Philadelphia television station to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition; the switch coincided with the station's move from its former Independence Mall studios to its new facility on Hamilton Street. On February 2, 2009, KYW began to produce a nightly prime time newscast at 10 p.m. for sister station & CW Network flagship WPSG. On October 19, 2009, KYW dropped its noon newscast in favor of launching a local talk show called ''TalkPhilly'', which left WPVI as the only station in the market to run a noon newscast (WCAU airs their midday newscast at 11 a.m. while WTXF does not air a newscast at noon).<ref>[http://www.philly.com/dailynews/features/20091014__Got_Talent__.html]</ref> On June 26, 2015, ''TalkPhilly'' aired its final broadcast due to declining ratings and was reverted to a traditional noon newscast the following Monday.

In September 2018, Jessica Dean announced that she would be leaving the station after five years to pursue another assignment.<ref>http://www2.philly.com/philly/entertainment/television/jessica-dean-leaving-cbs3-kyw-ukee-washington-20180922.html</ref> She has since joined CNN as a correspondent for the network's Washington bureau. On October 29, 2018, Dean's position as Ukee Washington's co-anchor was filled by Jessica Kartalija who came from KYW's sister station, [[WJZ-TV]] in Baltimore.<ref>https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/10/23/</ref>

Morning meteorologist Katie Fehlinger left the station on September 17, 2019 after more than eight years in order to spend more time with her family and pursue other professional ventures. Her position was covered in the interim by fellow CBS3 meteorologists Matt Peterson, Lauren Casey and Kate Bilo, former CBS3 meteorologist and current WJZ meteorologist Chelsea Ingram, and those from outside the station that were auditioning for the job including former WCAU Chief Meteorologist [[Tammie Souza]] and former [[KNSD]] weekend meteorologist Llarisa Abreu. On February 10, 2020, Abreu was officially announced as taking Fehlinger's position at CBS3, however she unofficially started at the station a day earlier due to Peterson taking a day off as he had been working earlier that week.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/entertainment/tv/llarisa-abreu-cbs3-meteorologist-weekday-mornings-20200210.html</ref><ref>https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/video/4167823-farewell-katie/</ref>

==Controversy==

===2008 Lane and Mendte firings===
In January 2008, 6 and 11 p.m. news anchor Alycia Lane was fired weeks after she was arrested in New York City the month prior for hitting a female police officer and calling her a "dyke".<ref>{{cite news|date=December 16, 2007|title=Alycia Lane Arrested, Punches Cop|work=New York Post|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_oa4R4Spk1I6G76GCmbZUMN}}</ref> The firing came as a result of the arrest being the second incident that Lane was involved in within a year. A previous incident in May 2007 saw Lane be penalized after it was learned that she had sent a photo of herself in a bikini via the station's email to her friend, [[NFL Network]] anchor [[Rich Eisen]]. The email only came to light due to the revelation that the account it was sent to was one Eisen shares with his wife [[Suzy Shuster]].<ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/...newscaster-alycia-lane-married... www.nydailynews.com/news/national/...newscaster-alycia-lane-married...</ref>

In June 2008, 6 and 11 p.m. news anchor Larry Mendte, who was Alycia Lane's co-anchor until her firing five months earlier, was himself fired from the station after police conducted a raid of his home and seized his computers due to an investigation by both law enforcement authorities and CBS 3. The investigation revealed that he had hacked Lane's email account at the station and had not only been secretly reading thousands of Lane's emails from her account during and after her employment at the station on multiple occasions, but also passing them on to gossip columnists. In a public statement, Mendte said that his actions were rooted in a feud that started after he ended a "flirtatious and improper" relationship with Lane.<ref>[http://news.aol.com/article/fired-tv-anchor-admits-e-mail-hacking/144518?icid=100214839x1207940646x1200451047]</ref> Additionally, it was learned that Mendte was also hacking into the email of another coworker at the station, current [[WRC-TV]] Chief Meteorologist [[Doug Kammerer]]. The FBI ultimately decided while the evidence regarding the Kammerer hack was credible, it was not strong enough to warrant additional charges against Mendte,<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/homepage/20081120_Mendte_tried_to_snoop_on_2d_coworker_.html</ref>  who pleaded guilty to the charges regarding Lane.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7747260.stm US TV anchor convicted of hacking, BBC News, 00:35 GMT, 25 November 2008]</ref> In September 2008, Lane filed a lawsuit against Mendte and KYW-TV, claiming that the station had been negligent in preventing Mendte from divulging her personal information and photos to columnists. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in October 2016, though no specific details of the settlement were revealed to the public.<ref>https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/alycia-lane-newscaster-lawsuit-larry-mendte/2038390/

===2013 Brewer and Erickson viral exchanges===
CBS 3 also made headlines in June 2013 when video surfaced on [[YouTube]] of weekend morning anchor [[Nicole Brewer]] and meteorologist Carol Erickson appearing to exchange on-air jibes at each other during their weekend morning newscasts. Station management said the edited video was taken out of context and the personalities have a mutual respect for one another.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 4, 2013|title=CBS3 responds to the Nicole Brewer-Carol Erickson viral video everyone's talking about|work=Philly.com|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/CBS3-responds-to-the-Nicole-Brewer-Carol-Erickson-viral-video.html#uS7XlkCSwJojlAeU.99}}</ref> Brewer left CBS 3 in June 2018 in order to spend more time with her family.<ref>https://www.phillyvoice.com/nicole-brewer-leaves-cbs3/</ref>

===2015 firings===
On June 30, 2015, station management fired longtime lead anchor Chris May, Chief Meteorologist Kathy Orr, and Sports Director Beasley Reece without any advance warning in a move that shocked many viewers. In a situation similar to the infamous 1996 "Massacre" that had occurred at its sister O&O flagship station WCBS-TV in New York, May and Reece learned of their firings nearly three hours before they were scheduled to go on the air at 5 p.m. while Orr (who had been the Chief Meteorologist since 2003) was on vacation at the time she was notified of her firing. Jessica Dean, who had joined CBS 3 just two years earlier and anchored alongside May, Orr and Reece, was the only member of their broadcast team to avoid being fired.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/philly/entertainment/celebrities/20150630_CBS3_fires_Reece__May__Orr.html</ref> Additionally, meteorologist Carol Erickson resigned after a 37-year career at the station to focus more on her animal rights advocacy. The next day, on July 1, it was announced that Ukee Washington would be moved from mornings to weeknights to co-anchor with Dean (marking the second time that Washington would be shifted to anchoring weeknights as he had previously anchored the 5 p.m. newscast with [[Dawn Stensland]]), while Kate Bilo would take over Orr's slots and become the station's Chief Meteorologist, with morning meteorologist Katie Fehlinger also reporting for the noon newscast, replacing Bilo. In September of the same year Don Bell would return to CBS3 to take over Reese's former position as Sports Director and weeknight sports anchor, leaving [[Fox Sports 1]] after previously having been a weekend sports anchor at CBS3 from 2005 to 2010.<ref>https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/personality/don-bell/</ref>

===2020 layoffs===
On May 27, 2020, KYW-TV [[layoff|laid off]] more than twelve ''Eyewitness News'' employees and on-air personnel in response to several factors affecting the station's parent company ViacomCBS, including a corporate restructuring due to the merger of Viacom and CBS Corporation in December 2019 and the dwindling of advertising revenue in the wake of the global [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/cbs-hit-by-newest-round-of-viacomcbs-layoffs/ar-BB14G0GT</ref> Among those laid off were general assignment reporter Crystal Cranmore, South Jersey Bureau reporter Cleve Bryan, and general assignment reporter/fill-in anchor Chantee Lans. Several off-camera personnel such as floor directors, engineers, and editors were also laid off. The two most notable employee layoffs were [[Leslie Van Arsdall]] and weekday morning traffic anchor [[Chandler Lutz]].<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/business/cbs3-layoffs-viacom-lesley-van-arsdall-20200528.html</ref>

==Cable, telco, and satellite carriage==
{{Refimprove-section|date=August 2020}}
KYW-TV has been carried on [[Comcast]] in southern [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex]] and [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]] counties in New Jersey since December 2007 on [[digital cable]] channel 256 in the Middlesex County municipalities of [[Plainsboro, New Jersey|Plainsboro]], [[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]], [[Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey|Monroe]], [[Cranbury, New Jersey|Cranbury]], [[Jamesburg, New Jersey|Jamesburg]], [[Helmetta, New Jersey|Helmetta]], [[Spotswood, New Jersey|Spotswood]], and [[East Brunswick, New Jersey|East Brunswick]] as well as the Monmouth County borough of [[Roosevelt, New Jersey|Roosevelt]]. Comcast's Central New Jersey systems that service portions of the New York market, including the aforementioned Middlesex County municipalities as well as Roosevelt, that were then part of [[Storer Communications|Storer Cable]] had previously carried KYW-TV during its NBC affiliation on channel 3 before moving to it channel 37 in the late 1980s where it remained until 1993. This came to an end when NBC O&O WNBC requested that Storer Cable's southern Middlesex County system stop carrying a second NBC affiliate in the New York market. KYW was removed from Storer systems in Middlesex County on September 1, 1993.

After the affiliation and ownership swap on September 10, 1995, WNBC did not object to their now NBC co-owned sister station WCAU continuing to be carried in southern Middlesex County on Comcast (then Channel 39), though Comcast did not restore the now CBS-owned KYW to the system for another twelve years. KYW is also available to Comcast cable customers in [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] on channel 256, being moved there from channel 3 in early 2008. Comcast added KYW's HD feed to its lineups in Ocean and southern Middlesex counties, as well as the borough of Roosevelt, and its Lambertville area system in [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] on August 22, 2012 on Channel 903.<ref name="Comcast Xfinity Mailing-HD Channels are moving up and new channels and changes are coming soon">http://www.dslreports.com/speak/slideshow/27366485?c=2020602&ret=L2ZvcnVtL3IyNzM2NjQ4NS1Db21jYXN0LUNlbnRyYWwtTkotTWlkZGxlc2V4LUxpbmV1cC13aXRoLVBoaWxseS1IRC1XTE5Z</ref>

In [[Plumsted Township, New Jersey|Plumsted Township]], Ocean County, KYW is carried in lieu of WCBS-TV as Plumsted is served by Comcast's Garden State system (based out of [[Mount Holly, New Jersey|Mount Holly]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]]) which does not carry any New York City stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvlistings.zap2it.com/api/printGrid?lineupId=NJ57264&timespan=3&headendId=NJ57264&country=USA&device=X&postalCode=08533&time=1527885000&pref=m,p&filter=all&token=&timezone=&headendName=Comcast%20Garden%20State%20-%20Digital&dstStart=2018-03-11T02:00Z&dstEnd=2018-11-04T02:00Z&dstOffset=-240&stdOffset=-300|title=TV Listings Comcast Garden State – Digital 08533|website=Zap2it.com|publisher=[[Gracenote]]|date=June 1, 2018|accessdate=June 1, 2018}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, New York local channels are available on [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] in Plumsted and all of Ocean County.

KYW is not available to [[Altice USA|Cablevision]] customers in [[Lakewood, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]] and southern Monmouth County, even though Cablevision carries other Philadelphia stations on these systems. Cablevision (previously Harte-Hanks Cable and Monmouth Cablevision) in the [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]] area of Monmouth County carried KYW-TV until September 10, 1995, when WCAU replaced KYW on that system after the network switch. [[Verizon FiOS]] carries KYW in [[Upper Freehold Township, New Jersey|Upper Freehold Township]], while the rest of the county gets only New York City area stations on FiOS, except for portions of southern [[Howell Township, New Jersey|Howell Township]], which get WPVI from the Ocean County feed. DirecTV and Dish Network do not carry any Philadelphia stations in any area outside the Philadelphia market.

In New Jersey, KYW (and the majority of Philadelphia stations) were carried in more places in central and northern New Jersey during the [[CATV]] era of the 1970s and 1980s. Northern and portions of central Middlesex County, with the exception of South Plainfield never received any other Philadelphia station except WKBS, WPHL, and WTAF (now WTXF), which have been removed since the late 1980s. Northeast Monmouth County Comcast subscribers ([[Eatontown, New Jersey|Eatontown]]) once had KYW and the other Philadelphia stations on cable, as well.<ref name="Cable Search">http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/coals7/forms/search/cableSearchNf.cfm</ref>

In [[Maryland]], KYW is carried in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]] and portions of the upper [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] along the [[U.S. Route 301|US 301]] corridor. During the CATV era of the 1970s and into the 1980s, KYW was carried as far south into [[Ocean Pines, Maryland|Ocean Pines]], [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]].<ref>https://apps.fcc.gov/coals/forms/search/cableSearchNf.cfmM{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
