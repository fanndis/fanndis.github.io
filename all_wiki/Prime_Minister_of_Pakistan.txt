==History==
[[Image:Liaquat Ali Khan 1945.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], serving as first Prime Minister of Pakistan after independence (1947–1951).]]

The office of the Prime Minister was created on immediate effect after the [[Partition of India|partition]] and the [[Independence of Pakistan|establishment]] of Pakistan in 1947; the Prime Minister existed alongside the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] who was the representative of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British Monarchy]]. The [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|first]] Prime Minister, [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], exercised central executive powers until his [[Assassination of liaqat ali khan|assassination]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/liaqat_ali_khan/page4.htm.html |title=Special Edition (Liaqat Ali Khan) |work=[[The News International]] |first=M Yakub |last=Mughal |accessdate=8 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121225534/http://jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/liaqat_ali_khan/page4.htm.html |archivedate=21 January 2012 }}</ref> However, the [[Political power|powers]] slowly began to be reduced as a result of constant intervention by the Governor-General. Despite the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first set]] of the Constitution giving central power in 1956, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|next six prime ministers]] were dismissed by the Governor-General from 1951 till 1957. In addition, the first set of the Constitution had evolved the Governor-General into the [[President of Pakistan]] whilst declaring the country an "[[Islamic republic]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://storyofpakistan.com/the-constitution-of-1956/ |title=The Constitution of 1956 | publisher=Story of Pakistan | date=1 June 2003 | accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref><ref name="Nagendra">{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Bangladesh|author=Nagendra Kr.

In 1962, the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|second set]] of the Constitution completely dissolved the office of prime minister as all powers were transferred to the President of Pakistan.<ref name="Nagendra"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://storyofpakistan.com/the-constitution-of-1962/ |title=The Constitution of 1962 | publisher=Story of Pakistan | date=1 June 2003 | accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref> Criticism over the [[President of Pakistan|presidency]] after the [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|presidential election]] held in 1965 over the centralizing of powers. After the [[1970 Pakistani general elections|general elections]] held in 1970, the office was established with [[Nurul Amin]] becoming the Prime Minister who was also the [[Vice President of Pakistan|Vice-President]].

With [[India]] intervening in East Pakistan and Pakistan conceding [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|defeat]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] led to the collapse of the [[presidential system]] in 1971.

As the comprehensive [[Constitution of pakistan|Constitution]] reinstated in 1973, the post was reestablished with more central powers as the constitution provided a [[parliamentary system]] with President of Pakistan as [[figurehead]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/constitution_pakistan.aspx |title=The Constitution of Pakistan |publisher=infopak.gov.pk |accessdate=8 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109103454/http://www.infopak.gov.pk/constitution_pakistan.aspx |archivedate=9 November 2007 }}</ref> Amid agitation instigated by the [[Pakistan National Alliance|right-wing alliance]] invited the [[Operation Fair Play|military intervention]] in 1977 which suspended the post.

The [[1985 Pakistani general election|general elections]] held in 1985 restored the post, with [[Muhammad Khan Junejo|Muhammad Junejo]] becoming the Prime Minister. Later that year, the National Assembly passed the controversial [[Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|eighth amendment]] to the Constitution, giving the President the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and the National Assembly without prior consultation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dossani |first1=Rafiq |last2=Rowen |first2=Henry S. |date=2005 |title=Prospects for Peace in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwO9zmj6aQ0C&pg=PA42 |publisher=Stanford University Press |pages=42–43 |isbn=978-0-8047-5085-1}}</ref> The [[1988 Pakistani general elections|general elections]] in 1988 resulted in the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]]'s [[Benazir Bhutto]] becoming the [[Women in Muslim societies|first woman]] Prime Minister elected in a Muslim country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://storyofpakistan.com/benazir-bhutto-becomes-prime-minister/ | title=Benazir Bhutto Becomes Prime Minister | publisher=Story of Pakistan | date=1 June 2003 | accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>

From 1988 to 1993, the power struggle between the Prime Minister and Presidency continued with President dismissing the [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]] on three different occasions. At the [[1997 Pakistani general elections|1997 elections]], the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|PML(N)]] secured a [[two-thirds majority]] in the Parliament and drafted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|XIII]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|XIV Amendments]] to reverse the eighth amendment to the Constitution; this allowed [[Nawaz Sharif]] to centralize more executive powers.<ref name=Mittal>{{Cite book | last =Akbar | first =M.K  | title =Pakistan Today | place =New Delhi, India | publisher =Mittal Publications | chapter =Pakistan Under Navaz Sharif | page =230 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g6D8xkFgTwEC&pg=PA1 | isbn =978-81-7099-700-9 | accessdate=8 September 2012| date =1 January 1998  }}</ref> After the draw down of [[Civil-Military Relations|civil-military relations]] in 1999, [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman joint chiefs]] General [[Pervez Musharraf]] staged [[1999 Pakistani coup d'état|a coup d'état]] against the PML(N)'s government and held nationwide elections in [[2002 Pakistani general elections|2002]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/472968.stm | title=Pakistan after the coup: Special report |work=BBC News| date=12 October 2000 | accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>

==Constitutional law==
{{Politics of Pakistan}}
The [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] envisages a scheme of affairs in which the [[President of Pakistan]] is the [[head of state]] who represents the "unity of the Republic." The [[system of government]] in Pakistan is based on [[Constitution of Pakistan|codified constitution]] which sees the Prime Minister as "[[chief executive]] of the Republic."

{{quote|text=Subject to the Constitution, the executive authority of the Federation shall be exercised in the name of the President by the Federal Government, consisting of the Prime Minister and the Federal Ministers, which shall act through the Prime Minister, who shall be the chief executive of the Federation."|sign=[http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html Article 90(1)] in Chapter 3: The Federal Government of Part III: The Federation of Pakistan in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]]|source=source<ref name="pakistani.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html|title=Chapter 3: "The Federal Government" of Part III: "The Federation of Pakistan"|website=pakistani.org}}</ref>}}

In addition, the Prime Minister is also the chairman of the [[Council of Common Interests]] as set by:
{{quote|text=1 There shall be a Council of Common Interests, in this Chapter referred to as the Council, to be appointed by the President<br />
(2) The Council shall consist of-<br />
(a) the Prime Minister who shall be the Chairman of the Council;<br />
(b) the Chief Ministers of the Provinces;<br />
(c) three members from the Federal Government to be nominated by the Prime Minister from time to time.|sign=[http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part5.ch3.html Article 153] in Chapter 3: Special Provisions of Part V: Relations between Federation and Provinces in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]]|source=source<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part5.ch3.html|title=Chapter 3: "Special Provisions" of Part V: "Relations between Federation and Provinces"|website=pakistani.org}}</ref>}}

As in most of the [[parliamentary democracies]], a [[head of state]]'s duties are mostly ceremonial. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is the [[head of government]] and has the responsibility for executive power. With Pakistan following a [[parliamentary system]] of government, the Prime minister is generally the leader of a party (or coalition of parties) that has a majority in the [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]]&nbsp;—the [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of Pakistan]]. The Prime Minister, in common with all other ministers, has to be a member of [[National Assembly (Pakistan)|National Assembly]].<ref name="pakistani.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part3.ch3.html|title=Chapter 3: "The Federal Government" of Part III: "The Federation of Pakistan"|website=pakistani.org}}</ref>
