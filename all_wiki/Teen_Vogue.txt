'''''Teen Vogue''''' is an American online publication, formerly in print, launched in 2003, as a sister publication to ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', targeted at preteen girls. Like ''Vogue'', it included stories about [[fashion]] and [[celebrities]].<ref name="Teen Vogue"/> Since 2015, following a steep decline in sales, the magazine cut back on its print distribution in favor of online content, which has grown significantly.

== Content ==
=== Fashion ===
''Teen Vogue''<nowiki/>'s initial content focused on fashion, aimed at a teen audience; in ''The New York Times'', Jazmine Hughes described this iteration in contrast to contemporaneous teen magazines as less "'finding a prom date' and more 'finding a prom color palette.'"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/magazine/elaine-welteroth-teen-vogues-refashionista.html|title=Elaine Welteroth, Teen Vogue's Refashionista|last=Hughes|first=Jazmine|date=August 31, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 8, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
