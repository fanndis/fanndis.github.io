The '''1964 Brazilian coup d'état''' ({{lang-pt|Golpe de estado no Brasil em 1964}} or, more colloquially, ''{{lang|pt|golpe de 64}}'') was a series of events in [[Brazil]] from March 31 to April 1 that led to the overthrow of President [[João Goulart]] by members of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]], supported by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].<ref name=1964coup>{{cite news |author=Kingstone, Steve |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3588339.stm|title=Brazil remembers 1964 coup d'etat|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 8, 2007 | date=April 1, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=US Role in 1964 Brazilian Military Coup Revealed |url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/international_news/2004/04/06/us_role_in.html |publisher=Dominion |accessdate=June 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Hm62hYMD?url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/international_news/2004/04/06/us_role_in.html |archive-date=July 1, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The following day, with the military already in control of the country, the [[National Congress of Brazil|Brazilian Congress]] came out in support of the coup and endorsed it by declaring vacant the office of the presidency.<ref name=1964coupCongress>{{cite web |author=House of Representatives, News |title=Congress nullifies session that declared vacant the presidency of Joao Goulart |url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/POLITICA/457600-CONGRESSO-ANULA-SESSAO-QUE-DECLAROU-VAGA-A-PRESIDENCIA-DE-JOAO-GOULART.html |accessdate=August 18, 2015 |date=November 21, 2013}}</ref> The coup put an end to the government of Goulart (also known as 'Jango'), a member of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]], who had been democratically elected vice president in the same election in which conservative [[Jânio Quadros]], from the [[Podemos (Brazil)|National Labour Party]] and backed by the [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]], won the presidency.

Quadros resigned in 1961, the same year of his inauguration, in a clumsy political maneuver to increase his popularity. Quadros anticipated those mass demonstrations would demand his return to office and strengthen his position, but he miscalculated. With the presidency vacant and according to the constitution then in force, enacted in 1946, Quadros should have automatically been replaced by Goulart. However, because Goulart was on a diplomatic trip to the [[People's Republic of China]] at the time, and because, although a moderate [[nationalism|nationalist]], Goulart was accused of being a [[communism|communist]] by right-wing militants, he was unable to take office. After lengthy negotiations, led mainly by [[Tancredo Neves]], Goulart's supporters and the right-wing reached an agreement under which the [[parliamentary system]] would replace the [[presidential system]] in the country. Goulart would continue as [[head of state]], although weakened, and Neves would be named the prime minister.

In 1963, however, a [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1963|referendum]] re-established the presidential system with Goulart as president. He took office with full powers, and during his rule several problems in Brazilian politics became evident, as well as disputes in the context of the [[Cold War]], which helped destabilize his government. The Basic Reforms Plan (''Reformas de Base'') proposed by Goulart had the potential to [[Socialization (economics)|socialize]] the profits of large companies. It was labelled as a "[[socialism|socialist]] threat" by right-wing sectors of society and of the military, which organized major demonstrations against the government in the [[March of the Family with God for Liberty|Marches of the Family with God for Freedom]] (''Marchas da Família com Deus pela Liberdade'').<ref name="Arquivo Nacional">{{cite web |url=http://www.an.gov.br/crapp_site/presidente.asp?rqID=8 |title=Centro de Informação de Acervos dos Presidentes da República - João Goulart |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref>

The coup brought to Brazil a [[Brazilian military government|military regime]] politically aligned to the interests of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]].<ref>Skidmore, Thomas: The Politics of Military Rule in Brazil, 1964-1985</ref> This regime lasted until 1985, when Neves was [[Brazilian presidential election, 1985|indirectly elected]] the first civilian president of Brazil since the 1960 elections.

==Conspiracy against Goulart==
Jânio Quadros resigned on August 25, 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.an.gov.br/crapp_site/presidente.asp?rqID=23 |title=Centro de Informação de Acervos dos Presidentes da República - Jânio Quadros |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref> At the time of his resignation, [[João Goulart]] was in the [[People's Republic of China]] on a foreign relations trip. On August 29, the Brazilian Congress heard and vetoed a motion to stop Goulart from being named the president, brought by the heads of the three branches of the military and some politicians, who claimed Goulart's inauguration would put the country "on the road to civil war."<ref name="fgvjango">{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/Jango/biografias/joao_goulart |title=João Goulart - CPDOC - FGV |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref> A compromise was reached. Brazil would become a parliamentary democracy, with Goulart as president. As such, he would be [[head of state]], but with limited powers of [[head of government]]. [[Tancredo Neves]] was named as the new [[prime minister]].

On January 6, 1963, Goulart successfully changed the system of government back to a presidential democracy in a [[referendum]] in which he won by a large margin. Goulart found himself back in power with a rapidly deteriorating political and economic situation.<ref name="fgvjango" /> During this period, Goulart was politically isolated, with a foreign policy which was independent of any alignment. He openly criticized the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] by the US, but criticized the Cuban regime of [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref name="Arquivo Nacional" />

The country's economic situation deteriorated rapidly. Attempts to stabilize the currency were financed by aid packages from the [[International Monetary Fund]]. His failure to secure foreign investment and curb domestic inflation put the country in a difficult situation which exacerbated social conflicts.<ref name="fgvjango" />

On March 13, 1964, Goulart gave a speech where he promised to [[nationalization|nationalize]] the country's oil refineries, as well as carry out "basic reforms" including [[rent control]]. This was followed by a large demonstration on March 19, where a conservative group marched on [[Praça da Sé]], [[São Paulo]], in a demonstration called "[[March of the Family with God for Liberty|March of the Family with God for Freedom]]" against Goulart and his policies.<ref>[http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/brasil_20mar1964.htm São Paul Parou Ontem Para Defender o Regime] ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]''. March 20, 1964 Retrieved on August 20, 2007.</ref>

===The Sailors' Revolt===
The friction between the military and Goulart boiled over with his intervention in a revolt by sailors of the [[Brazilian Navy]] led by [[José Anselmo dos Santos]], historically known as Cabo Anselmo, and later exposed as an [[agent provocateur]]. On March 25, 1964, nearly 2,000 sailors assembled in [[Rio de Janeiro]], petitioning for better living conditions and pledging their support for Goulart's reforms. The Minister of the Navy, Sílvio Mota, ordered the arrest of the sailors leading the assembly. Mota sent a detachment of [[Brazilian Marine Corps|marines]] to arrest the leaders and break up the assembly, led by [[Rear Admiral]] Cândido Aragão. These marines ended up joining the assembly and remained with the other sailors.<ref name="fgvrevolta">{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/Jango/artigos/AConjunturaRadicalizacao/A_revolta_dos_marinheiros |title=A revolta dos marinheiros - CPDOC - FGV |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref>

Shortly after Aragão's refusal to arrest the leaders, Goulart issued orders prohibiting any invasion of the assembly location (the headquarters of the local metalworker's union), and sacked Sílvio Mota as Minister of the Navy. The following day, March 26, the Minister of Labor, Amauri Silva, negotiated a compromise, and the sailors agreed to leave the assembly building. They were promptly arrested for [[mutiny]].<ref>[http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/brasil_28mar1964.htm Em Liberdade Provisoria os Marinheiros Rebeldes] ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]''. March 28, 1964. Retrieved August 20, 2007.</ref>

Goulart [[pardon]]ed the sailors shortly afterward, provoking a public rift with the military.<ref name="Arquivo Nacional" /> Soon after this, on March 30, 1964, the day before the coup, Goulart gave a speech to a gathering of [[sergeant]]s, where he asked for the military's support for his reforms.<ref name="Arquivo Nacional" />

==The coup==

===The run-up===
In the United States, concerns over the state of the Brazilian President, Goulart, started as early as July 1962. A private meeting was set up between [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard N. Goodwin]], and [[Lincoln Gordon]] to discuss Goulart's activity in the military, and their concern over whether or not he was leading the country towards Communism. The discussion concluded that they would support paramilitary forces in opposition to Goulart and that they would send a "fellow" who was fluent in Portuguese to be their contact within the military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/docs/Document%201%20kennedy%20brazil%20meeting%20July%2030,%201962.pdf|title=White House, Transcript of Meeting between President Kennedy, Ambassador Lincoln Gordon and Richard Goodwin, July 30, 1962|date=July 30, 1962|website=National Security Archive|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170325192921/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/docs/Document%25201%2520kennedy%2520brazil%2520meeting%2520July%252030,%25201962.pdf |archive-date=March 25, 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate=March 25, 2017}}</ref>

On December 11, 1962, the Executive Committee (EXCOMM) of the National Security Council met to evaluate three policy alternatives on Brazil: to do nothing and allow the present drift to continue, to collaborate with Brazilian elements hostile to Goulart who were in favor of a coup, and to seek to change the political and economic orientation of Goulart and his government.<ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/ |title=Brazil Marks 50th Anniversary of Military Coup |website=nsarchive.gwu.edu |access-date=March 12, 2017}}</ref> At the time the U.S. felt the third option was the best selection, and would be tried before shifting to the second option. The attempt to reform Goulart's policy was selected as having the only feasible chance of success at the time.<ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"/> The choice to give support to the Goulart administration without political confrontation might be justified by the fact that there was an expectation that events in Brazil would lead to Goulart's early ouster or a change in his policies.<ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"/> At first, the U.S. attempted to work with President Goulart and convince him to change his political views and policies to a more pro-Western system of governance.

In December 1962, Bobby Kennedy flew to Brazil to meet with Goulart. Goulart and Kennedy spoke for three hours, with Kennedy outlining "the presence of Communists, ultranationalists (read nationalists), extreme leftists (read leftists) and anti-Americans in Goulart's government" as the main American objection to his government.<ref name="PEREIRA, ANTHONY W 2016">PEREIRA, ANTHONY W. "The US Role in the 1964 Coup in Brazil: A Reassessment." Bulletin of Latin American Research. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, June 20, 2016. Web. May 8, 2017.</ref>

In March 1963, the Kennedy administration gave Goulart a choice: either he could remove the anti-American politicians from political power in Brazil, or the United States would put economic pressure on Brazil.<ref name="PEREIRA, ANTHONY W 2016"/> On March 8, the CIA released a memorandum listing the current efforts within the Brazilian military to organize and attempt a coup. The document identifies that "conservative elements of the Brazilian military [were] formulating plans for a possible effort to depose President Joao Goulart."<ref name=":3" /> The report identifies Odylio Denys as having the "best-developed plan."<ref name=":3" /> Denys's plan relied on the "cooperation by military commanders in key state against the central government with recalcitrant governors being arrests by local commanders who would then replace them."  However, no military action would be taken unless prompted by Goulart because, as the report states, "the Brazilian military prides itself in the belief that... it does not act unconstitutionally." The report continues that if a coup were to happen too soon it would ruin any further attempts; additionally, more support must be proved to Denys in the form of governmental sabotage. Ultimately, the CIA expressed their belief that Denys could bring about a coup "by putting together a luck combination of well-placed military commanders."<ref name=":3" />

During the final months of 1963, the Kennedy administration began to search for paramilitary forces capable of overthrowing the Goulart government.<ref name="PEREIRA, ANTHONY W 2016"/> The coup was foreseen by both pro- and anti-Goulart forces. In Rio de Janeiro, [[Leonel Brizola]], Goulart's brother-in-law and ally, had organized as far back as October 1963 so-called "Groups of Eleven", or groups of eleven people who would work in supporting Goulart's reforms,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pdt.org.br/pdt/lideres/leonel-brizola|title=Leonel Brizola - Portal PDT |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070206/http://www.pdt.org.br/pdt/lideres/leonel-brizola |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> but could theoretically be converted to a form of [[militia]] in defense of Goulart's presidency.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+br0024) Brazil: The Post-Vargas Republic, 1954–64]. [[Library of Congress]]. Retrieved August 20, 2007.</ref>

On the other side, on March 20, 1964, 11 days before the coup, [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco]], chief of staff for the army, circulated a letter to the highest echelons of the military warning of the dangers of communism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/Jango/artigos/NaPresidenciaRepublica/Os_militares_e_o_governo_JG |title=Os militares e o governo João Goulart - CPDOC - FGV |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref> Two cables from the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon reveal his suspicions of President Goulart's communist sympathies, and his urging of the CIA to prepare to aid the revolt. The first, dated March 27, 1964, accuses Goulart of actively working with the Brazilian Communist Party, and recommends that the U.S. prepare to support anti-Goulart forces with arms and fuel, especially the General Castello Branco.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz02.pdf |title=Info |publisher=nsarchive.gwu.edu |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> In the same cable, Gordon mentions that several anti-Goulart groups had approached him in the past two years about the U.S. supporting a coup. He says that, out of all of them, General Branco was easily the best. In Gordon's opinion, he was the one that the U.S. should put their weight behind. He is very urgent in his message, saying that he is afraid of Brazil becoming "The China of the 1960s".  Finally, he urges for arms to be sent via an unmarked submarine at night as soon as possible.<ref name=":0" /> In a second cable, sent two days later on March 29, he takes a more urgent tone as Ambassador Gordon reports that the situation had "worsened" and "possibly shortened time factors", and advised that "earliest possible action would achieve optimum results."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz03.pdf |title=Info |publisher=nsarchive.gwu.edu |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Retired Marshal Odylio Denys was Minister of War during president Janio Quadros' term and was a leader of the anti-Goulart group was in charge of developing the plan to overthrow Goulart. Denys and many Brazilian military men who were strongly against Goulart, however, would not initiate a revolutionary plan unless Goulart started any "attacks" that would win him support. The whole purpose was to protect their constitution, which they felt that Goulart disobeyed.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/ |title=National Security Archive &#124; 30+ Years of Freedom of Information Action |website=nsarchive.gwu.edu}}</ref>

On March 30, the American military attaché in Brazil, Colonel [[Vernon A. Walters]], telegraphed the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. In that telegraph, he confirmed that Brazilian army generals had committed themselves to act against Goulart within a week of the meeting, but no date was set.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d192 192.

Retrieved on August 20, 2007.</ref> An Intelligence Information Cable from the same day reiterates the likelihood of a revolution "probably within the next few days", and outlines the movement of troops from São Paulo and Minas Gerais towards Rio de Janeiro once the revolt begins.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz04.pdf |title=Data |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> They felt there would be no problems in Minas Gerais. The cable reports anticipation of problems in São Paulo, and warns that the revolution will be long and bloody, noting that "the position of the navy is uncertain and could add to the difficulties of the anti-Goulart forces." The air force base in Belo Horizonte had little to offer. They believed there would be no resistance or bloodshed. However, the cable also cites the division of the air force as beneficial to the aid of anti-Goulart forces. This included the commander Col. Afranio Aguiar who usually favored Goulart.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> These two documents reflect the planning and premeditation for the coup by both the CIA and Brazilian anti-Goulart bodies.

===March 31===
In the early hours of March 31, 1964, General [[Olímpio Mourão Filho]], Commander of the 4th Military Region, headquartered in [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Minas Gerais]], ordered his troops to start moving towards Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/Jango/biografias/olimpio_mourao_filho |title=Olímpio Mourão Filho - CPDOC - FGV |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |language=pt}}</ref> The move was not coordinated with the other main generals in the plot, namely General Amaury Kruel of the 2nd Army (based in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]) and Castello Branco, the deposed army chief of staff. The troop movement took them by surprise, as they felt it was too soon for a successful coup. Less than two hours after receiving news of Mourão's march, Kruel was reported saying "This is nothing more than a ''quartelada'' (military adventure, from ''quartel'', Portuguese for "barracks") by General Mourão, and I will not join it."<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |pages=68–69}}</ref> In the morning, Castello Branco would twice try to stop Mourão's march on Rio de Janeiro. At the same time, news of the march had reached General Argemiro Assis Brasil, João Goulart's military aide, who felt confident he could put the rebellion down.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |pages=69–70}}</ref> As the day progressed, minor revolts and military actions ensued, such as Castello Branco's barricades at the Ministry of War building, and at the {{lang|pt|Escola de Comando do Estado Maior}} in Rio de Janeiro. Despite this, the crucial support needed for the coup (that of General Kruel's 2nd Army) had not yet been implemented.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |pages=80–81}}</ref> At around 10:00 pm, General Kruel called João Goulart. In the call, Kruel asked the president to break with the left-wing by sacking his Minister of Justice and Chief of Staff and outlaw the ''{{lang|pt|Comando Geral dos Trabalhadores}}'' (Worker's General Command), a major workers' organization. Goulart replied that doing so would be a humiliating defeat for him, making him a "decorative president". Goulart told Kruel: "General, I don't abandon my friends. (...) I would rather stick with my grassroots. You should stick to your convictions. Put your troops out on the street and betray me, publicly."<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=88}}</ref>

After the 10:00 pm call, Kruel called Goulart two more times, repeating his demands, and receiving the same answer from Goulart.<ref name="Gaspari 2002 90">{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=90}}</ref> Goulart's attempt to revoke the generals was disastrous. Two of his three military chiefs of staff were out of action for various reasons. His military aide was a newly promoted [[Brigadier General]], General Assis Brasil. His greatest base of military support was located in his native [[Southern Brazil]]. His reaction, orchestrated by Assis Brasil, consisted of shifting a general from the southern 3rd Army to the southeast, to replace Castello Branco (he never arrived). Of his other generals, in the states of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and the Rio Grande do Sul, four were on vacation, while two others were returning to their posts in [[Curitiba]] when they were forced to land in [[Porto Alegre]] due to bad weather, and thus away from their commands.<ref name="Gaspari 2002 90"/>

A telegram dated March 31, 1964, details some decisions the United States made in response to the coup being underway. The details highlighted the dispatch of US Navy tankers from Aruba, an immediate dispatch of a naval task force to go to Brazil, and initiation of a shipment of 110 tons of ammunition as well as other light equipment such as tear gas. Furthermore, the telegram also states that the actual deployment of these resources requires more discussion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Action Amembassy Rio de Janeiro, Mar 31 1964 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz05.pdf |website=National Security Archive |accessdate=March 21, 2017}}</ref> The first tanker is to be off Santos between April 8 and 13, followed by three tankers at intervals of one day. An aircraft carrier, the [[USS Forrestal]] (CV-59) is to arrive on April 10, with four destroyers, two destroyer escorts, and task force tankers to arrive four days later.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz05.pdf |title=Article |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>

===April 1===
On April 1, at 12:45 pm, João Goulart left Rio de Janeiro for the capital, [[Brasília]], in an attempt to stop the coup.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=103}}</ref> He arrived at about 4:30 pm. Reservists were called up earlier in the day by the local military commander and were brought to the anti-aircraft headquarters in Brasília to try to protect Goulart. It was believed that their defense would only be able to delay his overthrow by about one day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000393511.pdf|title=PLANS OF PRESIDENT GOULART TO MAKE A LAST DITCH STAND IN BRASILIA {{!}} CIA FOIA (foia.cia.gov)|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> At the same time, General Kruel and the 2nd Army began to march towards the [[Vale do Paraíba]], between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.<ref>[http://almanaque.folha.uol.com.br/brasil_01abr1964.htm II Exercito Domna o Vale do Paraiba].

General [[Artur da Costa e Silva]] called Âncora and demanded his surrender. Âncora replied he would honor a promise to Goulart and first meet to discuss the situation with General Kruel, who was marching in his direction. The meeting would take place later in the day at the [[Academia Militar de Agulhas Negras]], in Resende, between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. At that meeting, Âncora surrendered the 1st Army.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=106}}</ref> Goulart had no military support outside of the south. When he reached Brasília, Goulart realized he lacked any political support. The Senate president, [[Auro de Moura Andrade]], was already articulating for congressional support of the coup. Goulart stayed for a short time in Brasília, gathering his wife and two children, and flying to Porto Alegre in an [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]] [[Avro 748]] aircraft. Soon after Goulart departed, Auro Moura Andrade declared the position of President of Brazil "vacant".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=111}}</ref> Seven people would die during the events of April 1.

In the early hours of April 2 the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] declared the presidency to be vacant and [[Brazilian Senate|Senate]] president Auro de Moura Andrade, along with the president of the [[Supreme Federal Tribunal]], swore in [[Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli]], the speaker of the house, as president. This move was arguably unconstitutional at the time, as João Goulart was still in the country.<ref name="Gaspari 2002 112"/> At the same time Goulart, now in the headquarters of the 3rd Army in Porto Alegre (which was still loyal to him at the time), contemplated resistance and counter-moves with Leonel Brizola, who argued for armed resistance. In the morning, General Floriano Machado informed the president that troops loyal to the coup were moving from Curitiba to Porto Alegre and that he had to leave the country, risking arrest otherwise. At 11:45 am, Goulart boarded a [[Douglas C-47]] transport for his farm bordering [[Uruguay]]. Goulart would stay at his farm until April 4, when he finally boarded the plane for the last time, heading for [[Montevideo]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=113}}</ref> Mazzilli would continue as president while the generals jockeyed for power. On April 11, 1964, General Humberto de Alencar Castello Branco was [[1964 Brazilian presidential election|elected President]] by the National Congress. Upon taking power, Castello Branco promised to "deliver, in 1966, to my successor legitimately elected by the people, a united nation." In 1967, he delivered what journalist [[Elio Gaspari]] dubbed "a fractured nation" to a president elected by 295 people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaspari |first=Elio |author-link=Elio Gaspari |title=A Ditadura Envergonhada |year=2002 |publisher=Cia. das Letras |location=São Paulo |isbn=85-359-0277-5 |page=125}}</ref>

Within two years, in accord with concessions promised to the U.S. government for its financial support of the overthrow, foreign companies gained control of about half of the Brazilian industry. This type of foreign intrusion was often accomplished through combined fiscal and monetary measures, "constructive bankruptcy" that caused the choice of selling out or going broke. By 1971, of the 19 of Brazil's 27 largest companies that were not state-owned, 14 were foreign-owned.<ref>Williams, P. 2015.

The US ambassador at the time, [[Lincoln Gordon]], and the military attaché, Colonel Vernon A. Walters, kept in constant contact with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] as the crisis progressed. Johnson urged taking action to support the overthrow of João Goulart by the military, as action against the "left-wing" Goulart government.<ref name="gwunsa">Kornbluh, Peter.

===Operation Brother Sam===
Operation Brother Sam was the codename given to Kennedy's plan to "prevent Brazil from becoming another China or Cuba". Kennedy believed Goulart was getting too friendly with anti-American radicals in the Brazilian government.<ref name=":3"/> Declassified transcripts of communications between Lincoln Gordon and the US government show that predicting an all-out civil war, and with the opportunity to get rid of a left-wing government in Brazil, Johnson authorized logistical materials to be in place and a US Navy task force led by an aircraft carrier to support the coup against Goulart. These included ammunition, motor oil, gasoline, aviation gasoline, and other materials to help in a potential civil war in sending US Navy tankers that were coming from [[Aruba]]. About 110 tons of ammunition and [[CS gas]] were made ready in [[New Jersey]] for a possible airlift to [[Viracopos Airport]] in [[Campinas]]. Potential support was also made available in the form of an ''"aircraft carrier'' ([[USS Forrestal (CV-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']])'' and two guided missile destroyers (expected arrive in area by April 10), (and) four destroyers"'', which sailed to Brazil under the guise of a military exercise.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d198 198.

=== CIA involvement ===
In the telegraphs, Gordon also acknowledges US involvement in ''"covert support for pro-democracy street rallies...and encouragement [of] democratic and anti-communist sentiment in Congress, armed forces, friendly labor, and student groups, church, and business"'' and that he ''"may be requesting modest supplementary funds for other covert action programs in the near future."''.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v31/d187 187.

=== March 28 ===
On March 28, 1964, several US government officials including Richard Helms, McGeorge Bundy, and Alexis Johnson met to discuss the situation in Brazil. The conversation emphasized discussion concerning Ambassador Gordon's message the day before. The memorandum of the conversation expressed the dilemma of Brazil's election. While it was considered preferable to "waffle through to the next election" the decision concluded that the US government did not want to "watch Brazil dribble down the drain while [waiting for the next election]." Concerning the Brazilian military, Bundy felt that it was a cause for worry if the military did not react. The principle concern was the military's response to Goulart. In response to Ambassador Gordon's request for military action, the officials at the meeting felt puzzled because they believed the Brazilian military to be adequately equipped. The memorandum discusses further details of Gordon's request, but concludes with several action plans. One of the plans of action gave orders to Bundy to influence the editors at the NY Times and the Washington Post to get satisfactory articles out concerning the situation with the Goulart government. At the heart of these action plans was the need to preserve oil interests.<ref>NSC,"Brazil" Top Secret, March 28, 1964 https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/</ref>

=== March 31, 1964 ===

A Department of the State telegram to US Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon, in Rio shows the US preparing to aid anti-Goulart forces. The US informs Lincoln that three things have occurred. Four American Navy tankers were directed to Brazil and expected between April 8 and the 13th. The US dispatched a naval task force to Brazil which included: an aircraft carrier, four destroyers, two destroyer escorts, and task force tankers. This was later corrected to one aircraft carrier, two guided missile destroyers, four destroyers, and task force tankers. The US assembled 110 tons of ammunition and sent it to São Paulo via airlift, as well as tear gas (later corrected to CS Agent). This airlift would incorporate ten cargo planes, six tankers, six fighters.  Later, the number of cargo planes was reduced to six.  The airlift would take 24–25 hours to occur upon request while involving ten cargo planes.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

At the bottom of the document, the reports claim "Dispatch of tankers from Aruba and of naval task force does not immediately involve us in the Brazilian situation and is regarded by us as normal naval exercise." The CIA did intend to involve themselves in the Brazilian coup, but wanted to do so in secrecy until it was necessary.<ref>{{cite news|title=State Department Telegram to Embassy Rio De Janeiro|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz05.pdf|accessdate=January 27, 2017|agency=National Security Archive: CIA}}</ref>

In a telephone conversation, President Johnson spoke on the phone from his Texas ranch with Undersecretary of State George Ball and Assistant Secretary for Latin America, Thomas Mann. Ball briefed Johnson on that status of military moves in Brazil to overthrow the government of Joao Goulart who U.S. officials view as a leftist closely associated with the Brazilian Communist Party. Johnson gave Ball the go ahead to actively support the coup if U.S. backing is needed. Johnson stated, "I think we ought to take every step that we can, be prepared to do everything that we need to do." He also stated, "I'd get right on top of it and stick my neck out a little."<ref>{{cite web |title=President Lyndon B. Johnson discussing the impending coup in Brazil with Undersecretary of State George Ball |url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/index.htm |website=NSA Archive |date=March 31, 1964}}</ref>

=== April 1, 1964 ===

At a White House Meeting on April 1, 1964, Colonel King of the CIA began the briefing stating that the latest intelligence gathered showed a more favorable situation for the insurgents. This was largely due to indications that General Kruel was moving Second Army troops to the São Paulo Border.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk claimed that the Ambassador to Brazil, Lincoln Gordon was not advising that the United States should support Brazil at the time. Despite the proclamation, the two men had previously agreed to provide Brazil support. Instead, this declaration was intended to signal that the United States would not overtly support Brazil. This was because Rusk was concerned that if the United States intervened in Brazil, that would provide Goulart with a reason to become opposed to the United States. However the rebel residents of São Paulo - referred to as the Paulistas - had asked the United States for aid, but had not requested specific items or funds.

At the same meeting Secretary of Defense, Robert Strange McNamara reported that the United States had military aid waiting for the proper Brazilian request. McNamara noted the existence of arms and ammunition waiting to be airlifted to Brazil from New Jersey, a Navy tanker that was being diverted from Aruba to Brazil, and American financed Norwegian boat headed to Buenos Aires with aviation fuel. This demonstrates the United States' tacit willingness to support the Brazilian cause despite Rusk's desire to keep this secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/bz06.pdf |title=Info |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>

A White House memorandum also dated April 1, 1964, highlighted that the White House knew that Goulart had gone into hiding and that the White House was unsure of his location due to the different intelligence reports that it had received about the situation. At the time of the memo, Gordon believed that the coup was "95% over" and that General Branco had "taken over Rio." Gordon reported that Branco "told us he doesn't need our help."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB465/docs/Document%2014%20memorandum%20for%20bundy.pdf|title=MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY|last=Chase|first=Gordon|date=1 April 1964}}</ref> The memo also stated that the White House had evidence that [[Pascoal Ranieri Mazzilli]] would become Brazil's temporary leader until an election could be conducted.

=== April and May 1964 ===
A ''Washington Daily News'' article, titled "Castro Plots in Brazil Confirmed", asserts that "Brazil's new anticommunist regime has discovered hard evidence that Castro's Cuba was aiding subversion in their country."<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP88-01315R000400130100-6.pdf|title=Castro Plots in Brazil Confirmed (General CIA Records)|last=Prewett|first=Virginia|date=April 10, 1964|work=Washington Daily News|access-date=March 14, 2017|archive-url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp88-01315r000400130100-6|archive-date=December 16, 2016}}</ref> The article's premise is that this news firmly classifies Brazil as newly anti-Castro/Cuba. The author of the piece, Virginia Prewett, does not detail how this information was obtained, nor how (or whether) it was independently verified. Rather, the piece extrapolates from this initial statement implication for other Organization of American States (OAS: the world's oldest regional organization, dating back to ... 1948 ... established in order to achieve among its member states{{nbsp}}..."an order of peace and justice, to promote their solidarity, to strengthen their collaboration, and to defend their sovereignty, their territorial integrity, and their independence")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/en/about/who_we_are.asp|title=OAS - Who We Are|website=OAS.org|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref> member states. Prewett mentions two upcoming OAS meetings; the first was slated to deal with a "showdown over Cuban subversion," the second dealing with "the problem of coups."<ref name=":1" /> The article goes on to describe Venezuela as being highly involved in OAS proceedings. Confusingly, though, the article says that Venezuela does not recognize the governments of Haiti, Guatemala, Ecuador, or the Dominican Republic, as they were the products of coups; the new Brazilian government, however, was likely to be deemed as legitimate by Venezuela. The article concludes by commenting on other OAS member states' reactions to Brazil's anti-Cuban stance: Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico will look to Brazil for leadership, rather than listening to the United States or Venezuela; Argentina and Uruguay, though fence-straddlers, were expected to back Brazil and its new government (rather than Cuba or Venezuela), too.

By May 1964, Brazil's break with Cuba was being recognized on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. Representative [[Paul Rogers (politician)|Paul G. Rogers]] of Florida addressed the Speaker of the House on May 14, 1964, saying that "credit is due the new Government of Brazil for ending diplomatic relations with the Communist regime of Cuba."<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP66B00403R000200170064-0.pdf|title=Brazil's Break With Cuba - Extension of Remarks (Congressional Record - Appendix)|date=May 18, 1964|website=cia.gov|accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref> His speech says that "the fall of leftist Joao Goulart's regime" helped Brazil reverse its course, "which seemed to be taking it away from the democratic community of the hemisphere."<ref name=":2" /> His remarks seem to collaborate the aforementioned ''Washington Daily News'' article, which considers the reaction of other countries. Specifically, Rogers predicts that Brazil will become a leader in "our sister continent," disregarding Cuba. Rogers calls out four other countries as being Cuba supporters—Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, and Uruguay—and publicly ask the OAS to utilize "stepped-up measures...to isolate Communist Cuba in this hemisphere."<ref name=":2" />

== Arrests and interrogation ==
In July 1972, a three-page telegram from the American Embassy in Brasilia to the US Secretary of State's office outlined the "Allegation of Torture in Brazil."<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://cnv.memoriasreveladas.gov.br/images/pdf/docs/Doc16_53384-6-006.pdf |title=53384-6-6.pdf |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> The memo alludes to the "peak" of "allegations" of torture, as acknowledged by "high Brazilian officials," stretched from 1968 until the "first half of 1971." The memo credits the marked "reduction" in torture or allegations of torture to the "great part of GOB success in substantially reducing [the] number of active terrorists," but the memo acknowledges that "ample evidence" continues to reveal "harsh interrogation techniques are still being employed at regional and local levels, in some areas and by some security units more flagrantly than in others." "Rightly or wrongly," the telegram continued, "many Brazilians attribute the success of anti-terrorism program to the strength of measures employed against subversives and there are indications that most Brazilians exercising influence upon the regime are prepared to accept international criticism so long as the government considers these measures to be necessary." The American Embassy warned through the memo that US relations with Brazil remained fragile, arguing that "efforts by any branch of US government or by US political figures to bring pressure on Brazil would not only damage our general relations but, by equating reduction in anti-terror measures with weakness under pressure, could produce opposite of intended result." "[With] respect to new formulation contained in state 117951," the memo predicts, "it obviously would be impossible now or at any time in the future to be in a position realistically to certify that the GOB is not engaged in torture of political prisoners."<ref name="auto"/>

A number of reports reveal the numbers of suspects arrested in Brazil and the different techniques used to torture suspects during the process of interrogation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB478/|title=Brazil: Torture Techniques Revealed in Declassified U.S. Documents – Dictatorship-Era Records Given By Vice President Biden to President Rousseff Detail "Psychophysical" Systems of Torture, Secret Executions – 43 State Department Records Made Public By Brazilian Truth Commission }}</ref> A report written on April 16, 1973 to the U.S. Department of State, "Widespread Arrests And Psychophysical Interrogation Of Suspected Subversive," gave specific details that accounted for what happened in Brazil. According to the report, there had been a dramatic increase in arrests in 1973, with a specific week period. The majority of the suspects were university students. These students were arrested within several weeks in the Rio area. When arrested and interrogated, the suspects were "submitted to the old methods of physical violence, which sometimes cause death." The increase in the number of suspects stemmed from the police report, especially on individuals who were jailed before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB478/docs/doc1.pdf|title=National Security Archives: Arrests and Interrogations }}</ref>

Another report, dated April 18, 1973, highlighted that over 300 individuals were arrested for subversive activities. Though the report listed students as the most substantial portion of the arrests, individuals such as university professors, journalists, and physicians were also detained. The method for torture upon a suspect who was picked up usually began with the suspect being forced into a car at gunpoint by an undercover policeman. A veil was then placed over the detainee's head and he was then instructed to lie down in the back of the police vehicle while he was being transported. Upon arrival the captive was stripped naked and forced to sit in either a refrigerated or darken cell for several hours, with loudspeakers broadcasting screaming, sirens, and whistles at high-decibel levels. The suspect was then interrogated by agents, who informed him of the charges and told him how far they would go to extract the information from him. If the detainee was still unco-operative, he was subjected to increasingly-painful physical and mental torture, such as being placed in a room nude with a metal floor that hd an electrical current pulsating through it. The suspect would be kept in that room for several hours. If the suspect did not yet confess, he would be transferred to other "special effects" room, all while he was denied food and water. Though the document references trials by military tribunals and arrests made by members of the military, the document also makes note of the use of the Brazilian police in the interrogation and torture process. Individuals labeled as hardened terrorists or known radical subversives usually faced an expedited execution process. A common practice for executions was to use a technique known as "the shootout technique," in which the executed subject was deemed to have died in a "shootout" with the police.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB478/docs/doc1.pdf |title=Documents |publisher=nsarchive.gwu.edu |accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>
