==Biography==
Daboub worked in both the public and private sectors, as well as in academia. He led family-owned businesses for nearly a decade before joining the board of CEL, El Salvador's electric utility, and he presided over El Salvador's electric distribution companies.  Subsequently, he was named president of ANTEL, the state-owned telecommunications company, which he re-structured and privatized through a competitive process.  Daboub served in three different governments over twelve years without belonging to any political party, and then returned to the private sector. In 2004, one electronic news paper enquired about a claim of abuse of authority, an investigation was never conducted due to a lack of proofs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archivo.elfaro.net/secciones/noticias/20050829/noticias1_20050829.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120022513/http://archivo.elfaro.net/secciones/noticias/20050829/noticias1_20050829.asp |archive-date=2014-01-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From 2004 to 2006, Daboub joined former [[Francisco Flores Pérez|President Flores]] of El Salvador in forming the America Libre Institute, where he worked in several projects implementing proven public policies that had been successfully deployed throughout Latin America. In 2014, this Institute was part of an investigation conducted by politicians from political parties opposite to that of Former President Flores for possible misuse of donations from Taiwan; a case is open in Court to determine if any wrongdoing was ever committed by Former President Flores.<ref>http://www.elfaro.net/es/201312/noticias/14145/ Fiscalía informó a EUA que investiga a expresidente Flores "por corrupción política"</ref>

==Controversy At World Bank==

Daboub was appointed a managing director for the World Bank by former World Bank President [[Paul D. Wolfowitz]]. During Daboub's World Bank tenure, he was alleged in 2007 to have deleted references to family planning in World Bank documents, and to have tried to water down references to global warming in Bank publications as well.<ref>Krishna Guha, "Wolfowitz Deputy Under Fire for Climate Change", The Financial Times, April 24, 2007, updated April 25, 2007, accessed December 16, 2009.</ref><ref>Nicole Gaouette, "World Bank May Target Family Planning: Repeated Absence of References to Birth Control in Internal Reports Alarms Women's Health Advocates", The Los Angeles Times, April 19, 2007, accessed December 16, 2009.</ref> It is thought{{by whom|date=April 2015}} that these actions were done without the knowledge of Wolfowitz, who at that time was engrossed in controversy regarding a personal relationship with a World Bank employee. However, there is no proof of the above controversy.
