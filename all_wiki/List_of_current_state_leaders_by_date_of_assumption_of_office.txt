{{short description|Current state leaders by date of assumption of office}}
{{pp|small=yes}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II in March 2015.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Elizabeth II]] is the world's longest-serving current state leader, having reigned as Queen of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Canada]], [[Monarchy of Australia|Australia]], and [[Monarchy of New Zealand|New Zealand]] since 1952.]]

This is a '''list of current state leaders''' ordered by their continuous tenure in a position of national leadership. In countries with different [[Head of state|heads of state]] and [[Head of government|heads of government]], both offices are listed. For leaders who held the same office prior to their [[Sovereign state|state]]'s independence, the start of their tenure is used, not independence. For a list of heads of state taking dates of independence into account, see [[List of heads of state by diplomatic precedence]].

Acting presidents are included in this list, but if a leader has non-consecutive terms, only the current period of service is listed.

[[Sovereign state|States]] where head of state differs from head of government are mainly [[parliamentary system]]s. Often a leader holds both positions in [[presidential system]]s or [[dictatorship]]s. Some states have [[semi-presidential system]]s where the head of government role is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state.
