'''Benenden School''' is an [[independent school|independent]] [[boarding school]] for girls in [[Kent]], [[England]]. It is located in [[Hemsted Park]] at [[Benenden]] in the Kent countryside, between [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook]] and [[Tenterden]].

Today Benenden remains an all-boarding school for over 500 girls aged 11 to 18. The headmistress is Samantha Price (previously head of [[Godolphin School]], [[Salisbury]], [[Wiltshire]]), who took over from Claire Oulton in January 2014.

==Facilities==
The school occupies a Victorian mansion, set in 240 acres of gardens and woodland in the Weald of Kent. Living, learning, sporting and leisure facilities are clustered around the original 19th-century mansion. There have been, and continue to be, many improvements to the site. There is a sports centre (known as "SPLASH"), a humanities building ("Leelands"), a design technology centre, study centre (Clarke Centre) and a theatre and drama teaching complex (completed summer 2007) at the cost of £2.3 million. The study centre consists of the Eugenia Leung Library and classrooms. A new science centre, one of the most advanced centres of scientific learning available in the independent sector, was opened by the [[Princess Royal]] on 10 October 2012. The school's most recent enhancement has been the construction of an all-weather sports pitch and pavilion in September 2016.

==History==

===Hemsted Park===
{{main|Hemsted Park}}
[[File:Hemsted Park, Benenden.jpg|thumb|Hemsted Park c. 1870]]
The grounds which the school now occupies are known as [[Hemsted Park]]. The earliest available records show the land in the possession of [[Odo, Earl of Kent]], the man believed to have commissioned the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], having been given it—among much other property in the county—by his half-brother [[William the Conqueror]].<ref name="hist">[http://www.benenden.kent.sch.uk/2309/overview/history-of-benenden "History of Benenden"], Benenden.</ref>

The first property on the site was a house built by Robert of Hemsted in 1216. In the late 14th century, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] granted the manor to William of Guldeford. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] visited [[Guldeford baronets|Thomas Guldeford]] at the house and he was knighted by her at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] a few days later.<ref name="hist"/>

In 1718 the property was sold to Admiral [[John Norris (Royal Navy officer)|Sir John Norris]], the commander-in-chief of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s navy. He did a lot of work landscaping the property, forming much of the park as it is now.<ref name="hist"/>

Thomas Hallett Hodges bought the house in 1786. He reduced the size of the building and filled in the moat that had until that point encircled it. He also created the lake in the grounds.
The [[Elizabethan architecture|Elizabethan property]] was demolished in 1860 following the acquisition of the estate by [[Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook|Lord Cranbrook]]. He commissioned the building of a new house, the extant Hemsted House, employing [[David Brandon (architect)|David Brandon]], president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] to design the new mansion. The house, which featured a prominent tower and was described as having "alarming vitality" was subsequently remodelled in 1912 by Herbert Cescinsky at the behest of its new owner, newspaper magnate and later Lord Rothermere, [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Harold Harmsworth]]. The remodelling saw the "vitality" toned down and the upper levels of the tower removed.<ref name="hist"/> It is now listed at grade II.<ref name="Historic England">{{NHLE|desc=Benenden country house|num=1000195|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref>

===Benenden School===
The school was founded in 1923 by three teachers from [[Wycombe Abbey]], Christine Sheldon CBE, Anne Hindle MBE and Kathleen Bird, who aimed to create a "happy school with personal integrity and service to others always in mind, where everyone would be given the chance to follow her own bent". It hence maintains sister school ties with Wycombe Abbey, as well as [[Godstowe Preparatory School]], High Wycombe, and [[St Leonards School]].

In July 1923 the first council meeting of the new school was held and 24 girls were registered. The new school had a temporary home in Bickley for the first term while the three founders set about finding a new permanent site, requiring at least 70 bedrooms and large grounds. In January 1924 Hemsted Park, near Benenden village in Kent, was leased to the Founders and the school was named Benenden School, to avoid confusion with Hemel Hempstead. In March 1924 The Benenden School (Kent) Limited prospectus was issued at £10 each; five shares entitled the holder to give a nomination to the school. Every parent was encouraged to pay a year's fees in advance. In September 1924 there were 126 girls on the school roll and in October 1924 the new Benenden School purchased Hemsted House for £20,000.

1927 was an important year for Benenden with the roll reaching 200. The first general inspection was made and Benenden was recognised as 'efficient'. The Seniors' Association was established and the school magazine was inaugurated.

As the school grew, so more boarding houses were established or constructed: Norris House in 1924, Medway and Marshall in 1925, Echyngham in 1930 and Guldeford in 1936. The dining room was also built in 1936 with the school hall following in 1938.

The school was evacuated to Newquay in 1940. The school moved to the Hotel Bristol in Newquay, Cornwall, with Christine Sheldon and Kathleen Bird, two of the founders. Anne Hindle stayed at Benenden to look after the estate. She persuaded the Ministry of Health to use Benenden as a military hospital. On 3 August 1944, Capitaine [[Jean Maridor]], a Free French pilot, died saving the school buildings and military hospital from being struck by a German [[V-1 flying bomb]].

The founders retired in 1954 and Elizabeth Clarke CVO became Headmistress. In 1963 [[Princess Anne]] and [[Princess Basma bint Talal|Princess Basma of Jordan]] became pupils at Benenden. Janet Allen became Headmistress in 1976. The Jubilee Wing was opened by Janet Allen and Kathleen Bird in 1977.

Gillian duCharme became Headmistress in 1985. The new Guldeford House opened the following year. The 1987 hurricane hit Benenden hard and over 250 trees were lost in the parkland. Further expansion to the school began with the opening of the new science and medical wing, Leelands, in 1988. SPLASH opened in 1990. Two further sixth-form houses opened in 1993 (Limes and Oaks).

The 75th anniversary of the school was celebrated in 1998–99 with a service at St Paul's Cathedral and a programme of special events for Seniors at Benenden, St James's Palace and other London venues. The book ''Benenden: A Great Company'' by David Souden was published. The school play, written for the occasion, ''A Great Company'' was performed at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], Haymarket.

Claire Oulton, Head of St Catherine's Bramley and a graduate from [[Somerville College, Oxford]], was appointed Headmistress in 2000. In 2001 the Clarke Centre with the Eugenia Leung Library was completed. Norris House was redeveloped in 2003, creating new study bedrooms. The school dining room and cloisters were refurbished. The "new stage" theatre fundraising campaign was launched.

The new theatre was opened by [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in 2007 and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' was its first production in December that year. The Seniors' Window was added to the chapel as part of a refurbishment and rededication. The following year the eco-classroom, a totally self-sustaining building, opened in the Victorian Water Gardens. A new cafe was added to the dining room in 2010.

The Benenden Science Centre was opened by the [[Princess Royal]] on 10 October 2012. The Leelands building was refurbished and became a classroom block for Humanities subjects. The new All-Weather Pitch and Pavilion was opened by television personality [[Davina McCall]] on 10 September 2016. Primarily for Lacrosse and Hockey, the new facility allows girls to train in all weather and in the mornings and evenings. After their first season training on the new pitch, Benenden's 1st lacrosse team won the National Schools Championships.

==Boarding==
Benenden is a full-boarding school and has around 540 to 550 girls. Benenden says that its boarding ethos is to complement, not replace, family life. All students live in ten boarding houses. There are six junior boarding houses (ages 11–16), consisting of Marshall, Medway, Guldeford, Echyngham, Norris and Hemsted. The senior students, in their last two years (16–18), go to sixth-form houses called Beeches, Elms, Limes and Oaks, which make up the sixth-form centre, known as Founders. Sixth-formers remain members of their junior house and take up positions of responsibility in them. Founders has 184 single study bedrooms.

Each boarding house has a housemistress or housemaster, a deputy housemistress or housemaster, a team of matrons (resident, day and evening) as well as tutors. All teaching staff and a significant number of administrative staff are house tutors. The role of the tutor is to provide individual weekly support and guidance.

==Curricular activities==
Benenden's stated aim is for its academic programme to encourage a lifelong enthusiasm for learning and discovery. The school has two main objectives: for every girl to achieve the best possible academic standards and qualifications, and for each girl to experience the maximum enjoyment in her learning. The curriculum is traditional, but also broad and forward-looking enough to provide education in its widest sense.

There is a traditional school hall where morning prayers are taken. The entire school must assemble for this every morning, except Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, at 8:30. There is also a small chapel. Occasionally, the Sunday services are taken in the village church, about 15 to 20 minutes' walk away.

Lessons at the school start at 9&nbsp;am and carry on until 5:30&nbsp;pm. There are six periods in the day; each lesson is one hour long. Sports practices take place during the lunch break as well as after lessons end. In addition there are two hours' worth of lessons on Saturday mornings. Younger students will take a mixture of all subjects offered, as well as sports, music and PSHE classes.

Pupils studying for their GCSEs must generally take 10 or 11 subjects, including Mathematics, Science and English and one modern language. Classes average around 13 students at GCSE, and 6–8 students during A Levels. Drama and the Arts are popular; the school's annual play has on occasion been performed in London theatres such as the [[London Palladium|Palladium]] (''[[Me and My Girl]]''; 2002). The 2007 play was ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', held in the new theatre, completed in February 2007. Productions since then have included ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', ''[[Grimm Tales (play)|Grimm Tales]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''Kiss Me Kate'' and ''Les Miserables''.

The school years are known, in order, as follows: Fourths (IV), Upper Fourths (UIV), Lower Fifths (LVths), Fifths (V), Upper Fifths (UV), Six Ones (VI1) and Six Twos (VI2). Each year around 24 school prefects are nominated, called Upper Sixths. Instead of wearing the normal navy blue sixth-form uniform, they wear white- and red-striped blouses and grey jumpers. The prefects are known as "grey jumpers".

==Extracurriculars==
[[File:Lax1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Benenden Lacrosse team at the National School Tournament 2000]]

Benenden offers a range of extracurricular activities. The belief is that these lead to a more rounded education and strongly favour individualism.

===Sports===
Main school sports include, [[lacrosse]], [[netball]], [[rounders]] and [[tennis]]. Girls often play these at county and sometimes national levels; a current senior England lacrosse player was introduced as head of lacrosse in 2008. Other activities include hockey, fencing, badminton, volleyball, swimming, golf, riding, judo, tae kwondo, trampolining, rounders, football, aerobics, athletics, rugby sevens (Kent Girls Under-18 Champions 2009) and squash. Tours abroad are occasionally organised.
