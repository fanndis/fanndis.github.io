'''''Desert Island Discs''''' is a radio programme broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]]. It was first broadcast on the [[BBC Forces Programme]] on 29 January 1942.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9045319/Desert-Island-Discs-Britains-longest-running-radio-show.html|title=Desert Island Discs: Britain's longest-running radio show |work=The Telegraph |date=29 January 2012 |location=London |first=Neil |last=Midgley}}</ref>

Each week a guest, called a '[[castaway]]' during the programme, is asked to choose eight recordings (usually, but not always, music), a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a [[desert island]], whilst discussing their lives and the reasons for their choices. It was devised and originally presented by [[Roy Plomley]]. Since 2018 the programme has been presented by [[Lauren Laverne]].

More than 3,000 episodes have been recorded, with some guests having appeared more than once and some episodes featuring more than one guest.<ref name="FaC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=29 August 2014}}</ref> An example of a guest who falls into both categories is [[Bob Monkhouse]], who appeared with his co-writer [[Denis Goodwin]] on 12 December 1955 and in his own right on 20 December 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/find-a-castaway?q=bob+monkhouse&type=all|title=Desert Island Discs – Find a castaway|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=18 April 2017}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In February 2019 a panel of broadcasting industry experts named ''Desert Island Discs'' the "greatest radio programme of all time".<ref name="BBC News 12 February 2019">{{cite web | title= Desert Island Discs 'greatest radio show of all time'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47204636| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 12 February 2019| website= [[BBC News Online]] | access-date= 28 February 2019 }}</ref>

==Format==
Guests are invited to imagine themselves [[castaway|cast away]] on a [[desert island]], and choose eight recordings, originally gramophone records, to take with them; discussion of their choices permits a review of their life. Excerpts from their choices are played or, in the case of short pieces, the whole work. At the end of the programme they choose the one piece they regard most highly. Guests are also automatically given the ''[[Complete Works of Shakespeare]]'' and either the [[Bible]] or another appropriate religious or philosophical work. They are then prompted to select a third book to accompany them. Popular choices include [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Jane Austen]]. Actress [[Judi Dench]], who has [[macular degeneration]], was permitted to take an [[audiobook]] in place of a printed manuscript.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/11218144/Desert-Island-Discs-racks-up-a-milestone-of-delights.html |title=Desert Island Discs racks up a milestone of delights |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06bd681 |title=BBC Radio 4 – Desert Island Discs, Dame Judi Dench |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-25 |access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>

Guests also choose one luxury, which must be inanimate and of no use in escaping the island or allowing communication from outside. [[Roy Plomley]]<ref name = "DID BBC 2002">{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1787472.stm

After Plomley's death in 1985, the programme was presented by [[Michael Parkinson]], from 1988 to 2006 by [[Sue Lawley]] and from 2006 to 2018 by [[Kirsty Young]].<ref name = "DID BBC 2002"/> Young was replaced by [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] presenter [[Lauren Laverne]], who interviewed Olympic diver [[Tom Daley]] for her first show, broadcast on 30 September 2018. Laverne was initially only drafted in as an interim presenter, while Young took [[sick leave|time off]] due to complications of [[fibromyalgia]], but following her decision not to return in July 2019, it was announced that Laverne would continue for "the foreseeable future".<ref name = BBC818>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45353719|title = Kirsty Young to take time out from Desert Island Discs|date = 30 August 2018|website = [[BBC News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48882335|title = Kirsty Young to stand down from Desert Island Discs|date = 5 July 2019|website = [[BBC News]]}}</ref>

The first castaway was [[Vic Oliver]], and several castaways, including [[Celia Johnson]], [[Arthur Askey]], [[Trevor Nunn]], [[John Schlesinger]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Terry Wogan]], [[Brian Rix]], [[David Attenborough]] and [[Adele Leigh]] have been cast away more than once. The most requested piece of music over the first 60 years was "Ode to Joy", the last movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1879322.stm "Beethoven tops island hit list"], BBC News, 18 March 2002</ref> One of the most remarked broadcasts was [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]]'s 1958 selection of seven of her own recordings.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8355952/Desert-Island-Discs-most-popular-requests.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Laura | last=Roberts | title=Desert Island Discs' most popular requests | date=2 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title = Elisabeth Schwarzkopf |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/51ed3e16#p009y865 |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1958}}</ref> This record was subsequently beaten by British pianist Dame [[Moura Lympany]] on her second appearance on the programme on 28 July 1979 when all eight of her selections were of her own recordings.<ref>{{cite episode |title = Dame Moura Lympany |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/35a36972#p009mx7g |series = Desert Island Discs |network = BBC Radio 4 |airdate = 28 July 1979}}</ref> In the early 1970s, Roy Plomley attempted to interview [[Alistair MacLean]], but ended up speaking to somebody else with the same name – and the programme was never broadcast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pile|first=Stephen|title=The Book of Heroic Failures|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofheroicfail00pile|url-access=registration|edition=1980|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofheroicfail00pile/page/29 29–30]|publisher=Futura|ISBN=0-7088-1908-7}}</ref> In January 1981, [[Princess Margaret|Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], appeared as a castaway on the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mvhf|title=HRH Princess Margaret, Desert Island Discs - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>

==Opening theme==
Plomley originally wanted the sounds of "surf breaking on a shore and the cries of sea birds" to open and close each programme. However, Leslie Prowne, the head of popular record programmes at the [[BBC]], was concerned that it lacked definition and insisted that music should also be used. Plomley and the series' producer Frederic Piffard selected "[[By the Sleepy Lagoon]]", composed by [[Eric Coates]] (who appeared on the show in 1951). The tune has been used since the first transmission in 1942. The sound of [[herring gulls]] has accompanied the music except for a period of time in 1964 when tropical bird sounds were used.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magee |first=Sean |title= Desert Island Discs: 70 Years Of Castaways |publisher=Bantam Press |date=13 September 2012 |page=8 |chapter=Chapter 2:1940s |isbn=978-0-593-07006-2}}</ref>

==Copyright status==
Until late September 2009, ''Desert Island Discs'' could not be heard on the BBC's [[iPlayer]] service, which allows most programmes to be heard up to a week after transmission. The programme's website<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/desertislanddiscs.shtml |title=Desert Island Discs – Home |publisher=BBC |access-date=2014-07-28}}</ref> stated that this was due to rights issues, as explained in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article681767.ece|title=How a man in his pyjamas invented a radio classic|work=The Sunday Times |date=2 July 2006 | access-date=25 February 2011|location=London|first=Charles|last=Bremner}}</ref>

It was announced on 27 September 2009 that an agreement had been reached as a result of which the programme would be available to stream via the iPlayer.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2009/09/desert_island_discs_iplayer.html |author=Mark Damazer|title=BBC – Radio 4 Blog: Desert Island Discs comes to iPlayer |publisher=BBC |date=27 September 2009|access-date=27 September 2009 }}</ref> The first episode available through the iPlayer was with [[Barry Manilow]]. Subsequently, the programme was also made available as a podcast,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/28/desert-island-discs-bbc-iplayer |title=BBC launches Radio 4's Desert Island Discs on iPlayer |work=The Guardian  |access-date=28 September 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=28 September 2009}}</ref> beginning with the edition broadcast on 29 November 2009, which featured [[Morrissey]]. However, due to music clearance issues, the music selections on the podcast versions are reduced to only playing for around 30 seconds or so (and in rare instances are unavailable, as mentioned in an announcement made by the presenter at the appropriate point of the programme).

On 30 March 2011, the BBC placed more than 500 episodes from the show's archive online to listen to via iPlayer. Other episodes have since been added, both new and old.

In the early years of the BBC, programmes were broadcast live and were generally not recorded. This, in addition to the BBC's policy of [[wiping]] that was applied during the 1950s and 1960s, means very few episodes from the first 20 years of the show are known to exist; the earliest episode still in existence was broadcast on 25 April 1951 and features actress [[Margaret Lockwood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p009ycqy|title=Desert Island Discs - Margaret Lockwood - BBC Sounds|publisher=BBC|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Several extracts were preserved for posterity at the request of the guests, such as an extract featuring [[Alfred Hitchcock]] where he speaks about his films ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) and ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), gives his view on the changing landscape of the film industry and briefly discusses his then upcoming film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960).
