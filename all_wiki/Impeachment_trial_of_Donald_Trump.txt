The '''impeachment trial of Donald Trump''', the 45th and incumbent president of the United States, began in the [[U.S. Senate]] on January 16, 2020, and concluded with his acquittal on February 5.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/801429948/not-guilty-trump-acquitted-on-2-articles-of-impeachment-as-historic-trial-closes 'Not Guilty': Trump Acquitted On 2 Articles Of Impeachment As Historic Trial Closes] (Senate Republicans would not allow evidence to be submitted into the record, officially.) {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206152432/https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/801429948/not-guilty-trump-acquitted-on-2-articles-of-impeachment-as-historic-trial-closes |date=February 6, 2020 }} by Philip Ewing, [[NPR]], February 5, 2020, 4:33 PM ET</ref> After [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an inquiry]] between September to November 2019, President [[Donald Trump|Trump]] was [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|impeached]] by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on December 18, 2019; the [[articles of impeachment]] charge him with [[abuse of power]] and [[obstruction of Congress]]. It was the third impeachment trial of a U.S. president, preceded by those [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|of Andrew Johnson]] and [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|of Bill Clinton]].{{efn|[[Richard Nixon]] resigned before he could be impeached and put on trial.}} 

The Republican majority voted on January 21 to reject 11 amendments proposed by Democrats which requested subpoena authority to introduce testimony from current and former White House officials, and [[Trump administration]] documents which were not provided to House investigators. The prosecution made its opening arguments on January 22–24, and the defense made its arguments on January 25–28. This was followed by a period of questions, answers, and debate on January 29–31. On January 31, a Senate majority of 51 Republican senators voted against allowing subpoenas to call witnesses or documents.

On February 5, the Senate acquitted Trump on both impeachment articles, as neither article obtained the support of a two-thirds supermajority of senators. Fifty-two Republican senators voted against the charge of abuse of power, and all fifty-three voted against the charge of obstruction of Congress. [[Mitt Romney]] became the first U.S. senator in history to cast a vote to convict and remove the President of their own political party from office.

== Background ==

{{See|Impeachment in the United States|U.S. presidential impeachment}}
[[File:House Resolution 755 — Articles of Impeachment Against President Donald J. Trump.pdf|thumb|The articles of impeachment against President Trump]]

Under the [[U.S. Constitution]], the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] has the sole power of impeachment ([[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment|Article I, Section 2, Clause&nbsp;5]]), and after that action has been taken, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] has the sole power to hold the trial for all impeachments ([[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachment|Article I, Section 3, Clause 6]]).
Trump is the third U.S. president to face a Senate impeachment trial, after [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/what-happens-after-impeachment|title=What Happens After Impeachment|last=Roos|first=Dave|website=History|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219180008/https://history.com/news/what-happens-after-impeachment|archive-date=December 19, 2019|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>

After the emergence of Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president [[Volodymyr Zelensky]], House leadership came to the conclusion that impeachment might be necessary, and began [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|an inquiry]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/pelosi-impeachment-inquiry-trump-ukraine|title=Pelosi announces impeachment inquiry into Trump over Ukraine scandal|last=Gambino|first=Lauren|date=September 25, 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 20, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219052046/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/24/pelosi-impeachment-inquiry-trump-ukraine|archive-date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>

As this was happening, Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] was quietly planning a possible trial. On October 8, 2019, he led a meeting on the subject, advising the Republican Senators to craft their responses according to their own political needs. McConnell proposed two potential avenues: state opposition to the House process, or refuse to comment due to being potential [[jurors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-impeachment-senate-republicans-20191109-bsrbhhe37vdy3bcdirub7lo4bm-story.html|title=How Mitch McConnell is managing impeachment and a fragmenting Republican response|last=Mascaro|first=Lisa|date=November 9, 2019|website=Chicago Tribune|url-status=live|access-date=December 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217011132/https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-impeachment-senate-republicans-20191109-bsrbhhe37vdy3bcdirub7lo4bm-story.html|archive-date=December 17, 2019}}</ref>

=== Republican plans ===

As the articles of impeachment moved to a vote before the full House and referral to the Senate for trial, Mitch McConnell met with White House Counsel [[Pat Cipollone]] and congressional liaison [[Eric Ueland]], later stating, "Everything I do during this I'm coordinating with the White House counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position as to how to handle this{{nbsp}}... I'm going to take my cues from the president's lawyers." As part of the "total coordination", McConnell said the president's lawyers could decide if witnesses would be called for the trial.<ref name=total>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/474399-mcconnell-says-hell-be-in-total-coordination-with-white-house-on-impeachment|title=McConnell says he'll be in 'total coordination' with White House on impeachment trial strategy|first=Jordain|last=Carney|date=December 12, 2019|website=The Hill}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Aaron |title=McConnell indicates he'll let Trump's lawyers dictate Trump's impeachment trial |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/mcconnell-says-hell-let-trumps-white-house-dictate-trumps-impeachment-trial/ |accessdate=January 23, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219124528/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/13/mcconnell-says-hell-let-trumps-white-house-dictate-trumps-impeachment-trial/ |archive-date=December 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> McConnell also said there was "no chance" the Senate would convict Trump and remove him from office, while declaring his wish that all Senate Republicans would acquit Trump of both charges.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Egan |first1=Lauren |title=McConnell: 'There's no chance' Trump is removed from office |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286 |publisher=NBC News |accessdate=December 16, 2019 |date=December 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215202600/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/mcconnell-there-s-no-chance-trump-removed-office-n1101286 |archive-date=December 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> On December 14, Judiciary Committee chairman [[Lindsey Graham]] said, "I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind.

Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the U.S. Constitution states that "The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments." Per the Senate's impeachment rules adopted in 1986, the submission of the articles to the Senate initiated the trial.<ref name=rules>{{cite web |title=Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SMAN-113/pdf/SMAN-113-pg223.pdf |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |accessdate=January 3, 2020 |p=223 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215042254/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SMAN-113/pdf/SMAN-113-pg223.pdf |archive-date=December 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On January 18, 2020, the House trial managers released a 111-page trial memorandum, which included new evidence from after Trump was impeached, such as the [[Government Accountability Office]]'s conclusion that it was illegal for the Trump administration to have withheld military aid to Ukraine without informing Congress—a violation of the [[Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. Trump attorneys released a six-page response to the articles of impeachment, criticizing what they described as a "lawless process", while not directly addressing the allegations that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine in an attempt to have Ukraine announce investigations of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/18/trump-impeachment-response-house-charges-100791|title='Brazen and unlawful': Trump team attacks House impeachment effort in first formal response|work=[[Politico]]|first1=Darren|last1=Samuelsohn|first2=Kyle|last2=Cheney|first3=Anita|last3=Kumar|date=January 18, 2020|accessdate=January 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118222016/https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/18/trump-impeachment-response-house-charges-100791|archive-date=January 18, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Itkowiz |first1=Colby |last2=DeBonis |first2=Mike |title=House Democrats say Senate 'must eliminate the threat' that the president poses to national security |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-say-senate-must-eliminate-the-threat-that-the-president-poses-to-americas-national-security/2020/01/18/c845ec04-3a03-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html |accessdate=January 21, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200119001137/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-say-senate-must-eliminate-the-threat-that-the-president-poses-to-americas-national-security/2020/01/18/c845ec04-3a03-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html |archivedate=January 19, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=James |title=Democrats, Trump spar in pre-trial impeachment filings |url=https://abc6onyourside.com/news/connect-to-congress/democrats-trump-spar-in-pre-trial-impeachment-filings |accessdate=January 21, 2020 |work=[[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] |date=January 21, 2020}}</ref> On January 20, House trial managers released a 9-page rebuttal to the original Trump response, rejecting the claim that Trump cannot be removed from office "even if the House proves every claim in the Articles of impeachment", as they argued that the Constitution "allows the Senate to remove Presidents who, like President Trump, abuse their power to cheat in elections, betray our national security, and ignore checks and balances".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lillis |first1=Mike |last2=Beavers |first2=Olivia |title=Democrats push back on White House impeachment claims, saying Trump believes he is above the law |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/479047-democrats-push-back-on-white-house-impeachment-claims-saying-trump-believes-he |accessdate=January 21, 2020 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200120182017/https://thehill.com/homenews/house/479047-democrats-push-back-on-white-house-impeachment-claims-saying-trump-believes-he |archive-date=January 20, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Procedural resolution and debate ==

On January 20, McConnell presented a resolution providing procedures for the trial, subject to approval by a simple majority vote. The resolution provided the White House counsel and House impeachment managers 24 hours each over two days to make opening statements, beginning at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. each day.

Also on January 21, Sekulow drew a parallel between Trump withholding aid to Ukraine and President Obama withholding aid to Egypt in 2013.

On January 22, Trump gave public comments on his impeachment trial: "I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material."

During statements in the Senate chamber regarding trial procedures, Trump attorneys Cipollone and Sekulow made significant false statements which had previously been asserted by Trump supporters but debunked. Cipollone asserted that Republican House members were not allowed to participate in closed-door hearings, when in fact all Republicans who were members of the three investigating committees were entitled to attend the hearings, and many did and questioned witnesses. Cipollone also accused Adam Schiff of manufacturing a fake transcript of Trump's comments during the Trump–Zelensky phone call, but Schiff had said in advance that he was paraphrasing Trump's words. Cipollone also misrepresented the genesis of the president's impeachment, falsely asserting that Schiff proceeded with his investigation despite knowing his allegations were false. Sekulow asserted that Trump was denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, examine the evidence, or have an attorney present during Judiciary Committee proceedings, though the White House was invited to exercise those rights, but declined, as the president had refused to cooperate in any way with the inquiry. Sekulow also falsely asserted that the [[Mueller Report]] had concluded that Trump did not engage in obstruction of justice.<ref>Multiple sources:

On January 22, the first day of opening arguments, Democrats presented evidence from House impeachment inquiry testimony, the Trump–Zelensky phone call and Trump's statements. Schiff started by asserting that Trump needs to be removed from office because he has shown he is ready and willing to cheat in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 elections]].

On day two, House managers presented arguments to assert the evidence warranted Trump's removal from office. Jerry Nadler argued that abuse, betrayal, and corruption, or the "ABCs" of impeachment make a strong case for removal. He played videos from the [[impeachment trial of Bill Clinton]] showing statements by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] arguing that impeachment does not necessitate the breaking of a law; Graham absented himself during the showing of the video. They also played videos of [[Fiona Hill (presidential advisor)|Fiona Hill]] and FBI director [[Chris Wray]] to debunk the notion that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. Sylvia Garcia and Adam Schiff argued several points to highlight why Trump's activities were inappropriate, including that he was not looking for an actual investigation but only an announcement of one, that the investigations were not official foreign policy and were carried out through unofficial channels, and that the White House first tried to bury the call. They pointed out that Trump himself told us he was looking for an investigation into the Bidens.

[[Chuck Schumer]] (D-NY) asked Adam Schiff for a reply, who asserted, "[I]f any part of the president's motive was a corrupt motive, that is enough to convict."<ref name=guardian_29 /> [[Ted Cruz]] (R-TX) asked if ''quid pro quo'' arrangements were common in foreign policy; Alan Dershowitz suggested there would be nothing wrong if the president asked a foreign country for help in his reelection because the president might think it was central to the best interests of the country. Schiff retorted that would give ''carte blanche'' to more interference in the future. Constitutional scholars such as [[Erwin Chemerinsky]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] said Dershowitz's stance was "absurd and outrageous" while [[Sanford Levinson]] of the [[University of Texas]] said it was "preposterous".<ref name=nbc_29>{{cite web|publisher=NBC News|title=Trump's Senate trial: Key moments from Day One of the question-and-answer phase|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-senate-trial-key-moments-day-1-question-answer-n1125871|first=Dareh|last=Gregorian|date=January 29, 2020|accessdate=January 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130031503/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-senate-trial-key-moments-day-1-question-answer-n1125871|archive-date=January 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Nikolas Bowie from [[Harvard Law School]], who was referenced by Dershowitz on several occasions, told [[CNN]] Dershowitz is wrong.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mediamatters.org/trump-impeachment-inquiry/nikolas-bowie-professor-repeatedly-cited-alan-dershowitz-during |title=Nikolas Bowie, professor repeatedly cited by Alan Dershowitz during impeachment trial, tells CNN Dershowitz is wrong |work=Media Matters |date=January 30, 2020 |accessdate=February 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213132327/https://www.mediamatters.org/trump-impeachment-inquiry/nikolas-bowie-professor-repeatedly-cited-alan-dershowitz-during |archive-date=February 13, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Five Republicans asked how the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] would feel about an impeachment that was supported by only one political party; Dershowitz opined that "The president is the executive branch.

Schiff said Bolton could clear up doubts about Trump's motives, while Philbin threatened that any attempt to get Bolton to testify would tie up the proceedings for months. Schiff said Chief Justice Roberts could rule on the question.<ref name=guardian_29 />

Dershowitz stirred controversy on January 29 by saying, "If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment." The statement elicited concerns among many that Dershowitz was asserting a president is above the law, with Schiff telling senators it was reminiscent of former president Nixon's assertion that "when the president does it, that means it is not illegal." Dershowitz insisted his comment was mischaracterized, later stating, "a president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants. He is not above the law. He cannot commit crimes."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/politics/dershowitz-trump-impeachment.html|title=Trump Lawyer's Impeachment Argument Stokes Fears of Unfettered Power|first=Charlie|last=Savage|date=January 30, 2020|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=January 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131020034/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/us/politics/dershowitz-trump-impeachment.html|archive-date=January 31, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The question and answer session continued on January 30. One of the first questions was how the Senate could find out when the $400 million hold was first ordered. Democratic House manager [[Jason Crow]] said that information was unknown but could be easily obtained with subpoenas for documents and witnesses, including Bolton. Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] cited Ambassador [[Gordon Sondland]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Senator Johnson]] in asking why Bolton should not be called to testify. Murkowski later joined [[Lamar Alexander]] in asking defense lawyers if withholding aid to Ukraine was impeachable; the lawyers said it is not. Senators [[Jack Reed (Rhode Island politician)|Jack Reed]] (D-RI), [[Tammy Duckworth]] (D-IL), and [[Kamala Harris]] (D-CA) asked both sides who was paying Rudy Giuliani. Schiff reported that he did not know, and Sekulow called the question unimportant.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NBC News|title=Trump's Senate trial: Key takeaways from senators' questions as witness vote in doubt|first=Dareh|last=Gregorian|date=January 30, 2020|accessdate=January 31, 2020|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-senate-trial-scores-questions-still-no-answer-witnesses-n1126916|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131022022/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/trump-s-senate-trial-scores-questions-still-no-answer-witnesses-n1126916|archive-date=January 31, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Senator [[John Thune]] (R-SD) conceded that Trump did what he was charged with, but that witnesses were not necessary and the actions were not impeachable. [[Kevin Cramer]] (R-ND) said, "I think [Bolton] sounds like a lot of the other witnesses, frankly. I don't know that he's got a lot new to add to it."

Schiff pointed out that during a January 30 federal court hearing about the White House's refusal to honor [[congressional subpoena]]s, Judge [[Randolph Moss]] asked Justice Department attorney James Burnham what remedies Congress might have in such a case. Burnham suggested impeachment, though Trump's attorneys argue that obstruction of Congress is not an impeachable offense. Burnham said, "They are hypocrites. We are hypocrites, I guess," in reference to the Trump administration's stance against both impeachment and court cases, as well as the House's wanting to impeach the president for obstruction of Congress while asking the courts to enforce its subpoenas for executive-branch information.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/politics/trump-impeachment-subpoena-hearing/index.html|title=Justice Department lawyer says House can impeach over defied subpoenas|first1=Marshall|last1=Cohen|first2=Katelyn|last2=Polantz|publisher=CNN|date=January 30, 2020|accessdate=February 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201193836/https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/politics/trump-impeachment-subpoena-hearing/index.html|archive-date=February 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Mother Jones |date=January 30, 2020 |accessdate=January 31, 2020 |title=Donald Trump's Own Justice Department Just Undermined His Impeachment Defense |first=Abigail |last=Weinberg |url=https://www.motherjones.com/impeachment/2020/01/donald-trumps-own-justice-department-just-undermined-his-impeachment-defense/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130215048/https://www.motherjones.com/impeachment/2020/01/donald-trumps-own-justice-department-just-undermined-his-impeachment-defense/ |archive-date=January 30, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Moss said, "It seems{{nbsp}}... remarkable to suggest that Congress as an institution can't enforce its subpoenas," noting that if that were so, subpoenas would be little more than requests.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neidig |first1=Harper |title=DOJ tells court that Congress can't sue to enforce subpoenas |url=https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/480730-doj-tells-court-that-congress-cant-sue-to-enforce-subpoenas |accessdate=February 2, 2020 |work=The Hill |date=January 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202094031/https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/480730-doj-tells-court-that-congress-cant-sue-to-enforce-subpoenas |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In early February 2020, Lindsey Graham publicly said [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] chairman [[Richard Burr]] would subpoena the whistleblower to look at "whether or not the whistleblower had a bias". Later that month, Burr said, "I'm prepared to do whatever we have to<!--not a mistake--> to interview the whistleblower."

On April 3, late on a Friday evening, Trump notified the Congressional intelligence committees that he intended to fire [[Michael Atkinson (Inspector General)|Michael Atkinson]], the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. Trump's letter did not specify a reason for firing Atkinson. However he has criticized Atkinson for helping to start his impeachment when he told Congress about the existence of a whistleblower complaint, as the law required. In defending the firing, Trump stated that Atkinson is "not a big Trump fan". Trump was heavily criticized for the firing, which many members of Congress described as another abuse of power. Adam Schiff described the firing as "yet another blatant attempt by the president to gut the independence of the intelligence community and retaliate against those who dare to expose presidential wrongdoing". Michael Horowitz, the chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, also released a statement rebuking Trump and defending Atkinson's professionalism and standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/412d7f58-c73d-48da-81dd-2e7a8fd5d836 |title=Trump fires intelligence official who helped initiate impeachment |access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/03/trump-fires-intelligence-community-inspector-general-164287 |title=Trump fires intelligence community watchdog who defied him on whistleblower complaint |access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> One of the only public officials who openly supported Trump's firing of Atkinson was Attorney General William Barr.

In February 2020, Republican Senator [[Rand Paul]] criticized [[YouTube]] for removing a video of his floor speech about the impeachment trial of Donald Trump.
