In the 1980s, Cook was the bassist for the [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]-based [[indie rock]] band [[The Housemartins]], who achieved a UK number-one single with their [[a cappella]] cover of "[[Caravan of Love]]". After the Housemartins split, Cook formed the electronic band [[Beats International]] in Brighton, who produced the number-one single "[[Dub Be Good to Me]]". He then played in [[Freak Power]], [[Pizzaman (band)|Pizzaman]], and the Mighty Dub Katz with moderate success.

In 1996, Cook adopted the name Fatboy Slim and released ''[[Better Living Through Chemistry (album)|Better Living Through Chemistry]]'' to critical acclaim. Follow-up albums ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]],'' ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]],'' and ''[[Palookaville (album)|Palookaville]]'', as well as singles such as "[[The Rockafeller Skank]]", "[[Praise You]]", "[[Right Here, Right Now (Fatboy Slim song)|Right Here, Right Now]]", "[[Weapon of Choice (song)|Weapon of Choice]]", and "[[Wonderful Night]]", achieved commercial and critical success. In 2008, Cook formed the Brighton Port Authority with [[David Byrne]].<ref name="bbd">{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045089/fatboy-slim-pulls-into-brighton-port-authority | title=Fatboy Slim Pulls into Brighton Port Authority |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | access-date=14 July 2012}}</ref> He has been responsible for successful remixes for [[Cornershop (band)|Cornershop]], the [[Beastie Boys]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Groove Armada]], and [[Roger McKenzie|Wildchild]].

As a solo act, he has won nine [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and two [[Brit Awards]].

==Life and career==

===1963–1984: Early life and career beginnings===
[[File:Button-disque.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Badge created by Cook (circa 1979) for his band Disque Attack in which he played drums and for whom he was later lead vocalist.]]
Cook was born in [[Bromley]], [[Kent]]. He was raised in [[Reigate]], [[Surrey]], and educated at [[Reigate Grammar School]], where he took violin lessons alongside future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Keir Starmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/03/keir-starmer-sensible-radical |title=Keir Starmer: The sensible radical |last=Maguire |first=Patrick |date=31 March 2020 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> He grew up with a love of music. When he was 14, his brother brought home the first album from the punk band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], which turned him onto that genre; he started attending gigs at the Greyhound pub in [[Croydon]] and playing in punk bands.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.acast.com/distractionpieces/normancookakafatboyslim-distractionpiecespodcastwithscroobiuspip-268|title=Norman Cook aka Fatboy Slim • Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip #268 {{!}} Distraction Pieces Podcast with Scroobius Pip on acast|last=acast|date=14 May 2019|website=acast|language=en|access-date=17 May 2019}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He played drums in Disque Attack, a British [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced rock band. When frontman Charlie Alcock was told by his parents that he had to give up the band to concentrate on his [[O levels]], Cook took over as lead vocalist. At The Railway Tavern in Reigate, Cook met [[Paul Heaton]], with whom he formed the Stomping Pondfrogs.

At 18, Cook went to [[University of Brighton|Brighton Polytechnic]] to read a B.A. in English, politics, and sociology, where he achieved a 2:1 in British Studies. He had begun DJing some years before, but it was at this time that he began to develop his skills in the thriving [[Brighton]] club scene, regularly appearing at the Brighton Belle and the students' favourite The Basement, where, known as DJ Quentox, he began laying the base for Brighton's hip-hop scene.

===1985–1995: The Housemartins to The Mighty Dub Katz===
In 1985, Heaton formed a guitar band called [[the Housemartins]]. Their bassist left on the eve of their first national tour, so Cook agreed to move to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] to join them. The band soon had a hit single, "[[Happy Hour (The Housemartins song)|Happy Hour]]", and their two albums, ''[[London 0 Hull 4]]'' and ''[[The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death]]'', peaked in the Top 10 of the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="martins">{{cite web|title=HOUSEMARTINS|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/housemartins/|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=25 December 2013}}</ref> They also reached [[List of number-one singles from the 1980s (UK)|number one]] just before Christmas 1986 with a version of "[[Caravan of Love]]", originally a hit the year before for [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]].<ref name="martins" /> By 1988 they split up. Heaton and the band's drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form [[The Beautiful South]], while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. He started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All of Cook's records since have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as "Executive Producer", for example).

Cook achieved his first solo hit in 1989, "Blame It on the Bassline", featuring future [[Beats International]] member MC Wildski. Credited to "Norman Cook feat. MC Wildski", the song followed the basic template of what would become Beats International's style. It was a modest hit on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching number 29.

Cook formed Beats International, a loose confederation of [[studio musician]]s including vocalists [[Lindy Layton]] and Lester Noel, rappers D.J. Baptiste and MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, ''[[Let Them Eat Bingo]]'', included the number one single "[[Dub Be Good to Me]]", which caused a legal dispute over allegations of [[copyright]] infringement through the liberal use of unauthorised [[Sampling (music)|samples]]: the [[bassline]] was lifted note for note from [[The Clash]]'s "[[The Guns of Brixton]]" and the lyrics borrowed heavily from [[The S.O.S. Band]]'s "[[Just Be Good to Me]]". Cook lost the case and was ordered to pay back twice the royalties made on the record, bankrupting him. The 1991 follow-up album ''Excursion on the Version'', an exploration of [[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] music, failed to duplicate its predecessor's success, as it did not chart.

Cook then formed [[Freak Power]] with horn player [[Ashley Slater]] and singer Jesse Graham. They released their debut album ''[[Drive-Thru Booty]]'' in 1994, which contained the single "[[Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out]]". [[Levi's]] used the song in a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign. In 1996, Cook rejoined Freak Power for their second album, ''More of Everything for Everybody''.

Cook enlisted help from producer friends Tim Jeffery and JC Reid to create a [[house music]] album as [[Pizzaman (band)|Pizzaman]]. The 1995 ''Pizzamania'' album spawned three [[UK Top 40]] hits: "Trippin' on Sunshine", "Sex on the Streets", and "Happiness". [[Del Monte Foods]] corporation used "Happiness" in a UK fruit juice ad. The videos for the three singles were directed by [[Michael Dominic]].

Cook also formed the group The Mighty Dub Katz with Gareth Hansome (aka GMoney), his former flatmate. Together they started the ''Boutique'' Nightclub in Brighton, formerly known as the ''Big Beat Boutique''. Their biggest song together was "[[Magic Carpet Ride (Mighty Dub Katz song)|Magic Carpet Ride]]".

===1996–2008: Fatboy Slim===
[[File:Fatboy Slim at Portrush Beach Party 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cook performing at the first "Beach Party" in [[Portrush]], 2006.]]
Cook adopted the pseudonym Fatboy Slim in 1996. Cook said of the name: "It doesn't mean anything. I've told so many different lies over the years about it I can't actually remember the truth. It's just an [[oxymoron]]—a word that can't exist.  It kind of suits me—it's kind of goofy and ironic."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/watc/features/2001/fatboyslim/010908.fatboyslim.html|title=NPR's Weekend All Things Considered: Fatboy Slim|website=www.npr.org}}</ref>

The Fatboy Slim album and Cook's second solo album, ''[[Better Living Through Chemistry (album)|Better Living Through Chemistry]]'' (released on [[Skint Records]] in the UK and [[Astralwerks]] in the US), contained the Top 40 UK hit "[[Everybody Needs a 303]]". Fatboy Slim's next work was the single "[[The Rockafeller Skank]]", released before the album ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]]'', both of which were released in 1998. "[[Praise You]]", also from this album, was Cook's first UK solo [[List of Number 1 singles from the 1990s (UK)#1999|number one]]. Its music video, starring [[Spike Jonze]], won numerous awards.<ref name="BBC stardom">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1530530.stm |work=BBC News | title=Norman Cook's long way to stardom | date=7 September 2001 | access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref> On 9 September 1999, he performed "Praise You" at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York City, and won three awards, including the award for [[MTV Video Music Award – Breakthrough Video|Breakthrough Video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1999/mtvvmas.htm|title=1999 MTV Video Music Awards|publisher=Rockonthenet.com|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2000, Fatboy Slim released his third studio album, ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', and featured two collaborations with [[Macy Gray]] and "[[Weapon of Choice (song)|Weapon of Choice]]", which also was made into an award-winning [[Weapon of Choice (song)|music video]], starring [[Christopher Walken]].<ref name="Fatboy Slim rakes in MTV awards">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1530007.stm |work=BBC News | title=Fatboy Slim rakes in MTV awards | date=7 September 2001 | access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref> The album also included "[[Sunset (Bird of Prey)]]," whose socially significant video sampled the 1964 "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy Girl]]" campaign ad.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards]] in New York, Fatboy Slim won six awards for "Weapon of Choice", the most awards at the ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2001/|title=2001 MTV Video Music Awards|publisher=MTV|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2001/mtvvmas.htm|title=2001 MTV VMAs|publisher=Rockonthenet.com|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2003, he produced "[[Crazy Beat]]" and "Gene by Gene" from the [[Blur (band)|Blur]] album ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'', and in 2004, ''[[Palookaville (Fatboy Slim album)|Palookaville]]'' was Cook's first studio album for four years.

Fatboy Slim's greatest hits album, ''[[The Greatest Hits - Why Try Harder|Why Try Harder]]'', was released on 19 June 2006. It comprises 18 tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones and two new tracks, "[[Champion Sound (song)|Champion Sound]]" and "[[That Old Pair of Jeans]]".

In 2006, Cook travelled to [[Cuba]], and wrote and produced two original Cuban crossover tracks for the album ''The Revolution Presents: Revolution'', which was released by [[Studio ! K7]] and Rapster Records in 2009. The tracks are "Shelter" (which featured longtime collaborator [[Lateef the Truthspeaker|Lateef]]) and "Siente Mi Ritmo", featuring Cuba's female vocal group Sexto Sentido. The recordings took place at Cuba's EGREM Studios, home of the [[Buena Vista Social Club]], and featured a band of young Cuban musicians, including [[Harold Lopez Nussa]]. Another track recorded during these sessions, "Guaguanco", was released separately under the Mighty Dub Katz moniker in 2006.

=== 2008–2012: The Brighton Port Authority ===
The Brighton Port Authority debuted in 2008 with a collaboration with [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Dizzee Rascal]] titled "[[Toe Jam (The Brighton Port Authority song)|Toe Jam]]", along with a video featuring nude dancers with [[censor bar]]s on them, making pictures and words with them.

The soundtrack album for the TV series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' also includes the Brighton Port Authority's track "He's Frank (Slight Return)" (a cover of a song by [[The Monochrome Set]]), with [[Iggy Pop]] as vocalist. The video for this track features a near life-size puppet of Iggy Pop. An alternative club version was released under the title "He's Frank (Washing Up)", with the video featuring some footage of Iggy Pop acting and saying lyrics.

The band's debut album, ''[[I Think We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat]]'', is the first to be co-produced by Cook's longtime engineer Simon Thornton, who also sings on one track. The album was released 6 January 2009 exclusively at [[Amazon.com]] on CD, with downloadable format and other stores scheduled for a month later on 3 February.

In 2010 Cook released a mix album, ''The Legend Returns'', as a covermount album in the June 2010 issue of ''[[Mixmag]].'' He returned as Fatboy Slim when performing at [[Ultra Music Festival]] in Miami in March 2012.

On 12 August 2012 he performed Rockefeller Skank and Right Here, Right Now at the [[2012 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony]], and on 1 September Cook performed at Brighton Pride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/fatboy-slim-joins-freemasons-brighton-pride230812|title=Fatboy Slim joins Freemasons at Brighton Pride|website=Gay Star News|access-date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

On 13 July 2002, Fatboy Slim performed the second of his free open-air concerts on Brighton beach. Although organisers expected a crowd of around 60,000 people, the event instead attracted an estimated 250,000 who crammed the promenade and beach between Brighton's piers. Local police forced the event to end early amid safety concerns, overcrowding, and one death.<ref name="Girl dies">{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Nurse dies after fall at Brighton beach party|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jul/17/stevenmorris|access-date=23 November 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 July 2002}}</ref>

After the show had finished and the crowd began to dissipate, major traffic congestion ensued throughout the Brighton area, with many caught in traffic jams until the morning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2127259.stm |work=BBC News | title=Fatboy Slim crowds cause chaos | date=14 July 2002 | access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref>
