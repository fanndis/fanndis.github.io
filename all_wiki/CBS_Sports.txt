Thank you. -->

The online arm of CBS Sports is [[CBSSports.com]]. CBS purchased SportsLine.com in 2004, and today CBSSports.com is part of [[CBS Interactive]]. On February 26, 2018, following up on the success of their online news network [[CBSN]], CBS Sports launched [[CBS Sports HQ]], a 24/7, online only, linear sports news network. The network focuses entirely on sports news, results, highlights and analysis.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is CBS SPORTS HQ? Your guide to our new 24/7 streaming sports news network|url=https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/what-is-cbs-sports-hq-your-guide-to-new-247-streaming-sports-news-network/|website=CBSSports.com|date=February 26, 2018|access-date=August 7, 2018}}</ref> (CBS Sports college sports and golf programming that it distributes over the air is generally made available for free via separate streams, as are a limited number of NFL national telecasts; the remainder requires a [[CBS All Access]] subscription to be viewed online, with [[CBS Sports Network]] programming requiring a [[TV Everywhere]] subscription.)

CBS Sports was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Synchronous Enhancement of Original Television Content for Interactive Use for its program ''[[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|March Madness]] on Demand.''

On August 31, 2013, CBS Sports rolled out its previous graphics and animation package that was first used in the network's coverage of [[Super Bowl XLVII]]. Additionally, in compliance with the [[Active Format Description]] #10 code, CBS Sports switched to a [[16:9 aspect ratio]] letterbox presentation used for all sports programming, including the ''SEC on CBS'' and the ''NFL on CBS'' broadcasts.

On November 30, 2015, CBS Sports released a new logo in order to coincide with the network's coverage of [[Super Bowl 50]]. The network also created a new on-air graphics package that debuted as part of the network's Super Bowl week programming. Following the game, the graphics package began to be utilized across all of their programming events, including their joint production of ''[[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|NCAA March Madness]]'' with [[Turner Sports]].<ref name="NewCBSSportsLogo2015">{{cite web|author=Eye on Football staff|title=CBS Sports to debut new logo for Super Bowl 50|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25395009/cbs-sports-to-debut-new-logo-for-super-bowl-50|publisher=CBS Sports|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=November 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS SPORTS ANNOUNCES NEW LOGO|url=http://cbspressexpress.com/cbs-sports/releases/view?id=44042|publisher=CBS Press Express|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=November 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]], which retains heavy production control over their event, continued to use the network's older graphical style originally unveiled in 2007 until 2019, when they debuted a new graphics package. Also, the network's ''Thursday Night Football'' game broadcasts continued to use the graphical style originally used since its debut in 2014 until its rights to that package expired in 2018.

'''CBS Sports Network''' is a sports-oriented American [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] channel that is operated by [[ViacomCBS]] through CBS Sports. Launched as the National College Sports Network in 2002, then renamed as College Sports Television in 2003, CBS's then-parent company [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] acquired the network in 2005 and later renamed it '''CBS College Sports Network''' in 2008. The network had always focused on college sports, but in 2011, CBS rebranded the network as '''CBS Sports Network''' as a move to reposition the network to include mainstream sports—including coverage of minor professional sports leagues such as the [[Arena Football League]] and [[Major League Lacrosse]], although college sports are still aired frequently by the network.
