Parker first gained election to Parliament as a Labour member in the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], winning an upset victory over [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s [[Gavan Herlihy]] in the [[Otago (New Zealand electorate)|Otago]] seat. In the 2005 election, the National candidate [[Jacqui Dean]] defeated him in his Otago electorate seat, but he returned to [[New Zealand House of Representatives|the House]] due to his position on the Labour [[Party lists in the 2005 New Zealand general election|list]]. In the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]] Parker and Dean both stood in the resurrected [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki electorate]], with Dean winning by over 11,000 votes.<ref>[http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-58.html Waitaki results 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211164936/http://2008.electionresults.govt.nz/electorate-58.html |date=11 December 2008 }}</ref> Nevertheless, due to his list position he was still returned to parliament. In the {{NZ election link|2011}}, Parker stood in the {{NZ electorate link|Epsom}} electorate, where he came third behind [[ACT New Zealand]]'s [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] and National's [[Paul Goldsmith (politician)|Paul Goldsmith]], but was again returned as a list MP.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Count Results â€“ Epsom |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2011/electorate-12.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |access-date=15 December 2011}}</ref> In the {{NZ election link|2014}}, Parker did not contest an electorate, but was number two on the [[Party lists in the 2014 New Zealand general election#Labour Party|Labour list]].<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1406/S00372/labour-list-for-the-2014-election-announced.htm |title=Labour List for the 2014 Election Announced |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]] |agency=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>

===Fifth Labour Government===
During the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]], Parker served as [[Attorney-General (New Zealand)|Attorney-General]] and Minister of Transport and Energy from 2005 until March 2006. He resigned his position as Attorney-General on 20 March 2006 after an allegation that he had filed an incorrect declaration with the Companies Office on behalf of the property company Queens Park Mews Limited. On 21 March Parker also resigned his place in Cabinet as [[Minister of Energy and Resources (New Zealand)|Minister of Energy]], Minister of Transport, and Minister Responsible for Climate Change Issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10373702|title=Parker quits all Cabinet posts|date=21 March 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref>
An inquiry by the Companies Office cleared him of the charge of filing false returns.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10379118|title=Parker heads back into the Cabinet|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=27 April 2006|author=Audrey Young}}</ref>

[[Helen Clark]], the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], re-appointed Parker to the Energy and Climate Change portfolios and to the Land Information portfolio on 2 May 2006. (The Attorney-General portfolio remained with [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], and [[Annette King]] took over Parker's former Transport portfolio.)

In July 2007 Clark appointed Parker as the acting [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Minister for the Environment]] following the resignation of [[David Benson-Pope]].<ref>Rt. Hon Helen Clark, 27 July 2007, [http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=30175 Acting Ministers in portfolios]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, New Zealand Government Press Release, retrieved 25 November 2007.</ref>

===Opposition===
Following Labour's defeat in the 2008 general election, Parker became the Opposition spokesperson on Conservation, ACC and Shadow Attorney-General. On 15 June 2010, Opposition Leader [[Phil Goff]] appointed Parker to be Portfolio Spokesperson for Economic Development, a position formerly held by Shane Jones, and shifted the portfolio of Conservation to Chris Carter.

[[File:David Parker NZ.jpg|thumb|upright|left|In 2011]]
Parker [[2011 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|ran for the party leadership]] in 2011, but withdrew part-way through the contest to support [[David Shearer]]'s bid.

Parker then became the Labour spokesperson for Finance and the shadow [[Attorney-General of New Zealand|Attorney-General]] (from February 2013).

From 17 September 2013, Parker was the deputy leader of the Labour Party. He retained his finance portfolio.

Following the poor performance of the Labour Party in the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]], and the eventual resignation of [[David Cunliffe]] as leader, Parker was appointed interim leader of the Labour Party. He then unsuccessfully ran in the [[2014 New Zealand Labour Party leadership election|2014 Labour Party leadership election]] and he came third in the leadership election behind Andrew Little and Grant Robertson.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Small|first1=Vernon|last2=Gulliver|first2=Aimee|title=Andrew Little new Labour Party leader â€“ by a whisker|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63305825/Andrew-Little-new-Labour-Party-leader-by-a-whisker|access-date=26 October 2017|publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=18 November 2014}}</ref> Little offered for Parker to continue as finance spokesperson, but Parker declined.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Young|first=Audrey|date=2017-11-03|title=Grant Robertson: Finance Minister more than Dr No|language=en-NZ|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11940277|url-status=live|access-date=2020-07-28|issn=1170-0777}}</ref> Instead, Parker was assigned a range of portfolios including shadow attorney-general and spokesperson for trade and export growth, the environment and, after the resignations of former leaders Goff and Shearer, foreign affairs.

===Sixth Labour Government===

During the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], Parker was re-elected on the Labour Party list.<ref>{{cite web |title=2017 General Election - Official Result Successful Candidates |url=http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/successful-candidates.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=3 November 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117212450/http://archive.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/successful-candidates.html |archivedate=17 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Following the formation of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]], he was sworn in as Attorney-General, Minister for Economic Development, Minister for the Environment, and Minister for Trade and Export Growth.

In a June 2019 reshuffle, the economic development portfolio was reassigned to Phil Twyford. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said this was so that Parker could focus more on water quality and trade negotiations with the European Union and United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-06-27|title=Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's Cabinet reshuffle - the ups and downs|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/113826823/prime-minister-jacinda-arderns-cabinet-reshuffle--the-ups-and-downs|access-date=2020-07-28|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|language=en}}</ref>

As Environment Minister, Parker has launched a "comprehensive overhaul" of the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walls |first1=Jason |title=Government wants to put a firmer focus on climate change when it shakes up the RMA |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12252216 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=31 July 2019 |language=en-NZ |date=24 July 2019}}</ref>
