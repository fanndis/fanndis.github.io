In 1959, Baldessari began teaching art in the San Diego school system. He taught for nearly three decades, in schools and junior colleges and community colleges, and eventually at the university level. When the [[University of California]] decided to open up a campus in San Diego, the new head of the Visual Art Department, [[Paul Brach]], asked Baldessari to be part of the originating faculty in 1968. At [[UCSD]] he shared an office with [[David Antin]].<ref>Karen Wright (October 23, 2009), [http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/features/john-baldessari/ John Baldessari] ''[[Art in America]]''.</ref> In 1970, Baldessari moved to Santa Monica, where he met many artists and writers, and began teaching at [[CalArts]].

==Work and themes==

===Early text paintings===
By 1966, Baldessari was using photographs and text, or simply text, on canvas.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> His early major works were [[canvas]] paintings that were empty but for painted statements derived from contemporary [[art theory]]. An early attempt of Baldessari's included the hand-painted phrase "Suppose it is true after all? WHAT THEN?" (1967) on a heavily worked painted surface. However, this proved personally disappointing because the form and method conflicted with the objective use of language that he preferred to employ. Baldessari decided the solution was to remove his own hand from the construction of the image and to employ a commercial, lifeless style so that the text would impact the viewer without distractions. The words were then physically lettered by sign painters, in an unornamented black [[font]]. The first of this series presented the ironic statement "A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SURFACE WITHOUT ANY ARTICULATION IS A DEAD EXPERIENCE" (1967).

Another work, ''Painting for Kubler'' (1967–68) presented the viewer theoretical instructions on how to view it and on the importance of context and continuity with previous works. This work referenced art historian [[George Kubler]]'s seminal book, ''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]''. The seemingly legitimate art concerns were intended by Baldessari to become hollow and ridiculous when presented in such a purely self-referential manner.

===Disowning of early work===
In 1970, Baldessari and five friends<ref name="people.com"/> burnt all of the paintings he had created between 1953 and 1966 as part of a new piece, titled ''The Cremation Project''. The ashes from these paintings were baked into cookies<ref>Paul Levy (September 30, 2011), [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903791504576588294168814716 For Baldessari, Art Imitates Art] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> and placed into an urn, and the resulting art installation consists of a bronze commemorative plaque with the destroyed paintings' birth and death dates, as well as the recipe for making the cookies.<ref>Grant, Daniel. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-grant/can-artists-really-disown_b_678184.html "Can Artists Really Disown their Early Work?"] ''The Huffington Post''. August 11, 2010.</ref> Through the ritual of cremation Baldessari draws a connection between artistic practice and the human life cycle. Thus the act of disavowal becomes generative as with the work of [[auto-destructive art|auto-destructive]] artist [[Jean Tinguely]].

===Juxtaposing text with images===
Baldessari is best known for works that blend photographic materials (such as film stills), take them out of their original context and rearrange their form, often including the addition of words or sentences. Related to his early text paintings were his ''Wrong''  series (1966–1968), which paired photographic images with lines of text from an amateur photography book, aiming at the violation of a set of basic "rules" on snapshot composition.<ref>[http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=115#footnote Interview with Moira Roth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172055/http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=115 |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> In one of the works, Baldessari had himself photographed in front of a palm precisely so that it would appear that the tree were growing out of his head.<ref>[http://collectionsonline.lacma.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=31081;type=101 John Baldessari, ''Wrong'' (1966-1968)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518162634/http://collectionsonline.lacma.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=31081;type=101 |date=2012-05-18 }} [[LACMA]], Los Angeles.</ref> His photographic ''California Map Project'' (1969) created physical forms that resembled the letters in "[[California]]" geographically near to the very spots on the map that they were printed. In the ''Binary Code Series'', Baldessari used images as information holders by alternating photographs to stand in for the on-off state of [[binary code]]; one example alternated photos of a woman holding a cigarette parallel to her mouth and then dropping it away.

Another of Baldessari's series juxtaposed an image of an object such as a [[glass]], or a block of [[wood]], and the phrase "A glass is a glass" or "Wood is wood" combined with "but a cigar is a good smoke" and the image of the artist smoking a cigar. These directly refer to [[René Magritte]]'s ''[[The Treachery of Images]]''; the images similarly were used to stand in for the objects described. However, the series also apparently refers to [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] famous attributed observation that "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar",<ref>attributed in Bartlett, ''Familiar Quotations'', 15th Ed.</ref> as well as to [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] "… a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke."<ref>"The Betrothed," [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/dptdt10.txt ''Departmental Ditties and Barrack Room Ballads''], Ed. [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>

In "Double Bill", a 2012 series of large inkjet prints,<ref>[http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2012-04-06_john-baldessari-double-bill/ John Baldessari: Double Bill, April 6 - May 12, 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308203756/http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2012-04-06_john-baldessari-double-bill/ |date=March 8, 2014 }} Marian Goodman Gallery, Paris.</ref> Baldessari paired the work of two selected artists (such as [[Giovanni di Paolo]] with [[David Hockney]], or [[Fernand Léger]] with [[Max Ernst]]) on a single canvas, further altering the appropriated picture plane by overlaying his own hand-painted color additions. Baldessari then names only one of his two artistic "collaborators" on each canvas's lower edge, such as ''…AND MANET'' or ''…AND DUCHAMP''.<ref>[http://www.margoleavingallery.com/exhibitions/298 John Baldessari: Double Bill (Part 2), May 12 - June 30, 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023044511/http://www.margoleavingallery.com/exhibitions/298 |date=October 23, 2012 }} Margo Leavin Gallery, Los Angeles.</ref><ref>David Pagel (May 18, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-john-baldessari-margo-leavin-20120515,0,751578.story Review: 'John Baldessari' is joyously more than sum of its sources] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref>

===Arbitrary games===
Baldessari has expressed that his interest in language comes from its similarities in structure to games, as both operate by an arbitrary and mandatory system of rules. In this spirit, many of his works are sequences showing attempts at accomplishing an arbitrary goal, such as ''Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line'' (1973), in which the artist attempted to do just that, photographing the results, and eventually selecting the "best out of 36 tries", with 36 being the determining number just because that is the standard number of shots on a roll of 35mm film. The writer eldritch Priest ties John Baldessari's piece ''Throwing four balls in the air to get a square (best of 36 tries)'' as an early example of [[post-conceptual art]].<ref>eldritch Priest, ''Boring Formless Nonsense: Experimental Music and The Aesthetics of Failure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2013, p. 5</ref> This work was published in 1973 by a young Italian publisher: Giampaolo Prearo that was one of the first to believe and invest in the work of Baldessari. He printed two series one in 2000 copies and a second more precious reserved to the publisher in 500 copies. Following Baldessari's seminal statement "I will not make any more boring Art", he conceived the work ''The Artist Hitting Various Objects with a Golf Club'' (1972–73), composed of 30 photographs of the artist swinging and hitting with a golf club objects excavated from a dump, as a parody of cataloging rather than a thorough straight classification.<ref>[http://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/2015-02-28_john-baldessari/ John Baldessari: Early Work, 28 February – 11 April 2015] [[Marian Goodman]], Paris.</ref>

===Pointing===
Much of Baldessari's work involves pointing, in which he tells the viewer not only what to look at but how to make selections and comparisons, often simply for the sake of doing so. Baldessari's ''Commissioned Paintings'' (1969) series took the idea of pointing literally, after he read a criticism of [[conceptual art]] that claimed it was nothing more than pointing. Beginning with photos of a hand pointing at various objects, Baldessari then hired amateur yet technically adept artists to paint the pictures. He then added a caption "A painting by [painter's name]" to each finished painting. In this instance, he has been likened to a [[choreographer]], directing the action while having no direct hand in it, and these paintings are typically read as questioning the idea of artistic authorship. The amateur artists have been analogized to sign painters in this series, chosen for their pedestrian methods that were indifferent to what was being painted.<ref>Harvey, Doug. [http://www.laweekly.com/2010-08-05/art-books/john-baldessari-point-man/ "John Baldessari: Point Man"]. LA Weekly. August 5, 2010.</ref> Baldessari critiques formalist assessments of art in a segment from his video ''How We Do Art Now'' (1973), entitled "Examining Three 8d Nails", in which he gives obsessive attention to minute details of the nails, such as how much rust they have, or descriptive qualities such as which appears "cooler, more distant, less important" than the others.

=== Dots ===
Circular adhesive dots covering up the faces of photographed and painted portraits are a prevailing motif in Baldessari's work from the mid-1980s onward.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://artwrite49.wordpress.com/john-baldessari-connecting-dots/|title=John Baldessari: Connecting Dots|date=2012-10-08|work=artwrite 49|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref> The artist himself suspected that, despite the broad array of approaches he's taken over the course of his career, he will be best remembered as "the guy who puts dots over peoples faces."<ref>{{Citation|last=HENRYandREL Supermarché|title=A Brief History of John Baldessari|date=2012-05-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7V4GyEuXA&t=241s|accessdate=2018-05-29}}</ref> Examples of the "dot portraits" would include—for  example—''Bloody Sunday'' (1987) or ''Stonehenge with Two Persons'' (2005), though these works are numerous and it is difficult to identify an exemplar. The dots in these paintings evoke brightly colored price-stickers sometimes seen at garage sales, thrift stores or placed on retail items during a sale. Indeed, these stickers appear to have been the inspiration for the method. Describing his initial intuitive leap in this direction, Baldessari said, "I just had these price stickers I was using for something else, in some graphic way and I put them on all the faces and I just felt like it leveled the playing field."<ref>{{Citation|last=HENRYandREL Supermarché|title=A Brief History of John Baldessari|date=2012-05-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU7V4GyEuXA|accessdate=2018-05-29}}</ref> The dot-faced works may sometimes be described as paintings, collages, or may be released as print editions.

===Prints===
[[File:Baldessari Studio.jpg|thumb|240px|John Baldessari, ''Studio'', 1988, Lithograph and silkscreen on Sommerset paper, 25 ¾ x 34 in, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]
Baldessari began making prints in the early 1970s and continued to produce editions. He created his first print – ''I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art'' (1971) - as an edition to raise funds for the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]], Halifax. The lithograph was created in conjunction with the now renowned exhibition for which – at Baldessari's request – students endlessly wrote the phrase "I will not make any more boring art" on the gallery walls. The artist has since worked internationally with premier publishers including Arion Press of San Francisco, Brook Alexander Editions of New York, [[Cirrus Editions]] of Los Angeles, Crown Point Press of San Francisco, Edition Jacob Samuel of Santa Monica, [[Gemini G.E.L.]] of Los Angeles, Mixografia of Los Angeles, Multiples, Multi Editions of Los Angeles, Inc. of New York, and Peter Blum Editions of New York. His 1988 prints, ''The Fallen Easel'' and ''Object (with Flaw)'', represented a major shift in Baldessari's approach to presentation, allowing a more complex relationship between his found imagery.  In both prints, Baldessari expertly contrasts unrelated photographs to suggest a mysterious and/or ominous undercurrent.  In the 1990s Baldessari began working with Mixografia Workshop to create three-dimensional prints utilizing their unique process of printing from metal molds. Baldessari's interest in dimensionality has carried over to recent editions from [[Gemini G.E.L.]], including the ''Person with Guitar'' series (2005) and the print series ''Noses & Ears, Etc.'' (2006–2007) in which screen-printed images are constructed in three layers on [[Closed-cell PVC foamboard|sintra]] with hand painting. A 2007 publication from Gemini is ''God Nose'', a cast aluminum piece that is designed to hang from the ceiling.<ref>[http://www.famsf.org/pressroom/pressreleases/john-baldessari-print-retrospective-collections-jordan-d-schnitzer-and-his-f John Baldessari: A Print Retrospective from the Collections of Jordan D.

===Performance and film===
Originally conceived in 1970, ''Unrealised Proposal for Cadavre Piece'' would have visitors look through a peep-hole and see a dead male body laid out with its feet towards them inside a climate-controlled vitrine,<ref>Marina Cashdan (July 13, 2011), [http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/live-from-manchester/ Live From Manchester] ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.</ref> made to resemble [[Andrea Mantegna]]’s painting, ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Mantegna)|The Lamentation over the Dead Christ]]'' (1480). [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], the co-director of London’s [[Serpentine Gallery]] and [[Klaus Biesenbach]], the director of [[MoMA PS1]], first attempted to realize Baldessari’s idea in 2011 and the resulting paperwork of failed attempts to procure a willing male cadaver was displayed in the exhibition "11 Rooms" at the [[Manchester International Festival]].<ref name="theartnewspaper.com">Elizabeth Fortescue (April 16, 2013), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Art-project-using-a-human-cadaver-could-still-happen/29314 Art project using a human cadaver could still happen] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>

Baldessari's film ''Police Drawing'' documents a 1971 performance, ''Police Drawing Project''. In this piece, the artist walked into a class of art students who had never seen him, set up a video camera to document the proceedings, and left the room. Subsequently, a police artist entered and, based on the students' testimony, sketched a likeness of the artist.<ref>[http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=2001 Police Drawing by John Baldessari, 1971] Electronic Arts Intermix, New York.</ref> In the black-and-white video ''I Am Making Art'' (1971), Baldessari stands facing the camera; for nearly 20 minutes, he strikes and then holds various poses — crossing his arms over his chest or swinging one arm out to one side or pointing directly at the lens, for example — and with each new gesture, he states "I am making art."<ref name="Much Less Than Meets the Eye"/> In a 1972 tribute to fellow artist [[Sol LeWitt]], Baldessari sang lines from LeWitt's thirty-five statements on conceptual art to the tune of popular songs.<ref>[http://www.sfmoma.org/explore/multimedia/videos/92 John Baldessari sings Sol LeWitt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201105635/http://www.sfmoma.org/explore/multimedia/videos/92 |date=2014-02-01 }} [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].</ref> Other films include ''Teaching a Plant the Alphabet'' and the ''Inventory'' videos, also from 1972.

=== Sculpture ===
Baldessari created his first ever sculpture, ''Beethoven's Trumpet (with Ear) Opus'' ''# 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135'' (2007), a series of 6 resin, fiberglass, bronze, aluminum, and electronics components in the form of a gigantic bronze trumpet extending off an oversized ear sculpted on the wall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ocula.com/art-galleries/beyer-projects/|title=Beyer Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=Ocula|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The sculpture was produced with Beyer Projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ocula.com/magazine/insights/john-baldessaris-enduring-presence/|title=John Baldessari's Enduring Presence|last=Moldan|first=Tessa|date=20 March 2020|website=Ocula|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When the viewer speaks into the trumpet, the sounds causes a short recital of a phrase from a Beethoven string quartet. Baldessari has gone on to create sculptural works that often incorporate resin, bronze, and steel, such as the approximately 2.4 m carrot (''Fake Carrot'', 2016) and an elongated bronze figure trapped wearing a wooden barrel in a nod to Giacometti (''Giacometti Variation'', 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beyerprojects.com/john-baldessari|title=John Baldessari|last=|first=|date=|website=Beyer Projects|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Exhibitions==
Baldessari was in over 200 solo shows and 1,000 group shows in his six-decade career.<ref>Mary M.
