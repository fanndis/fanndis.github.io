'''''Town & Country''''', formerly the '''''Home Journal''''' and '''''The National Press''''', is a monthly [[United States|American]] [[lifestyle magazine]]. It is the oldest continually published general interest magazine in the United States.

==History==

===Early history===
The magazine was founded as ''The National Press'' by poet and essayist [[Nathaniel Parker Willis]] and ''[[New York Mirror|New York Evening Mirror]]'' newspaper editor [[George Pope Morris]] in 1846.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beepdf.com/town-country|title=Town & Country|publisher=}}</ref> Eight months later, it was renamed ''The Home Journal''.<ref>Auser, Courtland P. ''Nathaniel P. Willis''. New York: Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1969: 125.</ref> After 1901, the magazine's name became ''"Town & Country,''" and it has retained that name ever since.

Throughout most of the 19th century, this weekly magazine featured poetry, essays and fiction. As more influential people began reading it, the magazine began to include society news and gossip in its pages. After 1901, the magazine continued to chronicle the social events and leisure activities of the North American [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], including [[debutante]] or [[cotillion ball]]s, and also reported on the subsequent "advantageous marriages" that came from people meeting at such social engagements.

The magazine's earlier readership consisted of members of [[the Establishment]]. This included older wealthy families of [[New York City]], [[Boston Brahmins]] and, later, those people in other parts of the United States whose surnames may have appeared in the ''[[Social Register]]'' (established 1887).

Willis owned and edited the magazine from 1846 until his death in 1867.

===Modern history===
After Willis's death, the magazine went through several owners and editors until [[William Randolph Hearst]] acquired ownership in 1925. The first editor under Hearst ownership was Harry Bull. He edited the magazine from 1925 through 1949. Henry B. Sell became Bull's successor.

The magazine is still owned and published by the [[Hearst Corporation]].<ref name="hearst1">[http://beepdf.com/town-country ]</ref> It is published monthly, and its readership is composed of mainly younger [[socialites]], [[café society]], and [[middle class]] professionals.

Most of the advertising copy in the magazine is for [[luxury goods]] and services. The feature articles and photography focus primarily on [[fashion]], arts, culture, interior design, travel, weddings, parties, gala events and other interests and concerns of the [[upper class]].

In May 1993, Pamela Fiori became the first woman [[editor-in-chief]] of ''Town & Country'' magazine. During her tenure, Fiori was credited with increasing circulation by making the magazine more fashion forward and in recent years, making [[philanthropy]] more of a priority for the magazine.

Fiori also pushed for more diversity in the magazine's coverage. In an effort to play down the magazine's perceived snobbish and [[elitist]] [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], or [[preppy]] image, more [[celebrities]] have been showing up on the magazine's covers, and there has been an increase in the number of articles showcasing the events and weddings of socially prominent persons of African-American descent, as well as the social activities of people of other ethnicities.

On April 6, 2010, Fiori was replaced by Steven Drucker<ref name="hearst1"/> as the editor-in-chief of the magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clifford |first=Stephanie |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/town-countrys-pamela-fiori-out-in-editor-shuffle/ |title=Town & Country's Pamela Fiori Out in Editor Shuffle - NYTimes.com |publisher=Mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-04-06 |access-date=2013-05-28}}</ref> Jay Fielden was named editor-in-chief in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2011/01/jay-fielden-named-eic-at-emtown-countryem/|title=Jay Fielden Named EIC At Town & Country|date=2011-01-19|website=Observer|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/the-fix/article/catching-up-with-tcs-jay-fielden |title=Catching Up With...Town & Country's Jay Fielden  |publisher=Fashionweekdaily.com |access-date=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406071826/http://www.fashionweekdaily.com/the-fix/article/catching-up-with-tcs-jay-fielden |archivedate=2012-04-06}}</ref> Fielden was previously editor-in-chief of ''Men's Vogue.'' Earlier in his career, he had worked at ''Vogue'' and ''The New Yorker''. He said his goal was to bring "a lot of people under the tent" of "a snooty, exclusionary magazine."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/fashion/jay-fielden-new-editor-of-town-country-up-close.html|title=Jay Fielden, New Editor of Town & Country: Up Close|last=La Ferla|first=Ruth|date=2011-07-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-07-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He later said, "I gave ''Town & Country'' some teeth, reporting on behavior that wasn't always that which, well, [[Emily Post]] would approve, like having an evening toke instead of a Scotch on the rocks."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/fashion/esquire-magazine-jay-fielden.html|title=The 'Esquire Man' Is Dead.

Fielden inaugurated the T&C 50 lists, including rankings of philanthropists and influential American families. In 2014, he founded the ''Town & Country'' Philanthropy Summit, which has featured speakers such as [[Michael Bloomberg]], [[Chelsea Clinton]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Lin-Manuel Miranda]], and [[Geoffrey Canada]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/the-scene/parties/town-and-country-philanthropy-summit|title=The Inaugural Town & Country Philanthropy Summit|last=Dangremond|first=Sam|date=2014-05-29|website=Town & Country|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> Fielden left ''Town & Country'' in 2016, when he replaced [[David M. Granger]] as editor-in-chief of [[Esquire Magazine]]. ''Adweek'' wrote that Fielden had transformed the magazine from "dusty publication to buzzy brand."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/after-20-years-david-granger-stepping-down-esquires-editor-chief-169296/|title=After 20 Years, David Granger Is Stepping Down as Esquire's Editor in Chief|website=www.adweek.com|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>

According to ''[[HuffPost]]'' on May 9, 2018, ''Town & Country'' took criticism for disinviting [[Monica Lewinsky]] from its philanthropic summit because former President [[Bill Clinton]] decided to attend the event.<ref name="EPeckHuffPost05092018">Peck, Emily.

AccessDate = 5/9/2018.</ref> Hollywood producer [[Judd Apatow]] commented, "This is what everyone is fighting against."<ref name="EPeckHuffPost05092018" /> He then added that ''Town & Country'' "should be ashamed of themselves."<ref name="EPeckHuffPost05092018" />

===Spin-off===
In September 2003, a spin-off magazine entitled, ''Town & Country Travel'', appeared. It is published quarterly. In September 2007, ''Town & Country Travel'' launched a travel website and a staff travel blog. There is a special edition of the magazine focusing on wedding planning. In the past decade, the magazine has also published several [[etiquette]], wedding and lifestyle guidebooks. Among the most recent books published by the magazine is "Modern Manners: The Thinking Person's Guide to Social Graces," released in 2005 and edited by ''Town & Country'' senior editor [[Thomas Farley (manners expert)|Thomas Farley]].

In 2003, ''Town & Country'' released ''Town & Country Weddings'', which is published twice yearly.<ref name="hearst1"/>

The first international version of the magazine, called ''Town & Country Philippines'', was launched by [[Summit Media]] in 2007.

A British ''Town & Country'' magazine was launched by Hearst Magazines UK, a subsidiary of Hearst Corporation, in May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hearst Magazines UK Launches British Town & Country Magazine|url=http://www.hearst.co.uk/magazines/http://www.hearst.co.uk/news/hearst-magazines-uk-launches-british-town-country-new-take-luxury-culture-society|website=hearst.co.uk|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|access-date=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref name="Media Week Ridley">{{cite news|last1=Ridley|first1=Louise|title=Hearst to launch British Town & Country magaz|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/1227892/hearst-launch-british-town---country-magazine|access-date=19 June 2015|publisher=Media Week|date=21 January 2014}}</ref>
