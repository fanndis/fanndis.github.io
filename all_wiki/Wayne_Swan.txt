'''Wayne Maxwell Swan''' (born 30 June 1954) is an Australian politician who is [[Australian Labor Party National Executive#National Presidents|National President of the Labor Party]]. He was previously the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] and [[Australian Labor Party#ALP Federal Deputy Parliamentary Leaders|Deputy Leader of the Labor Party]] from 2010 to 2013, and the [[Treasurer of Australia]] from 2007 to 2013.

Swan was first elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[1993 Australian federal election|1993]] for [[Division of Lilley|Lilley]] in [[Queensland]], although he lost this seat in [[1996 Australian federal election|1996]]. He regained the seat in [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]] and represented it until retiring in [[2019 Australian federal election|2019]]. Following Labor's victory in [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]], Swan was appointed [[Treasurer of Australia]] by Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]. In this position, he played a key role in Australia's response to the [[Great Recession|Global Financial Crisis]] throughout 2008 and 2009. In 2010, after [[Julia Gillard]] became Prime Minister, Swan was elected unopposed as her deputy and was subsequently sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kenny, Mark |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/rudd-faces-party-challenge-number-crunch/story-e6frea8c-1225883388264 |title=Julia Gillard replaces Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister of Australia |work=Adelaide Now |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2010 }}</ref> In 2011, Swan was named Finance Minister of the Year by ''[[Euromoney]]'' magazine, joining [[Paul Keating]] as the only Australian Treasurer to have been awarded that title.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/2903395/Press-release-Australias-Wayne-Swan-named-Euromoneys-finance-minister-of-the-year.html|title=Press release: Australia's Wayne Swan named Euromoney's finance minister of the year|date=20 September 2011|publisher=Euromoney}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/wayne-swan-named-worlds-best-treasurer-by-euromoney-magazine/story-fn59niix-1226142190437 |title=Wayne Swan named world's best Treasurer by Euromoney magazine |work=The Australian |author=Uren, David |accessdate=17 March 2012 |date=21 September 2011 }}</ref> After Rudd [[June 2013 Australian Labor Party leadership spill|successfully challenged]] Gillard for the leadership in June 2013, Swan resigned from the Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-26/rudd-prevails-over-gillard-in-leadership-ballot/4783422 |title=Kevin Rudd defeats Julia Gillard 57-45 in Labor leadership ballot, paving way for a return to PM |author=Griffith, Emma |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |location=Australia |date=26 June 2013 <!-- 21:00  --> |accessdate=26 June 2013 }}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Swan was born and educated in [[Nambour, Queensland]]. He attended [[Nambour State High School]] and graduated in 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/genesis-of-an-ideas-man/story-e6frg6z6-1111112632287 |title=Genesis of an ideas man |work=The Australian |date=5 December 2006 |first1=Andrew |last1=Fraser |accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref> [[Kevin Rudd]] attended the same school at the same time, though was three years younger than Swan and the two did not know each other. 

Swan won a Commonwealth scholarship to study Public Administration at the [[University of Queensland]], where he resided at [[Emmanuel College, University of Queensland|Emmanuel College]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. After graduating he worked as a lecturer in the Department of Management at the [[Queensland University of Technology|Queensland Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Atkins |first=Dennis |title=Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd seek government reform |work=The Courier-Mail |date=2 August 2008 |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24112099-5016424,00.html |accessdate=21 August 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite interview |last=Swan |first=Wayne |title=Australian Treasurer |interviewer=[[Laurie Oakes]] |work=[[Sunday (Australian TV program)|Sunday]] |publisher=Nine Network |date=21 August 2007 |url=http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/political_transcripts/article_2335.asp?s=1 |accessdate=21 August 2008 |type=Interview: transcript }}{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref> From 1978 to 1980, Swan acted as a policy adviser to Labor Leader [[Bill Hayden]], and from 1983 to 1984 was an adviser to Government Ministers [[Mick Young]] and [[Kim Beazley]]. He later worked as the State Secretary of the [[Queensland Labor Party]] from 1991 to 1993.

==Political career==
===Parliament===
[[File:Nundah wayne swan office.jpg|thumb|left|Wayne Swan's office in 2013]]
Swan was first elected as the Member for Lilley in the [[1993 Australian federal election|1993 federal election]], but was defeated three years later by [[Elizabeth Grace]] in what was a large defeat for Labor nationwide. In 1996, Swan donated $500–$1400 (amount disputed) to the [[Australian Democrats]] campaign manager in his seat of Lilley.<ref>{{cite news |author=Karvelas, Patricia |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22241106-11949,00.html |title='Kick Swan out' for Democrats donation |work=The Australian |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203213618/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22241106-11949,00.html |archive-date=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> At the time, speculation surrounded the nature of the donation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s217353.htm |title=Preferential treatment |work=7.30 Report |location=Australia |author=Sanderson, Wayne |format=transcript |date=27 November 2000 |accessdate=23 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407180847/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s217353.htm |archive-date=7 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s218264.htm |title=Tracking the money path of the Swan donation |work=7.30 Report |location=Australia |date=29 November 2000 |accessdate=23 June 2010 |format=transcript |author=Royal, Simon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927042322/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s218264.htm |archive-date=27 September 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The matter was referred to the [[Australian Federal Police]] who chose to take no further action.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/22/1026898972144.html |title=Why Wayne Swan will not realise the ALP leadership |work=The Age |date=23 July 2002 |author=Pearson, Christopher |accessdate=23 June 2010 |location=Australia }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,24897,22236658-601,00.html |title=Swan targeted over Democrats money |work=The Australian |accessdate=23 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203213613/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,24897,22236658-601,00.html |archive-date=3 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> He worked as an adviser to Labor Leader [[Kim Beazley]] before contesting Lilley again in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]] and regaining the seat. 

===Shadow Cabinet===
Kim Beazley promoted Swan to the Shadow Cabinet in 1998. Initially serving as Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, he became the [[Manager of Opposition Business in the House (Australia)|Manager of Opposition Business]] in 2001. During the [[2003 Australian Labor Party leadership spills|2003 Labor leadership spills]] he was a prominent supporter of Kim Beazley, but retained his position in the Shadow Cabinet when [[Mark Latham]] became the new leader. After the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]] defeat, Swan was promoted to become Shadow Treasurer. This was seen by many as a surprise, as it was rumoured that Latham was intending to appoint then-Shadow Health Minister [[Julia Gillard]] to the position. It was believed that strong opposition from Labor's Right Faction had put Latham under pressure to appoint either Swan or Shadow Industrial Relations Minister [[Stephen Smith (Australian politician)|Stephen Smith]] to the position.<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Toohey |title=Swan's Song |date=17 April 2007 |url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=260154 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708010728/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=260154 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |work=The Bulletin |pages=17–23 | accessdate=10 January 2008 }}</ref> Early in the role, Swan worked to devise Labor's response to the [[John Howard|Howard Government]]'s 2006 budget, with Labor proposing tax relief for low- and middle-income earners. Swan launched his book during the same month, ''[[Postcode: The Splintering of a Nation]]''.

After [[Kevin Rudd]] successfully challenged Kim Beazley to win the leadership of the Labor Party in December 2006, he reappointed Swan as Shadow Treasurer. In early November 2007, Swan and Rudd revisited their old high school in Nambour. Rudd gave a speech to students, in which he said that, while at school, "Wayne was very, very cool; and I was very, very not".<ref>{{cite news |title=Labor says Coalition spending will raise inflation |work=PM (ABC Radio) |location=Australia |date=13 November 2007 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s2089825.htm |format=transcript |author=Donald, Peta |accessdate=5 December 2007}}</ref>

[[File:WayneSwan.jpg|thumb|left|Swan in 2008]]
Following Labor's landslide win in the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], Swan was appointed [[Treasurer of Australia]] by Kevin Rudd on 3 December 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/29/2105169.htm |title=Rudd hands out portfolios |publisher=ABC News |location=Australia |date=29 November 2007 }}</ref>

Swan's first budget concentrated on inflationary pressures in the economy, with substantially reduced spending that exceeded the A$11&nbsp;billion outlaid for tax cuts. The policy debate shifted around August 2008 after mortgage lending banks in the United States [[Late 2000s recession|began to collapse]] and economic activity [[Late 2000s recession in Australasia|faltered]] as American investments were written off. In response to the resulting global downturn, Swan coordinated an "economic security strategy" worth $10&nbsp;billion in October 2008. Designed as a [[Stimulus (economic)|stimulus package]] and directed towards retail sales, it was largely supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]]. When the December quarterly growth report showed the economy contracting, he moved ahead with the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to provide government-sponsored work worth A$42&nbsp;billion. This action was widely credited with preventing Australia from following much of the world into recession, as the March 2009 quarterly growth report showed that the economy had returned to growth.

On 20 September 2011, Swan was named [[Euromoney Finance Minister of the Year|Finance Minister of the Year]] by ''[[Euromoney]]'' magazine, joining [[Paul Keating]] as the only Australian Treasurer to have been conferred that title.<ref name="auto"/><ref name="auto1"/>

In an essay published in ''[[The Monthly]]'' magazine in March 2012, Swan criticised the rising influence of vested interests, in particular paying attention to mining entrepreneurs [[Clive Palmer]], [[Gina Rinehart]] and [[Andrew Forrest]], and how Swan believed they are threatening Australia's egalitarian social contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/rising-influence-vested-interests-australia-001-cent-wayne-swan-4670 |title=The 0.01 Per Cent: The Rising Influence of Vested Interests in Australia |author=Swan, Wayne |date=March 2012 |work=The Monthly |accessdate=17 March 2012 }}</ref> and a subsequent address to the [[National Press Club (Australia)|National Press Club]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2012/s3446124.htm |title=Swan launches second assault on mining billionaires |date=5 March 2012 |format=transcript |work=PM (ABC Radio) |location=Australia |accessdate=17 March 2012 }}</ref> In ''The Monthly'' essay he opined:
<blockquote>The latest example of this is the foray by Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart, into [[Fairfax Media]], reportedly in an attempt to wield greater influence on public opinion and further her commercial interests at a time when the overwhelming economic consensus is that it's critical to use the economic weight of the resources boom to strengthen the entire economy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Politicians have a choice: between exploiting divisions by promoting fear and appealing to the sense of fairness and decency that is the foundation of our middle-class society; between standing up for workers and kneeling down at the feet of the Gina Rineharts and the Clive Palmers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For every Andrew Forrest who wails about high company taxes and then admits to not paying any, there are a hundred Australian businesspeople who held on to their employees and worked with government to keep the doors of Australian business open during the GFC. Despite the howling of a small minority, the vast bulk of the resources industry is in the cart for more efficient profits-based resource taxation which serves to strengthen our entire economy. The vast majority of our miners accept that they have a social obligation to pay their fair share of tax on the resources Australians own.</blockquote>

===Deputy Prime Minister===

On 23 June 2010, Deputy Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] [[2010 Australian Labor Party leadership spill|challenged]] Kevin Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party. Realising that he no longer had enough support to retain his position, Rudd resigned the following day, allowing Gillard to be elected unopposed. Swan stood to fill the vacant position of Deputy Leader, and was also elected unopposed. He was sworn in as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] later that day. Days later, Swan attended the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|G20 Toronto Summit]] in Gillard's place.<ref>{{cite news |author=O'Malley, Sandra |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/swan-to-take-international-stage-at-g20-20100626-zahn.html |title=Swan to take International Stage at G20 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=6 April 2011 }}</ref> He would regularly stand in for Gillard as Acting Prime Minister for the next three years.

===Resignation and retirement===

Swan resigned from his positions to return to the backbench following the return of Kevin Rudd to the leadership in June 2013. After Labor lost the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]], he remained in Parliament and retained his seat at the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]]. On 10 February 2018, he announced that he would not contest the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]] and that he would retire from politics.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dziedzic|first1=Stephen|last2=Doran|first2=Matthew|title=Former treasurer Wayne Swan to bow out of federal politics|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-10/wayne-swan-announces-retirement-at-next-election/9418788|accessdate=10 February 2018|work=ABC News|date=10 February 2018}}</ref>
