The '''Group of Eight''' ('''G8''') was an [[inter-governmental political forum]] from 1997 until 2014.<ref name="cfr" /> It had formed from incorporating the country of [[Russia]] into the [[Group of Seven]], or G7, and returned to its previous name after Russia was disinvited in 2014.<ref name="russia-suspension">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/russia-g8-kremlin-crimea-ukraine-vladimir-putin-g7-g20-a7525836.html|title=Russia just quit the G8 for good}}</ref>

The forum originated with a [[1st G6 summit|1975 summit]] hosted by [[France]] that brought together representatives of six governments: France, [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]], thus leading to the name [[Group of Six]] or G6. The summit came to be known as the Group of Seven, in 1976 with the addition of [[Canada]]. [[Russia]] was added to the political forum from 1997, which the following year became known as the G8. In March 2014 Russia was suspended indefinitely following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]], whereupon the political forum name reverted to G7.<ref name="CNN.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/24/politics/obama-europe-trip/index.html |title=U.S., other powers kick Russia out of G8 |publisher=CNN.com |date=24 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Russia Is Ousted From Group of 8 by U.S. and Allies|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/world/europe/obama-russia-crimea.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 March 2014|access-date=21 December 2015|issn=0362-4331|first=Alison|last=Smale|first2=Michael D.|last2=Shear}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/03/24/there-is-no-g8-russia-suspended-from-exclusive-club-until-it-changes-course-group-of-seven-nations-says/|title=Russia suspended from G8 over annexation of Crimea, Group of Seven nations says |work=National Post |date=24 March 2014|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref> In 2017 Russia announced its permanent withdrawal from the G8.<ref name="russia-suspension"/>  However, several representatives of G7 countries stated that they would be interested in Russia's return to the group.<ref name="TASS">{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/735279|title=Italy hopes G7 returns to G8 format – Foreign Ministry|date=8 June 2014|publisher=[[ITAR-TASS]]}}</ref><ref name="ANSA">{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2014/07/03/italy-working-for-russia-return-to-g8_dd003e4e-484e-4b43-9b12-34cd8eb85036.html|title=Italy working for Russia return to G8|publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|date=3 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Ischinger">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewi.info/idea/amb-wolfgang-ischinger-urges-inclusion-russia-g8|title=Amb.

"G7" can refer to the member states in aggregate or to the annual [[summit meeting]] of the G7 [[heads of government]]. G7 ministers also meet throughout the year, such as the [[G7 (finance ministers)|G7 finance ministers]] (who meet four times a year), G7 foreign ministers, or G7 environment ministers.

Each calendar year, the responsibility of hosting the G8 was rotated through the member states in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The holder of the [[presidency]] sets the agenda, hosts the summit for that year, and determines which ministerial meetings will take place.

In 2005, the UK government initiated the practice of inviting five leading emerging markets — [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]] — to participate in the G8 meetings that came to be known as [[G8+5]], but this practice was short-lived.<ref name="cfr" /> With the [[G20|G20 major economies]] growing in stature since the [[2008 G-20 Washington summit|2008 Washington summit]], world leaders from the group announced at their [[2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit|Pittsburgh summit]] in September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/09/24/us.g.twenty.summit/index.html|title=Officials: G-20 to supplant G-8 as international economic council |publisher=CNN|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1099172/G20-to-replace-the-G8 |title=G20 to replace the G8 |publisher=SBS |date=26 September 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927054722/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1099172/G20-to-replace-the-G8 |archive-date=27 September 2009}}</ref> Nevertheless, the G7 retains its relevance as a "steering group for the [[Western world|West]]",<ref name="cfr">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/global-governance/group-eight-g8-industrialized-nations/p10647|title=The Group of Eight (G8) Industrialized Nations|publisher=CFR|access-date=21 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115103825/http://www.cfr.org/global-governance/group-eight-g8-industrialized-nations/p10647|archive-date=15 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> with special significance appointed to Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/02/12/japan-and-the-g20-ambivalence-and-the-china-factor/|title=Japan and the G20: Ambivalence and the China factor|date=11 February 2011}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|Group of Seven#History}}

Following [[20th G7 summit|1994's G7 summit in Naples]], Russian officials held separate meetings with leaders of the G7 after the group's summits. This informal arrangement was dubbed the Political 8 (P8)—or, colloquially, the G7+1. At the invitation of UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]],<ref>[http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=5151 "Russia&nbsp;— Odd Man Out in the G-8", Mark Medish, ''The Globalist'', 02-24-2006].Accessed: 7 December 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305052221/http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=5151 |date=5 March 2008 }}</ref> President [[Boris Yeltsin]] was invited first as a guest observer, later as a full participant. It was seen as a way to encourage Yeltsin with his capitalist reforms. Russia formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of Eight, or G8.

===Food===
A major focus of the G8 since 2009 has been the global [[food security|supply of food]].<ref name="Reuters 5May">{{cite news|title=Cash-strapped G8 looks to private sector in hunger fight|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/g8-food-idUSL1E8GHE3520120518|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=18 May 2012}}</ref> At the 2009 [[L'Aquila]] summit, the G8's members promised to contribute $22 billion to the issue.

At the 2012 summit, [[President Barack Obama]] asked G8 leaders to adopt the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition initiative to "help the rural poor produce more food and sell it in thriving local and regional markets as well [[Globalization|as on the global market]]".<ref>{{cite news|last=Tandon |first=Shaun |title=Obama turns to private sector to feed world's poor |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jUyBu2GrB9ESl2EeXWyJQWwR0f-g?docId=CNG.3fbd5b32739e3209c58578b8a8480023.521 |accessdate=18 May 2012 |newspaper=Agence France-Presse |date=18 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131045725/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jUyBu2GrB9ESl2EeXWyJQWwR0f-g?docId=CNG.3fbd5b32739e3209c58578b8a8480023.521 |archive-date=31 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Patrick|first=Stewart M.|title=Why This Year's G8 Summit Matters|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/05/why-this-years-g8-summit-matters/257249/|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=16 May 2012}}</ref>  [[Ghana]] became one of the first six African countries to sign up to the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|title=G8 Cooperation framework to support The "New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition" in Ghana|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/208055/new-alliance-progress-report-coop-framework-ghana.pdf|publisher=Group of Eight Camp David}}</ref> There was, however, almost no knowledge of the G8 initiative among some [[Stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]], including farmers, academics and agricultural campaign groups.

===Russia's participation suspension (2014)===
On 24 March, 2014, the G7 members cancelled the planned [[40th G7 summit|G8 summit]] that was to be held in June of that year in the Russian city of Sochi, and suspended Russia's membership of the group, due to [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russia's annexation of Crimea]]; nevertheless, they stopped short of outright permanent expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ukraine crisis: Russia scathing about G8 suspension as fears grow |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-g-7-leaders-cancel-g-8-summit-in-sochi-until-russia-changes-course-9213000.html|date=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref> Russian foreign minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] downplayed the importance of the decision by the U.S. and its allies, and pointed out that major international decisions were made by the [[G20]] countries.<ref name="Insider">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-temporarily-kicked-out-of-g8-club-of-rich-countries-2014-3 |title=Russia Temporarily Kicked Out Of G8 Club Of Rich Countries|website=Business Insider |date=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="CNN.com" />

Later on, the Italian Foreign Affairs minister [[Federica Mogherini]] and other Italian authorities,<ref name="TASS"/><ref name="ANSA"/> along with the [[EastWest Institute]] board member [[Wolfgang Ischinger]],<ref name="Ischinger"/> suggested that Russia may restore its membership in the group. In April 2015, the German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] said that Russia would be welcomed to return to G8 provided the [[Minsk Protocol]] was implemented.<ref name="Steinmeier"/> In 2016, he added that "none of the major international conflicts can be solved without Russia", and the G7 countries will consider Russia's return to the group in 2017.

He also said that G20 is sufficient for Russian Federation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/russia-brushes-off-possibility-of-g-8-return|title=Russia brushes off possibility of G-8 return|last=hermesauto|date=9 June 2018}}</ref> In the final statement of the 2018 meeting in Canada, the G7 members announced to continue sanctions and also to be ready to take further restrictive measures against the Russian Federation for the failure of Minsk Agreement complete implementation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-summit-communique-text/the-charlevoix-g7-summit-communique-idUSKCN1J5107|title=The Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique|first=Reuters|last=Editorial}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.com/world/1008994|title=G7 leaders ready to step up anti-Russian sanctions|website=TASS}}</ref>

==Structure and activities==
[[File:Ten leaders at G8 summit, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Leaders of the G8 on 18 June 2013, in [[Lough Erne]], Northern Ireland, United Kingdom]]
By design, the G8 deliberately lacked an administrative structure like those for international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] or the [[World Bank]]. The group does not have a permanent secretariat, or offices for its members.

The presidency of the group rotates annually among member countries, with each new term beginning on 1 January of the year. The rotation order is: France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia (suspended), Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/what_is_g8.html|title=What is the G8?|author=G8 Research Group|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> The country holding the presidency is responsible for planning and hosting a series of ministerial-level meetings, leading up to a mid-year summit attended by the heads of government.

The ministerial meetings bring together ministers responsible for various portfolios to discuss issues of mutual or global concern. The range of topics include health, law enforcement, labor, economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs, justice and interior, terrorism, and trade. There are also a separate set of meetings known as the [[G8+5]], created during the 2005 [[Gleneagles, Scotland|Gleneagles]], Scotland summit, that is attended by finance and energy ministers from all eight member countries in addition to the five "outreach countries" which are also known as the [[Group of Five]]—[[Brazil]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.groupoffive.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013008/http://www.groupoffive.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-07-10 |title=G5 Overview; Evolución del Grupo de los Cinco |publisher=Groupoffive.org |accessdate=2010-06-27 }}</ref>

In June 2005, justice ministers and interior ministers from the G8 countries agreed to launch an international database on [[pedophile]]s.<ref name=pedophile>[http://society.guardian.co.uk/children/story/0,,1509107,00.html "G8 to launch international pedophile database"] David Batty 18 June 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> The G8 officials also agreed to pool data on [[terrorism]], subject to restrictions by privacy and security laws in individual countries.<ref name=terrorismdata>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1509218,00.html "G8 to pool data on terrorism]" Martin Wainwright, 18 June 2005, ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

[[File:G8 leaders confer together.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|G8 leaders confer during the [[35th G8 summit|2009 summit]] in [[L'Aquila]] ([[Abruzzo]], Italy).]]

At the [[33rd G8 summit|Heiligendamm Summit]] in 2007, the G8 acknowledged a proposal from the EU for a worldwide initiative on [[efficient energy use]]. They agreed to explore, along with the [[International Energy Agency]], the most effective means to promote energy efficiency internationally. A year later, on 8 June 2008, the G8 along with China, India, South Korea and the [[European Community]] established the [[International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation]], at the Energy Ministerial meeting hosted by Japan holding 2008 G8 Presidency, in [[Aomori]].<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/08/380&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=e The International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC).] 8 June 2008.</ref>

G8 Finance Ministers, whilst in preparation for the [[34th G8 summit|34th Summit of the G8 Heads of State and Government]] in [[Toyako, Hokkaido]], met on the 13 and 14 June 2008, in [[Osaka, Japan]]. They agreed to the "G8 Action Plan for Climate Change to Enhance the Engagement of Private and Public Financial Institutions." In closing, Ministers supported the launch of new [[Climate Investment Funds]] (CIFs) by the [[World Bank]], which will help existing efforts until a new framework under the [[UNFCCC]] is implemented after 2012. The UNFCCC is not on track to meeting any of its stated goals.<ref>{{cite news|title=G8 Finance Ministers Support Climate Investment Funds|url=http://climate-l.iisd.org/news/g8-finance-ministers-support-climate-investment-funds/|newspaper=IISD – Climate Change Policy & Practice|date=14 June 2008}}</ref>

===Annual summit===
{{Main|Group of Seven#List of summits}}

The [[23rd G8 summit|first G8 summit]] was held in 1997 after Russia formally joined the G7 group, and the [[39th G8 summit|last one]] was held in 2013. The [[40th G7 summit|2014 summit]] was scheduled to be held in Russia. However, due to the [[2014 Crimean crisis|Crimean crisis]], the other seven countries decided to hold a separate meeting without Russia as a G7 summit in Brussels, Belgium.

Some criticism centres on the assertion that members of G8 do not do enough to help global problems, due to strict [[patent]] policy and other issues related to [[Economic globalization|globalization]]. In ''Unraveling Global Apartheid'', political analyst Titus Alexander described the G7, as it was in 1996, as the 'cabinet' of global minority rule, with a coordinating role in world affairs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Titus|title=Unraveling Global Apartheid: An overview of world politics|publisher=Polity Press|year=1996|pages=212–213}}</ref>

[[Vladimir Putin]] did not attend the 2012 G8 summit at [[Camp David]], causing ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine to remark that the summit has generally outlived its usefulness as a viable international gathering of foreign leaders.<ref name=FN>{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/14/welcome_to_the_new_world_order| title=Welcome to the New World Disorder| work=[[Foreign Policy]]| first=Ian| last=Bremmer| date=14 May 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Two years later, Russia was suspended from the G8, then chose to leave permanently in January 2017.

The [[G20]] major economies leaders' summit has had an increased level of international prestige and influence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bosco.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/05/16/three_cheers_for_homogeneity| title=Three cheers for homogeneity| work=[[Foreign Policy]]| first=David| last=Bosco| date=16 May 2012| accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> However, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] said of the G8 in 2012:<ref>{{cite web|last=Horgan |first=Colin |url=http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/11/21/the-g8-still-matters-david-camero/ |title=The G8 still matters: David Cameron|publisher=Ipolitics.ca |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=2014-03-25}}</ref>

<blockquote>Some people ask, does the G8 still matter, when we have a Group of 20? My answer is, yes. The G8 is a group of like-minded countries that share a belief in free enterprise as the best route to growth. As eight countries making up about half the world's gross domestic product, the standards we set, the commitments we make, and the steps we take can help solve vital global issues, fire up economies and drive prosperity all over the world.</blockquote>

==Youth 8 Summit==
The Y8 Summit or simply Y8, formerly known as the G8 Youth Summit<ref>{{cite web|author=Bogott, Nicole|title=Global gerechte Handelspolitik|work=The European|date=June 2010|url=http://www.theeuropean.de/nicole-bogott/3581-g8-g20-youth-summit|language=de|access-date=14 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201239/http://www.theeuropean.de/nicole-bogott/3581-g8-g20-youth-summit|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> is the youth counterpart to the G8 summit.<ref>{{cite book|author1 =Dobson, Hugo|chapter=The G8, the G20, and Civil Society|editor1=avona, Paolo |editor2=Kirton, John J. |editor3=Oldani, Chiara |title=Global Financial Crisis: Global Impact and Solutions|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|pages=247, 251|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r63ZtJEJ7x0C&printsec=frontcover|isbn=140940272X}}</ref> The summits were organized from 2006 to 2013. The first summit to use the name Y8 took place in May 2012 in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]], alongside the Youth G8 that took place in [[Washington, D.C.]] the same year. From 2016 onwards, similar youth conferences were organized under the name Y7 Summit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.younglead.eu/activities/y7-y20-summits/#y20-2018|title=Y7/Y8 and Y20 Summits}}</ref>

The Y8 Summit brings together young leaders from G8 nations and the [[European Union]] to facilitate discussions of [[international affairs]], promote cross-cultural understanding, and build global friendships. The conference closely follows the formal negotiation procedures of the G8 Summit.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brun, Martine|title=Camille Grossetete, une Claixoise au Youth 8|work=Dauphiné Libéré|date=July 2013|url=http://bayimg.com/iaPNHAaeP|language=fr}}</ref> The Y8 Summit represents the innovative voice of young adults between the age of 18 and 35.

The Y8 Summit was organized annually by a global network of youth-led organizations called The IDEA (The International Diplomatic Engagement Association).<ref>{{cite web|title=The President and CEO's Notebook: What is The IDEA?|url=http://yadlusa.org/2013/04/22/the-president-and-ceos-notebook-what-is-the-idea/|publisher=Young Americans for Diplomatic Leadership|accessdate=21 December 2015|date=22 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222114654/http://yadlusa.org/2013/04/22/the-president-and-ceos-notebook-what-is-the-idea/|archive-date=22 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The organizations undertake the selection processes for their respective national delegations, while the hosting country is responsible for organizing the summit. An example of such a youth-led organization is the [[Young European Leadership]] association, which recruits and sends EU Delegates.

The goal of the Y8 Summit is to bring together young people from around the world to allow the voices and opinions of young generations to be heard and to encourage them to take part in global decision-making processes.<ref>{{cite web|website=www.teraz.sk|title=ladý Slovák zastupoval Slovensko a EÚ na mládežníckom summite G20 |date= June 2012|url=http://www.teraz.sk/ekonomika/mlady-slovak-zastupoval-slovensko-a-e/12769-clanok.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Enenkel|first= Kathrin|title= G8 Youth Summit and Europe's Voice 2009: Results and Reflexions|year= 2009|url= https://books.google.com/?id=pHyHmwEACAAJ}}</ref>
