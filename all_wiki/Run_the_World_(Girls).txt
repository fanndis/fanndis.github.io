"'''Run the World (Girls)'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé Knowles]], from her fourth studio album ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011), released as the lead single from the album on April 21, 2011. It was written by [[The-Dream|Terius "The-Dream" Nash]] and Beyoncé, while heavily sampling "[[Pon de Floor]]" by [[Major Lazer]] written by [[Afrojack|Nick "Afrojack" van de Wall]], [[Diplo|Wesley "Diplo" Pentz]], [[Switch (house DJ)|David "Switch" Taylor]] and [[Vybz Kartel|Adidja "Vybz Kartel" Palmer]]. Production was handled by Switch, The-Dream, Beyoncé, and [[Shea Taylor]]. The song's development was motivated by Beyoncé wanting to do something different: a mixture of different cultures and eras, a new sound, and a message which would give women strength. An unedited [[demo (music)|demo]] of the song, then thought to be titled "Girls (Who Run the World)", was [[Internet leak|leaked]] on the internet on April 18, 2011. "Run the World" premiered on US radio on April 21, 2011, and was digitally released the same day.

"Run the World" is an  [[electropop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song that heavily [[sample (music)|samples]] "[[Pon de Floor]]" by [[Major Lazer]]. The song's title and lyrics comprise an unapologetically aggressive message promoting [[Women's rights|female empowerment]]. "Run the World" initially divided critics; some complimented the song's sample, its musical direction, and Beyoncé's aggressiveness, while others criticized the continuation of past themes and stated that they wanted to see Beyoncé covering new topics. Several critics compared "Run the World" to Beyoncé's other singles with similar themes such as "[[Independent Women]]" (2000) – with [[Destiny's Child]], and "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" (2008) among others, stating that "Run the World" takes a more direct and assertive approach towards female empowerment.

The single peaked at number 29 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming her lowest performing lead single to date, and reached the top 10 in Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Scotland. "Run the World" was a top 20 hit in Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and was filmed in [[California]] over a three-day span. The video won [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] at the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]] and Best Dance Performance at the 2011 [[Soul Train Music Awards]].

Beyoncé promoted "Run the World" with high-profile live performances, notably at the 2011 [[Billboard Music Award]]s and on the French ''[[X Factor (France)|X Factor]]''. Although her performance at the ''Billboard'' Music Awards was well received by critics, it ignited controversy surrounding the production due to visual similarities to a performance by Italian entertainer [[Lorella Cuccarini]] in February 2010 at the 60th [[Sanremo Music Festival]] in Italy. "Run the World" was used to awaken the crew of [[STS-135|the final mission]] of the US [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]] and was dedicated to Mission Specialist [[Sandra Magnus]]. [[Heather Morris]] covered "Run the World" for "[[Asian F]]", an episode of the American television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.

It was produced by Switch, The-Dream, Beyoncé and Taylor. "Run the World" was recorded by [[DJ Swivel]] and [[Pat Thrall]] at MSR Studios, New York City, and was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios, Virginia Beach.<ref name="albumnotes"/> Before release, the song's title was rumored to be "Girls (Who Run the World)".<ref name="BBhit">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471944/beyonces-run-the-world-girls-single-to-hit-itunes-thursday |title=Beyoncé's 'Run the World (Girls)' Single to Hit iTunes Tomorrow |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> On April 14, 2011, two portions of the song [[Internet leak|leaked online]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/04/14/snippet-of-beyonces-new-single-hits-the-net/ |title=Snippet of Beyoncé's New Single Hits the Net |work=[[Rap-Up]] |publisher=Devin Lazerine |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name="billf"/> while an unfinished [[demo (music)|demo]] of "Run the World (Girls)" was leaked online on April 18, 2011.<ref name="Girls">{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/04/18/new-music-beyonce-girls-who-run-the-world/ |title=Beyoncé Drops Official Version Of 'Run The World (Girls)' |work=Rap-Up |publisher=Devin Lazerine |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Beyoncé described the song:
<blockquote>
It's definitely riskier than something a bit more... simple. I just heard the track and loved that it was so different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.<ref name="billde"/>

<blockquote>
"Run the World (Girls)" is a complex but catchy track that's actually more reminiscent of [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] and [[Santigold]] than Sasha Fierce. The song combines a dancefloor-defying military drumbeat, a sample from Switch's group Major Lazer, an unconventional song structure and some incongruously pretty, layered melodics that are basically chanted but still employ [Knowles'] full vocal range. The lyrics, however, are just as female-empowering as we've come to expect. There's much more to the song than first meets the ear—it confuses on first listen but coalesces beautifully with repeated plays.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1067784/beyonce-run-the-world-girls |title=Beyonce, Run the World (Girls) |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |first=Jem |last=Aswad |date=May 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 12, 2011}}</ref>

<blockquote>
"I just shot a Beyoncé video at the beginning of this last week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, which was fun, and I hadn't done a video since 2009. It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her."<ref name="francis">{{cite web|last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662164/francis-lawrence-beyonce-girls-video.jhtml |title=Beyoncé's 'Girls' Video Will Be 'Big', Director Says |publisher=MTV News.

===Synopsis===
[[File:Beyonce-runtheworldGIRLS.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Beyoncé stands with her female army, clenching their fists in the air and waving "B"-flags.]]
The video begins with Beyoncé riding a black horse over an open, deserted plain. As the horse lifts off the ground, scenes of Beyoncé standing atop a ruined vehicle are shown, as she leads a large army of women. Additional scenery includes a large bull in the middle of the battleground and a large banner featuring an African themed drawing of Beyoncé. A woman seemingly nailed on a cross is later seen. As several scantily clad women are shown, a [[SWAT]] team of men charge towards the battlefield as a sample from Major Lazer's "Pon de Floor" is played. As the male forces arrive, Beyoncé, is wearing a large golden helm and is surrounded by a lion, a large group of women prepared for battle and banners featuring Beyoncé insignia. As the song begins, Beyoncé removes her armor and confronts the male army, engaging in a series of shoulder-thrusting dance routines.

Beyoncé dances seductively towards the men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, the first of which is a white evening gown as she grasps the chains of two chained hyenas. As the confrontation escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front of a small group of her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.

===Reception===
The video received general acclaim from critics. On the night of the video's premiere, ''Rap-Up'' complimented Beyoncé on starting a "dance revolution", her "heavily-choreographed visuals" and "menagerie of wild animals, outrageous fashion, and epic dance sequences".<ref name="rapupvideo">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/05/18/video-beyonce-run-the-world-girls/ |title=Video: Beyoncé – 'Run the World (Girls)' |publisher=Devin Lazerine |work=Rap-Up |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé comes off like "barely sentient" but added that she remains cohesive and rational as a human being in real life.

<blockquote>
