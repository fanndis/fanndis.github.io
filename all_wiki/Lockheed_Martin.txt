==History==

===1990s===
Merger talks between [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[Martin Marietta]] began in March 1994, with the companies announcing their $10&nbsp;billion planned merger on August 30, 1994. The headquarters for the combined companies would be at Martin Marietta headquarters in [[North Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Floyd |last=Norris|title=A 'merger of equals,' with Martin Marietta the most equal |work=The New York Times |date=August 31, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/31/business/market-place-a-merger-of-equals-with-martin-marietta-the-most-equal.html}}</ref> The deal was finalized on March 15, 1995, when the two companies' shareholders approved the merger.<ref>{{cite news|title=Martin Marietta-Lockheed merger is approved|work=The New York Times|date=March 16, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/16/business/company-news-martin-marietta-lockheed-merger-is-approved.html}}</ref> The segments of the two companies not retained by the new company formed the basis for the [[L-3 Communications]], a mid-size defense contractor in its own right. Lockheed Martin also later spun off the materials company [[Martin Marietta Materials]].

The company reportedly received billions of dollars in subsidies to complete the merger.  Executives also received large bonuses directly from the government as a result of the merger.  [[Norman R. Augustine]] who was at the time CEO of Martin Marietta received an $8.2 million bonus.  This was strongly opposed by Senator [[Bernie Sanders]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/5d722dfdd62b97a758ab5cc097220138|title=Audit Recommends Slashing Pentagon Incentive Pay for Defense Execs|last=Diamond|first=John|website=AP NEWS|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref>

Both companies contributed important products to the new portfolio. Lockheed products included the [[Trident missile]], [[P-3 Orion]] [[maritime patrol aircraft]], [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] and [[SR-71]] [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance airplanes]], [[F-117|F-117 Nighthawk]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[F-22 Raptor]], [[C-130 Hercules]], [[A-4AR Fightinghawk]] and the DSCS-3 satellite. Martin Marietta products included [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan rockets]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]] (management contract acquired in 1993), [[Space Shuttle external tank|Space Shuttle External Tank]], [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] landers, the Transfer Orbit Stage (under subcontract to [[Orbital Sciences Corporation]]) and various satellite models.

On April 22, 1996, Lockheed Martin completed the acquisition of [[Loral Corporation]]'s defense electronics and system integration businesses for $9.1&nbsp;billion, the deal having been announced in January. The remainder of Loral became [[Loral Space & Communications]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Mintz |title=Lockheed-Martin Loral Merger May Mean a Loss of Business; McDonnell Douglas Threatens to Cancel Billions in Contracts|work=The Washington Post |date=April 23, 1996}}</ref> Lockheed Martin abandoned plans for an $8.3&nbsp;billion merger with [[Northrop Grumman]] on July 16, 1998, due to government concerns over the potential strength of the new group; Lockheed/Northrop would have had control of 25% of the Department of Defense's procurement budget.<ref>{{cite news |first=Leslie |last=Wayne|title=Lockheed cancels Northrop merger, citing U.S. stand |work=The New York Times |date=July 17, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/business/lockheed-cancels-northrop-merger-citing-us-stand.html}}</ref>

For the [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], Lockheed Martin incorrectly provided NASA with software using measurements in [[United States customary units|US Customary force units]] when metric was expected; this resulted in the loss of the Orbiter at a cost of $125&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/ |title=Metric mishap caused loss of NASA orbiter |work=CNN |date=September 30, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_15_156/ai_57155808/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904163705/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_15_156/ai_57155808 |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 4, 2004 |title=Math error equals loss of Mars orbiter |work=Science News|date=October 9, 1999}}</ref>  The development of the spacecraft cost $193.1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=aviationearth&e=com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511180550/http://www.aviationearth.com/the-lockheed-martin-corporation/|url-status= dead|title=HugeDomains.com - AviationEarth.com is for sale (Aviation Earth)|archivedate=May 11, 2013|website=www.hugedomains.com}}</ref>

In addition to their military products, in the 1990s Lockheed Martin developed the [[texture mapping]] chip for the [[Sega Model 2]] [[arcade system board]] and the entire graphics system for the [[Sega Model 3]], which were used to power some of the most popular arcade games of the time.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Peacetime Programmers|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=97 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1997|pages=66–67}}</ref>

==Corruption investigations==
On March 3, 2012, the U.S. Justice Department said that Lockheed Martin had agreed to settle allegations that the defense contractor had sold overpriced perishable tools used on many contracts.

In 2013, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan criticized the company's F-35 fighter program. The general said: "I want them both to start behaving like they want to be around for 40 years...I want them to take on some of the risk of this program. I want them to invest in cost reductions. I want them to do the things that will build a better relationship. I'm not getting all that love yet."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/business/lockheed-criticized-by-f-35-jet-program-chief.html?gwh=A3B475A95F1953E78A6BB177A73AEB78 |work=The New York Times |first=Christopher |last=Drew |title=Lockheed Criticized by F-35 Jet Program Chief |date=February 27, 2013}}</ref> The criticism comes in the wake of previous criticism from former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert Gates]] regarding the same program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/02/03/83590/lockheed-martin-downplays-gates.html|title=Lockheed Martin downplays Gates' criticism of F-35 program|author=Bob Cox|work=The Fort Worth Star-Telegram|date=February 3, 2010|access-date=September 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514040520/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/02/03/83590/lockheed-martin-downplays-gates.html|archive-date=May 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Lobbying===
According to the magazine ''[[Politico]]'', Lockheed Martin has "a political network that is already the envy of its competitors", and its contracts enjoy wide bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress thanks to it having "perfected the strategy of spreading jobs on weapons programs in key states and congressional districts".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Munsil|first1=Leigh|last2=Wright|first2=Austin|title=Is Lockheed Martin too big to fail?
