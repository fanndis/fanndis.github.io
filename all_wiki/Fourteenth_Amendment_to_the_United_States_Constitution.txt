The '''Fourteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XIV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Arguably one of the most consequential amendments, it addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.

The amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.

The Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.

The second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to "rebellion, or other crime" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current [[United States Congress|Congress]] from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by "appropriate legislation;" however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.

{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.

'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.

===Proposal by Congress===

In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name="Stromberg111">Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&pg=PA46|access-date=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.</ref>

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199–200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250–251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

More than seventy proposals for an amendment were drafted.<ref>Soifer, "Prohibition of Voluntary Peonage" (2012), p. 1614.</ref> In late 1865, the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee on Reconstruction]] proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=252}} This amendment passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of [[Radical Republican]]s led by [[Charles Sumner]], who believed the proposal a "compromise with wrong", and Democrats opposed to black rights.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by Representative [[John Bingham|John A. Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard "equal protection of life, liberty, and property" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The House of Representatives passed ''House Resolution 127, 39th Congress'' several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and{{nbsp}}4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138–36 vote (10 not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government|page=44|editor=James J.

The [[Radical Republicans]] were satisfied that they had secured civil rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks; in particular, the right to vote.<ref name=Carter>Carter, Dan.

On June 16, 1866, Secretary of State William Seward transmitted the Fourteenth Amendment to the governors of the several states for its ratification. State legislatures in every formerly Confederate state, with the exception of Tennessee, refused to ratify it. This refusal led to the passage of the [[Reconstruction Acts]]. Ignoring the existing state governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.<ref name=america.gov>{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2008/04/20080407120920eaifas0.4535639.html#axzz3whB8pdn2|title=The Civil War And Reconstruction|access-date=January 8, 2016}}</ref> It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2, 1867, requiring that a former Confederate state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before "said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress".<ref>An Act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States, enacted March 2, 1867, {{USStat|14|428}}, 429</ref>

If rescission by Ohio and New Jersey were illegitimate, South Carolina would have been the 28th state to ratify the amendment, enough for the amendment to be a part of the Constitution. Otherwise, only 26 states ratified the amendment out of needed 28. Ohio and New Jersey's rescissions caused significant controversy and debate, but as this controversy occurred ratification by other states continued:

On July 20, 1868, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] certified that if withdrawals of ratification by New Jersey and Ohio were illegitimate, then the amendment had become part of the Constitution on July 9, 1868, with ratification by South Carolina as the 28th state.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=707|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=740}}</ref> The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to [[Promulgation|promulgate]] it as such, thereby establishing a precedent that a state cannot rescind a ratification.<ref name=Killian>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160723797|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate&pg=PA31|display-authors=etal|year=2004}}</ref> Ultimately, New Jersey and Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the amendment, as well as Alabama was also named, making 29 states total.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=709|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=742}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite book|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|page=710|url=https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=015/llsl015.db&recNum=743}}</ref>

The inclusion of Ohio and New Jersey has led some to question the validity of the rescission of a ratification. The inclusion of Alabama and Georgia has called that conclusion into question. While there have been Supreme Court cases dealing with ratification issues, this particular question has never been adjudicated. On October 16, 1868, three months after the amendment was ratified and part of the Constitution, Oregon rescinded its ratification bringing the number of states to have the amendment actively ratified to 27, but this had no actual impact on the US Constitution or the 14th Amendment's standing.

Since Ohio and New Jersey re-ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 2003, all U.S. states that existed during Reconstruction have ratified the amendment.

===Background===

Section 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] from being abridged or denied by any state or [[state actor]]. Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court held in the ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883)<ref name=CRC/> that the amendment was limited to "state action" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw [[Racism|racial discrimination]] by private individuals or organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution). U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph P. Bradley]] commented in the ''Civil Rights Cases'' that "individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws."<ref>{{cite web|title=''Civil Rights Cases'' (1883)|url=http://www.infoplease.com/us/supreme-court/cases/ar06.html|work=Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Pearson Prentice Hall|publisher=Pearson Education|access-date=October 23, 2013|year=2005}}</ref>

The [[Radical Republicans]] who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people—but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect.<ref>Graber, "Subtraction by Addition?" (2012), p. 1523.</ref> The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=23–24}}<ref name=Foner>[[Eric Foner]], "The Second American Revolution", ''In These Times'', September 1987; reprinted in ''Civil Rights Since 1787'', ed.

Section 1 has been the most frequently litigated part of the amendment,<ref>Harrell, David and Gaustad, Edwin.

According to [[Garrett Epps]], professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore, "Only one group is not 'subject to the jurisdiction' [of the United States] — accredited foreign diplomats and their families, who can be expelled by the federal government but not arrested or tried."<ref name="20181030TheAtlanticEppsCitizenshipClause" /> The U.S. Supreme Court stated in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' (1884) with respect to the purpose of the Citizenship Clause and the words "persons born or naturalized in the United States" and "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in this context:

{{quote|The main object of the opening sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment was to settle the question, upon which there had been a difference of opinion throughout the country and in this Court, as to the citizenship of [[free negro]]es (''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Scott v. Sandford]]'', 19 How. 393), and to put it beyond doubt that all persons, [[White people|white]] or [[Black people|black]], and whether [[Slavery in the United States|formerly slaves]] or not, born or [[Naturalization#United_States|naturalized]] in the United States, and owing no allegiance to any alien power, should be citizens of the United States and of the state in which they reside. ''[[Slaughterhouse Cases]]'', 16 Wall. 36, 83 U. S. 73; ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', 100 U. S. 303, 100 U. S. 306. This section contemplates two sources of citizenship, and two sources only: birth and naturalization. The persons declared to be citizens are "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The evident meaning of these last words is not merely subject in some respect or degree to the jurisdiction of the United States, but completely subject to their political jurisdiction and owing them direct and immediate allegiance. And the words relate to the time of birth in the one case, as they do to the time of naturalization in the other. Persons not thus subject to the jurisdiction of the United States at the time of birth cannot become so afterwards except by being naturalized, either individually, as [[United States nationality law|by proceedings]] under [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|the naturalization acts]], or collectively, as by the force of a treaty by which foreign territory is acquired.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elk v.

There are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, as well as the customs and understandings prevalent at that time.<ref>Messner, Emily.

Historian [[Eric Foner]], who has explored the question of [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|U.S. birthright citizenship]] to other countries, argues that:{{quote|Many things claimed as uniquely American—a devotion to individual freedom, for example, or social opportunity—exist in other countries. But birthright citizenship does make the United States (along with Canada) unique in the developed world. [...] Birthright citizenship is one expression of the commitment to equality and the expansion of national consciousness that marked [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].

Garrett Epps also stresses, like Eric Foner, the equality aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment:{{quote|Its centerpiece is the idea that citizenship in the United States is ''universal''—that we are one nation, with one class of citizens, and that citizenship extends to everyone born here. Citizens have rights that neither the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] nor [[U.S. state|any state]] can revoke at will; even undocumented immigrants—"persons", in the language of the amendment—have rights to due process and equal protection of the law.<ref name="20181030TheAtlanticEppsCitizenshipClause" />}}

====Native Americans====

During the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator [[Jacob M. Howard]] of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause<ref name=Salon>LaFantasie, Glenn (March 20, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/20/lafantasie_civil_war_consensus/index.html The erosion of the Civil War consensus], ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323115737/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/03/20/lafantasie_civil_war_consensus/index.html|date=March 23, 2011 }}</ref>—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who maintain their tribal ties and "persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers".<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893] Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] said in the debate: "Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United States and not subject to some foreign Power—for that, no doubt, is the meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before us—shall be considered as citizens of the United States&nbsp;... If there are to be citizens of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time were subject to the authority of the United States."</ref> According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of [[Western Kentucky University]], "A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause."<ref name=Salon/> Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2897].</ref><ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=070/llcg070.db&recNum=702 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 572].</ref>

Senator [[James Rood Doolittle]] of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction, so that the phrase "Indians not taxed" would be preferable,<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2890,2892–4,2896].</ref> but [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman]] [[Lyman Trumbull]] and Howard disputed this, arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States.<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=14 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893]. Trumbull, during the debate, said, "What do we [the committee reporting the clause] mean by 'subject to the jurisdiction of the United States'? Not owing allegiance to anybody else. That is what it means." He then proceeded to expound upon what he meant by "complete jurisdiction": "Can you sue a Navajoe Indian in court?&nbsp;... We make treaties with them, and therefore they are not subject to our jurisdiction.{{nbsp}}... If we want to control the Navajoes or any other Indians of which the Senator from Wisconsin has spoken, how do we do it? Do we pass a law to control them? Are they subject to our jurisdiction in that sense?&nbsp;... Would he [Senator Doolittle] think of punishing them for instituting among themselves their own tribal regulations? Does the Government of the United States pretend to take jurisdiction of murders and robberies and other crimes committed by one Indian upon another?&nbsp;... It is only those persons who come completely within our jurisdiction, who are subject to our laws, that we think of making citizens."</ref><ref name=howard2>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=16 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2895]. Howard additionally stated the word jurisdiction meant "the same jurisdiction in extent and quality as applies to every citizen of the United States now" and that the U.S. possessed a "full and complete jurisdiction" over the person described in the amendment.</ref> In ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'' (1884),<ref>''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', {{ussc|112|94|1884}}.</ref> the clause's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United States automatically extended national citizenship.

====Children born to foreign nationals====
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become American citizens at birth. The principal framer [[John Armor Bingham]] said during the [[39th United States Congress]] two years before its passing:<ref>9 March 1866 ''Congressional Globe'' 39.1 (1866) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=071/llcg071.db&recNum=332 p. 1291]. (middle column, 2nd paragraph)</ref>
{{quote|I find no fault with the introductory clause, which is simply declaratory of what is written in the Constitution, that every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States '''of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty''' is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural-born citizen; but, sir, I may be allowed to say further that I deny that the Congress of the United States ever had the power, or color of power to say that any man born within the jurisdiction of the United States, '''not owing a foreign allegiance''', is not and shall not be a citizen of the United States.}}

At the time of the amendment's passage, President [[Andrew Johnson]] and three senators, including Trumbull, the author of the Civil Rights Act, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act<ref name=SenatePresidentJohnson>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=14 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 2893]. From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:<p>Mr. Johnson: "...&nbsp;Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State&nbsp;..."</ref><ref name=trumbullcowanexchange>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=070/llcg070.db&recNum=603 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 1, p. 498]. The debate on the Civil Rights Act contained the following exchange:<poem>Mr. Cowan: "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"
Mr. Trumbull: "Undoubtedly."
...
Mr. Trumbull: "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."
Mr. Cowan: "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."
Mr. Trumbull: "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European."</poem></ref> and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship to children born to [[foreign national]]s in the United States.<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=073/llcg073.db&recNum=11 Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, pp. 2891–2892] During the debate on the Amendment, Senator [[John Conness]] of California declared, "The proposition before us, I will say, Mr. President, relates simply in that respect to the children begotten of Chinese parents in California, and it is proposed to declare that they shall be citizens. We have declared that by law [the Civil Rights Act]; now it is proposed to incorporate that same provision in the fundamental instrument of the nation. I am in favor of doing so.

From the debate on the Civil Rights Act:<p>Mr. Cowan: "Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit&nbsp;..."</ref> Some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause should apply to the children of [[Illegal immigration|unauthorized immigrants]] today, as "the problem{{nbsp}}... did not exist at the time".<ref name=Lee>Lee, Margaret.

====Loss of citizenship====

[[Loss of citizenship|Loss of national citizenship]] is possible only under the following circumstances:
* Fraud in the [[naturalization]] process. Technically, this is not a loss of citizenship but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant ''never was'' a citizen of the United States.<ref name="StatePolicies">Current policies are at [https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartL-Chapter2.html].</ref>
* Affiliation with "anti-American" organizations (e.g., the Communist party, other totalitarian party, or terrorist organizations) within five years of naturalization. The State Department views such affiliations as sufficient evidence that an applicant must have lied or concealed evidence in the naturalization process.<ref name="StatePolicies" />
* Other-than-honorable discharge from the U.S. armed forces before five years of honorable service, if honorable service was the basis for the naturalization.<ref name="StatePolicies" />
* Voluntary relinquishment of citizenship. This may be accomplished either through renunciation procedures specially established by the State Department or through other actions that demonstrate desire to give up national citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html |title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality |last=U.S. Department of State |date=February 1, 2008 |access-date=April 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416013437/http://www.travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_778.html |archive-date=April 16, 2009 }}</ref>

For much of the country's history, voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship.<ref>For example, see ''[[Perez v. Brownell]]'', {{ussc|356|44|1958}}, overruled by ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}.</ref> This concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between the United States and other countries (the [[Bancroft Treaties]]). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' (1967),<ref>''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', {{ussc|387|253|1967}}.</ref> as well as ''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'' (1980),<ref>''[[Vance v. Terrazas]]'', {{ussc|444|252|1980}}.</ref> holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship.

===Privileges or Immunities Clause===

{{Main|Privileges or Immunities Clause}}

The Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of Article IV, which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states.<ref name="Slaughter">''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', {{ussc|83|36|1873}}.</ref> In the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873),<ref name="Slaughter" /> the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—"national citizenship" and "state citizenship"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship.<ref name="Slaughter" /><ref name="Beatty">{{cite book|last=Beatty|first=Jack|title=Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America, 1865–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3eG_QoBRzsC&q=%22To%20Miller%20the%20first%20sentence%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%22&pg=PA135|access-date=July 19, 2013|date=April 8, 2008|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1400032426|page=135}}</ref> The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that "owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws".<ref name="Slaughter" /> The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration.<ref name="Slaughter" /><ref name="Beatty" /> This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times.<ref>e.g., ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', {{ussc|529|598|2000}}.</ref> Largely as a result of the narrowness of the ''Slaughter-House'' opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.<ref>Shaman, Jeffrey. ''Constitutional Interpretation: Illusion and Reality'', p. 248 (Greenwood Publishing 2001).</ref>

In ''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'' (1999),<ref>''[[Saenz v. Roe]]'', {{ussc|526|489|1999}}.</ref> the Court ruled that a component of the "[[Freedom of movement|right to travel]]" is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause:

{{quote|Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, most notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' (1873), it has always been common ground that this Clause protects the third component of the right to travel. Writing for the majority in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'', Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges ''conferred by this Clause'' "is that a citizen of the United States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State". (emphasis added)}}

[[Samuel Freeman Miller|Justice Miller]] actually wrote in the ''Slaughter-House Cases'' that the right to become a citizen of a state (by residing in that state) "is conferred by ''the very article'' under consideration" (emphasis added), rather than by the "clause" under consideration.<ref name=Slaughter /><ref>Bogen, David.

In ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]] '' (2010), Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], while concurring with the majority in incorporating the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] against the states, declared that he reached this conclusion through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause.

===Due Process Clause===
==== General aspects ====
{{Main|Due Process Clause}}

Due process deals with the [[administration of justice]] and thus the due process clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law.<ref name="PAMadisonDPC">{{cite web|last=Madison|first=P.A.|title=Historical Analysis of the first of the 14th Amendment's First Section|url=http://www.federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm#due|publisher=The Federalist Blog|access-date=19 January 2013|date=2 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118145152/http://www.federalistblog.us/mt/articles/14th_dummy_guide.htm#due|archive-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Bill of Rights: A Brief History|url=https://www.aclu.org/bill-rights-brief-history|publisher=ACLU|access-date=21 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830084804/https://www.aclu.org/bill-rights-brief-history|archive-date=August 30, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Honda Motor Co. v.

The Due Process Clause has been used to [[Government interest|strike down legislation]]. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and Fourteenth Amendments for example do not prohibit governmental regulation for the public welfare. Instead, they only direct the process by which such regulation occurs. As the Court has held before, such due process "demands only that the law shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, and that the means selected shall have a real and substantial relation to the object sought to be attained."<ref>''[[Nebbia v.

Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the Federal Constitution from invasion by the States."<ref>''[[Whitney v. California]]'', {{ussc|274|357|1927}}</ref> 
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only against the states, but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of [[procedural due process]] and [[substantive due process]].<ref name="constitutional-gov">{{cite book|last=Curry|first=James A.|title=Constitutional Government: The American Experience|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7872-9870-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/constitutionalgo0000curr/page/210 210]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWR3pvfyI1sC&q=two%20Due%20Process%20Clauses%20fifth%20fourteenth%20interpreted%20identically&pg=PA210|author2=Riley, Richard B.|author3=Battiston, Richard M.|access-date=July 14, 2013|chapter=6|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalgo0000curr/page/210}}</ref> Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2009|title=Due process|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Business|publisher=Infobase|last=Gupta|first=Gayatri|editor-last=Folsom|editor-first=W.

==== Specific aspects ====
The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] interprets the clauses broadly, concluding that these clauses provide three protections: [[procedural due process]] (in civil and criminal proceedings); [[substantive due process]]; and as the vehicle for the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]]. These aspects will be discussed in the sections below.

=====Substantive due process=====

{{Main|Substantive due process}}

Beginning with ''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'' (1897),<ref>''[[Allgeyer v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|169|649|1897}}.</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the Due Process Clause as providing [[Substantive due process|substantive]] protection to private contracts, thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation; this principle was referred to as "[[freedom of contract]]".<ref name="Wests">{{Cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law|publisher=Thomson Gale|year=1998|chapter=Due Process of Law – Substantive Due Process|chapter-url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/6312/Due-Process-Law-Substantive-Due-Process.html}}</ref> Thus, the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'' (1905)<ref>''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', {{ussc|198|45|1905}}.</ref> and struck down a minimum wage law in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923).<ref>''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'', {{ussc|261|525|1923}}.</ref> In ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' (1923),<ref>''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', {{ussc|262|390|1923}}.</ref> the Court stated that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause
{{quote|[w]ithout doubt&nbsp;... denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14cfrag8_user.html|title=CRS Annotated Constitution|publisher=Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute|access-date=June 12, 2013|archive-date=November 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110102946/http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt14cfrag8_user.html|url-status=live|df=mdy}}</ref>}}

However, the Court did uphold some economic regulation, such as state [[Prohibition in the United States#Development of the prohibition movement|Prohibition]] laws (''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', 1887),<ref>''[[Mugler v. Kansas]]'', {{ussc|123|623|1887}}.</ref> laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers (''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', 1898),<ref>''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', {{ussc|169|366|1898}}.</ref> laws declaring maximum hours for female workers (''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'', 1908),<ref>''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'', {{ussc|208|412|1908}}.</ref> and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s intervention in a railroad strike (''Wilson v. New'', 1917),<ref>''[[Wilson v. New]]'', {{ussc|243|332|1917}}.</ref> as well as federal laws regulating narcotics (''United States v. Doremus'', 1919).<ref>''[[United States v. Doremus]]'', {{ussc|249|86|1919}}.</ref> The Court repudiated, but did not explicitly overrule, the "freedom of contract" line of cases in ''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'' (1937).<ref>''[[West Coast Hotel v. Parrish]]'', {{ussc|300|379|1937}}.</ref>

The Court has interpreted the term "liberty" in the Due Process Clauses of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and Fourteenth Amendments in ''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'' (1954) broadly:

{{quote|Although the Court has not assumed to define "liberty" with any great precision, that term is not confined to mere freedom from bodily restraint. Liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue, and it cannot be restricted except for a proper governmental objective.<ref name="Bolling">''[[Bolling v. Sharpe]]'', {{ussc|347|497|1954}}, at 499-500.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Huston|first=Luther A.|title=High Court Bans School Segregation; 9-to-0 Decision Grants Time to Comply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/specials/littlerock/051854ds-upset.html|access-date=6 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 May 1954}}</ref>}}

In ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' (1961), dissenting judge [[John Marshall Harlan II]] adopted a broad view of the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause:

{{quote|[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints{{nbsp}}... and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.<ref>''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=642884283459215206&q=planned+parenthood+of+pennsylvania+v.+casey&as_sdt=6,33&as_vis=1#p543 367 U.S. 497 (1961), at 543]</ref>}}

This broad view of liberty was adopted by the Supreme Court in ''Griswold v. Connecticut''<ref>''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey|Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey]]'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6298856056242550994&q=planned+parenthood+of+pennsylvania+v.+casey&as_sdt=6,33&as_vis=1#p849 505 U.S. 833, at 849]</ref> (for further information see below). Although the "freedom of contract" described above has fallen into disfavor, by the 1960s, the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution but that, according to the Court, extend or derive from existing rights.<ref name="Wests"/> For example, the Due Process Clause is also the foundation of a constitutional [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court first ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing [[birth control]].<ref>''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', {{ussc|381|479|1965}}</ref> While Justice [[William O. Douglas]] wrote for the majority that the right to privacy was found in the "penumbras" of various provisions in the Bill of Rights, Justices [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[John Marshall Harlan II]] wrote in concurring opinions that the "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001141.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905041203/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001141.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 5, 2013|title=Griswold v. Connecticut|date=January 1, 2000|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|access-date=June 16, 2013}}</ref>

The [[right to privacy]] was the basis for ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973),<ref>''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', {{ussc|410|113|1973}}.</ref> in which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to save the mother's life. Like Goldberg's and Harlan's concurring opinions in ''Griswold'', the majority opinion authored by Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty. The decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions, and it became one of the most controversial in the Court's history.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002190.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610054110/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425002190.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|title=Roe v.

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003),<ref>''[[Lawrence v.

=====Procedural due process=====

When the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Bradford|title=Procedural Due Process in Plain English|publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89133-573-3}}</ref><ref>See also ''[[Mathews v. Eldridge]]'' (1976).</ref> The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves in cases where the judge has a [[conflict of interest]]. For example, in ''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'' (2009),<ref>''[[Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', {{ussc|556|868|2009}}.</ref> the Court ruled that a justice of the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124447000965394255|title=Justices Set New Standard for Recusals|author1=Jess Bravin|author2=Kris Maher|date=June 8, 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=June 9, 2009}}</ref>

=====Incorporation=====

{{Main|Incorporation of the Bill of Rights}}

While many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. In ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'' (1833),<ref>''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', {{ussc|32|243|1833}}.</ref> the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000188.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329133228/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000188.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-03-29|title=Barron v.

Whether incorporation was intended by the amendment's framers, such as John Bingham, has been debated by legal historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YoI14vYA8r0C&q=%22fourteenth%20amendment%22%20John%20Bingham&pg=PA145|year=2006|title=Bingham, John Armor|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Civil Liberties|publisher=CRC Press|last=Foster|first=James C.|editor-first=Paul|editor-last=Finkelman|pages=145|isbn=9780415943420}}</ref> According to legal scholar [[Akhil Reed Amar]], the framers and early supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the federal government; all these rights were likely understood as falling within the "privileges or immunities" safeguarded by the amendment.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil Reed|year=1992|title=The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=[[Yale Law Journal]]|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1193–1284|doi=10.2307/796923|url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Amar1.html|jstor=796923|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019233856/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Amar1.html|archive-date=October 19, 2008}}</ref>

===Equal Protection Clause===

[[File:BinghamFacingForward.jpg|thumb|Representative [[John Bingham]] of Ohio, principal author of the Equal Protection Clause]]

The Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]].

In ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]'' (1886), the Supreme Court has clarified that the meaning of "person" and "within its jurisdiction" in the Equal Protection Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) [[Alien (law)|legal aliens]] in the United States who are Chinese citizens:<ref name="ReferenceB">''[[Yick Wo v.

{{quote|text=These provisions are universal in their application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to any differences of race, of color, or of nationality, and the equal protection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of equal laws.}}

Persons "within its jurisdiction" are entitled to equal protection from a state. Largely because the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase "within its jurisdiction" in relation to natural persons.<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/> In ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'' (1982), where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are ''within its jurisdiction'' and may thus raise equal protection claims<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/><ref name="Plyler">''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', {{ussc|457|202|1982|pin=210–16}}.</ref> the Court explicated the meaning of the phrase "within its jurisdiction" as follows: "[U]se of the phrase 'within its jurisdiction' confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory."<ref name="Plyler" /> The Court reached this understanding among other things from Senator Howard, a member of the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction|Joint Committee of Fifteen]], and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate. Senator Howard was explicit about the broad objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment and the intention to make its provisions applicable to all who "may happen to be" within the jurisdiction of a state:<ref name="Plyler" />

{{quote|The last two clauses of the first section of the amendment disable a State from depriving not merely a citizen of the United States, but ''any person, whoever he may be'', of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or from denying to him the equal protection of the laws of the State. This abolishes all class legislation in the States and does away with the injustice of subjecting one caste of persons to a code not applicable to another.&nbsp;...

The relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in ''Wong Wing v. United States'' (1896).<ref>''[[Wong Wing v. United States]]'', {{ussc|163|228|1896}}.</ref> He observed with respect to the phrase "within its jurisdiction": "The term 'person', used in the Fifth Amendment, is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic. A resident, alien born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws.&nbsp;... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."<ref>''Wong Wing'', 163 U.S. at 242–243 (Justice Field, concurring in part and dissenting in part).</ref>

The Supreme Court also decided whether foreign corporations are also ''within the jurisdiction'' of a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was ''within the jurisdiction'' and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit.<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/> When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18"/>

In ''[[Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad]]'' (1886), the court reporter included a statement by Chief Justice [[Morrison Waite]] in the decision's headnote:
{{quote|The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations.

In the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from [[juries]] (''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'', 1880)<ref>''[[Strauder v.

The Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in ''[[Berea College v. Kentucky]]'' (1908),<ref>''[[Berea College v.

In ''[[Plyler v.

Kraemer]]'' (1948):<ref>''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', {{ussc|334|1|1948}}.</ref> "[T]he action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful." The court added in ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883):<ref name=CRC /> "It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws."

Vindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those situations where there is "state action" meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power.<ref name="Dunn20090429" /> In ''Ex parte Virginia'' (1880),<ref>''Ex Parte Virginia'', {{ussc|100|339|1880}}.</ref> the Supreme Court found that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment "have reference to actions of the political body denominated by a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken. A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State."<ref name="ReferenceA">''Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co'', {{ussc|419|345|1974}}.</ref>

There are however instances where people are the victims of civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors.<ref name="Dunn20090429" /> In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as [[state actor]]s<ref name="Dunn20090429" /> (i.e., acts done or otherwise "sanctioned in some way" by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18" />

The critical factor in determining the existence of state action is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations, but "the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> "Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance."<ref>''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]'', {{ussc|365|715|1961}}.</ref>

The Supreme Court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party "acted under color of the challenged statute, but also that its actions are properly attributable to the State".<ref name="Flagg">''[[Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks]]'', {{ussc|436|149|1978}}.</ref> "And the actions are to be attributable to the State apparently only if the State compelled the actions and not if the State merely established the process through statute or regulation under which the private party acted."<ref name="FindLaw201311234Annotation18" />

The rules developed by the Supreme Court for business regulation are that (1) the "mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment",{{refn| group = lower-alpha |''[[Jackson v.

==Apportionment of representation in House of Representatives==

Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Apportionment of Representatives and taxes|Article I, Section 2, Clause 3]], the basis of representation of each state in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was [[Apportionment (politics)|determined]] by adding [[Three-fifths compromise|three-fifths]] of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name="bonfield"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name="bonfield">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>

Two solutions were considered:
* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)
* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote

On January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used "race or color" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name="bonfield"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.

The effect of Section 2 was twofold:
* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section{{nbsp}}2 "abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]".
* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name="bonfield"/>

===Enforcement===

The first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name="bonfield"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title="An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6. February 2, 1872}}</ref>}} A nearly identical provision remains in federal law to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/6?qt-us_code_temp_noupdates=0#qt-us_code_temp_noupdates|title=2 U.S. Code § 6 – Reduction of representation|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>

Despite this legislation, in subsequent reapportionments, no change has ever been made to any state's Congressional representation on the basis of the Amendment.<ref name="bonfield"/> Bonfield, writing in 1960, suggested that "[t]he hot political nature of such proposals has doomed them to failure".<ref name="bonfield"/> Aided by this lack of enforcement, [[Southern United States|southern states]] continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting until the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3444700477.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223753/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3444700477.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2014|title=Fourteenth Amendment|author=Friedman, Walter|date=January 1, 2006|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|access-date=June 12, 2013}}</ref>

In the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]] case of ''Saunders v Wilkins'' (1945),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://casetext.com/case/saunders-v-wilkins|title=Casetext|website=casetext.com}}</ref> Saunders claimed that Virginia should have its Congressional representation reduced because of its use of a [[poll tax]] and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued for the right to run for Congress at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a [[political question]].<ref name="bonfield"/>

===Influence on voting rights===

Some have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chin|first=Gabriel J.|year=2004|title=Reconstruction, Felon Disenfranchisement, and the Right to Vote: Did the Fifteenth Amendment Repeal Section 2 of the Fourteenth?|journal=[[Georgetown Law Journal]]|volume=92|page=259}}</ref> but the Supreme Court acknowledged Section{{nbsp}}2 in later decisions.

In ''[[Minor v. Happersett]]'' (1875), the Supreme Court cited Section{{nbsp}}2 as supporting its conclusion that the right to vote was not among the "privileges and immunities of citizenship" protected by Section 1.<ref>{{quote|Why this if it was not in the power of the legislature to deny the right of suffrage to some male inhabitants? And if suffrage was necessarily one of the absolute rights of citizenship, why confine the operation of the limitation to male inhabitants? Women and children are, as we have seen, "persons". They are counted in the enumeration upon which the apportionment is to be made, but if they were necessarily voters because of their citizenship unless clearly excluded, why inflict the penalty for the exclusion of males alone? Clearly, no such form of words would have been elected to express the idea here indicated if suffrage was the absolute right of all citizens.}}</ref> Women would not achieve equal voting rights throughout the United States until the adoption of [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1920.

In ''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'' (1974), the Court cited Section{{nbsp}}2 as justifying the states [[Felony disenfranchisement|disenfranchising felons]].<ref>''[[Richardson v. Ramirez]]'', {{ussc|418|24|1974}}.</ref>

In ''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'' (1985), a case involving disenfranchising black [[Misdemeanor|misdemeanants]], the Supreme Court concluded that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] cannot save legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment. More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the "other crime" provision of Section 2. The Court held that Section{{nbsp}}2 "was not designed to permit the purposeful racial discrimination [...] which otherwise violates [Section]{{nbsp}}1 of the Fourteenth Amendment."<ref>''[[Hunter v. Underwood]]'', {{ussc|471|222|1985}}.</ref>

===Criticism===

Abolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}}

Section 2 protects the right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only provision of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex.<ref name=Foner/> Section{{nbsp}}2 was condemned by [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffragists]], such as [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and [[Susan B. Anthony]], who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=255–256}}

==Participants in rebellion==

Section 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or [[Treason in the United States|treason]]. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In 1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's limitation.<ref>Act of June 6, 1898, [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/55th-congress/session-2/c55s2ch389.pdf ch. 389, 30 Stat. 432]</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment14/37.html|title=Sections 3 and 4: Disqualification and Public Debt|publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|date=June 5, 1933| access-date=August 1, 2010}}</ref> In 1975, the citizenship of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E.

Section 3 was used to prevent [[Socialist Party of America]] member [[Victor L.

==Validity of public debt==

Section 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all [[National debt of the United States|public debt]] appropriated by the Congress. It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by the Confederacy. For example, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] several British and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to support its war against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Annotation 37 – Fourteenth Amendment Sections 3 and 4 Disqualification and Public Debt|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation37.html#1|publisher=FindLaw|access-date=October 17, 2013}}</ref> In [[Gold Clause Cases|''Perry v.
