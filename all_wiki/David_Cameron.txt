'''David William Donald Cameron''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR}} (born 9 October 1966) is a British politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 2010 to 2016. He was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2016 Witney by-election|2016]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader of the Conservative Party]] from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]], and has been associated with both [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] policies.

<!--Early life and early political career-->
Born in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at [[Heatherdown School]], [[Eton College]], and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the [[Conservative Research Department]], latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]], before leaving politics to work for [[Carlton Communications]] in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|opposition shadow cabinet]] under Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]], and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|negotiations]] led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] – [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by age|the youngest holder of the office]] since the 1810s.<ref name="Telegraph11May2009YoungestPM"/> His [[Premiership of David Cameron|premiership]] was marked by the ongoing effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|late-2000s financial crisis]]; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through [[austerity]] measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes to [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare]], [[United Kingdom immigration law|immigration policy]], [[Education in England|education]], and [[Healthcare in England|healthcare]],<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-sticks-to-his-guns-on-immigration-reduction-pledge-even-while-numbers-rise-9420749.html |title=David Cameron sticks to his guns on immigration reduction pledge even while numbers rise |last=Morris |first=Nigel |newspaper=The Independent |location= London |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> and oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]]. It privatised the [[Royal Mail]] and some other state assets, and legalised [[Same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom|same-sex marriage in England and Wales]].

<!--Later Premiership-->
Internationally, his government [[Operation Ellamy|intervened militarily]] in the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]] and later authorised the bombing of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]; domestically, his government oversaw the [[2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum|referendum on voting reform]] and [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]], both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] he remained as Prime Minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU]]. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote,<ref name=bbc36615028>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36615028 |title=EU referendum: UK votes to leave in historic referendum |accessdate=24 June 2016 |work=BBC News |date=24 June 2016}}</ref> he resigned to [[2016 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|make way for a new Prime Minister]] and was succeeded by [[Theresa May]].<ref name=bbc36615028/><ref name="The Guardian 2016-06-24">{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |last2=Mason |first2=Rowena |last3=Syal |first3=Rajeev |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/david-cameron-resigns-after-uk-votes-to-leave-european-union |title=David Cameron resigns after UK votes to leave European Union |work=The Guardian |location= London|date=24 June 2016 |quote=PM announces resignation following victory for leave supporters after divisive referendum campaign}}</ref> Cameron is currently the President of [[Alzheimer's Research UK]] since 2017.

<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->
Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for decreasing the United Kingdom's national deficit. However, he has been the target of criticism surrounding his decision to hold the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU which led to a period of political instability in the UK during the late [[2010s in United Kingdom political history|2010s]].<ref name="ns12sep">{{cite news |last1=Skidelsky |first1=Robert |title=Cameron's great fault was mental idleness and today's crisis is a direct consequence of his carelessness |url= https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/09/cameron-s-great-fault-was-mental-idleness-and-today-s-crisis-direct-consequence |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=New Statesman |location= London |date=12 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kershaw |first1=Ian |last2=Seldon |first2=Anthony |last3=Todd |first3=Selina |last4=Adi |first4=Hakim |last5=Gardiner |first5=Juliet |last6=Bogdanor |first6=Vernon |title=David Cameron's legacy: the historians' verdict |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/david-camerons-legacy-the-historians-verdict |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The Guardian  |location= London |date=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Norman |first1=Matthew |title= What made Cameron the worst Prime Minister in living history |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/david-cameron-step-down-mp-worst-prime-minister-in-living-history-legacy-theresa-may-tony-blair-a7248326.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The Independent |location= London |date=13 September 2016}}</ref> He has also been criticised by figures on both the [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]], and has been accused of [[elitism]] and political opportunism.

===Early political career===

====Conservative Research Department====
After graduation, Cameron worked for the [[Conservative Research Department]] between September 1988 and 1993. His first brief was Trade and Industry, Energy and Privatisation; he befriended fellow young colleagues, including [[Edward Llewellyn (Conservative adviser)|Edward Llewellyn]], [[Ed Vaizey]] and [[Rachel Whetstone]]. They and others formed a group they called the "[[Smith Square]] set", which was dubbed the "Brat Pack" by the press, though it is better known as the "[[Notting Hill set]]", a name given to it pejoratively by [[Derek Conway]].{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=9}} In 1991, Cameron was seconded to [[Downing Street]] to work on briefing [[John Major]] for the then twice-weekly sessions of [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper&nbsp;... [[Despatch box]] performances" by Major,<ref name="Major PMQs">"Atticus", ''The Sunday Times'', 30 June 1991</ref> which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of [[doublespeak]]" by [[Tony Blair]] (then the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national [[minimum wage]].<ref name="Blair minimum wage">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1991-06-27/Orals-2.html "House of Commons 6th series, vol. 193, cols. 1133–34"], ''Hansard''. Retrieved 4 September 2007.</ref> He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow [[Judith Chaplin]] as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.<ref name="CRD">"Diary", ''The Times'', 14 August 1991.</ref>

However, Cameron lost to [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Jonathan Hill]], who was appointed in March 1992. Instead, Cameron was given the responsibility for briefing Major for his press conferences during the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]].<ref name="1992 election">Wood, Nicholas (13 March 1992).

''The Times''. 30 March 1992.</ref>

====Special Adviser to the Chancellor====
The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues, saying "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right", and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across [[Smith Square]] to jeer at [[Transport House]], the former Labour headquarters.<ref name="1992 post mortem">Pierce, Andrew (11 March 1992). "We got it right, say Patten's brat pack". ''The Sunday Times'' (London).</ref> Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to [[Special advisers (UK government)|Special Adviser]] to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Norman Lamont]].<ref name="Lamont's Spad">"Brats on the move". ''The Times'' (London). 14 April 1992.</ref>

Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of [[Black Wednesday]], when pressure from currency speculators forced the [[pound sterling]] out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference, Cameron had difficulty trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, [[Patricia Morris, Baroness Morris of Bolton|Patricia Morris]], to contact him.<ref name="1992 conference">"Diary", ''The Times'', 8 October 1992.</ref> Later that month, Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]]; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]]'s contribution to the economic crisis.<ref name="Germany visit">"Peace-mongers". ''The Times'' (London). 20 October 1992.</ref>

Lamont fell out with [[John Major]] after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 Budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]] for their political acceptability to be assessed.<ref name="1993 budget">Hencke, David (8 February 1993). "Treasury tax review eyes fuel and children's clothes". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> By May 1993, the Conservatives' average poll rating dropped below 30%, where they would remain until the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}} Major and Lamont's personal ratings also declined dramatically. However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron, who was considered as a potential "[[kamikaze]]" candidate for the [[1993 Newbury by-election|Newbury by-election]], which includes the area where he grew up.<ref name="Newbury">White, Michael; Wintour, Patrick (26 February 1993). "Points of Order". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> However, he decided not to stand.

During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "[[Non, je ne regrette rien|Je ne regrette rien]]" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitting to "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this gaffe; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself, even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been.<ref name="Piaf">"Careless talk". ''The Times'' (London). 10 May 1993.</ref> Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.<ref name="Lamont sacked">Smith, David; Prescott, Michael (30 May 1993). "Norman Lamont: the final days" (Focus). ''The Sunday Times'' (London).</ref>

====Special Adviser to the Home Secretary====
[[File:HomeOffice QueenAnnesGate.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[102 Petty France|Home Office building]] where Cameron worked during the 1990s]]
After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] for less than a month before being specifically recruited by [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]]. It was commented that he was still "very much in favour"<ref name="Howard's Spad">"No score flaw". ''The Times'' (London). 22 June 1993.</ref> and it was later reported that many at the Treasury would have preferred Cameron to carry on.<ref name="Clarke profile">Grigg, John (2 October 1993). "Primed Minister". ''The Times'' (London).</ref> At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of [[prospective parliamentary candidate]]s (PPCs).<ref name="Candidates list">"Newbury's finest". ''The Times'' (London). 6 September 1993.</ref>

Cameron was much more socially liberal than Howard but enjoyed working for him.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}} According to [[Derek Lewis (prison governor)|Derek Lewis]], then Director-General of [[Her Majesty's Prison Service]], Cameron showed him a "his and her list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, [[Sandra Howard|Sandra]]. Lewis said that Sandra Howard's list included reducing the quality of [[prison food]], although she denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.<ref name="Prison food">Leigh, David (23 February 1997). "Mrs Howard's own recipe for prison reform". ''The Observer'' (London).</ref> In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, Bruce (1 March 1997). "Derek Lewis: Big job, little man, inaccurate book". ''The Spectator'' (London).</ref>

During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the media. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]. After an inquiry failed to find the source of the leak, Labour MP [[Peter Mandelson]] demanded assurance from Howard that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.<ref name="Leak">Wintour, Patrick (10 March 1994).

====Carlton====
In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at [[Carlton Communications]].<ref name="Carlton job">"Smallweed". ''The Guardian'' (London). 16 July 1994.</ref> Carlton, which had won the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise for London weekdays in 1991, was a growing media company which also had film-distribution and video-producing arms. Cameron was suggested for the role to Carlton executive chairman [[Michael P. Green]] by his later mother-in-law Lady Astor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=James |last2=Teather |first2=David |title=Cameron&nbsp;– the PR years |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London

In 1997, Cameron played up the company's prospects for [[digital terrestrial television]], for which it joined with [[ITV Granada]] and [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]] to form [[ITV Digital|British Digital Broadcasting]]. In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.<ref name="Regulatory overlap">"We can't wait any longer to map the digital mediascape". ''[[New Statesman]]'' (London). 3 April 1998.</ref> Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to run for Parliament for a second time, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.

====Parliamentary candidacies====
[[File:Stafford town centre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]], the constituency Cameron contested in 1997]]
Having been approved for the PPCs' list, Cameron began looking for a seat to contest for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. He was reported to have missed out on selection for [[Ashford (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashford]] in December 1994, after failing to get to the selection meeting as a result of train delays.<ref name="Ashford">"Pendennis". ''The Observer'' (London). 1 January 1995.</ref> In January 1996, when two shortlisted contenders dropped out, Cameron was interviewed and subsequently selected for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]], a constituency revised in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=24}}<ref name="Stafford candidate">{{cite news |author-link=Michael White (journalist) |last=White |first=Michael |title=Seat-seeking missiles |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 March 1996}}</ref> The incumbent Conservative MP, [[Bill Cash]], ran instead in the neighbouring constituency of [[Stone (UK Parliament constituency)|Stone]], where he was re-elected. At the 1996 Conservative Party Conference, Cameron called for [[tax cut]]s in the forthcoming Budget to be targeted at the low-paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".<ref name="Conference 1996">Sherman, Jill (11 October 1996). "Clarke challenged to show gains of economic recovery". ''The Times'' (London).</ref> He also said the Party "should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements&nbsp;... It's time to return to our tax-cutting agenda. The socialist Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed [[Tony Blair]] because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion."<ref>[https://archive.is/20120717210551/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/ANCC839F_E "Conservative Party Conference 1996"]. BBC Archive. 10 October 1996</ref>

When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the [[Euro|single European currency]] clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.<ref name="Single currency 1997">Travis, Alan (17 April 1997). "Rebels' seven-year march". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> Otherwise, Cameron kept closely to the national [[Party line (politics)|party line]]. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however, the Labour candidate, [[David Kidney]], portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Initially Cameron thought he had a 50/50 chance, but as the campaign wore on and the scale of the impending Conservative defeat grew, Cameron prepared himself for defeat.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=3}} On election day, Stafford had a [[swing (politics)|swing]] of 10.7%, almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: Kidney defeated Cameron by 24,606 votes (47.5%) to 20,292 (39.2%), a majority of 4,314 (8.3%).<ref name="1997 election">Elliott and Hanning (2007), pp.&nbsp;172–5.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/constituencies/533.htm |title=Stafford 1997 election result |publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970429084317/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/constituencies/533.htm |archive-date=29 April 1997 |year=1997}}</ref>

In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried for the [[1999 Kensington and Chelsea by-election|Kensington and Chelsea]] seat after the death of [[Alan Clark]], but did not make the shortlist. He was in the final two but narrowly lost at [[Wealden (UK Parliament constituency)|Wealden]] in March 2000,<ref name="Wealden">White, Michael (14 March 2000). "Rightwingers and locals preferred for safe Tory seats". ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.<ref name="Spontaneity">Elliott and Hanning (2007), p. 193.</ref>

On 4 April 2000, Cameron was selected as PPC for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. This had been a safe Conservative seat, but its sitting MP [[Shaun Woodward]] (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had "crossed the floor" to join the Labour Party and was selected instead for the safe Labour seat of [[St Helens South (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South]]. Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe the two men as being "on fairly friendly terms".<ref name=autogenerated1>Elliott and Hanning (2007), p. 192.</ref> Cameron, advised in his strategy by friend [[Catherine Fall, Baroness Fall|Catherine Fall]], put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his potential constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacking Woodward for changing his mind on [[fox hunting]] to support a ban.<ref name="Woodward hunting">"Why Shaun Woodward changed his mind" (Letter). ''The Daily Telegraph''. 21 December 2000.</ref>

During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s online section.<ref name="Guardian column">[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/davidcamerondiaries "The Cameron diaries"] (archive). ''The Guardian'' (London).</ref> He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives, taking 22,153 votes (45%) to Labour candidate Michael Bartlet's 14,180 (28.8%), a majority of 7,973 (16.2%).<ref name="2001 election result">''Dod's Guide to the General Election June 2001''.

==In office==
===Member of Parliament, 2001–05===
Upon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons [[Home Affairs Select Committee]], a prominent appointment for a newly elected MP. Cameron proposed that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,<ref name="Drugs inquiry">Elliott, Francis; Hanning, James (2007). ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative''.

Cameron endorsed [[Iain Duncan Smith]] in the [[2001 Conservative Party leadership election]] and organised an event in Witney for party supporters to hear [[John Bercow]] speaking for him.<ref>{{Cite book|title=For the Record|last=Cameron|first=David|publisher=William Collins|year=2019|isbn=978-0-008-23928-2|location=United Kingdom|pages=57}}</ref> Two days before Duncan Smith won the leadership contest on 13 September 2001, the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] took place in [[New York City]]. Cameron described [[Tony Blair]]'s response to the attacks as "masterful", saying "He moved fast, and set the agenda both at home and abroad. He correctly identified the problem of [[Islamic extremism|Islamist extremism]], the inadequacy of our response both domestically and internationally, and supported – quite rightly in my view – the action to [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan]]."<ref>{{Cite book|title=For the Record|last=Cameron|first=David|publisher=William Collins|year=2019|isbn=978-0-008-23928-2|location=United Kingdom|pages=58}}</ref>

Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public visibility, offering quotations on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to Gurbux Singh, who had resigned as head of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] after a confrontation with the police;<ref name="Gurbux Singh">Johnston, Philip; Barrow, Becky (8 August 2002).

''The Observer'' (London). 30 June 2002.</ref> However, he was passed over for a front-bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith did invite Cameron and his ally [[George Osborne]] to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002.

''The Times'' (London). 6 November 2002.</ref> The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Duncan Smith leadership.

In June 2003, Cameron was appointed a [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|shadow minister]] in the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] as a deputy to [[Eric Forth]], then [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons|Shadow Leader of the House]]. He also became a vice-[[chairman of the Conservative Party]] when [[Michael Howard]] took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed Opposition frontbench [[local government]] spokesman in 2004, before being promoted to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] that June as head of policy co-ordination.

===Shadow Cabinet appointments===
{{Main|Shadow Cabinet of David Cameron}} 
[[File:DavidCameronHomeOffice.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cameron speaking at the Home Office, on 13 May 2010]]
His [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] appointments included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader [[William Hague]] was appointed to the Foreign Affairs brief, while both [[George Osborne]] and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] were retained, as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[Shadow Home Secretary]] respectively.

[[File:David Cameron's visit2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|David Cameron with the future Prime Minister [[Theresa May]], who was a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]] from 1999 until 2010]]
A [[Cabinet reshuffle|reshuffle]] of the Shadow Cabinet was undertaken in January 2009. The chief change was the appointment of former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Kenneth Clarke]] as Shadow Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary, David Cameron stating that "With Ken Clarke's arrival, we now have the best economic team."

====European Conservatives and Reformists====
During his successful 2005 campaign to be elected Leader of the Conservative Party, Cameron pledged that the Conservative Party's [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] would leave the [[European People's Party]] group, which had a "federalist" approach to the European Union.<ref name="Cameron EPP pledge">White, Michael; Branigan, Tania (18 October 2005).

In forming the caucus, which had 54 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] drawn from eight of the 27 [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], Cameron reportedly broke with two decades of Conservative co-operation with the centre-right Christian Democrats, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP),<ref name="guardian_03062009">{{cite news |last=Traynor |first=Ian |title=Anti-gay, climate change deniers: meet David Cameron's new friends |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 June 2009 |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/02/david-cameron-alliance-polish-nationalists |accessdate=2 June 2009}}</ref> on the grounds that they are dominated by European [[federalism|federalists]] and supporters of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon treaty]].<ref name="guardian_03062009" /> EPP leader [[Wilfried Martens]], former [[Prime Minister of Belgium]], has stated "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe.&nbsp;...

====Shortlists for Parliamentary candidates====
Similarly, Cameron's initial "[[A-List (Conservative)|A-List]]" of prospective parliamentary candidates was attacked by members of his party,<ref name=BBC_13_10_06>{{cite news |title=Don't ditch Tory values, MP warns |publisher=BBC News |date=13 October 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6046668.stm |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref> and the policy was discontinued in favour of sex-balanced final shortlists. Before being discontinued, the policy had been criticised by senior Conservative MP and former Prisons Spokeswoman [[Ann Widdecombe]] as an "insult to women", and she had accused Cameron of "storing up huge problems for the future."<ref name="Widdecombe">McSmith, Andy (22 August 2006).

====South Africa====
In April 2009, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that in 1989, while [[Nelson Mandela]] remained imprisoned under the [[apartheid]] regime, David Cameron had accepted a trip to South Africa paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm. A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at Conservative Research Department called the trip "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The [[P. W. Botha|Botha]] regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." Cameron distanced himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime. He was criticised by Labour MP [[Peter Hain]], himself an anti-apartheid campaigner.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-camerons-freebie-to-apartheid-south-africa-1674367.html |title=Cameron's freebie to apartheid South Africa |date=26 April 2009|last= Merrick|first= Jane |last2= Hanning|first2= James |work=The Independent on Sunday |location=London}}</ref>

====Raising teaching standards====
At the launch of the Conservative Party's education [[manifesto]] in January 2010, Cameron declared an admiration for the "brazenly elite" approach to education of countries such as [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]] and expressed a desire to "elevate the status of teaching in our country".<ref name=Telegraph_18_01_10>{{Cite news |last= Kirkup |first= James |title= David Cameron pledges 'brazen elitism' in teaching |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |date=7 February 2010 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/david-cameron/7014885/David-Cameron-pledges-brazen-elitism-in-teaching.html |accessdate =15 February 2010 |location=London }}</ref> He suggested the adoption of more stringent criteria for entry to teaching and offered repayment of the loans of maths and science graduates obtaining first or 2.1 degrees from "good" universities.<ref name=Independent_18_01_10>{{Cite news |last= Garner |first= Richard |title= 'Only for elite' fear over Tory teaching deal |newspaper= The Independent |date = 18 January 2010 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/only-for-elite-fear-over-tory-student-loans-deal-1871847.html |accessdate =15 February 2010 |location=London }}</ref>

[[Wes Streeting]], then president of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], said "The message that the Conservatives are sending to the majority of students is that if you didn't go to a university attended by members of the Shadow Cabinet, they don't believe you're worth as much."<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://www.nus.org.uk/cy/news/nus-comments-on-david-camerons-proposals-to-create-good-university-shortlist/ |publisher= [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=6 June 2014 | title=NUS comments on David Cameron's proposals to create 'Good University' shortlist}}</ref>

====Expenses====
During the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MPs expenses scandal]] in 2009, Cameron said he would lead Conservatives in repaying "excessive" expenses and threatened to expel MPs that refused after the expense claims of several members of his shadow cabinet had been questioned:<blockquote>We have to acknowledge just how bad this is, the public are really angry and we have to start by saying, "Look, this system that we have, that we used, that we operated, that we took part in—it was wrong and we are sorry about that".<ref>{{cite news |title= 'Appalled' Cameron leads payback |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8044998.stm |accessdate=3 May 2015 |publisher=BBC News |date=12 May 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

The Conservatives had last [[1992 United Kingdom general election|won a general election in 1992]]. The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in the Conservatives, led by Cameron, winning the largest number of seats (306). This was, however, 20 seats short of an overall majority and resulted in the nation's first [[hung parliament]] since [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results|title=BBC News&nbsp;– Election 2010&nbsp;– Results&nbsp;– United Kingdom&nbsp;– National Results|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Talks between Cameron and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Nick Clegg]] led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition.

In 2015 through 2016 the [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] conducted an extensive and highly critical inquiry into the British involvement in the civil war. It concluded that the early threat to civilians had been overstated and that the significant Islamist element in the rebel forces had not been recognised, due to an intelligence failure. By mid-2011 the initial limited intervention to protect Libyan civilians had become a policy of [[regime change]]. However that new policy did not include proper support and for a new government, leading to a political and economic collapse in Libya and the growth of [[ISIL]] in North Africa. It concluded that Cameron was ultimately responsible for this British policy failure.<ref name=bbc-20160914>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37356873 |title=MPs attack Cameron over Libya 'collapse' |publisher=BBC News |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20160914>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/mps-deliver-damning-verdict-on-camerons-libya-intervention |title=MPs deliver damning verdict on Cameron's Libya intervention |first=Patrick |last=Wintour |newspaper=The Guardian |location= London |date=14 September 2016 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=hoc-libya>{{cite report |url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf |title=Libya: Examination of intervention and collapse and the UK's future policy options |publisher= Foreign Affairs Committee (House of Commons) |date=6 September 2016 |id=HC 119 |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>

The referendum came to be known as [[Brexit]] (a [[portmanteau]] of "British" and "exit") and was held on 23 June 2016.

In his first Conservative conference speech as party leader in [[Bournemouth]] in 2006, he described the [[National Health Service]] as "one of the 20th Century's greatest achievements". He went on to say, "[[Tony Blair]] explained his priorities in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters: N.H.S." He also talked about his severely disabled son, Ivan, concluding "So, for me, it is not just a question of saying the NHS is safe in my hands—of course it will be.

Cameron said that he believed in "spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention" in cases such as the [[genocide]] in [[Darfur]], [[Sudan]].

In 2009 Cameron said "the restoration of family values and a new commitment to economic and social responsibility" were "key to repairing 'broken Britain'".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/5070968/David-Cameron-family-values-the-key-to-responsible-society.html |title=David Cameron: family values the key to responsible society|first=Rosa |last=Prince |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=19 September 2020}}</ref> In 2013 Cameron described himself as "a marriage man, I am a great supporter of marriage. I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage."

Cameron criticised [[Gordon Brown]] (when Brown was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) for being "an analogue politician in a digital age" and referred to him as "the roadblock to reform".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4833440.stm |title=Cameron attacks 'past it' Brown |publisher=BBC News |date=22 March 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2006}}</ref> As Prime Minister, he reacted to press reports that Brown could be the next head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] by hinting that he may block the appointment, citing the huge national debt that Brown left the country with as a reason for Brown not being suitable for the role.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13127225 |publisher=BBC News |title=Cameron hints at blocking Brown bid for IMF job |date=19 April 2011}}</ref>

===Foreign affairs===
====Iraq War====
In an interview on ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' in 2006, Cameron said that he supported the decision of the then Labour Government to go to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]], and said that he thought supporters should "see it through".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5108584.stm |title=Cameron backs Blair on Iraq war |publisher=BBC News |date=23 June 2006 |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> He also supported a motion brought by the SNP and Plaid Cymru in 2006 calling for an inquiry into the government's conduct of the Iraq war. In 2011, he oversaw the withdrawal of British soldiers from Iraq. He repeatedly called for the [[Chilcot Inquiry]] into the Iraq war to conclude and publish its findings, saying "People want to know the truth".<ref>{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewan|title=David Cameron pushes Chilcot for Iraq report: 'We want this inquiry finished'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/21/david-cameron-pushes-chilcot-iraq-report-we-want-this-inquiry-finished|accessdate=27 September 2015|work=The Guardian|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>

====India====
Cameron was a strong advocate of increased ties between India and the United Kingdom, describing Indian–British relations as the "New [[Special Relationship]]" in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title= Does India want a 'special relationship' with UK? |first= Chris |last= Morris |author-link= Chris Morris (journalist) |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2010 |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-10782552}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Ministers to build a new 'special relationship' with India |first= Dean |last= Nelson |newspaper= The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=7 July 2010 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/7877719/Ministers-to-build-a-new-special-relationship-with-India.html}}</ref>

====Allegations of social elitism====
[[File:Conservative Party Reception.jpg|right|thumb|Cameron speaking at a Conservative reception in 2008]]
While [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]], Cameron was accused of reliance on "old-boy networks",<ref name=Guardian_12_08_06>{{Cite news |last= Taylor |first= Matthew |title= Under the Green Oak, an old elite takes root in Tories |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 August 2006 |url =https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/12/uk.conservatives |accessdate=15 February 2010 |location=London}}</ref> and conversely attacked by his party for the imposition of selective shortlists of women and ethnic minority [[prospective parliamentary candidate]]s.<ref name="BBC_13_10_06"/>

Some of Cameron's senior appointments, such as [[George Osborne]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], are former members of the [[Bullingdon Club]]. [[Michael Gove]] conceded it was "ridiculous" how many fellow Cabinet ministers were old Etonians, though he placed the blame on the failings of the state education system rather than Cameron.<ref>{{cite news |title=How far will Michael Gove go? |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/ebe8018c-aa45-11e3-8497-00144feab7de.html |accessdate=5 March 2016 |work=Financial Times |date=14 March 2014}}</ref> However, Michael Mosbacher, co-founder of ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'' magazine, wrote that Cameron's Cabinet has the lowest number of Etonians of any past Conservative government: "David Cameron's government is the least patrician, least wealthy and least public-school-educated—indeed the least Etonian Conservative-led government this country has ever seen".<ref>Mosbacher, Michael (June 2013).

====Plots against leadership====
Following poor results in the [[2012 United Kingdom local elections|May 2012 local elections]] after a difficult few months for the government, with Labour increasing its lead in the polls, there were concerns from Conservative MPs about Cameron's leadership and his electability. [[David Davies (Welsh politician)|David Davies]], the chairman of the [[Welsh Affairs Select Committee]], accused the Conservative leadership of "incompetence" and hinted that it could risk Cameron's leadership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mp-tells-david-cameron-frustration-2030582 |title=MP tells David Cameron of his frustration at 'incompetence at government's highest levels' |date=10 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617101743/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mp-tells-david-cameron-frustration-2030582 |archive-date=17 June 2016 }}</ref> [[Nadine Dorries]] warned the Prime Minister that a leadership challenge could happen.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Press Association |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/06/nadine-dorries-david-cameron-leadership |title=Nadine Dorries tells David Cameron to change policies or lose Tory leadership |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=6 May 2012 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>

Later that year, Conservative MP [[Brian Binley]] openly said that Cameron's leadership was like being a "maid" to the Liberal Democrats, and accused him of leading the party to defeat. In January 2013 it was revealed that [[Adam Afriyie]] was planning his own bid for the Conservative leadership with the support of fellow MPs [[Mark Field]], [[Bill Wiggin]], [[Chris Heaton-Harris]], [[Patrick Mercer]], [[Jonathan Djanogly]] and [[Dan Byles]]. ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[ConservativeHome]]'' revealed that a 'rebel reserve' of 55 Conservative MPs gave firm pledges to a co-ordinating MP to support a motion of 'no confidence' and write to Brady simultaneously, more than the 46 MPs needed to trigger a vote of no confidence.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2013/01/rebel-reserve-of-55-conservative-mps-is-being-gathered-for-cameron-leadership-challenge.html |title='Rebel reserve' of 55 Conservative MPs 'is being gathered for Cameron leadership challenge' |publisher=Conservative Home |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> [[Andrew Bridgen]] openly called for a vote of confidence in Cameron's leadership and claimed that the Prime Minister had a "credibility problem" but he dropped his bid for a contest a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26923973|title=Tory MP Andrew Bridgen drops bid to oust Cameron|publisher=BBC News|date=7 April 2014|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>

====Cameron and Andy Coulson====
In 2007 Cameron appointed [[Andy Coulson]], former editor of the ''[[News of the World]]'', as his director of communications.

The judge hearing Coulson's trial was critical of the prime minister, pondering whether the intervention was out of ignorance or deliberate, and demanded an explanation.<ref name="CameronCoulson">{{cite news |title= David Cameron has explaining to do over apology for hiring Andy Coulson |url= http://www.thelondonnews.net/index.php/sid/223255805/scat/c08dd24cec417021/ht/David-Cameron-has-explaining-to-do-over-apology-for-hiring-Andy-Coulson |archive-url= https://archive.today/20140627234131/http://www.thelondonnews.net/index.php/sid/223255805/scat/c08dd24cec417021/ht/David-Cameron-has-explaining-to-do-over-apology-for-hiring-Andy-Coulson |url-status=dead |archive-date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate=27 June 2014 |work=The London News.Net}}</ref>

====Cameron and Lord Ashcroft====
Although [[Michael Ashcroft|Lord Ashcroft]] played a significant role in the 2010 election, he was not offered a ministerial post.<ref name=stopping/> In June 2012, shortly before a major Conservative rebellion on [[Reform of the House of Lords|House of Lords reform]],<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18786890 |title= Lords reform: Coalition suffers biggest rebellion |date=11 July 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> journalist [[Peter Oborne]] credited Ashcroft with "stopping the Coalition working" by moving policy on Europe, welfare, education, taxation to the right.<ref name=stopping>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9359539/Lord-Ashcrofts-Tory-Right-is-stopping-the-Coalition-working.html |title=Lord Ashcroft's Tory Right is stopping the Coalition working |last= Oborne|first= Peter |work= The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> According to Oborne, Ashcroft, owner of both the [[ConservativeHome]] and PoliticsHome websites and a "brutal critic of the Coalition from the start", had established "megaphone presence" in the on-line media. He believes Cameron's philosophy of liberal conservatism has been destroyed by "coordinated attacks on the Coalition" and "the two parties are no longer trying to pretend that they are governing together."<ref name=stopping/>

In ''The Observer'', [[Andrew Rawnsley]] commented that he believes that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to "generate publicity", "stir trouble for the prime minister" and influence the direction of the party.<ref name=andy>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/05/lord-ashcroft-poll-dowses-tories-optimism |title= Lord Ashcroft's big bucket of cold water to douse Tory optimism |last=Rawnsley|first= Andrew |work=The Observer |location=London |date=5 January 2014 |accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> In 2015 Ashcroft released ''[[Call Me Dave]]'', an [[unauthorised biography]] of Cameron written with journalist [[Isabel Oakeshott]], which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as [[Piggate]], in which he allegedly inserted his penis into a dead pig's head.

====Evaluations of premiership====
In the months immediately following his resignation from the post of Prime Minister, a number of commentators gave negative evaluations of Cameron's premiership. The [[University of Leeds]]' [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom#2016 University of Leeds survey|2016 survey]] of post-War Prime Ministers, which collected the views of 82 academics specialising in the history and politics of post-war Britain, ranked Cameron as the third-worst Prime Minister since 1945, ranking above only [[Alec Douglas-Home]] and [[Anthony Eden]]. 90% of respondents cited his calling and losing of the Brexit referendum as his greatest failure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-worst-prime-minister-ranking-third-since-ww2-a7358171.html |title=David Cameron rated third worst Prime Minister since end of World War Two |last=Cowburn |first=Ashley |date=12 October 2016 |website=[[independent.co.uk]] |accessdate=26 December 2017}}</ref>

=== Brexit ===
Cameron maintained a low profile following his resignation as Prime Minister and the subsequent [[Brexit negotiations]]. In January 2019, following [[Theresa May]]'s defeat in the House of Commons over her draft withdrawal agreement, Cameron gave a rare interview to reporters outside his house in [[Notting Hill]], saying he backed May's Brexit deal with the EU and did not regret calling the 2016 referendum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-46891769/david-cameron-i-don-t-regret-calling-referendum|title=Cameron: I don't regret calling referendum|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> However, he later said that the outcome of the referendum had left him "hugely depressed" and told ''[[The Times]]'' he knew "some people will never forgive me". He confessed "Every single day I think about it, and the fact that we lost, and the consequences, and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately".<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49690618|title=Cameron: Johnson and Gove behaved 'appallingly'|date=13 September 2019|access-date=13 September 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Months following [[Boris Johnson]]'s election as Prime Minister, Cameron began criticising Johnson's Brexit strategy, including his decision to [[2019 British prorogation controversy|prorogue]] parliament ahead of the Brexit deadline of 31 October and the removal of the whip from Conservative MPs who voted to block a [[no-deal Brexit]]. Additionally, he accused Johnson, as well as [[Michael Gove]], of behaving "appallingly" during the referendum campaign of 2016.<ref name=":1" />

In September 2020, Cameron became the fifth former Prime Minister to criticise the [[UK Internal Market Bill]], over which he said he had "misgivings".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54145202|title=Fifth ex-PM speaks out against post-Brexit bill|work=BBC News|date=14 September 2020|access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref>

=== Memoir ===
In January 2019, several news outlets reported that Cameron's political memoir, including an account of his time in office, was more than three-quarters written.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/17/so-what-is-david-cameron-really-doing-now |title=So what is David Cameron really doing now? |last=Addley |first=Esther |date=17 January 2019 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=1 April 2019 |location=London}}</ref> This came after Cameron was reported to have signed an £800,000 contract with William Collins, an imprint of [[HarperCollins]], in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/22/david-camerons-memoirs-delayed-next-year-amid-fears-former-prime/ |title=David Cameron's memoirs 'delayed until next year' amid fears former Prime Minister has writer's block |last=Hope |first=Christopher |date=22 April 2018 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=1 April 2019 |location= London}}</ref> It was widely sourced that Cameron was planning to hold back the release of the book by several years so that he would not be seen as a "backstreet driver" in May's handling of Brexit.

== In popular culture ==
Cameron made a cameo in the [[BBC]] television programme [[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear's]] [[Top Gear: India Special|India Special]], where he tells the trio of [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[James May]], and [[Richard Hammond]] to "stay away from India" after initially denying the group's request to improve economic relations with India in a letter and suggested that they [[Top Gear controversies#Mexico|mend fences with Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cameron did not like BBC India special he appeared in |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/219018/cameron-did-not-like-bbc.html |website=Deccan Herald |accessdate=23 August 2020}}</ref> Cameron later stated through his aides that he did not like the special that he cameoed in, and that he had the "utmost respect" for the people of India.

Cameron was portrayed by [[Mark Dexter]] in the [[Channel 4]] television films [[Coalition (film)|''Coalition'']] and ''[[Brexit: The Uncivil War]].''

==Personal life==
===Family===
[[File:Armed Forces Full Honor Cordon and State Dinner for United Kingdom 120314-A-WP504-075 (cropped).jpg|thumb|His wife Samantha]]

Cameron is married to [[Samantha Gwendoline Cameron]] (née Sheffield), the daughter of [[Sir Reginald Sheffield, 8th Baronet]], and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now [[Annabel Astor, Viscountess Astor|Viscountess Astor]]). A [[Marlborough College]] school friend of Cameron's sister Clare, Samantha accepted Clare's invitation to accompany the Cameron family on holiday in [[Tuscany]], Italy, after graduating from Bristol School of Creative Arts. It was then David and Samantha's romance started. They were married in 1996.

The Camerons have had four children. Their first, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]], London, with a rare combination of [[cerebral palsy]] and a form of severe [[epilepsy]] called [[Ohtahara syndrome]], requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron was quoted as saying: "The news hits you like a freight train&nbsp;... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful."<ref name="Focus">Can Boy Wonder save the Tories?".

On 8 September 2010, it was announced that Cameron would miss [[Prime Minister's Questions]] in order to fly to [[southern France]] to see his father, Ian Cameron, who had suffered a [[stroke]] with coronary complications.

===Inheritance and family wealth===
In October 2010, David Cameron inherited £300,000 from his father's estate. Ian Cameron, who had worked as a stockbroker in [[City of London#Economy|the City]] of London, used multimillion-pound investment funds based in offshore tax havens, such as [[Jersey]], [[Panama City]], and [[Geneva]], to increase the family wealth. In 1982, Ian Cameron created the Panamanian [[Blairmore Holdings]], an [[offshore investment]] fund, valued at about $20&nbsp;million in 1988, "not liable to taxation on its income or capital gains", which used [[bearer share]]s until 2006.<ref>(3 April 2016) [https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/ The Power Players David Cameron&nbsp;– Ian Cameron] The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

Before becoming prime minister, Cameron regularly used his bicycle to commute to work. In early 2006, he was photographed cycling to work, followed by his driver in a car carrying his belongings.
