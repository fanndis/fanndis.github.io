The city is home to many celebrities, luxury hotels, and the [[Rodeo Drive]] shopping district.

Originally a Spanish ranch where [[Phaseolus lunatus|lima beans]] were grown, Beverly Hills was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil, but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town.

Burton Green began construction on [[The Beverly Hills Hotel]] in 1911. The hotel was finished in 1912.

In the early 1940s, black actors and businessmen had begun to move into Beverly Hills, despite the covenants allowing only whites to live in the city. A neighborhood improvement association attempted to enforce the covenant in court. The defendants included such luminaries as [[Hattie McDaniel]], [[Louise Beavers]], and [[Ethel Waters]]. Among the white residents supporting the lawsuit against blacks was silent film star [[Harold Lloyd]]. The [[NAACP]] participated in the defense, which was successful.

==Geography==
Beverly Hills and the neighboring city of [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] are together entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. Specifically, Beverly Hills is bordered on the northwest by the Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] and the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], on the east by West Hollywood, the [[Carthay]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]] of Los Angeles, and on the south by the [[Beverlywood, Los Angeles, California|Beverlywood]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.<ref>Google map</ref> The area's "[[Platinum Triangle, Los Angeles|Platinum Triangle]]" is formed by the city of Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Bel Air and [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California|Holmby Hills]].

Most residents live in the "flats" of Beverly Hills, which is a relatively flat land that slants towards the hills, and includes all of Beverly Hills south of Sunset Blvd. The houses situated in the hillside north of Sunset Boulevard have a much higher value than the average housing price for the rest of the city. Santa Monica Boulevard divides the "flats" into two areas, locally known as "North or South of the tracks," referring to the train tracks that were once used by the old [[Pacific Electric]] streetcar line that traversed Beverly Hills along Santa Monica Blvd. Houses south of Wilshire Boulevard have more urban square and rectangular lots, in general smaller than those to the north. There are also more apartment buildings south of Wilshire Boulevard than anywhere else in Beverly Hills, and the average house value south of Wilshire is the lowest in Beverly Hills. Nearly all businesses and government offices in Beverly Hills are located south of Santa Monica Boulevard. Two notable exceptions are the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]]. Just outside the city limits to the west lies the [[Los Angeles Country Club]]. Other locations commonly associated with Beverly Hills include the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and the [[Beverly Center]], just outside the city limits to the east.

The ZIP codes for Beverly Hills are 90209, 90210, 90211, 90212 and 90213.<ref name="usps">{{cite web|url=http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp |title=USPS – ZIP Code Lookup – Search By City |publisher=United States Postal Service |access-date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903025217/http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/citytown.jsp |archive-date=September 3, 2007  }}</ref>

==In popular culture==
{{Category see also|Beverly Hills, California in fiction}}
Beverly Hills frequently appears in popular culture as a place of conspicuous wealth or luxury, although the actual demographics of the city are more complex.<ref name="ferrell">{{citation|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-28-mn-1225-story.html|title=Town That Tells Time on a Rolex : Beverly Hills is a small place really.

In television, the scene in the opening credits of ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960–1968), in which Sheriff Taylor and Opie carry fishing poles past a pond, was shot at the [[Franklin Canyon Reservoir]] at the north end of town, just west of Coldwater Canyon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/07/andy-griffith-mayberry-franklin-canyon.html|title=Take a walk to Andy Griffith's Mayberry in Franklin Canyon|date=July 7, 2012|website=LA Times Blogs|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> The CBS sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' (1962–71) followed a hillbilly family who relocate to Bevery Hills from the Ozarks. The city also features in the name of the 1990s soap opera ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', revolving around the lives of teenagers attending the fictional West Beverly Hills High School.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Itzkoff |first1=Dave |title=When Teenage Angst Had Its Own ZIP Code |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/31/arts/television/31itzk.html |access-date=15 February 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=29 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Herbert |first1=Steven |title=A Post-Graduate Commentary |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-07-07-tv-2798-story.html |access-date=15 February 2020 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=7 July 1991}}</ref>
