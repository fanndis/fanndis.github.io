{{Politics of Indonesia}}
'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Indonesia]] on 8 July 2009. The elections returned a [[President of Indonesia|president]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|vice president]] for the 2009â€“2014 term. Incumbent President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, elected with a 20% margin in the 2004 election, sought a second term against former President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] in a rematch of the 2004 election, as well as incumbent Vice President [[Jusuf Kalla]]. Securing a majority of the votes in a landslide victory in the first round, Yudhoyono was re-elected without the need to proceed to a second round, scheduled to be held on 8 September if no candidate received a majority of the popular vote.<ref>{{cite news | last = Yang | first = Lina | title = Indonesia's presidential election day set at July 8 | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/23/content_10706882.htm | publisher = [[Xinhua]] | date =  2009-01-23 | accessdate = 2009-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Indonesia's president re-elected: No wonder why with SBY | url = http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14009129 | publisher = [[The Economist]] | date =  2009-07-09 | accessdate = 2009-07-11}}</ref> Yudhoyono was officially declared the victor of the election on 23 July 2009, by the General Election Commission (KPU).<ref>{{Cite news|last = Andra Wisnu | title = SBY officially declared winner | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | pages = 2

==Background==
This was the second election in which Indonesians elected their [[President of Indonesia|President]] and [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]] [[Direct election|directly]]. In 2004, [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] defeated incumbent [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] in a run-off election. Polls through early January 2009 saw Yudhoyono leading a large field of potential presidential candidates.<ref>{{cite news | title = More Support New Susilo Term in Indonesia | url = http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32571/more_support_new_susilo_term_in_indonesia | publisher = [[Angus Reid Global Monitor]] | date = 2009-01-08 | accessdate = 2009-05-16 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090118234713/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32571/more_support_new_susilo_term_in_indonesia | archive-date = 2009-01-18 }}</ref>

Incumbent Vice President [[Jusuf Kalla]] announced in February 2009 that he would not be returning as a vice presidential candidate with Yudhoyono. Instead, he was ready to challenge Yudhoyono should [[Golkar]], the party which he chaired, nominate him as a presidential candidate.<ref>{{cite news | first = Mustaqim | last = Adamrah | title = Kalla ready to challenge SBY in polls | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/02/21/kalla-ready-challenge-sby-polls.html | publisher = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 2009-02-21 | accessdate = 2009-05-17}}</ref> Other individuals interested in becoming presidential candidates included former President [[Abdurrahman Wahid]],<ref>{{cite news | title = Abdurrahman Wahid plans new bid for Indonesian presidency | url = http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200807/s2306076.htm | publisher = [[Radio Australia]] | date = 2008-07-17 | accessdate = 2009-05-17}}</ref> former [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) Speaker [[Akbar Tandjung]],<ref>{{cite news | title = Akbar Tanjung ready to join next year's presidential election | url = http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/5/25/akbar-tanjung-ready-to-join-next-years-presidential-election/ | publisher = [[ANTARA]] | date = 2008-05-25 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090414115826/http://antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/5/25/akbar-tanjung-ready-to-join-next-years-presidential-election/ | archive-date = 2009-04-14 }}</ref>  [[Yogyakarta]] [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Sultan]] [[Hamengkubuwana X]],<ref>{{cite news | title = Indonesian sultan to run for president | url = http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/10/29/indonesian-sultan-to-run-for-president/ | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120903230814/http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/10/29/indonesian-sultan-to-run-for-president/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-09-03 | publisher = [[ANTARA]] | date = 2008-10-29 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 }}</ref> and former [[Jakarta]] Governor [[Sutiyoso]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Sutiyoso Berpeluang Besar Jika Cermat Pilih Cawapres | url = http://www.suaramerdeka.com/cybernews/harian/0710/02/nas6.htm | publisher = [[Suara Merdeka (newspaper)|Suara Merdeka]] | date = 2007-10-02 | accessdate = 2009-05-17 | language = id | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090802074143/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/cybernews/harian/0710/02/nas6.htm | archive-date = 2009-08-02 }}</ref>

==Coalition talks==
Following [[2009 Indonesian legislative election|legislative elections held on 9 April]], coalitions of political parties began to emerge in order to nominate candidates for President and Vice President. Under the 2008 Presidential Election Law, the candidates must be nominated by a party or coalition that won at least 25% of the popular vote or 112 (20%) of 560 seats of the DPR.<ref>{{cite news | title = Many votes to count | url = http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13448679 | publisher = [[The Economist]] | date = 2009-04-09 | accessdate = 2009-05-14}}</ref> Indonesia's [[Constitutional Court of Indonesia|Constitutional Court]] also ruled that independent candidates would not be allowed to run.<ref>{{cite news | title = 23 Parties Join Forces To Fight Election Limits | url = http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/article/11887.html | publisher = [[Jakarta Globe]] | date = 2009-03-04 | accessdate = 2009-05-16 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120915112400/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/news/article/11887.html | archive-date = 2012-09-15 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Candidates had to officially register with the KPU by midnight of 16 May in order to appear on the ballots.<ref>{{cite news | title = KPU urge presidential candidates to register before deadline passed | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/05/15/kpu-urge-presidential-candidates-register-deadline-passed.html | publisher = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 2009-05-15 | accessdate = 2009-05-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

It initially appeared that [[Golkar]], the party of incumbent Vice President Jusuf Kalla, would enter into a coalition with the [[Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle]] (PDIâ€“P) of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri to challenge President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's [[Democratic Party (Indonesia)|Democratic Party]]. However, talks were broken off on 13 April 2009, with Golkar reportedly more interested in continuing the coalition with Yudhoyono rather than risk being cut off from power completely. Yudhoyono was also in talks with Islamist parties in a bid to form a coalition controlling more than half the seats in parliament.<ref>{{cite news | first = Muklis | last = Ali | title = Indonesia president's party eyes Golkar, Islamist pact | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE53C0QX20090413 | publisher = [[Reuters]] | date = 2009-04-13 | accessdate = 2009-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Democrat Party Exploring Coalition With Golkar | url = http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsworld.php?id=403756 | publisher = Bernama.com | date = 2009-04-13 | accessdate = 2009-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Indonesia coalition talks 'near' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7996419.stm | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 2009-04-13 | accessdate = 2009-05-14}}</ref>

The presidential election campaign began on 2 June and ran until 4 July, with mass rallies allowed from 12 June onwards. Those participating in the campaign were not allowed to question the basis of the Indonesian state, insult the race or religion of candidates, use threats or violence or give financial or material incentives to voters.<ref>[http://mediacenter.kpu.go.id/images/mediacenter/mobsos/pilpres_liflet/kampanye-1.pdf Campaign Leaflet from the General Elections Commission] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20131225105324/http%3A//mediacenter.kpu.go.id/images/mediacenter/mobsos/pilpres_liflet/kampanye%2D1.pdf |date=2013-12-25 }} '''Indonesian'''</ref> There were a series of debates between 18 June and 2 July that were carried live on Indonesian television, three between the presidential candidates and two between the vice-presidential candidates.
