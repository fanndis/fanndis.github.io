"'''Mine'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Produced by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]], it was released as the [[lead single]] from Swift's third studio album, ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) by [[Big Machine Records]]. Following an unauthorized [[internet leak]], the song was released on August&nbsp;4, 2010, two weeks earlier than the intended release date. Swift was inspired to write "Mine" after reflecting on one of her unnamed crushes and explained that the song is about her tendency to run from [[love]]. The song contains elements of [[power pop]] and its lyrics speak of the ups and downs of a young love.

Critical reception for "Mine" was mostly positive. Swift was praised for her ability to show a mature perspective on love, although some critics called the song "formulaic" for resonating her earlier works, notably "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]". The song was commercially successful; it became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada and Japan. The single was certified Gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). In the United States, the song entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to debut multiple tracks in the top five during a calendar year after [[Mariah Carey]] did so in 1995.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by Swift and [[Roman White]]. The video chronicles the romantic relationship between Swift and her love interest played by British actor [[Toby Hemingway]] which ends with a marriage. The music video was met with great praise from contemporary critics who deemed it as "rather sweet," and "heartwarming." The song was performed live at numerous venues to promote ''Speak Now''. The music video received the Video of the Year Award at the 2011 [[CMT Music Awards]].

==Background and release==
In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Swift revealed that "Mine" was inspired by an unnamed [[Puppy love|crush]] in mind, saying "I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time."<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.omgmusic.com/news/taylor-swift-mine-was-written-about-a-boy-i-liked|title =Taylor Swift "Mine Was Written About A Boy I Liked"|publisher =Omgmusic.com|accessdate =2011-01-12|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100828073526/http://www.omgmusic.com/news/taylor-swift-mine-was-written-about-a-boy-i-liked|archivedate =2010-08-28}}</ref> She also told [[MTV]] that the song is about what it would be like if she actually let her guard down.<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646350/taylor-swifts-mine-reflects-on-one-her-crushes.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift's 'Mine' Reflects On One Of Her Crushes|date=2010-08-24|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2011-01-12|archive-date=2011-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216223742/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646350/taylor-swifts-mine-reflects-on-one-her-crushes.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> During a live [[Ustream.tv|Ustream]] chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about "her tendency to run from love" after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups.<ref name="Digitalspy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a247848/taylor-swift-confirms-new-single-details.html|title=Taylor Swift confirms new single details|date=2010-07-21|first=Ryan|last=Love|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=2011-01-12|archive-date=2010-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723135311/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a247848/taylor-swift-confirms-new-single-details.html|url-status=live}}</ref> She continued, "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship.

==Critical reception==
The song received mostly positive reviews by music critics. [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' praised Swift's lyrical craftsmanship, calling the song's couplets "You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter" as a "brilliant throwaway detail."<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-now-20101026 |title=Taylor Swift Speak Now (2010) |date=2010-10-26 |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2011-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110050744/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-now-20101026 |archivedate=January 10, 2011 }}</ref> Bobby Peacock of ''Roughstock'' gave the song three-and-a-half stars out of five, lauding its catchy yet melodious hook.

Blake Boldt of ''Engine 145'' gave the song a thumbs-down, criticizing Swift's failure to deliver an expected "big payoff" through the song. He contended that this failure proves that "Swift's songwriting skills are still raw, still needing that one last polish in order to shine."<ref name="engine145.com"/>

===Synopsis===
The video begins with Swift entering the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite where she is sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter ([[Toby Hemingway]]) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did when she was younger as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/956603/taylor-swift-grows-up-before-fans-eyes-in-mine-video|title=Taylor Swift Grows Up Before Fans' Eyes In 'Mine' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Mariel|last=Concepcion|date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-01-13|archive-date=2013-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529212955/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/956603/taylor-swift-grows-up-before-fans-eyes-in-mine-video|url-status=live}}</ref> Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.

===Reception===
The video was met with great praise from critics. Tanner Stransky of ''Entertainment Weekly'' felt the video was "rather sweet" and "heartwarming" in a sense that the song "seems to have a happy ending."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/08/27/taylor-swift-mine-music-video/|title=Taylor Swift's 'Mine' music video: What a sweet, sweet love story|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Tanner|last=Stransky|date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-01-13|archive-date=2013-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030124821/http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/08/27/taylor-swift-mine-music-video/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Leah Collins of the ''[[Dose (magazine)|Dose.ca]]'' lamented the video for its typical fairytale element even though the plot ended with a blissful marriage.
