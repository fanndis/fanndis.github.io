{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The APC is generally considered to be a [[center-left|centre-left]] political party that favors [[controlled market]] economic policies, and a strong and active role for government regulation. A substantial number of its political leaders are followers of or politicians who subscribe to the [[social democratic]] [[political philosophy]] of [[Obafemi Awolowo]] and the [[socialist]] and anti-class views of [[Aminu Kano]]. Moreover, the majority of the APC's base of political support is in southwestern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria, which are dominated by the country's largest ethnic groups, the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and the [[Hausa-Fulani]], respectively.<ref>Elite Project Writes.
