'''Dame Margaret Mary Beckett''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|DBE|PC|MP}} (''{{nee}}'' '''Jackson'''; born 15 January 1943) is a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who has been the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] since [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].  She was the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] from 1992 to 1994, and briefly served as interim [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] after Smith's sudden death. She later served in the Cabinet under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in a number of roles, becoming Britain's first female [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in 2006.

Beckett was first elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] and held junior positions in the governments of [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]]. She lost her seat in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]], but returned to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1983, this time representing [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]]. She was appointed to [[Neil Kinnock]]'s [[Shadow Cabinet of Neil Kinnock|Shadow Cabinet]] shortly afterwards; she was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in 1992, becoming the first woman to hold that role.  When [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] died in 1994, Beckett became the first woman to lead the Labour Party, although [[Tony Blair]] won the [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|election to replace Smith]] shortly afterwards and assumed the substantive leadership.

After Labour returned to power in [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]], Beckett became a member of [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] initially as [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]]. She later served as [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], before becoming [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] in 2006, the first woman to hold that position, and—after [[Margaret Thatcher]]—the second woman to hold one of the [[Great Offices of State]]. Following Blair's resignation as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2007, Beckett was not initially given a position by new Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]]. After a period on the backbenches, Brown appointed her [[Minister of State for Housing and Planning]] in 2008, before she left the government for the last time in 2009.

Beckett holds the record for the female MP with the longest service overall ([[Harriet Harman]] has longer continuous service) and is the only sitting MP who served in the Labour governments of the 1970s. She was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2013 New Year Honours]] for public and political service.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60367|date=29 December 2012|page=6 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>

==Early life==
Margaret Beckett was born Margaret Mary Jackson in 1943, in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Lancashire, into the family of an invalid Congregationalist carpenter father and an Irish Catholic teacher mother. Her father died early, precipitating family poverty.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/16/profiles.parliament1|title=Margaret Beckett|last=Roth|first=Andrew|date=16 March 2001|accessdate=14 September 2019|work=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010213012/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/16/profiles.parliament1|archive-date=10 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She had two sisters, one later a nun, the other later a doctor and mother of three. She was educated at the [[Notre Dame High School (Norwich)|Notre Dame High School for Girls]] in [[Norwich]], then at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]], where she took a degree in [[metallurgy]]. She was an active member of the Students' Union and served on its council.

In 1961, Beckett joined [[Associated Electrical Industries]] as a student apprentice in metallurgy. She joined the [[Transport and General Workers Union]] in 1964. She joined the [[University of Manchester]] in 1966 as an experiment officer in its metallurgy department. In 1970 Beckett went to work for the Labour Party as a researcher in [[industrial policy]].

==Member of Parliament==
In 1973, Beckett was selected as Labour candidate for [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]], which the party wanted to win back from ex-Labour MP [[Dick Taverne]], who had won the [[1973 Lincoln by-election|Lincoln by-election]] in March 1973 standing as the [[Democratic Labour Party (UK, 1972)|Democratic Labour]] candidate. At the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Beckett lost to Taverne by 1,297 votes. After the election, she worked as a researcher for [[Judith Hart]], the [[Minister for Overseas Development]] at the Foreign Office. [[Harold Wilson]] called another [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election in October 1974]], and Beckett again stood against Taverne in Lincoln. This time Beckett became the MP, with a majority of 984 votes.

Almost immediately after her election she was appointed as Judith Hart's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]]. [[Harold Wilson]] made her a [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] in 1975, and she was promoted in 1976 by [[James Callaghan]] to [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department of Education and Science]], replacing [[Joan Lestor]], who had resigned in protest over spending cuts. She remained in that position until she lost her seat at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Kenneth Carlisle]] narrowly won the seat with a 602-vote majority, the first time the Conservatives had won at Lincoln since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]].

She joined [[Granada Television]] as a researcher in 1979. Out of Parliament, and now known as Margaret Beckett after her marriage, she was elected to Labour's [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] in 1980, and supported left-winger [[Tony Benn]] in the [[1981 Labour Party deputy leadership election|1981 Labour deputy leadership election]] narrowly won by [[Denis Healey]]. She was the subject of a vociferous attack from [[Joan Lestor]] at the conference.

Beckett was selected to stand at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] as the Labour candidate in the parliamentary constituency of [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]] after the retirement of the sitting MP, [[Walter Johnson (UK politician)|Walter Johnson]]. At the election she retained the seat with a small majority of 421 votes.

===Shadow Cabinet and Deputy Leader, 1984–94===
{{see also|Shadow Cabinet of Margaret Beckett}}
Returning to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], Margaret Beckett gradually moved away from the [[hard left]], supporting incumbent leader [[Neil Kinnock]] against Benn in 1988. By this time she was a front bencher, as a spokeswoman on Social Security since 1984, becoming a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]] in 1989 as Shadow Chief Secretary to the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Following the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] she was elected [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]] and served under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons]]. She became a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Member of the Privy Council]] in 1993. She was the first woman to serve as deputy leader of the Labour Party.

Following the sudden death of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] from a heart attack on 12 May 1994, Margaret Beckett became the acting Labour leader, [[Labour Party Rule Book|the Party's constitution]] providing for the automatic succession of the deputy leader for the remainder of the leadership term, upon the death or resignation of an incumbent leader in opposition. Labour leaders are subject to annual re-election at the time of the annual party conference while the party is in opposition. Accordingly, Beckett was constitutionally entitled to remain in office as acting leader until the 1994 Conference, however the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) rapidly decided to bring forward the election for Leader and Deputy Leader to July 1994.

She decided to run for the position of Leader, but came last in [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|the subsequent leadership election]], behind [[Tony Blair]] and [[John Prescott]]. The Deputy Leadership was contested at the same time; Beckett, standing in this election as well, was also defeated in this contest, coming second behind Prescott. Though she failed in both contests, she was retained in the shadow cabinet by [[Tony Blair]] as [[Shadow Secretary of State for Health|Shadow Health Secretary]].

A footnote to her ten-week tenure as caretaker leader of the Labour Party is that she happened to be the leader at the time of that year's [[1994 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1994 European parliament elections]], which were held just four weeks after ill-fate placed her in the position. Labour's election campaign had naturally been long in the planning under John Smith, whose sudden death led to a "sympathy rise" in opinion polls for Labour, compounding what had already been a strong lead over the Conservatives. Consequently, Labour had a commanding victory in what was its best result in any of the eight European elections held since 1979. The two Labour leadership elections followed just six weeks later on 21 July 1994 and the Labour electorate did not appear to attribute any credit for the successful European election result to Beckett's chance-ordained position as acting leader in the four weeks immediately prior to the election.

Under [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership, Margaret Beckett was the Shadow Secretary of State for [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Health]], and then from 1995 the shadow [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]]. She was one of the leading critics of the government when the [[Scott Report]] published its findings into the [[Arms-to-Iraq]] scandal in 1996.

===In government, 1997–2001===
The Labour party was elected to government in a [[landslide victory|landslide]] in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] and Margaret Beckett held a number of senior positions in the [[First Blair ministry|Blair government]]. After the election she was appointed [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]] (a position the title later reverted to [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]); the first woman to have held the post. She was succeeded by [[Peter Mandelson]] in July 1998.

Beckett was then [[Leader of the House of Commons]] from 1998 until her replacement by [[Robin Cook]] in June 2001. Her tenure saw the introduction of Westminster Hall debates, which are debates held in a small chamber near Westminster Hall on topics of interest to individual MPs, committee reports, and other matters that would not ordinarily be debated in the Commons chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P04.pdf |title=House of Commons Factsheet P4: Sittings of the House |date=November 2006 |accessdate=16 December 2007 |work=House of Commons|publisher=UK Parliament  |page=2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529071521/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P04.pdf |archivedate=29 May 2008 }}</ref> Debates that take place in Westminster Hall are often more consensual and informal, and can address the concerns of [[backbenchers]].

===Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2001–06===
After the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Beckett became Secretary of State at the new [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], created after the old [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] was abolished in the wake of perceived mismanagement of the [[foot and mouth disease]] [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|epidemic in 2001]]. The new department also incorporated some of the functions of the former [[Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] (DETR), and was known by its initials, "DEFRA".

For legal reasons, she was also appointed formally as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which appointment she held until MAFF was finally dissolved on 27 March 2002 and the remaining functions of the [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] were transferred to the Secretary of State at large.

Beckett rejected demands for an expansion of [[Nuclear power in the United Kingdom|nuclear power]] from a lobby including energy minister [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] and Downing Street staff. She argued there was no need for new nuclear for at least 15 years given current energy prices and generation capacity. The 2003 energy [[white paper]] stated "the current economics of nuclear power make it unattractive" and there were no proposals for new nuclear power stations.<ref name=guardian-20040919>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/19/nuclear.greenpolitics |title=Beckett rejects nuclear option |work=The Guardian |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225223539/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/19/nuclear.greenpolitics |archive-date=25 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20050508>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489561/Beckett-puts-block-on-the-building-of-new-nuclear-power-stations.html |title=Beckett puts block on the building of new nuclear power stations |author1=Robert Watts |author2=Andrew Murray-Watson |work=The Telegraph |date=8 May 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225162009/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489561/Beckett-puts-block-on-the-building-of-new-nuclear-power-stations.html |archive-date=25 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=bower-2016>{{cite book |pages=297–304 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR5xCwAAQBAJ |title=Broken Vows : Tony Blair : the Tragedy of Power |last=Bower |first=Tom |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=2016 |isbn=9780571314201 |via=Google Books |access-date=25 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225163041/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JR5xCwAAQBAJ |archive-date=25 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

She held the position of [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] until May 2006, when she was succeeded by [[David Miliband]]. Beckett was on the front line of the government's efforts to tackle [[climate change]], and attended international conferences on the matter.

In a report published on 29 March 2007 by the [[Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee]], she was criticised for her role in the failures of the [[Rural Payments Agency]] when she had been [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/29/nfarms29.xml |title=Beckett should be sacked over farm payments fiasco, say MPs |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=2 April 2007 |author=Charles Clover |work=The Telegraph  |archivedate=30 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F03%2F29%2Fnfarms29.xml |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Foreign Secretary: 2006–2007===
Following the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 local elections]], [[Tony Blair]] demoted [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], and appointed Margaret Beckett as his successor. She was the first woman to hold the post, and only the second woman to hold one of the [[great offices of state]] (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]). Beckett's appointment came as something of a surprise, for the media and for Beckett herself. She admitted reacting to the news with a four-letter word.<ref>{{cite news

Margaret Beckett had to adapt quickly to her diplomatic role and within a few hours of her appointment as Foreign Secretary she flew to the United Nations in New York City for an urgent meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the [[Iran]] nuclear weapons crisis. About a month later, Beckett came under fire for not responding quickly enough to the [[2006 Lebanon war]], which saw [[Israel]] invade the country, although some reports suggested that the delay was caused by Cabinet division rather than Mrs Beckett's reluctance to make a public statement on the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6207306.stm |title=Commons Confidential: November 2006 |accessdate=20 March 2007 |work=BBC News |date=4 December 2006 |first=Nick |last=Assinder |archivedate=19 February 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219124000/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6207306.stm |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Bid to become Speaker===
On 10 June 2009, Beckett announced that she wished to replace [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]] as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Mrs Beckett said: "I think at the moment we have got very considerable problems in Parliament. We have got to make changes.... After the next election, if we have a more finely balanced chamber than we have had in the recent past, it will be a very different ball game.... I hope I can help us deal with that." Beckett received 74 votes in the first round and 70 votes in the second round of the 2009 Speaker election, reaching the third place as the strongest Labour candidate both times but considerably trailing the two Conservative frontrunners [[John Bercow]] and [[George Young, Baron Young of Cookham|George Young]]. She withdrew following the second round of voting.<ref>{{cite web|date=22 June 2009 |url=http://news.parliament.uk/2009/06/election-of-the-speaker-latest/ |title=Election of the Speaker: Latest |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=29 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://news.parliament.uk/2009/06/election-of-the-speaker-latest/ |archivedate=30 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

In August 2009, Beckett wrote to Sir Christopher Kelly, Chairman of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which was investigating MPs' Expenses. In the letter, Beckett says the allowances do not adequately cover MPs' costs, which include political campaigns. ''The Telegraph'' criticised the "self-pitying" letter, saying it will fuel "concern that some MPs are not genuinely committed to reform".<ref>{{cite news|date=23 August 2009|accessdate=23 August 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6806398.ece|title= Margaret Beckett in 'take pity' plea on expenses|work= Times Online|first=Isabel|last=Oakeshott}}{{dead link|date=May 2019}}</ref>

===Beckett report===
On 16 January 2016, Beckett released "Learning the Lessons from Defeat Taskforce Report", a 35-page report into why the Labour Party lost the general election of 2015 after the then-deputy leader [[Harriet Harman]] requested Beckett investigate the reasons for Labour's failure.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Mollie|title=Why Labour lost the election.

Ultimately, the Conservatives won a narrow majority.<ref name="Beckett Report" />

The report said that explanations including Labour being "anti-business" or "anti-aspiration" were not "significant" factors, saying that "reasons for defeat should be treated with caution and require deeper analysis".<ref name="Beckett Report">{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Jon|title=Forget what you think you know about why Labour lost the election|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/commonly-believed-reasons-why-labour-lost-the-election-arent-significant-says-partys-beckett-report-a6821476.html|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=The Independent|date=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122024003/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/commonly-believed-reasons-why-labour-lost-the-election-arent-significant-says-partys-beckett-report-a6821476.html|archive-date=22 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Allegations that the party was overly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] were also allegedly unfounded as according to the report: "Many of our most 'left wing' policies were the most popular. Polls showed a wish, from voters, for us to be tougher on big business, and policies that were unpopular with many senior business people, such as the energy price freeze and the Mansion Tax, were popular with voters".<ref name="Socialist Worker">{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Nick|title=Beckett report can't work out how Labour lost in 2015|url=https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/42037/Beckett+report+cant+work+out+how+Labour+lost+in+2015|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=Socialist Worker (Britain)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122162934/https://socialistworker.co.uk/art/42037/Beckett+report+cant+work+out+how+Labour+lost+in+2015|archive-date=22 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The main reasons given for Labour's losses were the perceived weakness of [[Ed Miliband]] as party leader, fear of Labour's relationship with the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) among English voters, a perceived association with [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|the financial crisis]] under the [[Brown ministry]]<ref name="Beckett Report"/> and "issues of connection" with voters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mason|first1=Rowena|title=Beckett report: Labour lost election over economy, immigration and benefits|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/14/beckett-report-labour-lost-2015-election-economy-immigrants-benefits|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=14 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117031140/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/14/beckett-report-labour-lost-2015-election-economy-immigrants-benefits|archive-date=17 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Labour was also said to have failed to convince voters of its welfare and immigration policies. Beckett claims: "A series of vicious and cynical attacks were mounted on some of the most vulnerable in society, in the expectation that the Labour party would do its utmost to defend them, and could be painted as the party of {{'}}welfare{{'}}".<ref name="Socialist Worker" />

The report also said that it would be difficult for Labour to win next time because of changes to constituency boundaries ([[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|due in 2018]]), voter registration changes and restrictions on trade union funding of parties. Beckett said the party should campaign in ordinary language, focus its policy on the condition of Britain in 2020, unite for the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU referendum]] and draw up a five-year media strategy.<ref name="Beckett Report"/>

The Beckett report was criticised by some on the left-wing of British politics as "show[ing] that many Labour politicians still don't really understand why they lost" and blaming factors such as the rise of the SNP on Labour's losses, rather than campaigning against [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]].<ref name="Socialist Worker" /> Others have criticised the report for being too broad and too vague in its conclusions. Stephen Bush wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' that "every bit of the Labour party will have something it can cling to" in the report:<ref name="Stephen Bush">{{cite news|last1=Bush|first1=Stephen|title=The Beckett Report won't help Labour win the next election|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2016/01/beckett-report-wont-help-labour-win-next-election|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=New Statesman|date=19 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120091411/http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2016/01/beckett-report-wont-help-labour-win-next-election|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He continued:
{{quote|Supporters of [[Jeremy Corbyn]] will take heart from the fact that individual left-wing policies, like the mansion tax, were popular. But Corbyn-sceptics will note that it was voters that went for [[Tony Blair]] and [[David Cameron]]  that failed to back the party in 2015, which they will take as an endorsement of a centrist approach. [[Ed Miliband]]'s diehard supporters – they do exist, believe it or not – will see the report as an endorsement of the Miliband era policy approach but will argue that a more convincing frontman would have sealed the deal.<ref name="Stephen Bush" />}}
[[Owen Jones]], columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that the left should not fear the Beckett report, saying: "Let's have a full inquest, not in the interests of navel-gazing, but in the interests of winning".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Owen|title=The left must not fear the Beckett report – it will help Labour win power|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/labour-beckett-report-left-election-defeat-2015|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=The Guardian|date=18 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120211727/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/labour-beckett-report-left-election-defeat-2015|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Many [[Centrism|centrist]] and more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] Labour politicians have also welcomed the report.<ref>{{cite news|title=Set little store by Beckett|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-7bbd-Set-little-store-by-Beckett|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=Morning Star|date=15 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128175612/http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-7bbd-Set-little-store-by-Beckett|archive-date=28 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
