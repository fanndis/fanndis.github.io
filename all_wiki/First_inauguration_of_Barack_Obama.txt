The '''first inauguration of Barack Obama''' as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th]] [[President of the United States]] took place on Tuesday, January 20, 2009, at the West Front of the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The 56th [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]], which set a record attendance for any event held in the city, marked the commencement of the first term of [[Barack Obama]] as President and [[Joe Biden]] as Vice President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/56th-inaugural-ceremonies/|title=The 56th Presidential Inauguration: Barack H. Obama, January 20, 2009|publisher=United States Senate|access-date=April 8, 2020|archive-date=April 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408041025/https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/56th-inaugural-ceremonies/|url-status=live}}</ref> Based on combined attendance numbers, television viewership, and Internet traffic, it was one of the most-observed events ever by the global audience.

"A&nbsp;New Birth of Freedom", a phrase from the [[Gettysburg Address]], served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th&nbsp;anniversary of the birth year of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. In his speeches to the crowds, Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal, continuity and national unity. Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America's challenges at home and abroad.

Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to Washington,&nbsp;D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]], the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith [[Prayers at United States presidential inaugurations|inaugural prayer service]]. The [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath]] as administered by [[Supreme Court Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the [[United States Constitution]], which led to its re‑administration the next day.

In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the [[Presidential Inaugural Committee]] increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened the entire length of the [[National Mall]] as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.

==Context==
By definition, the inauguration marked the formal culmination of the [[presidential transition of Barack Obama]] that began when he won the United States [[2008 United States presidential election|presidential election]] on [[Election Day (United States)|November 4, 2008]] and became the [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]].<ref name='NYT-Nagourney-2008-11-04'>{{cite news | first= Adam | last= Nagourney | authorlink= Adam Nagourney | title= Obama Wins Election | date= November 4, 2008 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= November 5, 2008 | archive-date= December 9, 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209030024/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html | url-status= live }}</ref> In accordance with [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 6: Compensation, privileges, and restrictions on holding civil office|Article&nbsp;I, Section&nbsp;6]] of the [[United States Constitution]], Obama resigned from the [[United States Senate]] effective November 16, 2008.<ref>Letter of resignation from Barack Obama to [[Richard Cheney]], November 18, 2008; published in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', November 19, 2008, page S10609 ([https://www.congress.gov/crec/2008/11/19/CREC-2008-11-19-pt1-PgS10608-3.pdf Communication from the Honorable Barack Obama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731164716/https://www.congress.gov/crec/2008/11/19/CREC-2008-11-19-pt1-PgS10608-3.pdf |date=July 31, 2020 }})</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Obama sets date to leave Senate|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/us_elections_2008/7728466.stm|date=November 13, 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=November 14, 2008|archive-date=January 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116201204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/us_elections_2008/7728466.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> He was formally elected by the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] on December 15, 2008.<ref name='Politico-EC'>{{cite news | first= Andy | last= Barr | title= Electoral College weighs in for Obama | date= December 15, 2008 | url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16610.html | series= U.S. Politics | work= [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | accessdate= December 15, 2008 | archive-date= May 14, 2013 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130514092347/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1208/16610.html | url-status= live }}</ref> The results were certified by a joint session of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on January 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/news_summaries/2009/01/summary_08.html|title=News Summary for January 8, 2009|accessdate=February 18, 2010|date=January 8, 2009|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914051614/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/news_summaries/2009/01/summary_08.html|archivedate=September 14, 2010}}</ref>
<!--Section is being added to address the following concern: An integral element missing to this article is why this was such a notable event, why it attracted the audience it did, which was a combination of the first black president the US has ever had, and the great sigh of relief that Bush was finally leaving. The raucous celebrations that took place throughout the world upon the Obama's elections were credited to both of these causes. I think the article should start with a brief overview of the campaigns and the results of the election, including a description of the running in the streets and honking of cars etc., that occurred in many locations on election night, plus the incredible problems Obama took on from the previous administration. This ties in with the new day themes of his speeches on the train rides and why he would address crisis issues in the inauguration speech. I think it's notable that Bush was the first president since Jimmy Carter, who surprised the Secret Service by walking from the Capitol to the White House, by not walking since his limo was pelted by eggs from parade attendees. As the first black president, there were some serious concerns about Obama's safety if he decided to get out and walk, which he did. Let me know if you have questions.
 I understand that, but the lead and the entire event surrounds the throng of people, the high price of tickets, the large global audience...for a presidential inauguration? As if Obama's just another president? Well he is, but he's also the first black president and the result of a massive political shove to the previous 8-year administration. I think these issues, with the political tone of his speeches in light of the 2 wars and the near-depression he inherited are integral to the article. An immense amount of pressure was placed on Obama to fix everything, to be the panacea for Americans and this came out ceremonially in his inauguration. Can you update this sentence: ''No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony and parade was arrested as of 6:00 p.m. EST on Inauguration Day''-->

Obama, who originally campaigned using the slogan "Change We Can Believe In" and later "Change We Need",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/obamas-change-s.html|title=Obama's 'Change' Slogan Gets a Change|accessdate=February 18, 2010|date=September 13, 2008|publisher=[[ABC News]] Internet Ventures|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224030927/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/obamas-change-s.html|archivedate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> was widely celebrated as the first [[African American]] president of the United States and a symbol of change from his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] predecessor, [[George W. Bush]]. Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President who was born in the 1960s. He inherited what [[Peter Orszag]] termed an "economic mess" that became known as the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/08/Orszag-Obama-inherited-economic-woes/UPI-85971236559252/|title=Orszag: Obama inherited economic woes|accessdate=February 18, 2010|date=March 8, 2009|agency=United Press International|archive-date=January 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116180358/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/03/08/Orszag-Obama-inherited-economic-woes/UPI-85971236559252/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Planning==
[[File:ObamaInaugurationCapitolPreparation.jpg|thumb|alt=U.S. Capitol at dusk, mostly darkened but with dome floodlit from within|Preparations at the [[United States Capitol]]|left]]
The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] and the 2009&nbsp;Presidential Inaugural Committee. Although the election was scheduled for November 4, 2008, the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite press release | title= Construction of 2009 Inaugural Platform Begins with the Ceremonial Driving of the 'First Nail' | date= September 24, 2008 | publisher= [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] | url= http://inaugural.senate.gov/media/releases/release-09242008-inauguralwebsite.cfm | accessdate= June 25, 2009 | archive-date= October 6, 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006205757/http://inaugural.senate.gov/media/releases/release-09242008-inauguralwebsite.cfm | url-status= live }}</ref>

===Joint Congressional Committee===
The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of [[United States Senator]]s [[Dianne Feinstein]], committee chair, [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] and [[Harry Reid]], and [[United States Representative]]s [[John Boehner]], [[Steny Hoyer]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/cmte/membershiphistory.cfm |title=Membership of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105232002/http://inaugural.senate.gov/cmte/membershiphistory.cfm |archivedate=January 5, 2010 }}</ref> The committee is overseen by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|U.S.&nbsp;Senate Committee on Rules and Administration]].

Roberts and Obama made several mistakes as they recited the oath. The proper wording for the oath of office is prescribed in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]:
{{quote|text=I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.<ref name="oathflub"/>}}

Roberts had practiced for the ceremony carefully. However, a memo noting his planned pauses in the recitation of the oath failed to reach Obama's staff before the swearing-in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=How Obama, Roberts Interpret Laws In 'The Oath'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/17/161144225/oba|work=Fresh Air (WHYY)|publisher=NPR|accessdate=January 21, 2013|date=September 17, 2012|archive-date=January 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120113446/http://www.npr.org/2012/09/17/161144225/oba|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court|year=2012|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=978-0385527200|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oathobamawhiteho00toob_0/page/7 7–10]|url=https://archive.org/details/oathobamawhiteho00toob_0/page/7|access-date=December 18, 2019|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804091132/https://archive.org/details/oathobamawhiteho00toob_0/page/7|url-status=live}}</ref>  As a result, Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase, stating "I, Barack" while Roberts was finishing "do solemnly swear". Obama then correctly repeated the entire phrase "I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."

Roberts, who was not using notes, rendered the next phrase as "that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully," misplacing the word ''faithfully'' and saying ''president to'' instead of ''president of''. Obama repeated, "that I will execute", then paused. Roberts attempted to correct the wording, but stumbled: "the off– faithfully the pres– the office of President of the United States." Obama then repeated Roberts' initial incorrect wording.<ref name=OCJRSiRoPO>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/20/chief-justice-roberts-officiates-inauguration/|title=Obama, Chief Justice Roberts Stumble in Recitation of Presidential Oath: Chief Justice John Roberts officiated over his first inauguration Tuesday by swearing in President-elect Barack Obama as president of the United States.|accessdate=February 1, 2009|date=January 20, 2009|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124145742/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/20/chief-justice-roberts-officiates-inauguration/|archive-date=January 24, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="oathflub">{{cite news|first=Pete |last=Williams |title=About That oath flub |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121194437/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |archivedate=January 21, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=President Obama 2009 Inaugural Ceremony|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/283479-1|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|accessdate=April 1, 2012|format=Video|date=January 20, 2009|archive-date=October 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015164740/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/283479-1|url-status=live}}</ref>

Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase "so help you God" to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath, and Obama responded "[[Oath of office of the President of the United States#"So help me God"|so help me God]]" when he was prompted.

Much public discussion arose about the errors in administering and reciting the oath.  Several constitutional scholars said that Obama should retake the oath.

====Inaugural address====
The central theme of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech|title=Obama inauguration: Words of history&nbsp;... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=United Kingdom|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|archive-date=September 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905175343/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/responsibility-theme-obamas-inauguration-speech-aides-say/|title=Responsibility is the Theme of Obama's Inauguration Speech, Aides Say|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=January 18, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518000631/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/responsibility-theme-obamas-inauguration-speech-aides-say/|archive-date=May 18, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases.

Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful&nbsp;to&nbsp;the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage", as well as values such as "honesty", "courage" and "patriotism", which "are old" values. Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The American Crisis]]'', which were ordered by [[George Washington]] to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world&nbsp;... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive&nbsp;... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|campaign]] message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as president within the margins of the nation's traditions.<ref name=mackin/>

Obama's goal for his Inaugural speech was to stir the following response among Americans: "This is why I want to go into public service and be a better politician. This is why I want to go home and be a better parent, better worker, better citizen."<ref>Alter, Jonathan. ''The Promise President Obama, Year One''. Simon & Schuster, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-0119-3}}.</ref>

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American" and "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." Obama quoted the lyrics of the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Dorothy Fields]] song "[[Pick Yourself Up]]" from the [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Swing Time (1936 film)|''Swing Time'']], saying that "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."<ref name="boston_globe">{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/01/obama_calls_for_3.html|title=Obama calls for American renewal|author=Foon Rhee|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=March 4, 2009|work=[[Boston Globe]]|archive-date=February 28, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228220348/http://boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/01/obama_calls_for_3.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In an article for ''The New York Times'', columnist and former drama critic [[Frank Rich]] noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address "one subtle whiff of the [[Great Depression]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/opinion/25rich.html|title=No time for poetry|author=Rich, Frank|date=January 25, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-date=November 4, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104030351/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/opinion/25rich.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Obama's speech contained several [[bible|biblical]] references and was compared to oratory of the "[[black church]] tradition." Obama also highlighted the United States' religious diversity, referring to the country's "patchwork heritage" as a strength and saying, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers." This was the first time a United States President acknowledged [[Irreligion in the United States|American non-believers]] in an inaugural address.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm|title=An inaugural first: Obama acknowledges 'non-believers'|accessdate=February 2, 2010|date=January 22, 2009|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Grossman, Cathy Lynn|archive-date=April 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401094239/http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-20-obama-non-believers_N.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:2009 Obama inauguration luncheon.jpg|thumb|left|225px|alt=Barack Obama addresses attendees at an indoor ceremony|Obama addresses the luncheon attendees in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the [[United States Capitol|U.S.&nbsp;Capitol]].]]
A luncheon at the U.S.&nbsp;Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and [[pheasant]] entrees with [[Pinot noir]] wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon [[sponge cake]] with sweet cream [[Candied fruit|glacé]]. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill's]] 1865 ''View of the Yosemite Valley'', a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the [[Yosemite National Park#Yosemite Grant|Yosemite Grant]], which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/|title=Inauguration of the President: Luncheon|publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]]|accessdate=February 16, 2009|archive-date=February 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211185314/http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/inauguralluncheon.cfm|title=Inaugural Luncheon|publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]]|accessdate=February 16, 2009|archive-date=October 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006180449/http://inaugural.senate.gov/history/daysevents/inauguralluncheon.cfm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/painting.cfm |title=2009 Painting: 'View of the Yosemite Valley' |publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|United States Congress Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]] |accessdate=February 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072111/http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/painting.cfm |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}</ref>

No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8&nbsp;million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported the [[crowd size estimation|estimated crowd size]] for the inaugural ceremony, and the [[National Park Service]] said it did not contest the estimate.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news | last=Ruane | first=Michael | title=D.C.'s Inauguration Head Count: 1.8 Million | accessdate=January 22, 2009 | date=January 20, 2009 | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103884.html | archive-date=June 28, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231456/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103884.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="bostonglobe-attendance">{{cite news | title=Inaugural crowd size reportedly D.C. record | accessdate=January 22, 2009 | date=January 22, 2009 | work=[[Boston Globe]] | url=https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/01/22/inaugural_crowd_size_reportedly_dc_record/ | archive-date=January 25, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125075537/http://boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/01/22/inaugural_crowd_size_reportedly_dc_record/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Amid the massive crowds that arrived at the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to reserved areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates at the start of the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the [[National Mall]].

Inauguration Day broke several records for the Washington Metropolitan Transit system. The 1,120,000 estimated Metrorail riders broke the record of 866,681 trips set the day before (which had broken the record set on July 11, 2008), and marked the first million trip day in the system's history. Metro also provided 423,000 bus trips and 1,721 MetroAccess trips for a total of 1,544,721 trips, the highest ridership day ever in the transit authority's history.<ref name="Metro"/> As of October 2018, the inauguration day crowd is still the largest in Metrorail history, but the [[2017 Women's March]] has the highest counted, not estimated, single day ridership of 1,001,613. In addition, the Sunday events helped Metro set a Sunday single-day record of 616,324 that is still largest Sunday crowd.<ref>{{cite web |title=Metrorail sets new Sunday record for highest ridership |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2429 |accessdate=October 10, 2018 |archive-date=October 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013750/https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2429 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Security===
As with the 54th and 55th Presidential Inaugurations, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a [[National Special Security Event]] (NSSE), resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan;<ref>Title 18 United States Code, Section 3056</ref> the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism, intelligence, and criminal investigation; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophic incident. The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon.  The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, on December 10, 2008.<ref>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7</ref> The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. for the inaugural activities, planners raised concerns about public safety and security. [[U.S. Army|Army]] [[General (United States)|General]] Richard Rowe, head of the joint military task force for the Washington, D.C. area, explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats, especially in light of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks|Mumbai attacks]] in [[India]] that occurred in November 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/19/2469096.htm|title=Obama security team 'prepared for unthinkable'|date=January 19, 2009|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting News]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009|archive-date=January 23, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123091010/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/19/2469096.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Attention was heightened by terrorist threats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html?ref=magazine|title=Obama's War Over Terror|author=Baker, Peter|accessdate=January 18, 2010|date=January 4, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-date=January 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121041535/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html?ref=magazine|url-status=live}}</ref>
