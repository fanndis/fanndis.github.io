Critics of the film, including writer [[Emily Yoffe]] and a number of [[Harvard Law School]] professors, have questioned ''The Hunting Ground's'' accuracy and objectivity.

==Background==
According to Ziering, reactions from women on college campuses to Dick and Ziering's 2012 documentary ''[[The Invisible War]],'' which focuses on the issue of [[Sexual assault in the United States military|sexual assault in the US military]], inspired them to make a documentary about the subject of sexual assault at American colleges.<ref name="Setoodeh"/>

==Content==
''The Hunting Ground'' presents multiple students who were sexually assaulted at their college campuses, and say that [[Academic administration|college administrators]] either ignored them or required that they navigate a complex academic bureaucracy to have their claims addressed. The film shows that many college officials were more concerned by minimizing rape statistics for their universities than by the welfare of the students,<ref name=Barnes/> and contains interviews with college administrators who state that they were pressured into suppressing rape cases.<ref name=Lowman-02-25>{{cite news|title=Jameis Winston's accuser speaks out in campus rape documentary 'Hunting Ground'|first=Rob|last=Lowman|url=http://www.dailynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/20150225/jameis-winstons-accuser-speaks-out-in-campus-rape-documentary-hunting-ground|work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=25 February 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> The film chiefly criticized actions (or lack thereof) by university administrations, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]],<ref name=Setoodeh /> [[Amherst College]], and [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], but it also examines [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] such as [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], colloquially referred by some as “Sexual Assault Expected”.<ref name=Barnes /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://duclarion.com/2019/01/sae-sexual-assault-expected/|title=SAE: Sexual Assault Expected – DU Clarion|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>

The narrative features Andrea Pino and Annie Clark,<ref name=Keslassy/> students at the University of North Carolina, who became campus anti-rape activists after being assaulted. In response to what they saw as an inadequate response from the university, they filed a [[Title IX]] complaint against The University of North Carolina on January 16, 2013 (along with three other students),<ref name="Why">{{cite news |author= Andrea Pino |title=Why Filing an Office for Civil Rights Complaint Against UNC Is Bigger Than Me |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrea-pino/unc-sexual-assault-_b_2497326.html|publisher=Huffington Post |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref> and co-founded the group End Rape on Campus.<ref name=Vogue>{{cite news|title=Campus Sexual Assault: Annie E.

As well as talking to women who share how they were victims of both rapists and unsympathetic university officials, the filmmakers interviewed students, parents, and administrators. ''The Hunting Ground'' also includes a conversation with a former Notre Dame police officer who criticized how rape cases were handled at that institution.<ref name=Setoodeh/> The officer spoke of a case where he was not allowed to question a student accused of rape, a Notre Dame football player, at any time that student was on athletic department property.<ref name=Lowman-02-25/> ''The Hunting Ground'' also includes testimony from male victims of sexual assault. Producer Amy Ziering stated the filmmakers "felt it was important to show men and women. For men it's often harder to speak up because there is a social stigma associated with rape. Many male victims were feeling ashamed."<ref name=Keslassy/>

A section of the film is focused on [[Jameis Winston]], the former star [[quarterback]] for the [[Florida State Seminoles football]] team (now an NFL Free Agent), and the accusation of sexual assault against him while at [[Florida State University|Florida State]]. His accuser, Erica Kinsman, publicly discusses the incident for the first time after Jameis Winston refused to speak about the inncident.<ref name=Barnes /><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25383810/jameis-winston-threatens-lawsuit-against-cnn-over-documentary | title=Jameis Winston threatens lawsuit against CNN over documentary| first=John|last=Breech|work=[[CBSSports.com]] | date=November 21, 2015 | access-date=November 21, 2015}}</ref>

The filmmakers feature experts who say that most rapes are committed by a small number of repeat offenders.

On February 26, 2015, one day before the theatrical release of the film, a bipartisan group of twelve U.S. Senators, accompanied by the film's lead subjects, Annie Clark and Andrea Pino, reintroduced the [[Campus Accountability and Safety Act]].

New York governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] presented the film at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] on June 2, 2015 to promote, and help pass, new legislation to address sexual assault at New York institutions of higher learning.

In a statement emailed to ''The Harvard Crimson,'' the film's director and producer, Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering, criticized the law professors' letter, saying it was "irresponsible and raises an important question about whether the very public bias these professors have shown in favor of an assailant contributes to a hostile climate at Harvard Law".<ref name=Duehren-12-04>{{cite news|title=Website Continues Challenge of 'The Hunting Ground' Film|first=Andrew M.|last=Duehren|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/3/website-challenges-hunting-ground/|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|accessdate=December 5, 2015|date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>

[[Jeannie Suk]], one of nineteen Harvard Law professors to sign the letter, told the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] that filmmaker's comment "exemplifies the reckless way some people use the concept of a hostile environment these days", and later tweeted "if actually accused of violating Title IX because of our criticism of @thehuntinground we will not be allowed to speak about that".<ref>{{cite web|title='Hunting Ground' Filmmakers to Harvard Law Profs: Criticizing Our Film Could Create a 'Hostile Climate'|first=Samantha|last=Harris|url=https://www.thefire.org/hunting-ground-filmmakers-to-harvard-law-profs-criticizing-our-film-could-create-a-hostile-climate/|publisher=[[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]]|accessdate=December 5, 2015|date=December 4, 2015}}</ref>  Suk later wrote that there have been several inquiries about filing a Title IX complaint and likened the misuse of Title IX to [[Laura Kipnis#Controversy|Laura Kipnis']] experience.<ref name=Suk/> Another of the professors, Janet E. Halley, stated "What [the filmmaker's statement] really means is that they don't want the debate".<ref name=Duehren-12-04/>

In a January 5, 2016 op-ed piece in the ''[[Huffington Post]],'' filmmakers Dick and Zeiring reiterated their charges against the nineteen Harvard Law professors signing the letter, stating those professors had "launched a public campaign to discredit an assault survivor" and that their "aggressive actions send a very chilling message to all current and future students at Harvard and Harvard Law: if you report a sexual assault, your professors may come after you publicly".<ref>{{cite news|title=How Harvard Law Professors Retaliated Against An Assault Survivor|first1=Kirby|last1=Dick|first2=Amy|last2=Ziering|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kirby-dick/how-harvard-law-professor_b_8916026.html|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> Professor Janet E.

===Reports of conflicts of interest edits on Wikipedia{{anchor|Editing Wikipedia}}===
As the CNN air date of ''The Hunting Ground'' approached, media reports appeared stating that a crew member of ''The Hunting Ground'' had made edits to multiple [[Wikipedia]] pages in order to bring the content of those pages more closely in line with the film's narrative. An assistant editor and technical supervisor working for the film's production company had openly made numerous edits, spanning several months, including edits to the page for [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] and to the page for ''The Hunting Ground'' itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2015/11/20/hunting-ground-crew-member-alters-wikipedia-pages-conform-film/76102516/|last=Deen|first=Safid|title='The Hunting Ground' crew member alters Wikipedia pages to conform to film|work=[[Tallahassee Democrat]]|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = 'The Hunting Ground' crew caught editing Wikipedia to make facts conform to film|first=Ashe|last=Schow|url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-hunting-ground-crew-caught-editing-wikipedia-to-make-facts-conform-to-film/article/2576792|work=[[The Washington Examiner]]|date=November 19, 2015 |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Filmmaker Caught Trying to Change the 'Facts' of Campus Rape Case to Fit Narrative|first=Virginia|last=Kruta|url=http://www.ijreview.com/2015/11/476513-hunting-ground-wiki/|work=[[Independent Journal Review]]|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref> Such edits can violate Wikipedia's [[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia|conflict of interest]] rules.<ref>{{cite news|title=FSU president John Thrasher declines CNN invite to discuss Hunting Ground; film crew member edits Jameis Winston's Wikipedia page|first=Tom|last=D'Angelo|url=http://seminolepost.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/11/20/florida-state-president-john-thrasher-refuses-cnn-invite-to-discuss-hunting-ground-film-crew-member-edits-jameis-winstons-wikipedia-page/|work=[[Palm Beach Post]]|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref>
