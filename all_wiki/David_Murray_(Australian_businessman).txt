Murray has made public comments on attempts to mitigate climate change.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/10/18/hurdles-in-the-coalition-game-of-deterring-renewables-investment/ |title=The Coalition game of deterring renewables investment |author=Keane, Bernard |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2012 |work=Crikey }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/outgoing-future-fund-chairman-david-murray-says-carbon-tax-will-be-veryvery-bad-for-economy/story-e6frg6xf-1226314215514 |title=Outgoing Future Fund chairman David Murray says carbon tax will be 'very,very bad' for economy |author=Packham, Ben |date=30 March 2012 |work=The Australian |accessdate=8 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Govt rejects savage spray from Future Fund boss |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2012/s3467297.htm |work=The World Today |publisher=ABC News |location=Australia |date=30 March 2012 |format=transcript |accessdate=8 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/carbon-tax-worst-economic-reform-says-outgoing-future-fund-chief-20120330-1w21p.html |title=Carbon tax worst economic reform, says outgoing Future Fund chief |date=30 March 2012 |author=Ireland, Judith |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Against a backdrop of increasingly severe 2013 bush fires, he slandered an Australian group of scientists who he said lacked any "integrity" after they attributed the disasters to increased carbon emissions.
