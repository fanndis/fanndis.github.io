It surpassed 10 million monthly unique visitors in July 2014, placing it ahead of rival women-oriented sites such as ''[[Refinery29]]'', ''[[Rookie (magazine)|Rookie]]'' and ''[[xoJane]]''; it had the second greatest number of unique visitors after [[Gawker Media|Gawker]]'s ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Griffith |first=Erin |date=July 14, 2014 |title=With an audience of 11 million young women, Bustle raises $5 million more |url=http://fortune.com/2014/07/14/bustle-funding-traction/ |newspaper=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |access-date=October 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031174404/http://fortune.com/2014/07/14/bustle-funding-traction/ |archive-date=October 31, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hess |first=Amanda |date=August 21, 2014 |title=The Bro Whisperer of Bustle |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/08/bustle_one_year_later_bryan_goldberg_s_website_for_women_is_hugely_successful.html |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |access-date=October 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012140111/http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2014/08/bustle_one_year_later_bryan_goldberg_s_website_for_women_is_hugely_successful.html |archive-date=October 12, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''Bustle''{{'}}s increasing popularity among young women is partly attributed to its young writing staff.
