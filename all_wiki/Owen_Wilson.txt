After his film debut in ''[[Bottle Rocket]]'' (1996), Wilson co-wrote with [[Wes Anderson]] the script for Anderson's next two directorial films, ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' and ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', for which they garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Wilson then landed a role in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', directed by [[Ben Stiller]], an early admirer of ''Bottle Rocket''. After appearing in supporting roles in action films like ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' and the horror film ''[[The Haunting (1999 film)|The Haunting]]'', Wilson appeared in two dramatic roles: a supporting role in ''[[Permanent Midnight]]'', which starred Stiller as a drug-addicted TV writer; and the lead role (as a [[serial killer]]) in ''[[The Minus Man]]'', in which his future girlfriend, singer [[Sheryl Crow]], was a co-star.

=== 2000–2009 ===

Wilson starred in the 2000 comedy action film ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' alongside [[Jackie Chan]]. The film grossed nearly $100 million worldwide. His fame continued to rise after starring alongside [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Will Ferrell]] in the 2001 film ''[[Zoolander]]''. [[Gene Hackman]] reportedly took notice of Wilson's performance in ''Shanghai Noon'' and recommended the actor to co-star in the 2001 action film ''[[Behind Enemy Lines (2001 film)|Behind Enemy Lines]]''. Also in 2001, Wilson and Anderson collaborated on their third film, ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'', a financial and critical success.
