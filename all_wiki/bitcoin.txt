Bitcoin has been praised and criticized. Critics noted its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity used by miners, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists, including several [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureates]], have characterized it as a [[speculative bubble]].

{{Broader|Blockchain}}

The bitcoin [[blockchain]] is a public [[ledger]] that records bitcoin transactions.{{r|econbc}} It is implemented as a chain of ''blocks'', each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block{{efn|The genesis block is the block number 0. The timestamp of the block is 2009-01-03 18:15:05. This block is unlike all other blocks in that it does not have a previous block to reference.}} of the chain. A [[computer network|network]] of communicating nodes running bitcoin software maintains the blockchain.<ref name="JEP" />{{rp|215–219}} Transactions of the form ''payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z'' are [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] to this network using readily available software applications.

Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. To achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain.<ref name="f_c2">{{Cite news |last=Sparkes, Matthew |date=9 June 2014 |title=The coming digital anarchy |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10881213/The-coming-digital-anarchy.html |url-status=live |access-date=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123190900/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10881213/The-coming-digital-anarchy.html |archive-date=23 January 2015}}</ref> At varying intervals of time averaging to every 10 minutes, a new group of accepted transactions, called a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes, without requiring central oversight. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin was spent, which is needed to prevent [[double-spending]]. A conventional ledger records the transfers of actual [[Banknote|bills]] or [[promissory note]]s that exist apart from it, but the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of [[unspent outputs of transactions]].<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 5}}

===Transactions===
{{See also|Bitcoin network}}

Transactions are defined using a [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]-like scripting language.{{r|Antonopoulos2014|p=ch. 5}} Transactions consist of one or more ''inputs'' and one or more ''outputs''. When a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. To prevent double spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain.<ref name="EconOfBTC">{{Cite web |last=Joshua A. Kroll |last2=Ian C. Davey |last3=Edward W. Felten |date=11–12 June 2013 |title=The Economics of Bitcoin Mining, or Bitcoin in the Presence of Adversaries |url=http://www.econinfosec.org/archive/weis2013/papers/KrollDaveyFeltenWEIS2013.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509053819/http://www.econinfosec.org/archive/weis2013/papers/KrollDaveyFeltenWEIS2013.pdf |archive-date=9 May 2016 |access-date=26 April 2016 |website=The Twelfth Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS 2013) |quote=A transaction fee is like a tip or gratuity left for the miner.}}</ref> The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer.<ref name="EconOfBTC" /> Any input ''satoshis'' not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.<ref name="EconOfBTC" />

====Transaction fees====
Though transaction fees are optional, miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees.<ref name="EconOfBTC" /> Miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee. These fees are generally measured in ''satoshis per byte (sat/b)''. The size of transactions is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction, and the number of outputs.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 8}}

===Ownership===
[[File:Bitcoin Transaction Visual.svg|thumb|Simplified chain of ownership as illustrated in the bitcoin whitepaper.<ref name="paper" /> In practice, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output.<ref name="EconOfBTC" />]]

In the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. Creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is practically unfeasible.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 4}} Users can tell others or make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. To be able to spend their bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding [[private key]] and [[digital signature|digitally sign]] the transaction. The network verifies the signature using the [[public key]]; the private key is never revealed.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 5}}

If the private key is lost, the [[bitcoin network]] will not recognize any other evidence of ownership;<ref name="JEP" /> the coins are then unusable, and effectively lost. For example, in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth $7.5 million at the time, when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing his private key.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 November 2013 |title=Man Throws Away 7,500 Bitcoins, Now Worth $7.5 Million |work=CBS DC |url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/11/29/man-throws-away-7500-bitcoins-now-worth-7-5-million/ |url-status=live |access-date=23 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115062630/http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/11/29/man-throws-away-7500-bitcoins-now-worth-7-5-million/ |archive-date=15 January 2014}}</ref> About 20% of all bitcoins are believed to be lost.

Computing power is often bundled together or "pooled" to reduce variance in miner income. Individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment.

A wallet is more correctly defined as something that "stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings" and allows one to access (and spend) them.{{r|Antonopoulos2014|p=ch. 1, glossary}} Bitcoin uses [[public-key cryptography]], in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated.<ref name="Economist113013Pressure">{{Cite news |date=30 November 2013 |title=Bitcoin: Bitcoin under pressure |work=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21590766-virtual-currency-it-mathematically-elegant-increasingly-popular-and-highly |url-status=live |access-date=30 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130032403/http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21590766-virtual-currency-it-mathematically-elegant-increasingly-popular-and-highly |archive-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.

There are several modes which wallets can operate in. They have an inverse relationship with regards to trustlessness and computational requirements.
* ''Full clients'' verify transactions directly by downloading a full copy of the blockchain (over 150&nbsp;GB {{as of|2018|January|lc=y}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Blockchain Size |url=https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170527050820/https://blockchain.info/charts/blocks-size |archive-date=27 May 2017 |access-date=16 January 2018 |website=Blockchain.info}}</ref> They are the most secure and reliable way of using the network, as trust in external parties is not required. Full clients check the validity of mined blocks, preventing them from transacting on a chain that breaks or alters network rules.{{r|Antonopoulos2014|p=ch. 1}} Because of its size and complexity, downloading and verifying the entire blockchain is not suitable for all computing devices.
* ''Lightweight clients'' consult full clients to send and receive transactions without requiring a local copy of the entire blockchain (see ''[[Bitcoin network#Payment verification|simplified payment verification]]'' – ''SPV''). This makes lightweight clients much faster to set up and allows them to be used on low-power, low-bandwidth devices such as smartphones. When using a lightweight wallet, however, the user must trust the server to a certain degree, as it can report faulty values back to the user. Lightweight clients follow the longest blockchain and do not ensure it is valid, requiring trust in miners.<ref name="LBC">{{Cite web |last=Gervais |first=Arthur |last2=O.

Third-party internet services called ''online wallets'' offer similar functionality but may be easier to use. In this case, credentials to access funds are stored with the online wallet provider rather than on the user's hardware.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bill Barhydt |date=4 June 2014 |title=3 reasons Wall Street can't stay away from bitcoin |publisher=NBCUniversal |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101711220 |url-status=live |access-date=2 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403052101/https://www.cnbc.com/id/101711220 |archive-date=3 April 2015}}</ref> As a result, the user must have complete trust in the online wallet provider.

===Privacy===
Bitcoin is [[pseudonymous]], meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through "idioms of use" (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Simonite, Tom |date=5 September 2013 |title=Mapping the Bitcoin Economy Could Reveal Users' Identities |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518816/mapping-the-bitcoin-economy-could-reveal-users-identities/ |access-date=2 April 2014 |website=MIT Technology Review}}</ref> Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information.<ref name="5facts">{{Cite news |last=Lee, Timothy |date=21 August 2013 |title=Five surprising facts about Bitcoin |work=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/21/five-surprising-facts-about-bitcoin-2/ |url-status=live |access-date=2 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035053/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/21/five-surprising-facts-about-bitcoin-2/ |archive-date=12 October 2013}}</ref> To heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction.<ref>{{Cite web |last=McMillan, Robert |date=6 June 2013 |title=How Bitcoin lets you spy on careless companies |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/06/bitcoin-retai/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209202222/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/06/bitcoin-retail |archive-date=9 February 2014 |access-date=3 April 2020 |website=wired.co.uk |publisher=Conde Nast}}</ref>

===Fungibility===
Wallets and similar software technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of [[fungibility]]. Researchers have pointed out that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's fungibility.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ben-Sasson |first=Eli |last2=Chiesa |first2=Alessandro |last3=Garman |first3=Christina |last4=Green |first4=Matthew |last5=Miers |first5=Ian |last6=Tromer |first6=Eran |last7=Virza |first7=Madars |date=2014 |title=Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin |url=http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-oakland2014.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014012438/http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-oakland2014.pdf |archive-date=14 October 2014 |access-date=31 October 2014 |website=2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |publisher=IEEE computer society}}</ref> For example, in 2012, Mt.

===Scalability===
{{Main|Bitcoin scalability problem}}

The blocks in the blockchain were originally limited to 32 [[megabyte]]s in size. The block size limit of one [[megabyte]] was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010. Eventually the block size limit of one megabyte created problems for transaction processing, such as increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Orcutt |first=Mike |date=19 May 2015 |title=Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision |work=MIT Technology Review |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537486/leaderless-bitcoin-struggles-to-make-its-most-crucial-decision/ |url-status=live |access-date=22 June 2017 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018075515/https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537486/leaderless-bitcoin-struggles-to-make-its-most-crucial-decision/ |archive-date=18 October 2017}}</ref> [[Andreas Antonopoulos]] has stated [[Lightning Network]] is a potential scaling solution and referred to lightning as a second layer routing network.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014">{{Cite book |last=Antonopoulos, Andreas M. |title=Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Crypto-Currencies |date=April 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=978-1-4493-7404-4 |author-link=Andreas Antonopoulos}}</ref>{{rp|ch. 8}}

We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state."<ref name="BitIdeo" /> ''[[The Economist]]'' describes bitcoin as "a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks".<ref name="30082018Economist" /> Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are "something of a cult" based in "paranoid fantasies" of government power.{{r|Krugman}}

The overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions take place on a [[cryptocurrency exchange]], rather than being used in transactions with merchants.<ref name="FT08062018" /> Delays processing payments through the blockchain of about ten minutes make bitcoin use very difficult in a retail setting.

Bitcoin is "not actually usable" for retail transactions because of high costs and the inability to process [[chargeback]]s, according to Nicholas Weaver, a researcher quoted by ''Bloomberg''. High price volatility and transaction fees make paying for small retail purchases with bitcoin impractical, according to economist Kim Grauer. However, bitcoin continues to be used for large-item purchases on sites such as [[Overstock.com]], and for cross-border payments to [[freelancer]]s and other vendors.<ref name="impractical">{{Cite news |last=Kharif |first=Olga |date=1 August 2018 |title=Bitcoin's Use in Commerce Keeps Falling Even as Volatility Eases |publisher=Bloomberg |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/bitcoin-s-use-in-commerce-keeps-falling-even-as-volatility-eases |url-status=live |access-date=2 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802073219/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/bitcoin-s-use-in-commerce-keeps-falling-even-as-volatility-eases |archive-date=2 August 2018}}</ref>

==Legal status, tax and regulation==
{{Further|Legality of bitcoin by country or territory}}

Because of bitcoin's decentralized nature and its trading on online exchanges located in many countries, regulation of bitcoin has been difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a [[de facto]] ban.<ref>{{Cite web |title=China May Be Gearing Up to Ban Bitcoin |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/china-may-be-gearing-up-to-ban-bitcoin.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224721/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/china-may-be-gearing-up-to-ban-bitcoin.html |archive-date=3 October 2017 |access-date=6 October 2017 |website=pastemagazine.com |quote=The decentralized nature of bitcoin is such that it is impossible to "ban" the cryptocurrency, but if you shut down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy running on bitcoin, it's a de facto ban.}}</ref> The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them.

===Energy consumption===

Bitcoin has been criticized for the amount of electricity consumed by mining. {{as of|2015}}, ''The Economist'' estimated that even if all miners used modern facilities, the combined electricity consumption would be 166.7 megawatts (1.46 terawatt-hours per year).<ref name=ec1305 />

Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of bitcoin, including wallets, a transaction and block validation engine, and a full network node in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.}}</ref> Initially, the software was published by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] under the name "Bitcoin", and later renamed to "Bitcoin Core" to distinguish it from the [[bitcoin network|network]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 Mar 2014 |title=Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 released |url=https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0#rebranding-to-bitcoin-core |access-date=21 October 2018 |website=Bitcoin Core}}</ref> It is also known as the '''Satoshi client'''.<ref name="mastbit">{{Cite book |last=Antonopoulos |first=Andreas M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXmrBQAAQBAJ |title=Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014 |isbn=978-1491902646 |pages=31–32 |access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref>

The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Digital Currency Initiative funds some of the development of Bitcoin Core.<ref name="blad">{{Cite web |date=29 Mar 2016 |title=MIT Announces $900,000 Bitcoin Developer Fund |url=https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/mit-media-lab-bitcoin-developer-fund.html |access-date=21 October 2018 |website=Inc}}</ref> The project also maintains the cryptography library libsecp256k1.<ref name="about" />

===Features===
Bitcoin Core includes a transaction verification engine and connects to the bitcoin network as a full [[node (networking)|node]].<ref name="mastbit" /> Moreover, a [[cryptocurrency wallet]], which can be used to transfer funds, is included by default.<ref name="about">{{Cite web |title=About |url=https://bitcoincore.org/en/about/ |access-date=21 October 2018 |website=Bitcoin Core}}</ref>  The wallet allows for the sending and receiving of bitcoins. It does not facilitate the buying or selling of bitcoin. It allows users to generate [[QR codes]] to receive payment.

The software validates the entire [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]], which includes all bitcoin transactions ever. This [[distributed ledger]] which has reached more than 235 gigabytes in size as of Jan 2019, must be downloaded or synchronized before full participation of the client may occur.<ref name="mastbit" /> Although the complete blockchain is not needed all at once since it is possible to run in pruning mode. A [[Command-line interface|command line]]-based [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]] with a [[JSON-RPC]] interface, bitcoind, is bundled with Bitcoin Core. It also provides access to testnet, a global testing environment that imitates the bitcoin main network using an alternative blockchain where valueless "test bitcoins" are used. Regtest or Regression Test Mode creates a private blockchain which is used as a local testing environment.<ref name="bde">{{Cite web |title=Bitcoin Developer Examples |url=https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-examples#testing-applications |access-date=21 Oct 2018 |publisher=Bitcoin}}</ref> Finally, bitcoin-cli, a simple program which allows users to send [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] commands to bitcoind, is also included.

Checkpoints which have been hard coded into the client are used only to prevent Denial of Service attacks against nodes which are initially syncing the chain. For this reason the checkpoints included are only as of several years ago.<ref name="check">{{Cite web |title=checkpoints.cpp |url=https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/checkpoints.cpp |access-date=13 November 2016 |website=Repository source code |publisher=GitHub, Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=bitcoin/chainparams.cpp |url=https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp |access-date=21 October 2018 |website=GitHub}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} A one megabyte block size limit was added in 2010 by Satoshi Nakamoto. This limited the maximum network capacity to about three transactions per second.<ref name="leadbit">{{Cite news |last=Mike Orcutt |date=19 May 2015 |title=Leaderless Bitcoin Struggles to Make Its Most Crucial Decision |work=MIT Technology Review |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/537486/leaderless-bitcoin-struggles-to-make-its-most-crucial-decision/ |access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> Since then, network capacity has been improved incrementally both through block size increases and improved wallet behavior. A network alert system was included by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way of informing users of important news regarding bitcoin.<ref name="asr">{{Cite web |date=1 November 2016 |title=Alert System Retirement |url=https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2016-11-01-alert-retirement |access-date=16 November 2016 |publisher=Bitcoin Project}}</ref> In November 2016 it was retired. It had become obsolete as news on bitcoin is now widely disseminated.

Bitcoin Core includes a scripting language inspired by [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that can define transactions and specify parameters.<ref name="mpapi">{{Cite web |last=Antonopoulos |first=Andreas |date=29 May 2013 |title=Bitcoin is a money platform with many APIs |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/bitcoin-is-a-money-platform-with-many-apis.html#more-57340 |access-date=19 November 2016 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly}}</ref> ScriptPubKey is used to "lock" transactions based on a set of future conditions. scriptSig is used to meet these conditions or "unlock" a transaction. [[Instruction set|Operations]] on the data are performed by various OP_Codes. Two [[stack (abstract data type)|stacks]] are used - main and alt. [[Control flow#Loops|Looping]] is forbidden.

Bitcoin Core uses [[OpenTimestamps]] to timestamp merge commits.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bitcoin Core devtools README - Create and verify timestamps of merge commits |url=https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ebd786b72a2a15143d7ef4ea2229fef121bd8f12/contrib/devtools/README.md#create-and-verify-timestamps-of-merge-commits |access-date=May 5, 2018 |website=GitHub}}</ref>

===Development===
The original creator of the bitcoin client has described their approach to the software's authorship as it being written first to prove to themselves that the concept of purely peer-to-peer electronic cash was valid and that a paper with solutions could be written. The lead developer is Wladimir J. van der Laan, who took over the role on 8 April 2014.<ref name="hunt" /> [[Gavin Andresen]] was the former lead maintainer for the software client. Andresen left the role of lead developer for bitcoin to work on the strategic development of its technology.<ref name="hunt">{{Cite book |last=Preukschat |first=Alex |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=438FCwAAQBAJ |title=Bitcoin: The Hunt of Satoshi Nakamoto |last2=Josep Busquet |publisher=Europe Comics |year=2015 |isbn=9791032800201 |page=87 |access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Bitcoin Core in 2015 was central to a dispute with [[Bitcoin XT]], a competing client that sought to increase the blocksize.<ref name="NewYorker">{{Cite news |last=Maria Bustillos |date=25 August 2015 |title=Inside the Fight Over Bitcoin's Future |work=New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/inside-the-fight-over-bitcoins-future |access-date=29 June 2020}}</ref> Over a dozen different companies and industry groups fund the development of Bitcoin Core.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
In [[Charles Stross]]' 2013 science fiction novel, ''[[Neptune's Brood]]'', the universal [[Interstellar travel|interstellar]] payment system is known as "bitcoin" and operates using cryptography.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stross |first=Charles |url=https://archive.org/details/neptunesbrood0000stro |title=Neptune's Brood |date=2013 |publisher=Penguin Group USA |isbn=978-0-425-25677-0 |edition=First |location=New York |quote=It's theft-proof too – for each bitcoin is cryptographically signed by the mind of its owner.}}</ref> Stross later blogged that the reference was intentional, saying "I wrote Neptune's Brood in 2011. Bitcoin was obscure back then, and I figured had just enough name recognition to be a useful term for an interstellar currency: it'd clue people in that it was a networked digital currency."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Crib Sheet: Neptune's Brood – Charlie's Diary |url=http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/09/crib-sheet-neptunes-brood.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614175136/http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/09/crib-sheet-neptunes-brood.html |archive-date=14 June 2017 |access-date=5 December 2017 |website=www.antipope.org |quote=I wrote Neptune's Brood in 2011.
