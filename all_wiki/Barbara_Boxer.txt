Boxer, then a Marin County supervisor, was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1982, succeeding [[John L. Burton|John Burton]]. Her slogan was "Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn." In the House, she represented {{ushr|CA|6}} (Marin and Sonoma Counties) for five terms.  She narrowly won her first election with 52 percent of the vote, but easily won reelection four times, never dropping below 67 percent of the vote.

Boxer was a member of the original [[United States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families|Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families]]<ref name="Hearing">[http://files/eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED245830.pdf Children, youth, and families: Beginning the assessment.

In 1992, Boxer was implicated in the [[House banking scandal]], which revealed that more than 450 congressional representatives and aides, herself included, wrote overdraft checks covered by overdraft protection by the House Bank. In response, she issued a statement saying "in painful retrospect, I clearly should have paid more attention to my account" and wrote a $15 check to the Deficit Reduction Fund for each of her 87 overdrafts.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/16/us/the-house-bank-house-bank-overdrafts-add-to-voters-outrage.html?pagewanted=all |title=The House Bank; House Bank Overdrafts Add to Voters' Outrage – |work=The New York Times |date=March 16, 1992 |access-date=March 6, 2012 |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz}}</ref>

===Elections===
In 1992 four-term incumbent Democratic Senator [[Alan Cranston]] retired, creating an [[1992 United States Senate election in California|open seat contest]].

In the general election, Boxer defeated Republican [[Bruce Herschensohn]], a conservative television political commentator from Los Angeles, by 4.9%.

Boxer voted against [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]]'s nomination for [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations]] in the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and [[filibuster]]ed him on the Senate floor. Because of the strong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opposition, Bolton could not obtain Senate approval. However, President Bush bypassed the Senate by employing the constitutional right of [[recess appointment]], only the second time such an appointment has been used for a [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|United States ambassador to the United Nations]] since the UN's founding in 1945. Recess appointments themselves have been used numerous times by various presidents.

===Economy===
Senators Boxer and [[John Ensign]] (R-NV) are the authors of the Invest in the USA Act. This legislation, which was signed into law in October 2004 as a small part of the more comprehensive American Jobs Creation Act, is intended to encourage American companies to bring overseas profits back to the United States, to create jobs in the U.S., and stimulate domestic economic growth.

In March 2004, Boxer offered an amendment to the Federal budget to create a $24 billion jobs reserve fund. The amendment would set aside funds for a variety of investments to improve the economy and create jobs by establishing a manufacturing jobs tax credit for companies that create jobs in the United States, expanding investment in science research and development, providing a tax credit to small businesses to pay for health insurance for their employees, and expanding trade adjustment assistance to help those who lose their jobs because of [[foreign trade]]. The Boxer amendment would also end the tax break that companies receive after moving plants overseas.

On October 1, 2008, Boxer voted for [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation & Records Home > Votes > Roll Call Vote |publisher=Senate.gov |access-date=May 25, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528063758/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00213| archive-date= May 28, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

===Criticizing Condoleezza Rice's judgment===
Boxer criticized [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]]'s judgment in relation to the [[war in Iraq]]: "I personally believe&nbsp;– this is my personal view&nbsp;– that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 22, 2005.</ref>

In January 2007, Boxer was in the news for comments she made when responding to [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq]]. "Who pays the price?" Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. "I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling."<ref>Barrett, Ted. ''GOP senator: Bush plan could match Vietnam blunder'' [http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/11/iraq.congress/index.html CNN, January 11, 2007]</ref>

===Television appearances===
Boxer has made cameo appearances as herself in several television shows, including ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' (1994),<ref name="imdb" /> ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' (2002)<ref name="imdb" /> and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' (2007),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/tv_review.asp?ID=55|title=Curb Your Enthusiasm |author=Len Sousa |publisher=Slant magazine |date=September 22, 2007|access-date=November 4, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011025919/http://slantmagazine.com/tv/tv_review.asp?ID=55| archive-date= October 11, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> as well as a cameo (as herself) in the 2000 film ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0101526/|publisher=IMDB |title=Barbara Boxer|access-date=November 4, 2007}}</ref> On November 2, 2005, she made an appearance on ''[[The Daily Show|The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' to discuss her new novel ''A Time To Run''.

In September 2012, it was reported that Boxer and Republican Senator [[Olympia Snowe]] would appear together in an [[NBC]] sitcom.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Sen-Snowe-ready-to-make-sitcom-debut-3870532.php|title=News report | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> On September 20, 2012, she and Senator Snowe appeared in the [[Ms. Knope Goes to Washington|fifth season premiere]] of ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''. Boxer later returned to ''Parks and Recreation'' alongside several other U.S. senators in early 2015 in the [[Parks and Recreation (season 7)|seventh season]] episode "Ms. Ludgate-Dwyer Goes to Washington."

In November 2016, Boxer appeared in an episode of ''[[List of Chelsea episodes|Chelsea]]'', presented by [[Chelsea Handler]], entitled "Do Not Despair About Our Country", filmed shortly after the result of the [[2016 US presidential election]] was known, during which Handler wept about the result.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxT4A0NLg-E|title=Chelsea Handler Cries Talking About Hillary Clinton's Election Loss|last=World News|date=November 10, 2016|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/chelsea-handler-breaks-down-netflix-donald-trump-victory-1201915108/|title=Chelsea Handler Breaks Down While Discussing Donald Trump Victory|first=Lawrence|last=Yee|date=November 10, 2016}}</ref>
