'''''The Conscience of a Conservative''''' is a 1960 book published under the name of [[Arizona]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] who was the 1964 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate. It revived the [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] movement, made Goldwater a political star, and has influenced countless conservatives in the United States, helping to lay the foundation for the [[Reagan Revolution]] of the 1980s.<ref name = Frohnen179-180>{{cite book | last = Frohnen | first = Bruce | title = American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia | publisher = Intercollegiate Studies Institute | location = Wilmington | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-932236-43-0 | pages = 179â€“80 }}</ref>

==Content==
The 123-page book covers such topics as education, [[labor unions]] and policies, [[civil rights]], [[agricultural policy]] and [[farm subsidies]], [[social welfare]] programs, and [[income tax]]ation. The book is considered to be a significant statement of politically and economically [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] ideas which were to gain influence during the following decades.<ref name="Frohnen179-180"/>
