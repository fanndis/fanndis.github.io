== History ==
[[John Wood (Room to Read)|John Wood]], founder and board co-chair, launched Room to Read in 1999 after a trek through Nepal where he visited several local schools. He was amazed by the warmth and enthusiasm of the students and teachers, but saddened by the shocking lack of resources. Driven to help, John quit his senior executive position with [[Microsoft]] and built a global team to work with rural villages to build sustainable solutions to their education challenges.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/executive/leadership/john-wood-i-had-to-get-out-of-microsoft-and-make-education-for-the-worlds-poorest-children-my-job|title=John Wood: 'I had to get out of Microsoft and make education for the world’s poorest children my job'|work=Financial Post|access-date=2017-03-25|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite podcast

Beginning in Nepal, John and his Nepali Co-Founder, Dinesh Shrestha, started by working with rural communities to build schools (School Room) and establish libraries (Reading Room). John and Dinesh quickly recognized the need to expand the scope of work beyond libraries, and wanted to address the fact that many girls in the developing world are overlooked in the educational system due to cultural bias. To that end, in 2000, Room to Read began the Girls' Education program, which targets young girls and provides a long-term commitment to their education.<ref name=":0" />

In 2001, co-founder and CEO Erin Keown Ganju spearheaded Room to Read's expansion into [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=John|title=Leaving Microsoft to Change the World|date=2006|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=9780061121074|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leavingmicrosoft00wo/page/119 119]–125|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/leavingmicrosoft00wo}}</ref> Since then, Room to Read's operations have expanded to include Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zambia. In 2010, Room to Read celebrated its "Year of Tens," marking its ten-year anniversary with the opening of its 10,000th library in Nepal, along with the construction of its 1,000th school and support of its 10,000th girl through the Girls' Education Program.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Scher|first1=Eddie|title=Financial Times Features Room To Read and ‘Year of Tens’|url=http://www.skollfoundation.org/financial-times-features-room-to-read-and-%E2%80%98year-of-tens%E2%80%99/|website=[[Skoll Foundation]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119121207/http://www.skollfoundation.org/financial-times-features-room-to-read-and-%E2%80%98year-of-tens%E2%80%99/|archivedate=19 November 2010|date=12 November 2010}}</ref>
