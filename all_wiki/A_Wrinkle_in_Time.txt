L'Engle modeled the Murry family on her own. Scholar Bernice E.

== Background ==

Raised in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], author [[Madeleine L'Engle]] began writing at a young age.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/books/07cnd-lengle.html|title=Madeleine L'Engle, Writer of Children's Classics, Is Dead at 88|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2007-09-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> After graduating from boarding school in Switzerland, she attended [[Smith College]], where she earned a degree in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumnae.smith.edu/spotlight/14-things-to-know-about-madeleine-lengles-life-and-legacy/|title=14 Things to Know About Madeleine L'Engle's Life and Legacy « - Smith college Office of Alumnae Relations Smith College Office of Alumnae Relations|website=alumnae.smith.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> In addition to writing, L'Engle also gained experience as an actor and playwright.<ref name=":4" /> At age forty, she nearly abandoned her career as a novelist, but continued to write after her publication of ''[[Meet the Austins]]''.<ref name=":4" />

[[Madeleine L'Engle|L'Engle]] wrote ''A Wrinkle in Time'' between 1959 and 1960.<ref name="anniversary">{{cite book|title=A Wrinkle in Time, 25th Anniversary Collectors' Edition|last=L'Engle|first=Madeleine|date=1987|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus & Giroux]]|edition=Limited|location=ikNew York|pages=viii–ix|author-link=Madeleine L'Engle}}</ref> In her memoir, ''[[A Circle of Quiet]]'' (1972), L'Engle explains that the book was conceived "during a time of transition." <ref>{{cite book|title=A Circle of Quiet|author=L'Engle, Madeleine|isbn=0-374-12374-8|date=January 1971}}</ref> After years of living in rural [[Goshen, Connecticut]] where they ran a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country. L'Engle writes that "we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, ''Mrs&nbsp;Whatsit''. ''Mrs&nbsp;Who''. ''Mrs&nbsp;Which''."<ref name="Circle">{{cite book|title=''A Circle of Quiet''|last=L'Engle|first=Madeleine|date=1972|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus & Giroux]]|isbn=0-374-12374-8|location=New York|pages=5–6, 21, 66, 217–218|author-link=Madeleine L'Engle|title-link=A Circle of Quiet}}</ref> This was in the spring of 1959. When asked for more information in an interview with Horn Book magazine in 1983, L'Engle responded "I cannot possibly tell you how I came to write it. It was simply a book I had to write. I had no choice. It was only after it was written that I realized what some of it meant." L'Engle has also described the novel as her "psalm of praise to life, [her] stand for life against death."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-i-learned-from-madel_b_63612|title=What I Learned from Madeleine L'Engle|last=Melcher|first=Michael|date=2007-09-08|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>

Additionally, L'Engle drew upon her interest in science. The novel includes references to Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] and Planck's [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].<ref name=":4" />

''A Wrinkle in Time'' is the first novel in the [[Time Quintet]], a series of five young adult novels written by [[Madeleine L'Engle]].<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/series/|title=Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> Later books include ''[[A Wind in the Door]]'', ''[[A Swiftly Tilting Planet]]'', ''[[Many Waters]]'', and ''[[An Acceptable Time]]''.<ref name=":5" /> The series follows the adventures of Meg Murry, her youngest brother Charles Wallace Murry, their friend Calvin O'Keefe, and her twin siblings Sandy and Dennys Murry.<ref name=":5" /> Throughout the series, the friends band together to travel through space and time as they attempt to save the world from the grasps of evil.<ref name=":5" />

==Publication history==
Upon completion in 1960, the novel was rejected by at least 26&nbsp;publishers, because it was, in L'Engle's words, "too different," and "because it deals overtly with the [[problem of evil]], and it was really difficult for children, and was it a children's or an adults' book, anyhow?"<ref name="sqfish"/><ref name="Circle"/>

In "A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle" on the Random House website, L'Engle offers another possible reason for the rejections: "''A Wrinkle in Time'' had a female protagonist in a science fiction book," which at the time was uncommon.<ref name="message" /> After trying "forty-odd" publishers (L'Engle later said "twenty-six rejections"), L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her. Then at Christmas, L'Engle threw a tea party for her mother. One of the guests happened to know [[John C. Farrar]] of [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], and he insisted that L'Engle should meet with him.<ref name="message" /> Although the publisher did not, at the time, publish a line of children's books, Farrar met L'Engle, liked the novel, and ultimately published it under the Ariel imprint.<ref name="message">{{cite web| last = L'Engle | first = Madeleine | author-link = Madeleine L'Engle| title = A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle| work = Teachers @ Random: A Wrinkle in Time| publisher = Random House, Inc. | date = 2004 |url = http://www.randomhouse.com/audio/listeninglibrary/catalog/author.php?authorid=16446| access-date =April 19, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1963, the book won the [[Newbery Medal]], an annual award given by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American children's literature. The book has been continuously in print since its first publication. The hardback edition is still published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. The original blue dust jacket by [[Ellen Raskin]] was replaced with new art by [[Leo and Diane Dillon]], with the publication of ''[[A Swiftly Tilting Planet]]'' in 1978. The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors' edition (limited to 500 signed and numbered copies), at least two book club editions (one hardback, one [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Book Services]] paperback), as a [[Paperback#Trade|trade paperback]] under the [[Dell Yearling]] imprint, and as a [[mass market paperback]] under the [[Dell Laurel-Leaf]] imprint. The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since its first publication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007, along with the rest of the Time Quintet. This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L'Engle as well as a transcription of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech.<ref name="square">{{cite web|title = It's Time to Read A Wrinkle in Time|publisher = Square Fish Books |date = 2007| url = http://www.awrinkleintime.net/| access-date =March 1, 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303103732/http://www.awrinkleintime.net/| archive-date= March 3, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Plot summary==
One night, thirteen-year-old [[Meg Murry]] meets an eccentric new neighbor, Mrs. Whatsit, who refers to something called a [[tesseract]]. She later finds out it is a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance. The following day, Meg, her [[Child prodigy|child genius]] brother [[Charles Wallace Murry|Charles]], and fellow schoolmate [[Calvin O'Keefe|Calvin]] visit Mrs. Whatsit's home, where the equally strange Mrs. Who and the unseen voice of Mrs. Which promise to help Meg find and rescue her father..

Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract, a fifth-dimensional phenomenon explained as folding the fabric of space and time. Their first stop is the planet Uriel, a Utopian world filled with [[Centaur]]-like beings who live in a state of light and love. The Mrs. Ws reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing, which is essentially the personification of evil. The children are taken to visit the Happy Medium, a woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness, although great religious figures, philosophers, scientists, and artists have been fighting against it. Mrs. Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self-sacrifice to fight the darkness.

The children travel to the dark planet of Camazotz, which has succumbed to the Black Thing and where Meg's father is trapped because he would not succumb to the group mind that causes inhabitants to behave in a mechanical way. In order to find their father, Charles Wallace deliberately allows himself to be hypnotized. He takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Meg's father, Alexander, is being held prisoner. Charles Wallace then takes them to It, the evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities that controls the planet. Using special powers from Mrs. Who's glasses, Alexander tessers Calvin, Meg, and himself to the planet Ixchel before IT can control them all. Charles Wallace is left behind, still under the influence of IT and Meg is paralyzed from injuries sustained during the trip. An inhabitant of the planet with featureless faces, tentacles and four arms proves to be both wise and gentle and cures Meg's paralysis.

The trio of Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which arrive and charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT. Arriving at the building where IT resides, they find Charles Wallace under IT's influence. Inspired by hints from the Mrs. Ws, Meg focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. They all then tesser back to Earth and the Mrs. Ws leave.

== Analysis ==

=== Religious analysis ===
The novel is highly spiritualized, with notable influences of divine intervention and prominent undertones of religious messages.<ref name=":1">Humankind - Religion - Spirituality. (1988). In J. B. Simpson, ''Simpson's contemporary quotations''. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. Retrieved from https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/simpsons/humankind_religion_spirituality/0</ref> According to scholar James Beasley Simpson, the overwhelming love and desire for light within the novel is directly representative of a Christian love for God and Jesus Christ.<ref name=":1" /> Furthermore, the children encounter spiritual intervention, signaling God's presence in the ordinary, as well as the extendibility of God's power and love.<ref name=":0" /> Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer [[C. S. Lewis]]. She was herself the official writer-in-residence at New York City's Episcopal [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York|Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], which is known for its prominent position in the liberal wing of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/repaired-after-fire-cathedral-reopens | work=The New York Times | title=Repaired After Fire, Cathedral Reopens | first=Sewell | last =Chan | date=November 30, 2008}}</ref> L'Engle's liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from more conservative Christians, especially with respect to certain elements of ''A Wrinkle in Time''.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/1998/mayjun/8b3034.html | first = Donald | last = Hettinga | title = A Wrinkle in Faith: The unique spiritual pilgrimage of Madeleine L'Engle | journal = Books & Culture: A Christian Review | publisher = Christianity today | date = 1998}}</ref>

L'Engle utilizes numerous religious references and allusions in the naming of locations within the novel. The name Camazotz refers to [[Camazotz|a Mayan bat god]], one of L'Engle's many mythological allusions in her nomenclature.<ref name="Stott">{{Cite journal|last=Stott|first=Jon|date=Fall 1977|title=Midsummer Night's Dreams: Fantasy and Self-Realization in Children's Fiction|journal=The Lion and the Unicorn|volume=1|issue=2|pages=25–39|doi=10.1353/uni.0.0401|s2cid=145776252}}; cited in Hettinga, pp. 27, 30.</ref> The name Ixchel refers to [[Ixchel|a Mayan jaguar goddess of medicine]].<ref name="Stott" /> Uriel is a planet with extremely tall mountains, an allusion to the [[Archangel]] [[Uriel]]. It is inhabited by creatures that resemble winged [[centaur]]s. It is "the third planet of the Star Malak (meaning 'angel' in Hebrew) in the [[Spiral galaxy|spiral nebula]] [[Pinwheel galaxy|Messier 101]]", which would place it at roughly 21&nbsp;million [[light-year]]s from Earth.<ref name="hettangel" /> The site of Mrs&nbsp;Whatsit's temporary transformation into one of these winged creatures, it is the place where "the guardian angels show the questers a vision of the universe that is obscured on earth." <ref name="hettangel">Hettinga, p. 26</ref> The three women are described as ancient star-beings who act as guardian [[angels]].<ref name="hettangel"/>

The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one. Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the [[Gospel of John]], which is quoted within the book.<ref name=":3" /> When the Mrs Ws reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against darkness, they ask the children to name some figures on Earth, a partially dark planet, who fight the darkness. They name [[Jesus]] and, later in the discussion, [[Buddha]] is named as well.

Nevertheless, religious journalist Sarah Pulliam Bailey doubts whether the novel contains religious undertones.<ref name=":2" /> Bailey explains that many readers believe the novel promotes witchcraft, as opposed to alluding to Christian spirituality.<ref name=":2" /> Bailey states that conservative Christians take offense, due to the novel's potential relativistic qualities, suggesting the various interpretations of religious allusions signals anti-Christian sentiments.<ref name=":2" /> However, in her personal journal referencing ''A Wrinkle in Time'', L'Engle confirms the religious content within the novel: "If I've ever written a book that says what I feel about God and the universe, this is it."<ref name=":2" />

=== Conformity ===
Further, the themes of conformity and the status quo are present. IT is a powerful dominant group that manipulates the planet of Camazotz into conformity. Even Charles Wallace falls prey and is hence persuaded to conform. It is thanks to Meg that she and her family are able to break from conformity.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/94642884/Classics-of-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Literature |last= Fulton |first= Jean C |chapter= A Wrinkle in Time |title= Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature |volume= 2 |editor-link= Fiona Kelleghan |editor-first= Fiona |editor-last= Kelleghan |location= Pasadena, [[California|CA]] |publisher= Salem Press |date= 2002 |pages= 597–98 |quote= ...the importance of both individual initiative and family interaction is a thematic thread. L'Engle made both the Murry adults highly talented, both intellectually and scientifically. This was atypical of fiction published in the 1950s, when the book was written. Female characters rarely were featured as intellectuals or scientists. L'Engle has been praised for this departure as well as for her creation of strong female characters. Critics even suggested that in making Meg the protagonist in ''A Wrinkle in Time'', L'Engle opened the door for the many female protagonists who have appeared in more recent fantasy and science fiction. |access-date= December 26, 2012 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140103122911/http://www.scribd.com/doc/94642884/Classics-of-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Literature |archive-date= January 3, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> According to the author's granddaughter Charlotte Jones Voiklis, the story was not a simple allegory of communism; in a three-page passage that was cut before publication, the process of domination and conformity is said to be an outcome of dictatorship under totalitarian regimes and by an excessive desire of security under democratic countries.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://graphics.wsj.com/documents/doc-cloud-embedder/?sidebar=1#1881486-a-wrinkle-in-time-excerpt|title = ''A wrinkle in time'' excerpt|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-wrinkle-in-time-1429219305/|title = A New 'Wrinkle in Time'|last = Maloney|first = Jennifer|date = April 16, 2015|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Scholar Jean Fulton writes: <blockquote>"L'Engle's fiction for young readers is considered important partly because she was among the first to focus directly on the deep, delicate issues that young people must face, such as death, social conformity, and truth. L'Engle's work always is uplifting because she is able to look at the surface values of life from a perspective of wholeness, both joy and pain, transcending each to uncover the absolute nature of human experience that they share."<ref name="Fulton">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/94642884/Classics-of-Science-Fiction-and-Fantasy-Literature|title=Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature|last=Fulton|first=Jean C.|date=2002|publisher=Salem Press|editor=Fiona Kelleghan|editor-link=Fiona Kelleghan|volume=2|location=Pasadena, Calif.|page=596|chapter=A Wrinkle in Time|quote=Madeleine L'Engle's view of the universe was changed by the work of such well-known physicists as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Max Planck]].

==== Conformity within Camazotz ====
Camazotz is a planet of extreme, enforced conformity, ruled by a disembodied brain called IT. Camazotz is similar to Earth, with familiar trees such as birches, pines, and maples, an ordinary hill on which the children arrive, and a town with smokestacks, which "might have been one of any number of familiar towns". The horror of the place arises from its ordinary appearance, endlessly duplicated. The houses are "all exactly alike, small square boxes painted gray", which, according to author Donald Hettinga, signals a comparison to "the burgeoning American suburbia", such as the post-war housing developments of [[Levittown, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Hettinga">{{cite book|title=Presenting Madeleine L'Engle|last=Hettinga|first=Donald R.|date=1993|publisher=[[Twayne Publishers]]|isbn=0-8057-8222-2|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/presentingmadele00dona/page/27 27]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/presentingmadele00dona/page/27}}</ref> The people who live in the houses are similarly described as "mother figures" who "all gave the appearance of being the same".

The biennial, international [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] for children's writing was inaugurated in 1956, recognizing a single book published during the preceding two years. Since the first three renditions—that is, from 1962—it has recognized a living author for a lasting contribution, considering his or her complete works. Nevertheless, a "Runner-Up List" with single book titles was published from 1960 to 1964. [Pages 15–16. This source does not identify those runners-up or report their number.]<br>
