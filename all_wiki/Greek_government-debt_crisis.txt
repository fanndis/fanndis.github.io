{{Greek economic crisis}}

The '''Greek government-debt crisis''' was the [[sovereign debt crisis]] faced by [[Greece]] in the aftermath of the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Widely known in the country as '''The Crisis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Η Κρίση), it reached the populace as a series of sudden reforms and [[austerity]] measures that led to impoverishment and loss of income and property, as well as a small-scale [[humanitarian crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iefimerida.gr/news/218032/bbc-i-ellada-vionei-anthropistiki-krisi-ennea-apokalyptika-grafimata-eikones|title=BBC: Η Ελλάδα βιώνει ανθρωπιστική κρίση -Εννέα αποκαλυπτικά γραφήματα [εικόνες]|language=Greek|trans-title=Greece is experiencing a humanitarian crisis - New revealing charts [images] |website=iefimerida.gr|date=20 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naftemporiki.gr/finance/story/928463/i-ellada-kai-i-anthropistiki-krisi|title=Η Ελλάδα και η ανθρωπιστική κρίση|language=Greek|trans-title=Greece and the humanitarian crisis|website=Naftemporiki.gr|last=Kostoulas|first=Vasilis|date=26 March 2015}}</ref> In all, the Greek economy suffered the longest recession of any advanced capitalist economy to date, overtaking the US [[Great Depression]].

Greece, like other European nations, had faced [[List of sovereign debt crises|debt crises in the 19th century]], as well as a similar crisis in 1932 during the [[Great Depression]]. In general, however, during the 20th century it enjoyed one of the highest GDP growth rates in the world<ref name="Angus Maddison">[[Angus Maddison]], [http://www.ggdc.net/MADDISON/Monitoring.shtml "Monitoring the World Economy 1820–1992"], OECD (1995)</ref> (for a quarter century – early 1950s to mid 1970s – [[Greek economic miracle|second in the world after Japan]]). Average Greek government debt-to-GDP for the entire century before the crisis (1909–2008) was lower than that for the UK, Canada or France<ref name="Debt Past"/><ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/> (see table), while for the 30-year period until its entrance into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1981,<ref name=accgr>{{cite web|first1= Etienne |last1=Deschamps |first2= Christian |last2= Lekl|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_accession_of_greece-en-61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515.html|title=The accession of Greece|publisher=Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe, Universite de Luxembourg|date = 2016}}</ref> the Greek government debt-to-GDP ratio averaged only 19.8%.<ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/>
Indeed, accession to the EEC (and later the [[European Union]]) was predicated on keeping the debt-to-GDP well below the 60% level; and certain members watched this figure closely.<ref name="acii10">{{cite news |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Anis |last2=Islam |first2=Iyanatul |title=Is there an optimal debt-to-GDP ratio? |url=https://voxeu.org/debates/commentaries/there-optimal-debt-gdp-ratio |publisher=Centre for Economic Policy Research |date=9 November 2010}}</ref>

Between 1981 and 1993 it steadily rose, surpassing the average of what is today the Eurozone in the mid-1980s. For the next 15 years, from 1993 to 2007 (i.e. before the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]]), Greece's government debt-to-GDP ratio remained roughly unchanged (the value was not affected by the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]]), averaging 102%<ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/><ref name="Debt 1980">{{cite news |url=http://www.economicsinpictures.com/2011/09/greek-debtgdp-only-22-in-1980.html|title= Greek Debt/GDP: Only 22% In 1980|work=Economics in Pictures|first=Reinoud|last=Linschoten |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>
– a value lower than that for Italy (107%) and Belgium (110%) during the same 15-year period,<ref name="Historical Debt IMF"/> and comparable to that for the U.S. or the OECD average in 2017.<ref name="OECD Debt">{{cite news |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp|title= Debt-To-GDP Ratio|work= Investopedia (2018)|first=Will|last=Kenton|accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

During the latter period, the country's annual budget deficit usually exceeded 3% of GDP, but its effect on the debt-to GDP ratio was counterbalanced by high GDP growth rates.<ref name="Debt Past"/> The debt-to GDP values for 2006 and 2007 (about 105%) were established after [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|audits]] resulted in corrections according to Eurostat methodology, of up to 10 percentage points for the particular years (as well as similar corrections for the years 2008 and 2009). These corrections, although altering the debt level by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|a maximum of about 10%]], resulted in a popular notion that "Greece was previously hiding its debt".

=== Evolutions after birth of Euro currency ===
The 2001 introduction of the euro reduced trade costs between Eurozone countries, increasing overall trade volume. Labour costs increased more (from a lower base) in peripheral countries such as Greece relative to core countries such as Germany without compensating rise in productivity, eroding Greece's competitive edge. As a result, Greece's [[Current account (balance of payments)|current account (trade) deficit]] rose significantly.<ref name=FRBSFGalina>{{cite web|url=http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2013/january/balance-payments-europe-periphery/|title=Balance of Payments in the European Periphery|date=14 January 2013|first=Galina|last=Hale|work=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>

A trade deficit means that a country is consuming more than it produces, which requires borrowing/direct investment from other countries.<ref name=FRBSFGalina /> Both the Greek [[trade deficit]] and [[budget deficit]] rose from below 5% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 1999 to peak around 15% of GDP in the 2008–2009 periods.<ref name="research.stlouisfed.org">{{cite web|url=https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=244979&updated=4652|title=FRED Graph|work=stlouisfed.org|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref> One driver of the investment inflow was Greece's membership in the EU and the Eurozone. Greece was perceived as a higher [[credit risk]] alone than it was as a member of the Eurozone, which implied that investors felt the EU would bring discipline to its finances and support Greece in the event of problems.<ref name="vox.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8871509/greece-charts|title=Greece's debt crisis explained in charts and maps|first=Ezra|last=Klein|work=Vox|date=July 2015}}</ref>

As the [[Great Recession]] spread to Europe, the amount of funds lent from the European [[core countries]] (e.g. Germany) to the peripheral countries such as Greece began to decline. Reports in 2009 of Greek fiscal mismanagement and deception increased [[Interest expense|borrowing costs]]; the combination meant Greece could no longer borrow to finance its [[trade deficit|trade]] and [[budget deficit]]s at an affordable cost.<ref name=FRBSFGalina />

A country facing a '[[Sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]]' in private investment and a high (local currency) [[government debt|debt]] load typically allows its currency to [[currency depreciation|depreciate]] to encourage investment and to pay back the debt in devalued currency. This was not possible while Greece remained in the Euro.<ref name=FRBSFGalina />  "However, the sudden stop has not prompted the European periphery countries to move toward devaluation by abandoning the euro, in part because capital transfers from euro-area partners have allowed them to finance current account deficits".<ref name=FRBSFGalina /> In addition, to become more competitive, Greek wages fell nearly 20% from mid-2010 to 2014,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} a form of [[deflation]]. This significantly reduced income and GDP, resulting in a severe [[economic recession|recession]], decline in tax receipts and a significant rise in the [[debt ratio|debt-to-GDP ratio]]. Unemployment reached nearly 25%, from below 10% in 2003. Significant government spending cuts helped the Greek government return to a primary [[budget surplus]] by 2014 (collecting more [[government revenue|revenue]] than it paid out, excluding [[compound interest|interest]]).<ref name=AKPrimer>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf |first=Anil |last=Kashyap |title=A Primer on the Greek Crisis |date=29 June 2015|accessdate=29 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701173825/https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/anil.kashyap/research/papers/A-Primer-on-the-Greek-Crisis_june29.pdf|archive-date=1 July 2015}}</ref>

== Causes ==
=== External factors ===

The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the [[Great Recession]], which lead the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP.<ref name="Debt Past"/> In the case of Greece, the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections, was revealed that it had been allowed to reach 10.2%  and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively<ref name="Deficit Eurostat">{{cite news |url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=teina200|title= Eurostat (budget deficit data)|work= Eurostat |accessdate=2 September 2020}}</ref>) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (which, until then, was relatively stable for several years, at just above 100% of GDP- as calculated after all corrections).<ref name="Debt Past"/> Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009.<ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat"/> In contrast, Italy was able (despite the crisis) to keep its 2009 budget deficit at 5.1% of GDP,<ref name="Deficit Eurostat"/> which was crucial, given that it had a public debt to GDP ratio comparable to Greece's.<ref name="Debt 2009 2017 Eurostat"/> 
In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, Greece had essentially no autonomous [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Monetary policy inflexibility|monetary policy flexibility]].<ref name="Euro effect 1"/><ref name="Euro effect 2"/>

Finally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by [[Greek financial audits, 2009–10|about 10%]], a public debt to GDP ratio of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of [[#Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping|media reports]]. Consequently, Greece was "punished" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.

=== Internal factors ===
In January 2010, the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek Ministry of Finance]] published ''Stability and Growth Program 2010''.<ref name=europa1>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/sgp/pdf/20_scps/2009-10/01_programme/el_2010-01-15_sp_en.pdf|title=Update of the Hellenic Stability and Growth Programme|work=Greek Ministry of Finance|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=9 October 2011|date=15 January 2010}}</ref> The report listed five main causes, poor GDP growth, government debt and deficits, budget compliance and data credibility. Causes found by others included excess government spending, current account deficits, [[tax avoidance]] and [[tax evasion]].<ref name=europa1 />

==== GDP growth ====
After 2008, GDP growth was lower than the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority|Greek national statistical agency]] had anticipated. The Greek Ministry of Finance reported the need to improve competitiveness by reducing salaries and bureaucracy<ref name="europa1" /> and to redirect governmental spending from non-growth sectors such as the military into growth-stimulating sectors.

The global financial crisis had a particularly large negative impact on GDP growth rates in Greece. Two of the country's largest earners, tourism and shipping were badly affected by the downturn, with revenues falling 15% in 2009.<ref name="tempsreel.nouvelobs.com">{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/economie/20100505.OBS3509/onze-questions-reponses-sur-la-crise-grecque.html|first1=Tristan|last1=Berteloot|first2=Donald|last2=Hebert|title=Onze questions-réponses sur la crise grecque|language=French|trans-title=Eleven questions and answers on the Greek crisis|date=5 May 2010|website=Nouvelobs.com}}</ref>

==== Government deficit ====
Fiscal imbalances developed from 2004 to 2009: "output increased in nominal terms by 40%, while central government primary expenditures increased by 87% against an increase of only 31% in tax revenues." The Ministry intended to implement real expenditure cuts that would allow expenditures to grow 3.8% from 2009 to 2013, well below expected inflation at 6.9%. Overall revenues were expected to grow 31.5% from 2009 to 2013, secured by new, higher taxes and by a major reform of the ineffective tax collection system. The deficit needed to decline to a level compatible with a declining debt-to-GDP ratio.

==== Government debt ====
The debt increased in 2009 due to the higher-than-expected government deficit and higher debt-service costs. The Greek government assessed that structural economic reforms would be insufficient, as the debt would still increase to an unsustainable level before the positive results of reforms could be achieved. In addition to structural reforms, permanent and temporary [[austerity measures]] (with a size relative to GDP of 4.0% in 2010, 3.1% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012 and 0.8% in 2013) were needed. Reforms and austerity measures, in combination with an expected return of positive economic growth in 2011, would reduce the baseline deficit from €30.6&nbsp;billion in 2009 to €5.7&nbsp;billion in 2013, while the debt/GDP ratio would stabilize at 120% in 2010–2011 and decline in 2012 and 2013.

After 1993, the debt-to-GDP ratio remained above 94%.<ref name="Debt-to-GDP ratio" /> The [[late-2000s financial crisis|crisis]] caused the debt level to exceed the maximum sustainable level, defined by [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] economists to be 120%.<ref name="imfmsd">{{cite journal |first1=Fiscal Affairs Department |first2=Strategy, Policy, and Review Department |editor1-last=Cottarelli |editor1-first=Carlo |editor2-last=Moghadam |editor2-first=Reza |title=Modernizing the Framework for Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis |journal=International Monetary Fund |date=5 August 2011 |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2011/080511.pdf}}</ref> According to the report "The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece" published by the EU Commission in October 2011, the debt level was expected to reach 198% in 2012, if the proposed debt restructure agreement was not implemented.<ref name="EC draft">{{cite web|url=http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|title=The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece: Fifth Review&nbsp;– October 2011 (Draft)|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=22 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120193113/http://dl.dropbox.com/u/46265023/20Oct%20Fifth%20Review%20Compliance%20Report-All.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2012}}</ref>

==== Budget compliance ====
Budget compliance was acknowledged to need improvement. For 2009 it was found to be "a lot worse than normal, due to economic control being more lax in a year with political elections". The government wanted to strengthen the monitoring system in 2010, making it possible to track revenues and expenses, at both national and local levels.

==== Data credibility ====
Problems with unreliable data had existed since Greece applied for Euro membership in 1999.<ref name="Eurostat Audit in 2004 of the Greek economy">{{cite web |title=Revision of the Greek Government Deficit and Debt Figures |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF |publisher=Eurostat |date=22 November 2004 |accessdate=5 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205001847/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/GREECE/EN/GREECE-EN.PDF |archivedate=5 February 2012}}</ref> In the five years from 2005 to 2009, [[Eurostat]] noted reservations about Greek fiscal data in five semiannual assessments of the quality of EU member states' public finance statistics.

When the Greek EDP data have been published without reservations, this has been the result of Eurostat interventions before or during the notification period in order to correct mistakes or inappropriate recording, with the result of increasing the notified deficit."

By the end of each year, all were below estimates. Data problems had been evident over time in several other countries, but in the case of Greece, the problems were so persistent and so severe that the European Commission/Eurostat wrote in its January 2010 Report on Greek Government Deficit and Debt Statistics (page 3): "Revisions of this magnitude in the estimated past government deficit ratios have been extremely rare in other EU Member States, but have taken place for Greece on several occasions. These most recent revisions are an illustration of the lack of quality of the Greek fiscal statistics (and of macroeconomic statistics in general) and show that the progress in the compilation of fiscal statistics in Greece, and the intense scrutiny of the Greek fiscal data by Eurostat since 2004 (including 10 EDP visits and 5 reservations on the notified data), have not sufficed to bring the quality of Greek fiscal data to the level reached by other EU Member States." And the same report further noted (page 7): "The partners in the ESS [European Statistical System] are supposed to cooperate in good faith. Deliberate misreporting or fraud is not foreseen in the regulation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/4187653/6404656/COM_2010_report_greek/c8523cfa-d3c1-4954-8ea1-64bb11e59b3a|title=European Commission – Report on Greek Government Deficit and Debt Statistics|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>

In April 2010, in the context of the semiannual notification of deficit and debt statistics under the EU's Excessive Deficit Procedure, the Greek government deficit for years 2006–2008 was revised upward by about 1.5–2 percentage points for each year and the deficit for 2009 was estimated for the first time at 13.6%,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aUi3XLUwIIVA|title=Papandreou Faces Bond Rout as Budget Worsens, Workers Strike|date=22 April 2010|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=2 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623231800/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aUi3XLUwIIVA|archivedate=23 June 2011}}</ref> the second highest in the EU relative to GDP behind Ireland at 14.3% and the [[United Kingdom]] third at 11.5%.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/7269629/Britains-deficit-third-worst-in-the-world-table.html|title=Britain's Deficit Third Worst in the World, Table|date=19 February 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref> Greek government debt for 2009 was estimated at 115.1% of GDP, which was the second highest in the EU after Italy's 115.8%.

The revised statistics revealed that Greece from 2000 to 2010 had exceeded the [[Euro convergence criteria|Eurozone stability criteria]], with yearly deficits exceeding the recommended maximum limit at 3.0% of GDP, and with the debt level significantly above the limit of 60% of GDP. It is widely accepted that the persistent misreporting and lack of credibility of Greece's official statistics over many years was an important enabling condition for the buildup of Greece's fiscal problems and eventually its debt crisis. The February 2014 Report of the European Parliament on the enquiry on the role and operations of the Troika (ECB, Commission and IMF) with regard to the euro area programme countries (paragraph 5) states: "[The European Parliament] is of the opinion that the problematic situation of Greece was also due to statistical fraud in the years preceding the setting-up of the programme".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+REPORT+A7-2014-0149+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=REPORT on the enquiry on the role and operations of the Troika (ECB, Commission and IMF) with regard to the euro area programme countries – A7-0149/2014|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref>

Pre-Euro, currency [[devaluation]] helped to finance Greek government borrowing. Thereafter this tool disappeared. Greece was able to continue borrowing because of the lower interest rates for Euro bonds, in combination with strong GDP growth.

The translation of trade deficits to budget deficits works through [[sectoral balances]]. Greece ran current account (trade) deficits averaging 9.1% GDP from 2000 to 2011.<ref name="research.stlouisfed.org" /> By definition, a trade deficit requires capital inflow (mainly borrowing) to fund; this is referred to as a capital surplus or foreign financial surplus.

Greece's large budget deficit was funded by running a large foreign financial surplus. As the inflow of money stopped during the crisis, reducing the foreign financial surplus, Greece was forced to reduce its budget deficit substantially. Countries facing such a sudden reversal in capital flows typically devalue their currencies to resume the inflow of capital; however, Greece was unable to do this, and so has instead suffered significant income (GDP) reduction, an internal form of devaluation.<ref name=FRBSFGalina /><ref name="research.stlouisfed.org" />

The ability to pay its debts depends greatly on the amount of tax the government is able to collect. In Greece, tax receipts were consistently below the expected level. Data for 2012 indicated that the Greek "shadow economy" or "underground economy", from which little or no tax was collected, was a full 24.3% of GDP – compared with 28.6% for Estonia, 26.5% for Latvia, 21.6% for Italy, 17.1% for Belgium, 14.7% for Sweden, 13.7% for Finland, and 13.5% for Germany.<ref name="go.bloomberg.com">{{cite news| title = Will Euro Austerity Push the Shadow Economy Even Deeper into the Dark?|  url = http://go.bloomberg.com/market-now/2012/12/06/will-euro-austerity-push-the-shadow-economy-even-deeper-into-the-dark/   |work= Bloomberg  | date = 6 December 2012| accessdate= 8 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Greek Myths and Reality (p. 20) | url = http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/08/06%20greece%20recovery%20dervis/eliamep_brookings%20greek%20myths%20and%20reality.pdf | work = ELIAMEP | date = 6 August 2013 | accessdate = 6 January 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108103115/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2013/08/06%20greece%20recovery%20dervis/eliamep_brookings%20greek%20myths%20and%20reality.pdf | archivedate = 8 January 2014}}</ref> (The situation had improved for Greece, along with most EU countries, by 2017).<ref name="Shadow IMF 2017"/> Given that tax evasion is correlated with the percentage of working population that is self-employed,<ref name="Media Coverage">{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/6655991

A mid-2017 report indicated Greeks were being "taxed to the hilt" and many believed that the risk of penalties for tax evasion were less serious than the risk of bankruptcy. One method of evasion that was continuing was the so-called "black market" or "grey economy" or "underground economy": work is done for cash payment which is not declared as income; as well, [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] is not collected and remitted.<ref name="auto6">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html|title=Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms|first=Liz|last=Alderman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 February 2017}}</ref> A January 2017 report<ref name="auto7">{{cite web|url=http://www.dianeosis.org/en/2016/06/tax-evasion-in-greece/|title=Tax Evasion in Greece – A Study|first=Thodoris|last=Georgakopoulos|work=DiaNEOsis|date=22 June 2016}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2020}} by the DiaNEOsis think-tank indicated that unpaid taxes in Greece at the time totaled approximately 95&nbsp;billion euros, up from 76&nbsp;billion euros in 2015, much of it was expected to be uncollectable.

Following similar actions by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], the Greek government was in talks with [[Switzerland]] in 2011, attempting to force Swiss banks to reveal information on the bank accounts of Greek citizens.<ref name="Skai Elvetia">{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/184756/mehri-to-telos-tou-2011-i-sumfonia-gia-ti-forologisi-ton-katatheseon-stin-elvetia-/ |script-title=el:Μέχρι το τέλος του 2011 η συμφωνία για τη φορολόγηση των καταθέσεων στην Ελβετία |trans-title=Deal to tax Swiss bank accounts to be reached by end of 2011 |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=30 October 2011|language=el}}</ref> The [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Finance]] stated that Greeks with Swiss bank accounts would either be required to pay a tax or reveal information such as the identity of the bank account holder to the Greek internal revenue services.<ref name="Skai Elvetia" /> The Greek and Swiss governments hoped to reach a deal on the matter by the end of 2011.<ref name="Skai Elvetia" />

The solution demanded by Greece still had not been effected as of 2015. That year, estimates indicated that the amount of evaded taxes stored in Swiss banks was around €80&nbsp;billion. By then, however, a tax treaty to address this issue was under serious negotiation between the Greek and Swiss governments.<ref name="auto4"/><ref name="auto5"/> An agreement was finally ratified by Switzerland on 1 March 2016 creating a new tax transparency law that would allow for a more effective battle against tax evasion. Starting in 2018, banks in both Greece and Switzerland were to exchange information about the bank accounts of citizens of the other country, to minimize the possibility of hiding untaxed income.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3185_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|title=EU-Swiss relations|date=25 September 2016}}</ref>{{update inline|date=April 2019}}

In 2016 and 2017, the government was encouraging the use of [[credit card]]s or [[debit card]]s to pay for goods and services in order to reduce cash only payments. By January 2017, taxpayers were only granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments were made electronically, with a "paper trail" of the transactions that the government could easily audit. This was expected to reduce the problem of businesses taking payments but not issuing an invoice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.naftemporiki.gr/story/1271541|title=Tax evasion 'safari' in well-known Greek tourist spots continues to snag major violators |work=Naftemporiki|date=30 August 2017}}</ref> This tactic had been used by various companies to avoid payment of VAT as well as income tax.<ref name="auto8">{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/12/13/fin-ministry-bill-gives-tax-breaks-to-greeks-making-payments-with-credit-and-debit-cards/|first=Kerry|last=Kolasa-Sikiaridi|work=Greek Reporter|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=Fin Ministry Bill Gives Tax Breaks to Greeks Making Payments With Credit and Debit Cards|date=13 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="auto9">{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0411/Why-Greeks-swap-of-cash-for-cards-could-end-a-culture-of-tax-evasion|work=Christian Science Monitor|first=Sara|last=Miller Llana|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=Why Greeks' swap of cash for cards could end a culture of tax evasion|date=11 April 2016}}</ref>

The methodology of revisions, has led to a certain controversy.

As the Eurostat report noted, "Eurostat discovered that the ESA 95 rules for classification of state owned units were not being applied."<ref name="Methodological Visits to Greece"/> In the context of this controversy, the former head of Greece's statistical agency, Andreas Georgiou, has been accused of inflating Greece's budget deficit for the aforementioned years.<ref name="2006 2009 revisions 1"/><ref name="Georgiou 1">{{cite news |url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/08/02/former-head-of-elstat-will-face-charges-for-allegedly-inflating-2009-deficit-supreme-court-says/|title= Former Head of ELSTAT Will Face Charges for Allegedly Inflating 2009 Deficit, Supreme Court Says|work= Greek Reporter |date= 2 August 2016 |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> He was cleared of charges of inflating Greece's deficit in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/man-who-revealed-the-depth-of-greeces-financial-quagmire-is-cleared-11551435051}}</ref> It has been argued by many international as well as Greek observers that "despite overwhelming evidence that Mr. Georgiou correctly applied EU rules in revising Greece’s fiscal deficit and debt figures, and despite strong international support for his case, some Greek courts continued the witch hunt."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirandaxafa.com/contents_en.asp?id=150}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaos-isi.org/index.php/latestnews/221-80-former-chief-statisticians-condemn-prosecution-of-andreas-georgiou}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amstat.org/asa/News/ASA-Statement-Prominent-Individuals-Urge-Greek-Authorities-to-Halt-Prosecutions-of-Andreas-Georgiou.aspx}}</ref>

A year later, a worsened recession along with the poor performance of the Greek government in achieving the conditions of the agreed bailout, forced a second bailout. In July 2011, private creditors agreed to a voluntary haircut of 21 percent on their Greek debt, but Euro zone officials considered this write-down to be insufficient.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone/greek-debt-write-down-must-be-larger-german-finance-minister-idUSL5E7LG0LK20111016 | title=Greek debt write-down must be larger: German finance minister | work=Reuters | date=16 October 2011}}</ref> Especially [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], the German finance minister, and [[Angela Merkel]], the German chancellor, "pushed private creditors to accept a 50 percent loss on their Greek bonds",<ref name="auto10">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/business/global/europes-two-years-of-denials-trapped-greece.html | work=The New York Times | first=Thomas | last=Landon| title=The Denials That Trapped Greece | date=5 November 2011}}</ref> while [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] of the European Central Bank had long opposed a haircut for private investors, "fearing that it could undermine the vulnerable European banking system".<ref name="auto10"/> When private investors agreed to accept bigger losses, the Troika launched the second bailout worth {{Nowrap|€130 billion}}. This included a bank recapitalization package worth €48bn.

The second bailout programme was ratified in February 2012. A total of {{Nowrap|€240 billion}} was to be transferred in regular tranches through December 2014. The recession worsened and the government continued to dither over bailout program implementation. In December 2012 the Troika provided Greece with more debt relief, while the IMF extended an extra €8.2bn of loans to be transferred from January 2015 to March 2016.

The government campaigned for rejection of the proposal, while four opposition parties ([[PASOK]], [[To Potami]], [[KIDISO]] and [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]) objected that the proposed referendum was unconstitutional.

On 28 June the referendum was approved by the Greek parliament with no interim bailout agreement. The [[European Central Bank|ECB]] decided to stop its Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Greek banks. Many Greeks continued to withdraw cash from their accounts fearing that capital controls would soon be invoked.

On 5 July a large majority [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|voted]] to reject the bailout terms (a 61% to 39% decision with 62.5% voter turnout). This caused stock indexes worldwide to tumble, fearing Greece's potential exit from the Eurozone ("[[Grexit]]"). Following the vote, Greece's finance minister [[Yanis Varoufakis]] stepped down on 6 July and was replaced by [[Euclid Tsakalotos]].<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-greek-finance-minister-tsakalotos-thrown-into-the-debt-crisis-hot-seat-1436213175|title = New Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos Thrown into the Debt Crisis Hot Seat|last = Bouras|first = Stelios|date = 6 July 2015|work = [[Wall Street Journal]]|access-date = 7 July 2015}}</ref>

On 13 July, after 17 hours of negotiations, Eurozone leaders reached a provisional agreement on a third bailout programme, substantially the same as their June proposal.

They also approved an additional {{Nowrap|€109 billion}} support package, with exact content to be finalized at a later summit.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page/highlights/a-common-response-to-the-crisis-situation.aspx?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309040109/http://www.european-council.europa.eu/home-page/highlights/a-common-response-to-the-crisis-situation.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-09|language=english|title=A common response to the crisis situation|work=European Council}}</ref> On 27 October 2011, Eurozone leaders and the IMF settled an agreement with banks whereby they accepted a 50% write-off of (part of) Greek debt.<ref name="Skai 50">{{cite web|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/184567/kourema-50-tou-ellinikou-hreous/ |title="Κούρεμα" 50% του ελληνικού χρέους" |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |date=27 October 2011|accessdate=27 October 2011|trans-title="Haircut" 50% of the Greek debt|language=Greek}}</ref><ref name="BBC 50">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15478358 |title=Barroso: Europe 'closer to resolving eurozone crisis' |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=27 October 2011|accessdate=27 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Bloomberg 50">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-27/papandreou-says-new-funding-gives-greece-time-new-prospects.html |title=Papandreou: EU Deal Gives Greeks Time |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=27 October 2011|accessdate=27 October 2011 |first1=Maria |last1=Petrakis |first2=Natalie |last2=Weeks}}</ref>

=== Third Economic Adjustment Programme ===
{{main|Third Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece}}
The third and last Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece was signed on 12 July 2015 by the Greek Government under prime minister Alexis Tsipras and it expired on 20 August 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45243088|title=Greece emerges from eurozone bailout programme|work=BBC|accessdate=21 May 2020|date=20 August 2018}}</ref>

=== Effects on the GDP compared to other Eurozone countries ===
There were key differences in the effects of the Greek programme compared to those for other Eurozone bailed-out countries. According to the applied programme, Greece had to accomplish by far the largest fiscal adjustment (by more than 9 points of GDP between 2010 and 2012<ref name="OECD adjustment">{{cite news | title= OECD Economic Surveys: Greece 2013 |publisher=OECD |date=27 November 2013|isbn=9789264298187}} {{subscription required}}</ref>), "a record fiscal consolidation by OECD standards ".<ref name="OECD djustment overview">{{cite news |url=http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/GRC_Overview_Eng_2013.pdf |title=OECD Economic Surveys: Greece 2013 overview |date=November 2013 |accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref> Between 2009 and 2014 the change (improvement) in structural primary balance was 16.1 points of GDP for Greece, compared to 8.5 for Portugal, 7.3 for Spain, 7.2 for Ireland, and 5.6 for Cyprus.<ref name="Fiscal adjustment">{{cite news |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/02/should-other-eurozone-programme-countries-worry-about-a-reduced-greek-primary-surplus-target/ |title=Should other Eurozone programme countries worry about a reduced Greek primary surplus target?|first=Zsolt|last=Darvas |date=25 February 2015 |accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>

The negative effects of such a rapid fiscal adjustment on the Greek GDP, and thus the scale of resulting increase of the Debt to GDP ratio, had been underestimated by the IMF, apparently due to a calculation error.<ref name="Marianne">{{cite news |url=http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2013/01/22/marianne-the-incredible-errors-by-imf-experts-the-wrong-multiplier/ |title= Marianne: The incredible errors by IMF experts & the wrong multiplier|website=KeepTalkingGreece.com |date=22 January 2013 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref> Indeed, the result was a magnification of the debt problem.
Even were the amount of debt to remain the same, Greece's Debt to GDP ratio of 127% in 2009 would still jump to about 170% – considered unsustainable – solely due to the drop in GDP (which fell by more than 25% between 2009 and 2014).<ref name="Eurostat Debt to GDP">{{cite news |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=teina225&plugin=1 |title=General government gross debt - annual data|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The much larger scale of the above effects does not easily support a meaningful comparison with the performance of programmes in other bailed-out countries.

=== Bank recapitalization ===
The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) completed a €48.2bn bank recapitalization in June 2013, of which the first €24.4bn were injected into the four biggest Greek banks. Initially, this recapitalization was accounted for as a debt increase that elevated the debt-to-GDP ratio by 24.8 points by the end of 2012. In return for this, the government received shares in those banks, which it could later sell (per March 2012 was expected to generate €16bn of extra "privatization income" for the Greek government, to be realized during 2013–2020).ecb

HFSF offered three out of the four big Greek banks ([[National Bank of Greece|NBG]], [[Alpha Bank|Alpha]] and [[Piraeus Bank|Piraeus]]) [[warrant (finance)|warrants]] to buy back all HFSF bank shares in semi-annual exercise periods up to December 2017, at some predefined strike prices.<ref name="Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece (Third review July 2013)">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2013/pdf/ocp159_en.pdf|title=The Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece (Third review)|date=29 July 2013|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> These banks acquired additional private investor capital contribution at minimum 10% of the conducted recapitalization. However [[Eurobank Ergasias]] failed to attract private investor participation and thus became almost entirely financed/owned by HFSF. During the first warrant period, the shareholders in Alpha bank bought back the first 2.4% of HFSF shares.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/11/alphabank-warrants-idUSL6N0JQ1E220131211|title=Investors exercise about 2.4 pct of Alpha Bank warrants|work=Reuters|date=11 December 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref> Shareholders in Piraeus Bank bought back the first 0.07%<!--2,700,125 / 4,106,340,039--> of HFSF shares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piraeusbankgroup.com/en/press-office/press-release/2014/01/apotelesma-askisis-parastatikwn-titlwn-ktisis-metoxw|title=Results of the exercise of titles representing share ownership rights (Warrants) – 1st Exercise|publisher=Piraeus Bank|date=8 January 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> National Bank (NBG) shareholders bought back the first 0.01% of the HFSF shares, because the market share price was cheaper than the strike price.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/31/greece-nbg-warrants-idUSL6N0KA0WH20131231|title=Investors exercise fraction of Greece's National Bank warrants|work=Reuters|date=31 December 2013|accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> Shares not sold by the end of December 2017 may be sold to alternative investors.<ref name="Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece (Third review July 2013)" />

In May 2014, a second round of bank recapitalization worth €8.3bn was concluded, financed by private investors. All six commercial banks (Alpha, Eurobank, NBG, Piraeus, [[Attica Bank|Attica]] and Panellinia) participated.<ref name="Second Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece (Fourth review April 2014)" /> HFSF did not tap into their current €11.5bn reserve capital fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsf.gr/files/press_release_20140509_en.pdf|title=Press Release: National Bank of Greece's Share Capital Increase|publisher=HFSF|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> Eurobank in the second round was able to attract private investors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsf.gr/files/press_release_20140415_en.pdf|title=Press Release: Approval of the Institutional Investors Group for Eurobank's Share Capital Increase|publisher=HFSF|date=15 April 2014}}</ref> This required HFSF to dilute their ownership from 95.2% to 34.7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macropolis.gr/?i=portal.en.the-agora.1120|title=Are investors getting a bargain with Eurobank?|publisher=MacroPolis|date=16 April 2014}}</ref>

According to HFSF's third quarter 2014 financial report, the fund expected to recover €27.3bn out of the initial €48.2bn. This amount included "A€0.6bn positive cash balance stemming from its previous selling of warrants (selling of recapitalization shares) and liquidation of assets, €2.8bn estimated to be recovered from liquidation of assets held by its 'bad asset bank', €10.9bn of EFSF bonds still held as capital reserve, and €13bn from its future sale of recapitalization shares in the four systemic banks." The last figure is affected by the highest amount of uncertainty, as it directly reflects the current market price of the remaining shares held in the four systemic banks (66.4% in Alpha, 35.4% in Eurobank, 57.2% in NBG, 66.9% in Piraeus), which for HFSF had a combined market value of €22.6bn by the end of 2013 – declining to €13bn on 10 December 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hfsf.gr/files/announcement_20141211_en.pdf|title=Announcement: Interim Financial Report of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund – December 2014|publisher=Hellenic Financial Stability Fund|date=11 December 2014}}</ref>

Once HFSF liquidates its assets, the total amount of recovered capital will be returned to the Greek government to help to reduce its debt. In early December 2014, the [[Bank of Greece]] allowed HFSF to repay the first €9.3bn out of its €11.3bn reserve to the Greek government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_05/12/2014_545197|title=Part of HFSF reserves set aside|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=5 December 2014}}</ref> A few months later, the remaining HFSF reserves were likewise approved for repayment to ECB, resulting in redeeming €11.4bn in notes during the first quarter of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_20/05/2015_550223|title=HFSF cash return brings state debt down by 11.4 bln|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=20 May 2015}}</ref>

== Creditors ==
Initially, European banks had the largest holdings of Greek debt. However, this shifted as the "troika" (ECB, IMF and a European government-sponsored fund) purchased Greek bonds.  As of early 2015, the largest individual contributors to the fund were Germany, France and Italy with roughly €130bn total of the €323bn debt.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-greece-debt-factbox/how-much-greece-owes-to-international-creditors-idUSKCN0P80XW20150628|title=How much Greece owes to international creditors|work=Reuters| date=28 June 2015}}</ref> The IMF was owed €32bn and the ECB €20bn.

=== European banks ===
Excluding Greek banks, European banks had €45.8bn exposure to Greece in June 2011.<ref name="European bank exposure to Greece">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jun/17/greece-debt-crisis-bank-exposed |title= Greece debt crisis: how exposed is your bank?|publisher=Guardian Media|date=17 June 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> However, by early 2015 their holdings had declined to roughly €2.4bn,<ref name="money.cnn.com" /> in part due to the 50% debt write-down.

===European Investment Bank===
In November 2015, the [[European Investment Bank]] (EIB) lent Greece about 285&nbsp;million euros. This extended the 2014 deal that EIB would lend 670&nbsp;million euros.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.trend.az/business/economy/2452416.html|title=Greece sign 285M euro financing deal for energy projects|first1=Baku|last1=Azerbaijan|first2=Anvar|last2=Mammadov|date=4 November 2015|accessdate= 21 May 2020|work=Trend}}</ref> It was thought that the Greek government would invest the money on Greece's energy industries so as to ensure energy security and manage environmentally friendly projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.energylivenews.com/2015/11/07/greece-granted-285m-for-energy-projects/|title=Greece granted £285m for energy projects|first=Jacqueline|last=Echevarria|website=EnergyLiveNews.com|date=7 Nov 2015|accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref> [[Werner Hoyer]], the president of EIB, expected the investment to boost employment and have a positive impact on Greece's economy and environment.

===Diverging views within the troika===
In hindsight, while the troika shared the aim to avoid a Greek sovereign default, the approach of each member began to diverge, with the IMF on one side advocating for more debt relief while, on the other side, the EU maintained a hardline on debt repayment and strict monitoring.<ref name=Chatham/>

[[File:Riots in Athens 15.jpg|thumb|2008 riots in Athens]]
According to a poll in February 2012 by Public Issue and SKAI Channel, PASOK—which won the national elections of 2009 with 43.92% of the vote—had seen its approval rating decline to 8%, placing it fifth after centre-right [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (31%), left-wing [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (18%), far-left [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE) (12.5%) and radical left [[Syriza]] (12%).

In a May 2011 poll, 62% of respondents felt that the IMF memorandum that Greece signed in 2010 was a bad decision that hurt the country, while 80% had no faith in the [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]], [[Giorgos Papakonstantinou]], to handle the crisis.<ref name="Public Issue">{{cite web|title=Mνημόνιο ένα χρόνο μετά: Aποδοκιμασία, αγανάκτηση, απαξίωση, ανασφάλεια|trans-title=One Year after the Memorandum: Disapproval, Anger, Disdain, Insecurity|language=Greek|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/169875/mnimonio-ena-hrono-meta-apodokimasia-aganaktisi-apaxiosi-anasfaleia|publisher=skai.gr|accessdate=21 May 2020|date=19 May 2011}}</ref> (Venizelos replaced Papakonstantinou on 17 June). 75% of those polled had a negative image of the IMF, while 65% felt it was hurting Greece's economy.<ref name="Public Issue" /> 64% felt that sovereign default was likely.

From 2009 to 2012, the Greek GDP declined by more than a quarter, causing a " [[Depression (economics)|depression]] dynamic" in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/09/the_greek_depression|title=The Greek Depression|work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|date=9 January 2013|accessdate=21 May 2020|first=John|last=Sfakianakis}}</ref>

Key statistics are summarized below, with a detailed table at the bottom of the article. According to the CIA World Factbook and [[Eurostat]]:
* Greek [[GDP]] fell from €242&nbsp;billion in 2008 to €179&nbsp;billion in 2014, a 26% decline. Greece was in recession for over five years, emerging in 2014 by some measures. This fall in GDP dramatically increased the Debt to GDP ratio, severely worsening Greece's debt crisis. 
* GDP per capita fell from a peak of €22,500 in 2007 to €17,000 in 2014, a 24% decline.
* The public debt to GDP ratio in 2014 was 177% of GDP or €317&nbsp;billion. This ratio was the world's third highest after Japan and Zimbabwe. Public debt peaked at €356&nbsp;billion in 2011; it was reduced by a bailout program to €305&nbsp;billion in 2012 and then rose slightly.
* The annual budget deficit (expenses over revenues) was 3.4% GDP in 2014, much improved versus the 15% of 2009. 
* Tax revenues for 2014 were €86&nbsp;billion (about 48% GDP), while expenditures were €89.5&nbsp;billion (about 50% GDP).
* The unemployment rate rose from below 10% (2005–2009) to around 25% (2014–2015).
* An estimated 36% of Greeks lived below the poverty line in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref>

Greece defaulted on a $1.7&nbsp;billion IMF payment on 29 June 2015 (the payment was made with a 20-day delay<ref name="IMF July 2015 payment 1"/>). The government had requested a two-year bailout from lenders for roughly $30&nbsp;billion, its third in six years, but did not receive it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/06/30/news/economy/greece-imf-default/index.html|title=Greece defaults on $1.7 billion IMF payment|author1=Virginia Harrison |author2=Chris Liakos |date=30 June 2015|work=CNNMoney}}</ref>

The [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] reported on 2 July 2015 that the "debt dynamics" of Greece were "unsustainable" due to its already high debt level and "...significant changes in policies since [2014]—not least, lower primary surpluses and a weak reform effort that will weigh on growth and privatization—[which] are leading to substantial new financing needs." The report stated that debt reduction (haircuts, in which creditors sustain losses through debt principal reduction) would be required if the package of reforms under consideration were weakened further.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=43044.0|title=Greece : Preliminary Draft Debt Sustainability Analysis|work=imf.org}}</ref>

=== Taxation ===
In response to the crisis, the Greek governments resolved to raise the tax rates dramatically. A study showed that indirect taxes were almost doubled between the beginning of the Crisis and 2017.

As of 2016, five indirect taxes had been added to goods and services. At 23%, the value added tax is one of the Eurozone's highest, exceeding other EU countries on small and medium-sized enterprises.<ref name="coffee"/> One researcher found that the poorest households faced tax increases of 337%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvxs.gr/news/ellada/ereyna-337-ayksisi-foron-stoys-ftoxoys-ellines-9-stoys-ploysioys|title=Αύξηση φόρων 337% στους φτωχούς Έλληνες, 9% στους πλούσιους|language=Greek|trans-title=337% tax increase for poor Greeks, 9% for rich people|date= 19 March 2015|accessdate=21 May 2020|work=TVXS – TV Χωρίς Σύνορα}}</ref>

The ensuing tax policies are accused for having the opposite effects than intended, namely reducing instead of increasing the revenues, as high taxation discourages transactions and encourages tax evasion, thus perpetuating the depression.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/845083/article/oikonomia/ellhnikh-oikonomia/pws-oi-meiwseis-forwn-ay3anoyn-telika-ta-esoda|title=Πώς οι μειώσεις φόρων αυξάνουν τελικά τα έσοδα|language=Greek|trans-title=How tax cuts ultimately increase revenue|first=Ilias|last=Bellos|date=10 January 2016|accessdate=21 May 2020|website=kathimerini.gr}}</ref> Some firms relocated abroad to avoid the country's higher tax rates.<ref name="coffee">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/16/tax-hikes-greece-coffee-austerity-economy-bailout|title=Tax hikes threaten to brew up a storm for Greece's coffee drinkers|author=Helena Smith|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref>

Greece not only has some of the highest taxes in Europe, it also has major problems in terms of tax collection. The VAT deficit due to tax evasion was estimated at 34% in early 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pwc.com/gr/en/publications/greek-thought-leadership/world-tax-summaries.html|title=World Tax Summaries: Taxation in Greece|work=Price Waterhouse Coopers|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> Tax debts in Greece are now equal to 90% of annual tax revenue, which is the worst number in all industrialized nations. Much of this is due to the fact that Greece has a vast underground economy, which was estimated to be about the size of a quarter of the country's GDP before the crisis. The International Monetary Fund therefore argued in 2015 that Greece's debt crisis could be almost completely resolved if the country's government found a way to solve the tax evasion problem.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-struggles-to-get-citizens-to-pay-their-taxes-1424867495|title=Greece Struggles to Get Citizens to Pay Their Taxes|last1=Karnitschnig|first1=Matthew|date=2015-02-26|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-02-28|last2=Stamouli|first2=Nektaria|issn=0099-9660}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

==== Tax evasion and avoidance ====
<!-- This sub-section should be about the new tax culture as formed in response to the in-crisis austerity measures. The general phenomenon of corruption should be covered in the earlier section on "Tax evasion". -->

A mid-2017 report indicated Greeks have been "taxed to the hilt" and many believed that the risk of penalties for tax evasion were less serious than the risk of bankruptcy.<ref name="auto6"/> A more recent study showed that many Greeks consider tax evasion a legitimate means of defense against the government's policies of austerity and over-taxation.<ref name="dianeosis"/> As an example, many Greek couples in 2017 resolved to "virtual" divorces hoping to pay lower income and property taxes.<ref>http://www.enikonomia.gr/economy/171618,diastaseis-epidimias-lamvanoun-ta-eikonika-diazygia-trito-prosopo.html</ref>

By 2010, tax receipts consistently were below the expected level. In 2010, estimated tax evasion losses for the Greek government amounted to over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}}.<ref name="auto">{{cite news|title=Greeks and the state: An uncomfortable couple|url=https://www.deseret.com/2010/5/3/20112654/greeks-and-the-state-an-uncomfortable-couple#demonstrators-protest-against-the-new-economic-measures-during-a-rally-in-the-northern-greek-port-city-of-thessaloniki-sunday|date=3 May 2010|agency=Deseret News|accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref> 2013 figures showed that the government collected less than half of the revenues due in 2012, with the remaining tax to be paid according to a delayed payment schedule.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_05/11/2013_526451|title=State collected less than half of revenues due last year  |publisher=Ekathimerini|accessdate=7 November 2013|date=5 November 2013}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=delayed payment not in source|date=July 2015}}

Data for 2012 placed the Greek underground or "black" economy at 24.3% of GDP, compared with 28.6% for Estonia, 26.5% for Latvia, 21.6% for Italy, 17.1% for Belgium, 14.7% for Sweden, 13.7% for Finland, and 13.5% for Germany.<ref name="go.bloomberg.com"/>

A January 2017 report<ref name="auto7"/>{{failed verification|date=May 2020}} by the DiaNEOsis think-tank indicated that unpaid taxes in Greece at the time totaled approximately 95&nbsp;billion euros, up from 76&nbsp;billion euros in 2015, much of it was expected to be uncollectable. Another early 2017 study estimated that the loss to the government as a result of tax evasion was between 6% and 9% of the country's GDP, or roughly between 11&nbsp;billion and 16&nbsp;billion euros per annum.<ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com"/>

One method of evasion is the so-called black market, grey economy or shadow economy: work is done for cash payment which is not declared as income; as well, VAT is not collected and remitted.<ref name="auto6"/> The shortfall in the collection of VAT (sales tax) is also significant. In 2014, the government collected 28% less than was owed to it; this shortfall is about double the average for the EU. The uncollected amount that year was about 4.9&nbsp;billion euros.<ref name="bloomberg.com"/> The DiaNEOsis study estimated that 3.5% of GDP is lost due to VAT fraud, while losses due to smuggling of alcohol, tobacco and petrol amounted to approximately another 0.5% of the country's GDP.<ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com"/>

=== Social effects ===

By 2015, the OECD reported that nearly twenty percent of Greeks lacked funds to meet daily food expenses. Consequently, because of financial shock, unemployment directly affects debt management, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms such as depression, suicide, and addiction.<ref>Sakellari, E., & Pikouli, K.

The Greek government was unable to commit the necessary resources to homelessness, due in part to austerity measures. A program was launched to provide a subsidy to assist homeless to return to their homes, but many enrollees never received grants. Various attempts were made by local governments and non-governmental agencies to alleviate the problem.

=== Political effects ===

The economic and social crisis had profound political effects.  In 2011 it gave rise to the anti-austerity [[Anti-austerity movement in Greece|Movement of the Indignant]] in Syntagma Square. The [[two-party system]] which dominated Greek politics from 1977 to 2009 crumbled in the double elections of [[May 2012 Greek legislative election|6 May]] and [[June 2012 Greek legislative election|17 June 2012]]. The main features of this transformation were:

a) The crisis of the two main parties, the center-right [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy (ND)]] and center-left [[PASOK]]. ND saw its share of the vote drop from an historical average of >40% to a record low of 19–33% in 2009–19. PASOK collapsed from 44% in 2009 to 13% in [[June 2012 Greek legislative election|June 2012]] and stabilized around 8% in the 2019 elections. Meanwhile, [[Syriza]] emerged as the main rival of ND, with a share of the vote that rose from 4% to 27% between 2009 and June 2012. This peaked in the elections of [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|25 January 2015]] when Syriza received 36% of the vote and fell to 31.5% in the [[2019 Greek legislative election|7 July 2019 elections]].

b) The sharp rise of the Neo-Nazi [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]], whose share of the vote increased from 0.5% in 2009 to 7% in May and June 2012.  In 2012–19, Golden Dawn was the third largest party in the Greek Parliament.

c) A general fragmentation of the popular vote. The average number of parties represented in the Greek Parliament in 1977–2012 was between 4 and 5. In 2012–19 this increased to 7 or 8 parties.

d) From 1974–2011 Greece was ruled by single-party governments, except for a brief period in 1989–90. In 2011–19, the country was ruled by two- or three-party coalitions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/35888922|first1=Alexander|last1=Kazamias|title=The Political Effects of the Greek Economic Crisis: The Collapse of the Old Party System|accessdate=21 May 2020}}</ref>

The victory of ND in the [[2019 Greek legislative election|7 July 2019 elections]] with 40% of the vote and the formation of the first one-party government in Greece since 2011 could be the beginning of a new functioning two-party system. However, the significantly weaker performance of Syriza and PASOK's endurance as a competing centre-left party could signal continued party system fluidity.

== Responses ==
=== Electronic payments to reduce tax evasion ===
In 2016 and 2017, the government was encouraging the use of [[credit card]] or [[debit cards]] to pay for goods and services in order to reduce cash only payments. By January 2017, taxpayers were only granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments were made electronically, with a "paper trail" of the transactions. This was expected to reduce the opportunity by vendors to avoid the payment of VAT (sales) tax and income tax.<ref name="auto8"/><ref name="auto9"/>

By 28 July 2017, numerous businesses were required by law to install a point of sale device to enable them to accept payment by credit or debit card. Failure to comply with the electronic payment facility can lead to fines of up to 1,500 euros. The requirement applied to around 400,000 firms or individuals in 85 professions. The greater use of cards was one of the factors that had already achieved significant increases in VAT collection in 2016.<ref name="ekathimerini.com"/>

=== Grexit ===
[[Paul Krugman|Krugman]] suggested that the Greek economy could recover from the recession by exiting the Eurozone ("Grexit") and returning to its national currency, the drachma. That would restore Greece's control over its monetary policy, allowing it to navigate the trade-offs between inflation and growth on a national basis, rather than the entire Eurozone.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/grexit-and-the-morning-after/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&seid=auto|title=Grexit and the Morning After|first=Paul|last=Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 May 2015|accessdate=22 May 2020}}</ref> Iceland made a dramatic recovery after it filed for bankruptcy in 2008, in part by devaluing the [[Icelandic krona|krona]] (ISK).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304203604577396171007652042|title=In European crisis, Iceland emerges as an island of recovery|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=22 May 2020|first=Charles|last=Forelle}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/23/iceland-recovers-voice-financial-crisis|title=Iceland starts to recover its voice after financial crisis|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 November 2012|accessdate=22 May 2020|first=Alexandra|last=Topping}}</ref> In 2013, it enjoyed an economic growth rate of some 3.3 percent.<ref name=oecdNAOCVol2014F>OECD, National Accounts of OECD Countries detailed tables 2006–2013, Volume 2014/2</ref> Canada was able to improve its budget position in the 1990s by devaluing its currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/08/policy-lessons-from-the-eurodebacle/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body|title=Policy Lessons From The Eurodebacle|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=8 July 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=22 May 2020}}</ref>

=== Bailout ===
Greece could accept additional bailout funds and debt relief (i.e. bondholder haircuts or principal reductions) in exchange for greater austerity. However, austerity has damaged the economy, deflating wages, destroying jobs and reducing tax receipts, thus making it even harder to pay its debts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} If further austerity were accompanied by enough reduction in the debt balance owed, the cost might be justifiable.<ref name="vox.com" />

=== European debt conference ===
Economist [[Thomas Piketty]] said in July 2015: "We need a conference on all of Europe’s debts, just like after World War II. A restructuring of all debt, not just in Greece but in several European countries, is inevitable." This reflected the difficulties that Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland had faced (along with Greece) before ECB-head [[Mario Draghi]] signaled a pivot to looser monetary policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2012/html/sp120726.en.html|title=Verbatim of the remarks made by Mario Draghi|access-date=22 May 2020|date=26 July 2012|work=European Central Bank}}</ref> Piketty noted that Germany received significant debt relief after World War II.

|quote= So what, in brief, is happening? The answers are: creeping onset of deflation; mass joblessness; thwarted internal rebalancing and over-reliance on external demand. Yet all this is regarded as acceptable, desirable, even moral—indeed, a success. Why? The explanation is myths: the crisis was due to fiscal malfeasance instead of to irresponsible cross-border credit flows; fiscal policy has no role in managing demand; central bank purchases of government bonds are a step towards hyperinflation; and competitiveness determines external surpluses, not the balance between supply and insufficient demand.<ref>{{cite news | last = Wolf | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Wolf | date = 5 November 2013 | title = Germany is a weight on the world | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/291a5ca6-42ec-11e3-8350-00144feabdc0.html | accessdate = 11 November 2013 | newspaper =Financial Times}}</ref>

Claims that Germany had, by mid-2012, given Greece the equivalent of 29 times the aid given to West Germany under the Marshall Plan after World War II have been contested, with opponents claiming that aid was just a small part of Marshall Plan assistance to Germany and conflating the writing off of a majority of Germany's debt with the Marshall Plan.<ref>{{cite news |last= Porter |first= Eduardo |date= 22 June 2012 |title= Why Germany Will Pay Up to Save the Euro |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/business/economy/why-germany-will-pay-up-to-save-the-euro.html |newspaper= New York Times |accessdate= 22 February 2013 }}</ref>

The version of adjustment offered by Germany and its allies is that austerity will lead to an internal devaluation, i.e. deflation, which would enable Greece gradually to regain competitiveness.

== Criticism of the role of news media and stereotyping ==
A large number of negative articles about the Greek economy and society have been published in international media before and during the crisis, leading to accusations about negative stereotyping and possible effects on the evolution of the crisis itself.<ref name="Media Coverage"/>

Elements contradicting several negative reports, include the facts that Greeks even before the crisis worked the hardest in the EU, took fewer vacation days and on average retired at about the same age as the Germans,<ref name="Media Coverage"/><ref name="Alex 2">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad0n-eX_cYI|title= "Alex" episode 2: The Lazy Greek
