'''''Pichia pastoris''''' is a species of [[methylotroph]]ic [[yeast]]. It was found in the 1960s, with its feature of using [[methanol]], as a source of carbon and energy.<ref name="Koichi Ogata, Hideo Nishikawa & Masahiro Ohsugi (1969)">{{Cite journal | author=Koichi Ogata, Hideo Nishikawa & Masahiro Ohsugi | title=A Yeast Capable of Utilizing Methanol | journal=[[Agricultural and Biological Chemistry]]  | year=1969 | volume=33 | issue=10 | pages=1519–1520 | doi=10.1080/00021369.1969.10859497 | doi-access=free }}</ref> After years of study, ''P. pastoris'' was widely used in [[biochemistry|Biochemical]] research and [[biotechnology|Biotech industries]].

==''P. pastoris'' in nature==

===Natural habitat===
Naturally, ''P. pastoris'' live on trees，such as [[Chestnut | chestnut trees]]. They are heterotrophs and they can use several carbon sources for living, like [[glucose]], [[glycerol]] and [[methanol]].<ref name="Rebnegger, C., Vos, T., Graf, A. B., Valli, M., Pronk, J. T., Daran-Lapujade, P., & Mattanovich, D. (2016)">{{Cite journal | author=Rebnegger, C., Vos, T., Graf, A. B., Valli, M., Pronk, J.

===Reproduction===
''P. pastoris'' can undergo both [[asexual reproduction]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]] reproduction, by [[budding]] and [[ascospore]].<ref name="Kurtzman.

==''P. pastoris'' as a model organism==
In the last few years, ''P. pastoris'' was investigated and identified as a good model organism with several advantages. First of all, ''P. patoris'' can be grown and used easily in lab. Like other widely used yeast models, it has relatively short life span and fast regeneration time. Moreover, some inexpensive culture media have been designed, so that ''P. patoris can grow quickly on them, with high cell density.<ref name="M. M. Guarna G. J. Lesnicki B. M. Tam J. Robinson C. Z.

Whole genome sequencing for ''P. patoris'' had been performed. The ''P. pastoris'' GS115 genome has been sequenced by the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and Ghent University, and published in ''Nature Biotechnology''.<ref name = "De Schutter">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Schutter K, Lin YC, Tiels P, Van Hecke A, Glinka S, Weber-Lehmann J, Rouzé P, Van de Peer Y, Callewaert N | title = Genome sequence of the recombinant protein production host Pichia pastoris | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 561–6 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19465926 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1544 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The genome sequence and gene annotation can be browsed through the [http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Picpa ORCAE] system. The complete genomic data allows scientists to identify homologous proteins and evolutionary relationships between other yeast species and ''P. pastoris''. Furthermore, ''P. pastoris'' are single [[eukaryotic]] cells, which means researchers could investigate the proteins inside ''P. pastoris''. Then the homologous comparison to other more complicated eukaryotic species can be processed, to obtain their functions and origins.<ref name="Brigitte Gasser, Roland Prielhofer, Hans Marx, Michael Maurer, Justyna Nocon, Matthias Steiger, Verena Puxbaum, Michael Sauer & Diethard Mattanovich(2013)">{{Cite journal | author=Brigitte Gasser, Roland Prielhofer, Hans Marx, Michael Maurer, Justyna Nocon, Matthias Steiger, Verena Puxbaum, Michael Sauer & Diethard Mattanovich | title=Pichia pastoris: protein production host and model organism for biomedical research | journal=[[Future Microbiology]] | volume=8 | year=2013 | issue=2 | pages=191–208 | doi=10.2217/fmb.12.133 | pmid=23374125 }}</ref>

Another advantage of ''P. pastoris'' is its similarity to the well-studied yeast model — ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. As a [[model organism]] for biology, ''S. cerevisiae'' have been well studied for decades and used by researchers for various purposes throughout history. The two yeast genera; ''[[Pichia]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', have similar growth conditions and tolerances; thus, the culture of ''P. pastoris'' can be adopted by labs without many modifications.<ref name="Tran, A., Nguyen, T., Nguyen, C.(2017)">{{Cite journal | author=Tran, A., Nguyen, T., Nguyen, C. | title=Pichia pastoris versus Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a case study on the recombinant production of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor | journal=[[BMC Res Notes]] | volume=10 | year=2017  | issue=1 | page=148 |doi=10.1186/s13104-017-2471-6| pmid=28376863 | pmc=5379694 | doi-access=free }}</ref> Moreover, unlike ''S. cerevisiae'', ''P. pastoris'' has the ability to functionally process proteins with large molecular weight, which is useful in a translational host.<ref name="Heidebrecht, Aniela, and Thomas Scheibel(2013)">{{Cite journal | author=Heidebrecht, Aniela, and Thomas Scheibel | title=Recombinant production of spider silk proteins | journal=Advances in Applied Microbiology. | volume=82 | year=2013 |pages=115–153  |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-407679-2.00004-1| pmid=23415154 | isbn=9780124076792 }}</ref>
Considering all the advantages, ''P. pastoris'' can be usefully employed as both a genetic and experimental model organism.

===''P. pastoris'' as a genetic model organism===
As a genetic model organism, ''P. pastoris'' can be used for genetic analysis and large-scale [[Hybrid (biology)|genetic crossing]], with complete genome data and its ability to carry out complex eukaryotic genetic processing in a relatively small genome. The functional genes for [[peroxisome]] assembly were investigated by comparing wild-type and mutant strains of ''P. pastoris''.<ref name="Gould, S. J., McCollum, D., Spong, A. P., Heyman, J. A., & Subramani, S. (1992).">{{Cite journal | author=Gould, S. J., McCollum, D., Spong, A. P., Heyman, J.

===''P. pastoris'' as an experimental model organism===
As an experimental model organism, ''P. pastoris'' was mainly used as the host system for transformation. Due to its ablities of recombination with foreign DNA and processing large proteins, much research has been carry out to investigate the possibility of producing new proteins and the function of artificially designed proteins, using ''P. pastoris'' as a transformation host.<ref name="Cregg, J. M., Barringer, K. J., Hessler, A. Y., & Madden, K. R. (1985).">{{Cite journal | author=Cregg, J. M., Barringer, K. J., Hessler, A. Y., & Madden, K.

==''P. pastoris'' as expression system platform==
''P. pastoris'' is frequently used as an [[gene expression#Expression system|expression system]] for the production of [[heterologous]] proteins. Several properties make ''P. pastoris'' suited for this task. Currently, several strains of  ''P. pastoris'' are used for biotechnical purposes, with significant differences among them in growth and protein production.<ref name="Brady, J. R. (2020).

===Advantage===
1:''P. pastoris''  is able to grow on simple, inexpensive medium, with high growth rate. ''P. pastoris'' can grow in either [[shaker (laboratory)|shake flasks]] or a [[fermenter]], which makes it suitable for both small- and large-scale production.<ref name="Wenhui Zhang Mark A. Bevins Bradley A. Plantz Leonard A. Smith Michael M. Meagher(2000)">{{Cite journal | author=Wenhui Zhang Mark A. Bevins Bradley A. Plantz Leonard A. Smith Michael M.

2:''P. pastoris'' has two [[alcohol oxidase]] genes, ''Aox1'' and ''Aox2'', which include strongly [[regulation of gene expression|inducible]] [[promoter (biology)|promoters]].<ref name="pmid15565717">{{cite journal | vauthors = Daly R, Hearn MT | title = Expression of heterologous proteins in Pichia pastoris: a useful experimental tool in protein engineering and production | journal = Journal of Molecular Recognition | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–38 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15565717 | doi = 10.1002/jmr.687 }}</ref> These two genes allow ''Pichia'' to use methanol as a [[carbon]] and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by [[methanol]], and repressed by [[glucose]]. Usually, the gene for the desired protein is introduced under the control of the ''Aox1'' promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of methanol on medium. After several researches, scientists found that the promotor derived from ''AOX1'' gene in ''P. pastoris'' is extremely suitable to control the expression of foreign genes, which had been transformed into the ''P. pastoris'' genome, producing heterologous proteins.<ref name="Romanos, Mike.(1995)">{{Cite journal | author=Romanos, Mike. | title=Advances in the use of Pichia pastoris for high-level gene expression | journal=[[Current Opinion in Biotechnology]] | volume=6 | year=1995 | issue=5 |pages=527–533|doi=10.1016/0958-1669(95)80087-5}}</ref>

3: With a key [[Phenotypic trait|trait]], ''P. pastoris'' can grow with extremely high cell density on the culture. This feature is compatible with heterologous protein expression, giving higher yields of production.<ref name="Zhou, X., Yu, Y., Tao, J., & Yu, L. (2014).

4: The technology required for genetic manipulation of ''P. pastoris'' is similar to that of ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', which is one of the most well-studied yeast model organisms. As a result, the experiment protocol and materials are easy to build for ''P. pastoris''.<ref name="Morton, C. L., & Potter, P. M. (2000). ">{{Cite journal | author=Morton, C. L., & Potter, P.

===Disadvantage===
As some proteins require [[chaperonin]] for proper folding, ''Pichia'' is unable to produce a number of proteins, since ''P. pastoris'' does not contain the appropriate chaperones. The technologies of introducing genes of mammalian chaperonins into the yeast genome and overexpressing existing chaperonins still require improvement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bankefa |first1=OE |last2=Wang |first2=M |last3=Zhu |first3=T |last4=Li |first4=Y |s2cid=29155989 |title=Hac1p homologues from higher eukaryotes can improve the secretion of heterologous proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris. |journal=Biotechnology Letters |date=July 2018 |volume=40 |issue=7 |pages=1149–1156 |doi=10.1007/s10529-018-2571-y |pmid=29785668}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yu |first1=Xiao-Wei |last2=Sun |first2=Wei-Hong |last3=Wang |first3=Ying-Zheng |last4=Xu |first4=Yan |title=Identification of novel factors enhancing recombinant protein production in multi-copy Komagataella phaffii based on transcriptomic analysis of overexpression effects |journal=Scientific Reports |date=24 November 2017 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=16249 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-16577-x |pmid=29176680 |pmc=5701153 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2017NatSR...716249Y }}</ref>

===Comparison with other expression systems===
In standard [[molecular biology]] research, the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is the most frequently used organism for expression system, to produce heterologous [[proteins]], due to its features of fast growth rate, high protein production rate, as well as undemanding growth conditions. Protein production in ''E. coli'' is usually faster than that in ''P. pastoris'', with reasons: [[competent cell|Competent]] ''E. coli'' cells can be stored frozen, and thawed before use, whereas ''Pichia'' cells have to be produced immediately before use.Expression yields in Pichia vary between different [[Cloning|clones]], so that a large number of clones has to be screened for protein production, to find the best producer. The biggest advantage of ''Pichia'' over ''E. coli'' is that ''Pichia'' is capable of forming [[disulfide]] bonds and [[glycosylation]]s in proteins, but ''E. coli'' cannot.<ref name="pmid19892173">{{Cite book |vauthors=Cregg JM, Tolstorukov I, Kusari A, Sunga J, Madden K, Chappell T |title=Expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris |journal=Meth.

The well-studied ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' is also used as an expression system with similar advantages over ''E. coli'' as ''Pichia''. However ''Pichia'' has two main advantages over ''S. cerevisiae'' in laboratory and industrial settings:
#''Pichia'', as mentioned above, is a [[methylotroph]], meaning that it can grow with the simple methanol, as the only source of energy — ''Pichia'' can grow fast in [[cell suspension]] with reasonably strong methanol solution, which would kill most other micro-organisms. In this case, the expression system is cheap to set up and maintain.
#''Pichia'' can grow up to a very high cell density. Under ideal conditions, it can multiply to the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression system in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the proteins produced per cell, which makes ''Pichia'' of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment.<ref name="pmid19892173"/>

Comparing to other expression systems, such as S2-cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, ''Pichia'' usually gives much better yields.Generally, [[Immortalised cell line|cell lines]] from multicellular organisms require complex and expensive types of media, including [[amino acids]], [[vitamin]]s, as well as other [[growth factor]]s. These types of media significantly increase the cost of producing heterologous proteins. Additionally, since ''Pichia'' can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one [[nitrogen]] source, which is suitable for isotopic labelling applications, like [[protein NMR]].<ref name="pmid19892173"/>

==Industrial applications==
''P. pastoris'' have been used in several kinds of biotech industries, such as [[pharmaceutical industry]]. All the applications are based on its feature of expressing proteins.

===Biotherapeutic production===
In the last few years, ''Pichia pastoris'' had been used for the production of over 500 types of [[biotherapeutic]]s, such as [[Interferon gamma|IFNγ]]. At the beginning, one drawback of this protein expression system is the over-[[glycosylation]] with high density of [[mannose]] structure, which is a potential cause of [[immunogenicity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Tan E, Lua LH, Owens L, Karthikeyan OP, Heimann K | title = Is Pichia pastoris a realistic platform for industrial production of recombinant human interferon gamma? | journal = Biologicals | volume = 45 | pages = 52–60 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27810255 | doi = 10.1016/j.biologicals.2016.09.015 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1312349 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/afpuc.2015.62.issue-2/afpuc-2015-0031/afpuc-2015-0031.xml?format=INT | title=Increased expression and secretion of recombinant hIFNγ through amino acid starvation-induced selective pressure on the adjacent HIS4 gene in Pichia pastoris | author=Ali Razaghi|author2=Roger Huerlimann|author3=Leigh Owens|author4=Kirsten Heimann | journal=European Pharmaceutical Journal | year=2015 | volume=62 | issue=2 | pages=43–50 | doi=10.1515/afpuc-2015-0031| doi-access=free }}</ref> In 2006, a research group managed to create a new strain called YSH597.

===Enzyme production for food industry===
In food industries, like brewery and bake house,''Pichia pastoris'' is used to produce different kinds of enzymes, as [[processing aid]]s and [[food additive]]s, with many functions. For example, some enzymes produced by genetically modified ''Pichia pastoris'' can keep the bread soft. Meanwhile, in beer, enzymes could be used to lower the alcohol concentration.<ref name="Spohner, S. C., Müller, H., Quitmann, H., & Czermak, P. (2015)). ">{{Cite journal | author=Spohner, S.
