The '''Kim dynasty''', referred to in North Korea as the '''Mount Paektu bloodline''' or '''Mount Baekdu bloodline''', is a three-generation lineage of [[North Korea]]n leadership descending from the country's first [[Leader of North Korea|leader]], [[Kim Il-sung]]. In 1948, Kim came to rule the North after the end of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in 1945 split the region. He began the [[Korean War]] in 1950 in a failed attempt to [[Korean reunification|reunify the Korean Peninsula]]. By the 1980s, Kim developed [[North Korean cult of personality|a cult of personality]] closely tied to their state philosophy of ''[[Juche]]'', which would later be passed on to his two successors: son [[Kim Jong-il]] and grandson [[Kim Jong-un]].

In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the new edited [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System]] adopted by the government, states that the Party and revolution must be carried "eternally" by the "Baekdu bloodline".<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html The Twisted Logic of the N.Korean Regime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113064929/http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/08/13/2013081301558.html |date=13 January 2017 }}, Chosun Ilbo, 13 August 2013, Accessed date: 11 January 2017.</ref>

== Ancestry ==
Kim Il-sung was born in [[Mangyongdae-guyok]] to [[Methodist]] parents.<ref name="Corfield2013"/> His father [[Kim Hyong-jik]] was 15 when he married [[Kang Pan-sok]] two years his elder.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=14}} Kim Hyong-jik had attended a school founded by Protestant missionaries, which influenced his own family. Kim Hyong-jik became a father at the age of 17, and left school to work as a teacher in a nearby school he once attended. He later practiced Chinese herbal medicine as a doctor. Kim Hyong-jik protested against Japanese rule, and was arrested several times for his activism. He was a founding member of the Korean National Association in 1917, participated in the 1919 [[March 1st Movement]], and fled Korea for [[Manchuria]] with his wife and young Kim Il-sung in 1920. There is a teacher's college named for him in [[Pyongyang]].<ref name="Corfield2013" />

Kim Hyong-jik's own parents, [[Kim Bo-hyon]] and Li Bo-ik,<ref name="Corfield2013" /> were described as "patriots" by the Editorial Committee of the ''Short Biography of Kim Il Sung''.<ref name="Editorial Committee for Il-sung" />

Kim Il-sung married twice and had six children. He met his first wife, [[Kim Jong-suk]], in 1936, and she bore [[Kim Jong-il]], [[Kim Man-il]], and [[Kim Kyong-hui]] before dying while bearing a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] daughter. Kim Jong-suk was born 24 December 1917 in Hoeryong in (North) Hamgyo’ng Province. Her family and she fled Korea to Yanji, Jilin (Kirin) Province around 1922.<ref name=leadershipwatch>{{Cite web |title=Kim Family |work=North Korea Leadership Watch |url= http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/kim-family/ }}</ref> In October 1947, Kim Jong-suk presided over the establishment of a school for war orphans in South P’yo’ngan Province, which became the Mangyo’ngdae Revolutionary School. When the school opened in west Pyongyang one year after its foundation, Kim Jong-suk also unveiled the country's first statue to Kim Il-sung. In 1949, Kim Jong-suk was once again pregnant. She continued public activities, but her health diminished. She died on 19 September 1949 due to complications from pregnancy. Kim Il-sung had three children with his second wife, [[Kim Song-ae]]: Kim Kyong-il (born 1951), [[Kim Pyong-il]] (born 1953), and Kim Yong-il (born 1955).<ref name="Time tree" /> He had two younger brothers, Kim Chol-ju and [[Kim Yong-ju]] and a sister.<ref name="leadershipwatch" />

When Kim Il-sung's first wife died, Kim Song-ae was not recognized as Kim Il-sung's wife for several years. Neither partnerships had public weddings.{{sfn|Martin|2007|p=187}} Born Kim So’ng-p’al in the early 1920s in South P’yo’ngan Province, Kim Song-ae began her career as a clerical worker in the Ministry of National Defense where she first met Kim Il-sung in 1948. She was hired to work in his residence as an assistant to Kim Jong-suk. In addition to doing secretarial work for the Kims, she also looked after Kim Jong-il and Kim Kyong-hui. After Kim Jong-suk's 1949 death, Kim Song-ae began managing Kim Il-sung's household and domestic life.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kim Song Ae (Kim So’ng-ae) |work=North Korea Leadership Watch |access-date=25 October 2020|url=http://www.nkleadershipwatch.org/leadership-biographies/kim-song-ae-kim-song-ae/ }}</ref>

In 1953, Kim Song-ae gave birth to her first child with Kim Il Sung, a daughter named Kim Kyong Jin (Kim Kyo’ng-chin). She went on to have at least two other children with him, sons  [[Kim Pyong-il]] (b. 1954) and Kim Yong Il (b. 1957).<ref name="leadershipwatch" />

The main branch referred to Kim Il-sung’s family with Kim Jong-suk and publicly included Kim Jong-il and Kim Kyong-hui.
