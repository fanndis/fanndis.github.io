'''ArtRave''' (stylized as '''artRAVE''') was a two-day event hosted by [[Lady Gaga]] from November 10–11, 2013, as part of the promotional campaign for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Artpop]]'' (2013). The event, held in a large warehouse in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in New York, served as an album release party and included a [[press conference]] and a live performance. During the press conference, Gaga revealed "the world's first flying dress", called the [[TechHaus Volantis|Volantis]], confirmed plans to stage a performance in space in 2015, and introduced new works by [[Marina Abramović]], [[Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin]], [[Jeff Koons]], and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]. The warehouse contained a giant statue of Gaga created by Koons on one side and other artworks, while screens all around displayed videos of Gaga's performances with Abramović. There were contortionists, a DJ booth, as well as free food and drink for the assembled crowd.

The event was to have been sponsored by [[American Express]], however they backed out at the last moment failing to come to terms regarding ArtRave's production. Gaga performed a concert which was streamed live on [[Vevo]] and later rebroadcast through the website's syndication partners. The set list consisted of songs from ''Artpop''. On November 11, [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] aired a half-hour special called ''Album Release Party with Lady Gaga'', hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] on more than 150 radio stations throughout the United States. On November 19, [[The CW]] aired a television special with footage from the album release party. ArtRave received generally positive reviews from critics who noted the enormity of the production, as well as Gaga's performance and enthusiasm; the launch of Volantis was generally criticised.

Development of Lady Gaga's third studio album, ''[[Artpop]]'', began shortly after the release of her second one, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]'' in 2011. By the following year, Gaga started collaborating with producers [[Fernando Garibay]] and [[DJ White Shadow]].<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Shewey|first=Don|date=July 30, 2013|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|title=Lady Gaga's 'ARTPOP': What We Know So Far|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127124958/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eight-things-we-know-about-lady-gagas-artpop-20130730|archivedate=November 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="DJWS">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|title=Lady Gaga 'Doing Prep' for Tour, Next Album|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211093036/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675019/lady-gaga-next-album-tour/|archivedate=December 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="albumname">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|title=Lady Gaga Says Next Album Is 'Beginning to Flourish'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=December 6, 2011|accessdate=January 17, 2012|publisher=MTV News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140507183044/http://www.mtv.com/news/1675458/lady-gaga-next-album/|archivedate=May 7, 2014}}</ref> In the meantime, she began presenting tracks to her record company and hoped to announce the album's working title by September 2013;<ref>{{cite web|last=Carley|first=Brennanan|title=Lady Gaga Teases New Album News|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/483555/lady-gaga-teases-new-album-news|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=June 17, 2012|date=July 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524145532/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/483555/lady-gaga-teases-new-album-news|archivedate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> a revelation that was actually disclosed one month earlier.<ref name="ds2">{{cite web|title=Lady GaGa's new album to be called 'ARTPOP'|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a397438/lady-gagas-new-album-to-be-called-artpop/|last=Rowley|first=Alison|date=August 5, 2012|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=August 6, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212104109/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a397438/lady-gagas-new-album-to-be-called-artpop/|archivedate=December 12, 2015}}</ref> The artist later claimed that ''Artpop'' was her first "real album" comparing herself to a "phoenix rising from the ashes", which reflected her heightened confidence in writing material for the album compared to her previous efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/7440120/lady-gaga-artpop-details|title=Lady Gaga Promises "Fun, Dirty Dance Music" On 'Artpop'|first=Kathy|last=Iandoli|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=September 14, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101164852/http://www.idolator.com/7440120/lady-gaga-artpop-details|archivedate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>

Gaga recruited artist [[Jeff Koons]] for the project in early 2013; the two had met previously at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga "just kind of grabbed ahold of me and gave me a big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'."<ref name="Koonsmtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons/|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means|first=Brenna|last=Ehrlich|publisher=MTV News|date=November 8, 2013|accessdate=November 9, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126133843/http://www.mtv.com/news/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons/|archivedate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> In addition to [[Interscope Records]] notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for ''Artpop'' in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a [[multimedia]] [[application software|software application]] which "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Gaga Reveals Lyrics to Upcoming 'Applause' Single, Talks ARTPOP App Details|url=http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/444381/lady-gaga-reveals-lyrics-to-upcoming-applause-single-talks-artpop-app-details|last=Harrison|first=Lily|date=July 31, 2013|publisher=E!|accessdate=July 31, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220104040/http://www.spin.com/2013/11/lady-gaga-artrave-artpop-review/|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="ARTPOPAnnouncements">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|title=Lady Gaga Announces ''ARTPOP'' Release Date, New Single|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1710440/lady-gaga-artpop-announcement/|publisher=MTV News|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026221325/http://www.mtv.com/news/1710440/lady-gaga-artpop-announcement/|archivedate=October 26, 2014}}</ref>

The interior of the yard was strewn with art pieces and art works. There was a food truck and open bar, and at one end there was a white stage with a spiral staircase. Opposite the stage, across the room, stood a giant statue of Gaga depicted naked, with her hands covering the breasts, created by Koons. In between her spread legs, Koons' characteristic blue gazing ball was placed; the statue was photographed and used in the album cover design for ''Artpop''.<ref name=pitchfork>{{cite news|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/132-lady-gagas-artrave-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-extravagant-album-launch/|title=Lady Gaga's artRave: The Beginning of the End of the Extravagant Album Launch?|last=Phillips|first=Amy|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212222614/http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/132-lady-gagas-artrave-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-extravagant-album-launch/|archivedate=December 12, 2016}}</ref> Between the stage and the Gaga sculpture stood four other statues created by Koons ''[[In flagrante delicto]]'',<ref name=howlady/> as well as the open bars where [[contortionists]] performed their intricate moves. The area was surrounded by large video screens which displayed Gaga's work with Abramović (showing the singer stumbling through a forest naked), Inez and Vinoodh, as well as with Wilson.<ref name=pitchfork/> Adjacent to the main space, there was a side area which featured an art installation called ''Binary Room'', by artist [[Benjamin Rollins Caldwell]], consisting of a room with all the furniture and flooring made up of old computer parts. Another room was dedicated to the display and usage of the Artpop app, as well as the fashions created by the Haus of Gaga for the ArtRave.<ref name=pitchfork/> There were personnel dressed in matching future-esque uniforms to [[Software walkthrough|walkthrough]] the app and its uses, including "the ability to read auras, create animated 3D [[GIF|Gifs]] and remix Gaga's music."<ref name=howlady/>

ArtRave was an "extravagant spectacle" according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Andrew Hampp. However, he also noted that though the event did not have any sponsors, Gaga "was part of a select group of artists who have firmly thrown their branding lot in with the tech–music innovation space". Projects like Creators with ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' and [[Intel]], as well as artists like [[will.i.am]], [[Jay-Z]] and [[Björk]] were cited as precedents for crafting events and merging music and technology with art.<ref name="howlady">{{cite web|title=How Lady Gaga Pulled Off the Impossible: A Multimillion Dollar 'ARTPOP' Release Party Without Sponsorship|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/5785849/how-lady-gaga-pulled-off-the-impossible-a-multimillion-dollar|accessdate=December 10, 2016|date=November 12, 2013|last=Hampp|first=Andrew|work=Billboard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110203416/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/branding/5785849/how-lady-gaga-pulled-off-the-impossible-a-multimillion-dollar|archivedate=November 10, 2016}}</ref> Gaga, who had been named a creative director of [[Polaroid Corporation]] in 2010, had been involved in technical projects like Backplane with her former manager [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]]; Gaga separated from Carter a few days before the ArtRave. But Hampp believed that the explicit nature of the art works and the videos being shown had deprived Gaga of the opportunity of any "overt" sponsorship for the event. He explained that ''Billboard'' had reached out to three executives from [[American Express]] (AmEx), the company which was supposed to sponsor ArtRave but had "backed out" due to creative differences. Speaking off the record, the executives confirmed that AmEx had been slated to bear the expenses of the event as well as the live [[streaming media|streaming]]. They later issued an apology statement:
<blockquote>
American Express had been in discussions to potentially live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. American Express decided not to proceed with the live stream because of an inability to reach a mutual agreement on the production of the event. However, American Express honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an incredible artist and we hope to work together in the future.<ref name=howlady/>

Gaga promoted the dress by [[Twitter|tweeting]] earlier in the day, "At 6pm EST today we will beta test Volantis with the world.

==Critical reception==

Amy Phillips of ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' commended Gaga's performance saying that it was "amazing as usual&nbsp;– a master class in over-the-top theatrics, campy gender-bending, and cheeky fun... But it was almost beside the point. The whole Gaga machine, the whole Gaga world we were immersed in&nbsp;– that was the point. It was overwhelming, all consuming. Something even the best album promo cycles only dream of being." Phillips wondered how Gaga would be able to "top" the ArtRave event and listed it as an unprecedented promotional tool for an artist's album release cycle.<ref name=pitchfork/> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'s}} Andrew Hampp and Jason Lipshutz compared Gaga's outfit to a "bizarro" version of [[Jack Box]], the mascot for [[Jack in the Box]], and wrote that the lip-synched portion of her performance was "more pop art than artistic pop music."<ref name=Hampp/> Hampp and Lipshutz summarized their experience by writing, "Even if the 'ARTPOP' live show still needs a bit of tinkering to fully captivate, Lady Gaga showed on Sunday night that she knows how to meld low art and high art at a party."<ref name=Hampp/> Michael Baggs of ''[[Gigwise]]'' described the concert as "sparse but impressive" and wrote that Gaga appeared "wide-eyed and slightly manic... but impressed with live vocals and a hugely energetic performance."<ref name=Baggs/>

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Marisa G. Muller noted that Gaga spoke of the artists and the personnel involved with the event continuously throughout the night, and "[despite] being more than an hour late, Gaga made her tight-knit audience of little monsters feel special... Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak."<ref name="rsreview"/> David Drake of ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, and lots of other contradictions that make you think about the nature of philosophy and life and art." He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of "Gypsy" and "Do What U Want", and deduced that: "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although ''Artpop'' doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun."<ref name="complexreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/lady-gaga-artrave-review|title=Lady Gaga's artRave: An Expensive Multimedia Extravaganza|last=Drake|first=David|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094404/http://www.complex.com/music/2013/11/lady-gaga-artrave-review|archivedate=June 28, 2017}}</ref>

Carl Swanson of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine was amazed by the ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that "[the] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras as well as those of the feverishly [[Instagram]]ming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." However, he noticed a bit of "vulnerability" in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as "borderline gibberish", adding that: "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less evanescent than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a [[hashtag]] in the wind."<ref name="nymagreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/11/lady-gaga-art-pop.html|title=Lady Gaga's Art Rave&nbsp;— a Pop Artist in Search of Something Bigger|last=Swanson|first=Carl|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110064145/http://www.vulture.com/2013/11/lady-gaga-art-pop.html|archivedate=November 10, 2016}}</ref> Kia Makarechi of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that "[o]nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness."<ref name="huff">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/artrave-lady-gaga-artpop-flying-dress_n_4254387|title=Lady Gaga Throws 'artRave,' Takes Off In Flying Dress|last=Makarechi|first=Kia|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220112307/http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/artrave-lady-gaga-artpop-flying-dress_n_4254387|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Nick Murray of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine criticized the "underwhelming display" of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about "changing the world" with the album and the technology were "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [Gaga] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'."<ref name="spinreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/11/lady-gaga-artrave-artpop-review/|title=Lady Gaga Flies (Sorta), Sings, and Vogues at Multimillion-Dollar 'ArtRave'|last=Murray|first=Nick|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2016|work=Spin|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220104040/http://www.spin.com/2013/11/lady-gaga-artrave-artpop-review/|archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref>
