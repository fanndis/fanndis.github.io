'''ABC News''' (American Brodcasting Company) is the [[journalism|news]] division of [[Walt Disney Television]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) [[broadcast network]]. Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC World News Tonight with David Muir]]''; other programs include [[Breakfast television|morning news-talk show]] ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime]]'', and ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', and [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political affairs]] program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]''.

In addition to the division's television programs, ABC News also has radio and digital outlets, including [[ABC News Radio]] and ABC News Live, plus various podcasts hosted by ABC News personalities.

==History==
===Early years===
ABC began in 1943 as the [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]], a [[radio network]] that was [[Corporate spin-off|spun off]] from [[NBC]], as ordered by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in 1942.<ref>{{cite news|author=Thomas P. Swift|date=January 9, 1942|title=Red and Blue Networks of NBC To Be Split; WJZ May Be Sold|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> The reason for the order was to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]], specifically news and political broadcasting, and broaden the projected [[point of view (philosophy)|points of view]]. The radio market was dominated by only a few companies, such as NBC and [[CBS]]. NBC conducted the split voluntarily{{Explain|reason=|date=May 2020}} in the event that its appeal to the ruling was denied.

Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. Broadcasts continued as the ABC network expanded nationwide. Until the early 1970s, ABC News programs and ABC in general consistently ranked third in viewership behind [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]] news programs. ABC had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]] and a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to support the network's news operations compared to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.

===Roone Arledge===
By the 1970s, the network had effectively turned around, with its prime-time entertainment programs achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to ABC overall. With the appointment of then president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]], [[Roone Arledge]] as president of ABC News in 1977, ABC invested the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast "model", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'', and ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html|title=ESPN Classic – Arledge brought modern innovations to TV sports|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>

ABC News' longtime slogan, "More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source." (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite press release|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>

In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]]. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service, [[Associated Press Television News]] (APTV), while providing material from ABC's news video service, ABC News One, to APTV.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=A.P.

===Modern era===
On August 7, 2014, ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division, [[ABC Audio|ABC Radio]], on January 1, 2015. The change occurred following the announcement that Cumulus would replace its ABC News radio service with [[Westwood One News]] (via [[CNN]]).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Venta|first1=Lance|title=ABC Radio to Expand Operations|url=http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/89657/abc-radio-to-expand-operations/|accessdate=June 1, 2016|work=Radio Insight|date=August 7, 2014}}</ref> On September 20, 2019, ABC Radio was renamed as ABC Audio as the network has evolved to offer a [[podcast]] portfolio and other forms of on-demand and linear content.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Lance |last1=Venta |title=ABC Radio Rebrands As ABC Audio |url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/180635/abc-radio-rebrands-as-abc-audio/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=RadioInsight |date=September 20, 2019}}</ref>

In April 2018, it was announced that ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' would be transferred to ABC News from [[ESPN, Inc.]], majority owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Brian|title=ABC News Takes Over Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/abc-news-ffivethirtyeight-espn-nate-silver-1202755646/|work=Variety|date=17 April 2018}}</ref> On September 10, 2018, ABC News launched a second attempt to extend its Good Morning America brand into the afternoon with [[Strahan, Sara and Keke]].<ref name=vty0>{{cite news |last1=Steinberg |first1=Brian |title=Michael Strahan, Sara Haines Will Carry 'GMA' From Morning to Afternoon |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/michael-strahan-sara-haines-gma-day-good-morning-america-1202929220/ |accessdate=November 9, 2018 |work=Variety |date=September 6, 2018}}</ref> In May 2019, ABC News Live, an news focused steaming channel, was launched on Roku.<ref name="vty1">{{cite news |last1=Roettgers |first1=Janko |title=ABC Launches New 24/7 Online News Network 'ABC News Live' Exclusively on Roku Channel |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/abc-news-live-roku-1202783981/ |accessdate=January 15, 2020 |work=Variety |date=April 24, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Following an reorganization of ABC's parent company, The Walt Disney Company which created the Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International segment in March 2018, ABC News' Digital and Live Streaming, including ABC News Live and FiveThirtyEight, were transferred to the new segment.<ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Spangler|first1=Todd|title=Disney Reorganizes Divisions, Creates Dedicated Direct-to-Consumer Streaming Unit|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/disney-reorganizes-direct-to-consumer-streaming-unit-1202726528/|accessdate=March 15, 2018|work=Variety|date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>

===Former===

====Satellite News Channel====
{{main|Satellite News Channel}}
[[Satellite News Channel]] was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] that launched on June 21, 1982, as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and seven [[Washington, D.C.]]-based crews, in addition to stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, [[CNN]] (a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]]). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel's operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]] on most cable systems. Group W eventually shut down seven years later, in 1999. Following Satellite News Channel's discontinuation, ABC News did not return to 24-hour cable news until 22 years later, in 2004, when they launched [[ABC News Now]], whose launch indicated that Satellite News Channel was ABC News' first attempt in the 24-hour cable news world.

====ABC News Now====
ABC News Now was a [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[Cable television|cable]] [[News broadcasting|news]] [[Cable network|network]] that launched on July 26, 2004 as a [[digital subchannel]] by ABC News, being the company's second attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after [[Satellite News Channel]]. It was offered via [[digital television]], [[broadband]] and [[Streaming media|streaming video]] at ABCNews.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.com|title=ABC News|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref> and on [[mobile phones]]. It delivered [[breaking news]], headline news each half hour, and wide range of [[entertainment]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[Broadcast programming|programming]]. The channel was available in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel when after its experimental phase had ended with the President inauguration in 2005. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] on October 28, 2013.

====Fusion====
{{main|Fusion TV}}
[[Fusion TV|Fusion]] is a [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] network that is owned & operated by [[Fusion Media Group]], LLC, which was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Univision Communications]]. ABC and Univision formally announced its launch on May 2, 2012. Launched on October 28, 2013, Fusion features a mix of traditional news and investigative programs along with satirical content aimed at English-speaking [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] adults between the ages of 18 and 34.<ref name=tvc>{{cite web |title=ABC, Univision teaming on News Network|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/59240/abc-univision-teaming-on-news-network|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC and Univision Announce New Cable Network 'Fusion' Will Launch Later in 2013 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/abc-news-univision-announce-cable-network-called-fusion/t/story?id=18468776|work=ABC News|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Fusion was ABC News' third attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after [[Satellite News Channel]] in 1982 and [[ABC News Now]] (which it replaced) in 2004.

In [[Australia]], [[Sky News Australia]] airs daily broadcasts of ''World News Tonight'' (at 10:30&nbsp;a.m.) and ''Nightline'' (at 1:30&nbsp;a.m.) as well as weekly airings of ''20/20'' (on Wednesdays at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., with an extended version at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally ''Primetime'' (at 1:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country's [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], operates its own unrelated news division that is also named [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content sharing agreement with the [[Nine Network]], which also broadcasts ''GMA'' domestically in the early morning before its own [[Today (Australian TV program)|breakfast program]].

In [[New Zealand]], ''ABC World News'' was broadcast daily at 5:10&nbsp;p.m. and again at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., [[TVNZ 7]] (owned by [[Television New Zealand]]) aired the program commercial-free, until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.
