====Drug conviction in 2014====

====Arrest on immigration charges in 2019====
On February 3, 2019, just two days after releasing the music video for his single "[[A Lot (song)|A Lot]]", 21 Savage was taken into custody by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) after a vehicle was pulled over that contained him and his cousin, [[Young Nudy]], and two other men. Young Nudy and the two other men had been targeted in an operation involving charges of [[aggravated assault]] and violation of the Georgia Gang Act.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strauss |first=Matthew |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-ice-detention-allegedly-instigated-by-the-arrest-of-his-cousin-young-nudy/ |title=21 Savage's ICE Detention Allegedly Instigated by the Arrest of His Cousin Young Nudy |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=February 4, 2019 |access-date=February 16, 2019 |archive-date=February 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190208104628/https://pitchfork.com/news/21-savage-ice-detention-allegedly-instigated-by-the-arrest-of-his-cousin-young-nudy/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

After his arrest, ICE revealed that 21 Savage is a [[British nationality law|British]] national who has been in the United States unlawfully since his non-immigrant visa expired in July 2006. 21 Savage's management team expresses he has been trying to get his Visa renewed since the year 2017. Before this, 21 Savage had commonly been believed to be a native of the Atlanta area – e.g., ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine had reported in an interview with [[Seth Rogen]] in April 2018 that the rapper's birthplace was Atlanta, Georgia, and in a 2016 interview with ''[[XXL Magazine]]'', he said he was "from Decatur, Georgia" (which is in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]).<ref name=Ortiz/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |title=21 Savage |first=Seth |last=Rogen |website=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=<!-- No date for the article is given on the website --> |accessdate=February 3, 2019 |quote=Born Shayaa Bin Abraham-Joseph in Atlanta, Georgia... |archive-date=February 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206073220/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/21-savage-seth-rogen-interview |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Andrews |first1=Travis |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE agents, who say he's from the United Kingdom, not Atlanta |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |website=Washington Post |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=February 3, 2019 |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204025709/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/02/03/rapper-savage-arrested-by-ice-agents-who-say-hes-united-kingdom-not-atlanta/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Dowd |agency=AP |url=https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |title=Rapper 21 Savage arrested by ICE, which alleges he is actually British |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=February 3, 2019 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203213426/https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/21-savage-atlanta-arrested-british-visa-13585649.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Theft by deception charges in 2019====
On February 15, 2019, 21 Savage turned himself in to authorities and was booked into a south Georgia jail in response to a warrant for his arrest for felony [[theft by deception]].

He was released on his own recognizance, pending a court hearing on a later date to resolve the charge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/atlanta-rapper-savage-booked-into-georgia-jail-felony-warrant/lLqFGDcVJvWyfPgx54o5RM/ |title=Atlanta rapper 21 Savage booked into S.
