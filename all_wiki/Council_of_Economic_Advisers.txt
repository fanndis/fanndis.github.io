The '''Council of Economic Advisers''' ('''CEA''') is a [[United States]] agency within the [[Executive Office of the President]] established in 1946, which advises the [[President of the United States]] on economic policy.<ref>{{Citation |title=Council of Economic Advisers |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/}}</ref> The CEA provides much of the empirical research for the [[White House]] and prepares the annual '''Economic Report of the President'''.

==Economic Report of the President==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}
{{expand section|date=September 2019}}
}}
The report is published by the CEA in February of each year. It reviews what [[economy|economic]] activity was of impact in the previous year, outlines the economic goals for the coming year (based on the President's economic agenda), and makes numerical projections of how the economy will perform. Criticism usually follows, sometimes attacking the importance placed or not placed on particular data, and also on the importance of particular goals presented in the overview. Actual data, related to or used in the report, are from the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] and U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==History: 1946–1978==
The Truman administration established the Council of Economic Advisers via the [[Employment Act of 1946]] to provide presidents with objective economic analysis and advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and international economic policy issues. It was a step from an "ad hoc style of economic policy-making to a more institutionalized and focused process". In 1949 Chairman [[Edwin Nourse]] and member [[Leon Keyserling]] argued about whether the advice should be private or public and about the role of government in economic stabilization.<ref name=green>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/cea/about.html#1a Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan. Receipt of the Truman Medal for Economic Policy. Before the Truman Medal Award and Economics Conference, Kansas City, Missouri] October 26, 2005, Council of Economic Advisers website under President Bush</ref>

Nourse believed a choice had to be made between "[[guns or butter]]" but Keyserling argued for deficit spending, asserting that an expanding economy could afford large defense expenditures without sacrificing an increased standard of living. In 1949, Keyserling gained support from Truman advisors [[Dean Acheson]] and [[Clark Clifford]]. Nourse resigned as chairman, warning about the dangers of budget deficits and increased funding of "wasteful" defense costs. Keyserling succeeded to the chairmanship and influenced Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals and the economic sections of [[NSC 68]] that, in April 1950, asserted that the larger armed forces America needed would not affect living standards or risk the "transformation of the free character of our economy."<ref>Brune 1989</ref>

During the [[The Recession of 1953|1953–54 recession]], the CEA, headed by [[Arthur Burns]] deployed non-traditional [[Neo-Keynesian economics|neo-keynesian interventions]], which provided results later called the "steady fifties" wherein many families stayed in the economic "middle class" with just one family wage-earner. The Eisenhower Administration supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish [[Keynesianism]] as a possible bipartisan economic policy for the nation. Especially important in formulating the CEA response to the recession—accelerating [[public works]] programs, easing credit, and reducing taxes—were Arthur F. Burns and [[Neil H. Jacoby]].<ref>Engelbourg 1980</ref>

Until 1963, during its first seven years the CEA made five technical advances in policy making, including the replacement of a "cyclical model" of the economy by a "growth model," the setting of quantitative targets for the economy, use of the theories of fiscal drag and full-employment budget, recognition of the need for greater flexibility in taxation, and replacement of the notion of unemployment as a structural problem by a realization of a low aggregate demand.<ref>Salant 1973</ref>

The 1978 [[Humphrey–Hawkins Full Employment Act]] required each administration to move toward [[full employment]] and reasonable price stability within a specific time period. It has been criticized for making CEA's annual economic report highly political in nature, as well as highly unreliable and inaccurate over the standard two or five year projection periods.<ref>Cimbala and Stout 1983</ref>

==History: 1978–present==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Since 1980, the CEA has focused on sources of economic growth, the supply side of the economy, and on international issues.<ref name=green/> In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008–2009, the Council of Economic Advisers played a significant role in supporting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Flickenschild; Michael|first=Afonso, Alexandre|date=2018|title=Networks of economic policy expertise in Germany and the United States in the wake of the Great Recession|journal=Journal of European Public Policy|volume=26|issue=9|pages=1292–1311|doi=10.1080/13501763.2018.1518992|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Under the direction of [[Kevin Hassett]] during the Donald Trump presidency, the CEA released a report vilifying socialism and associating what they characterized as the "socialist" policies of liberal politicians to those of historical authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/socialist-democrats-trump-elections.html|title=What Could Kill Booming U.S. Economy?

==Organization==
The council's chairman is nominated by the president and confirmed by the [[United States Senate]]. The members are appointed by the president. As of July 2017, the Council's 18 person staff consisted of a chief of staff (Director of Macroeconomic Forecasting), 15 economists (5 senior, 4 research, 4 staff economists, 2 economic statisticians) and 2 operations staff.<ref>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/staff Council of Economic Advisers. Staff] Whitehouse.gov, n.d. accessed 29 July 2017</ref> Many of the staff economists are academics on leave or government economists on temporary assignment from other agencies.<ref name=":0" />
