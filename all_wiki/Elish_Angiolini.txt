'''Dame Elish Frances Angiolini''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DBE|PC|QC|FRSA|FRSE}} (née '''McPhilomy'''; born 24 June 1960<ref name="Who's Who">"Angiolini, Elish Frances" in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]]'', [[A & C Black]].</ref>) is a Scottish lawyer. She was the [[Lord Advocate]] of [[Scotland]] from 2006 until 2011, having previously been [[Solicitor General for Scotland|Solicitor General]] since 2001. She was the first woman, the first [[Procurator Fiscal]], and the first solicitor to hold either post. Since September 2012, Angiolini is the Principal of [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]]. She is a Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]] and Chancellor of [[University of the West of Scotland]]. Since leaving office she has led several investigations and inquiries, including a review of deaths in police custody<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deaths-and-serious-incidents-in-police-custody|title=Deaths and serious incidents in police custody|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> commissioned by the then-Home Secretary [[Theresa May]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/home-secretary-announces-review-of-deaths-in-policy-custody|title=Home Secretary announces review of deaths in police custody|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Angiolini was born on 24 June 1960 to Mary (''née'' Magill) and James McPhilomy.<ref name="Who's Who" /> She grew up in [[Govan]], Glasgow in a working-class family; her father was a coal merchant and later worked for [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and then as a commercial driver.<ref name="Carrell"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNSGTA4D03w |title=Eye To Eye – Elish Angiolini |publisher=YouTube |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> As a child she wanted to be a ballet dancer.<ref name="scotsman.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/interview_elish_angiolini_lord_advocate_1_1532502 |title=Interview: Elish Angiolini, Lord Advocate |work=[[The Scotsman]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> One of her first summer jobs was working on a checkout at [[Marks & Spencer]].<ref name="scotsman.com"/> She was educated at [[Notre Dame High School (Glasgow)|Notre Dame High School for Girls]] in the West End of the city, and studied at the [[Strathclyde Law School|School of Law]] of the [[University of Strathclyde]], obtaining an LLB (Hons) in 1982 and a [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] in 1983.

Angiolini's first encounter with the legal profession came when, as a teenager, she was asked to give evidence in a burglary trial. Later, she recalled: "I was not terribly impressed. There were a lot of important people in gowns and witnesses were left a very long time in the witness room and not given any information... All the attention was focused on the permanent figures of the court, while ... witnesses, and those in the dock, seemed irrelevant". The experience inspired Angiolini to pursue a career in law.<ref name="scotsman.com"/> Later as Regional Procurator Fiscal, Angiolini piloted a victim liaison scheme which was subsequently extended throughout Scotland.<ref name="journalonline.co.uk">{{cite news |url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Magazine/47-1/1000046.aspx |title=Interview: Elish Angiolini |first=Roger |last=Mackenzie |work=The Journal |publisher=[[Law Society of Scotland]] |date=1 January 2002 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>

==Early legal career==
Upon completing her legal studies, she joined the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] to train as a [[Procurator Fiscal]] (public prosecutor). Whilst a trainee, she survived the [[Polmont rail accident]]; two passengers sitting next to her were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firmmagazine.com/news/1987/Angiolini_tells_of_Polmont_disaster_survival_.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=4 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813180225/http://www.firmmagazine.com/news/1987/Angiolini_tells_of_Polmont_disaster_survival_.html|archivedate=13 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Following her training, Angiolini spent 8 years as a Depute Procurator Fiscal in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]], prosecuting in Airdrie [[Sheriff Court]]. In 1992, she was seconded to the [[Crown Office]] where she worked in the [[Lord Advocate]]'s Secretariat.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/people/rt-hon-dame-elish-f-angiolini-dbe-qc-frse|title=The Rt Hon Dame Elish F Angiolini DBE QC FRSE, Principal of St Hugh's College|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Oxford, Faculty of Law|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> During her secondment, she developed an interest in improving the support offered to vulnerable victims and witnesses, and in particular to children. She was then appointed Senior Depute Procurator Fiscal at Glasgow, taking operational responsibility for Sheriff and Jury prosecutions. In 1995, she was promoted to Assistant Procurator Fiscal at Glasgow.<ref name=":0" />

In 1997, Angiolini returned to the Crown Office as Head of Policy, with responsibility for the development of policy across all functions of the Department. In particular, she helped the department prepare for [[devolution]] and was involved in the preparation of the [[Scotland Act 1998]]. At the same time, Angiolini was responsible for the department's preparations for the introduction of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].

She was then appointed Regional Procurator Fiscal for [[Grampian]], [[Highland and Islands]] (based at [[Aberdeen]]) on 27 July 2000 – the first woman to hold such a post.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishopera.org.uk/biographiespage/the-board-of-scottish-opera|title=The Board of|publisher=Scottish Opera|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> In this role she piloted a victim liaison scheme which was subsequently extended across the country.<ref name="journalonline.co.uk"/>

==Solicitor General==
Angiolini was appointed [[Solicitor General for Scotland]] by First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] in 2001. Angiolini was the first solicitor, as opposed to advocate, to be appointed Solicitor General; this was not received favourably amongst all members of the legal profession.<ref name="Carrell"/>

In 2006, Jack McConnell praised Angiolini's work as Solicitor General, saying the decision to appoint her had been one of the best he had ever made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1003519.aspx|title=Angiolini first non-advocate Lord Advocate|work=The Journal|publisher=Law Society of Scotland|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref>

==Lord Advocate==
Following the resignation of [[Colin Boyd, Baron Boyd of Duncansby|Lord Boyd]], First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] nominated Angiolini for the post of [[Lord Advocate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/5408286.stm |title=Angiolini choice for top law post|work=BBC News|date=5 October 2006}}</ref> Her nomination was passed by Parliament on 5 October 2006, with 99 in favour, 0 against and 15 abstentions.<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-06/sor1005-02.htm#Col28335 "The Scottish Parliament Official Report"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312064130/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-06/sor1005-02.htm |date=12 March 2007 }}, [[Scottish Parliament|The Scottish Parliament]], 5 October 2006. URL retrieved 12 October 2006</ref> She was sworn in at the [[Court of Session]] on 12 October 2006 and one month later she was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10372.asp|title=Archived copy|accessdate=20 December 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101110353/http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10372.asp|archivedate=1 January 2007}}</ref>

After the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]] there was speculation that the new [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|SNP administration]] might replace Angiolini. On the morning after the election, Angiolini had cleared her office and was preparing to leave when she received a phone call from [[Alex Salmond]], the new [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]]. Angiolini congratulated Salmond on his election, and said that she had packed up her things. "Unpack your things, and come and see me", replied Salmond. Salmond decided that Angiolini should stay in post, and would continue not to attend Cabinet except to provide advice or to make representations about her own department as had been the case with the former administration following the departure of her predecessor. Her reappointment was agreed by Parliament on 24 May 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6686885.stm |title=Law officer Angiolini reappointed |work=BBC News |date=24 May 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2007}}</ref> This made her the first Lord Advocate to serve two different governments.<ref name="Carrell"/>

Later in 2007, Angiolini clashed publicly with the [[Lord President of the Court of Session|head of Scotland's judiciary]], [[Arthur Hamilton, Lord Hamilton|Lord President Hamilton]], over the collapse of the [[World's End murders]] trial. The trial judge, [[Matthew Clarke, Lord Clarke|Lord Clarke]], had ruled there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict and threw the case out. Angiolini then made a statement to the [[Scottish Parliament]], saying she was "disappointed" at the decision, a move Hamilton said undermined the [[independence of the judiciary]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Top judge enters World's End row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7015884.stm|work=BBC News|date=27 September 2007|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Leading judge steps into legal row over murder trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/28/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=14 January 2011|first=Severin|last=Carrell|location=London}}</ref>

Angiolini announced in October 2010 that she would step down from the role of Lord Advocate after the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|Scottish Parliament elections in May 2011]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Lord Advocate announces she will step down at the next Scottish election|url=http://www.copfs.gov.uk/media-site/media-releases/274-lord-advocate-announces-she-will-step-down-at-the-next-scottish-election|publisher=Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Elish Angiolini moves on|url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/sln/blogentry.aspx?blogentryref=8399|publisher=Scots Law News|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025010416/http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/sln/blogentry.aspx?blogentryref=8399|archivedate=25 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Alex Salmond paid tribute to Angiolini, saying "her term as Lord Advocate has been marked by significant improvements and substantial success in the disposal of justice in Scotland".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scottishlaw.blogspot.com/2010/10/lord-advocate-elish-angiolini-to-step.html|title=Scottish Law Reporter: Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini to step down 'at next election' as suitors circle for Law Chief’s job|website=Scottishlaw.blogspot.com|date=1 October 2010|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> She was succeeded on 19 May 2011 by [[Frank Mulholland, Lord Mulholland|Francis Mulholland]].
