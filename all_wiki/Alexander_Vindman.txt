Vindman came to national attention in October 2019 when he testified before the [[United States Congress]] regarding the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]]. His testimony provided evidence that resulted in a charge of [[abuse of power]] in the [[impeachment of Donald Trump]].

Commissioned in 1999 as an [[Infantry Branch (United States)|infantry officer]], Vindman received a [[Purple Heart]] medal for wounds he received from an [[Improvised explosive device|IED attack]] in the [[Iraq War]] in 2004.<ref name=ArmyTimes /><ref name="NYTWhoIs" /> Vindman became a [[foreign area officer]] specializing in [[Eurasia]] in 2008, and assumed the position of Director for European Affairs with the NSC in 2018.

In July 2020, Vindman retired after 21 years in the military. He cited vengeful behavior and bullying by President Trump and administration officials after he complied with a subpoena to testify in front of Congress during Trump's impeachment hearings. At the time of his retirement, Vindman's promotion to the rank of colonel had been abnormally stalled by the administration.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Vindman, Key Impeachment Witness, Retires Over 'Bullying, Intimidation' By Trump|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/07/08/888933684/lt-col-vindman-witness-in-trump-impeachment-is-retiring-from-military|access-date=2020-07-11|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2020|title=Lt.

Vindman testified that: "In Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false and alternative narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency," which was "harmful to U.S. national security" and also "undermined U.S. Government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine."<ref name=opening/>

Vindman states that, additionally, he was concerned by two events, both of which he objected to with senior officials in real time, and which he reported to the National Security Council's lead attorney. The first event occurred at a July 10 meeting between Ukraine's then [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|Secretary of National Security and Defense Council]] [[Oleksandr Danylyuk]], and then [[National Security Advisor (United States)|US National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]], at which Ambassadors [[Kurt Volker|Volker]] and [[Gordon Sondland|Sondland]], and Energy Secretary [[Rick Perry]] were in attendance, and at which Sondland asked Ukraine to launch investigations into the [[Joe Biden|Bidens]] in order to get a meeting with President Trump. Vindman states that Bolton cut the meeting short, and that both Vindman and Hill told Ambassador Sondland that his comments were inappropriate and reported their concerns to the NSC's lead counsel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/read-national-security-official-alexander-s-vindman-s-prepared-remarks-n1073156 |date=October 29, 2019 |title=Read national security official Alexander S.

{{Trump-Ukraine scandal}}

The second event occurred on a July 25 phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky. Vindman states, "I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. Government's support of Ukraine. I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained. This would all undermine U.S. national security." Vindman also stated that he reported his concern to the NSC's lead counsel, [[John Eisenberg]].<ref name=opening/>

Vindman later testified in person before the US House of Representatives on November 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/18/who-is-alexander-vindman-why-does-his-public-testimony-matter/ |title=Who is Alexander Vindman and why does his public testimony matter? |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> In his testimony, Vindman stated that he made a report to an intelligence official about what he heard during Trump's call with the Ukrainian President and felt what the President mentioned during the phone conversation was "improper."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/19/impeachment-hearings-live-highlights-and-updates-071459 |title=Impeachment hearings: Live highlights from Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams' testimony |publisher=Politico |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lt-col-alexander-vindman-reveals-in-testimony-that-he-told-an-intelligence-official-about-trumps-call-with-ukrainian-leader/2019/11/19/61c46b16-0ae4-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html |title=Lt.

On February 10, 2020, Senate Minority Leader [[Chuck Schumer]] (D-NY) sent a letter in an apparent response to the firing of the two brothers that requested federal Inspectors General investigate possible retaliation against "anyone who has made, or in the future makes, protected disclosures of presidential misconduct." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whistleblowers-retaliation-inspectors-general-investigate-sen-schumer/|title=Schumer calls on inspectors general to investigate retaliation against whistleblowers|website=www.cbsnews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-07-09}}</ref> On February 13, Trump’s former chief of staff, retired Marine Gen.
