'''Member of the Scottish Parliament''' ('''MSP'''; {{lang-gd|Ball Pàrlamaid na h-Alba, BPA}}; {{lang-sco|Memmer o the Scots Pairliament, MSP}}) is the title given to any one of the 129 individuals elected to serve in the [[Scottish Parliament]].

==Electoral system==
The [[additional member system]] produces a form of [[proportional representation]], where each constituency has its own representative, and each region has seats given to political parties to reflects as closely as possible its level of support among voters.<ref name="ScotGovFAQs">{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/About/Information/FAQs |title=About: Information resources: FAQs |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Each registered voter is asked to cast 2 votes, resulting in MSPs being elected in one of two ways:
* 73 are elected as [[First past the post]] [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituency]] MSPs and;
* 56 are elected as [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|Regional]] additional member MSPs. Seven are elected from each of eight regional groups of [[constituencies]].<ref name="ScotParlWorks">{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/PublicInformationdocuments/HTSPW-240613.pdf |title=How the Scottish Parliament works |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=July 2013 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062438/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/PublicInformationdocuments/HTSPW-240613.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2014 }}</ref>

==Types of candidates==
With the additional members system, there are 3 ways in which a person can stand to be a MSP:<ref name="Standing2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/110075/Key-CA-Scotland-web-and-email.pdf |title=Standing for Scottish Parliamentary election |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]]|date=February 2011|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>
* a constituency candidate
* a candidate named on a party list at the regional election
* an individual candidate at the regional election

A candidate may stand both in a constituency and on a regional list. Constituency seats are decided first. Candidates who succeed in being elected to a constituency seat will then have their name removed from the regional list process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Research%20briefings%20and%20fact%20sheets/Scottish_Parliament_Electoral_System.pdf |title=Scottish Parliament Fact sheet: Scottish Parliament Electoral System |publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] | date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>

==Elections==
All MSP positions become simultaneously vacant for [[elections]] held on a five-year cycle. The [[Scotland Act 1998]] as amended by the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] sets out that ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May, every five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Recess_Dissolution_Parliamentary_Years.pdf |title=Scottish Parliament Fact Sheet: Dates of Recess, Dissolution and Parliamentary Years |publisher=Scottish Parliament |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=21 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010125435/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Recess_Dissolution_Parliamentary_Years.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

If a [[Vacancy (politics)|vacancy]] arises at another time, due to death or resignation, then it may be filled in one of two ways, depending on whether the [[Vacancy (politics)|vacancy]] is for a [[first-past-the-post]] [[constituency]] MSP or for an additional-member MSP.

A constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. An additional-member vacancy may be filled by the next available candidate on the relevant party list. In the event that there is no next available person, the vacancy will then remain. This situation occurred in April 2014 following the death of [[Margo MacDonald]], independent MSP for the Lothian region.

==Title==
An MSP is known as ''Name'' MSP (''Name'' BPA in Gaelic). For instance, [[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]] can be entitled either Mike Russell MSP or Mìcheal Ruiseal BPA.
