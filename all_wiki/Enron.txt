'''Enron Corporation''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Energy development|energy]], [[Commodity|commodities]], and services company based in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It was founded in 1985 as a merger between [[Houston Natural Gas]] and [[InterNorth]], both relatively small regional companies. Before its bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, Enron employed approximately 29,000 staff and was a major [[electricity]], [[natural gas]], communications and [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] company, with claimed revenues of nearly $101&nbsp;billion during 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/snapshots/2001/478.html|title=FORTUNE 500: Enron|publisher=Fortune}}</ref> ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' named Enron "America's Most Innovative Company" for six consecutive years.

At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron's reported financial condition was sustained by an institutionalized, systemic and creatively planned [[accounting scandals|accounting fraud]], known since as the [[Enron scandal]]. Enron has since become a well-known example of willful corporate [[fraud]] and [[Corporate crime|corruption]]. The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the [[United States]] and was a factor in the enactment of the [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002. The scandal also affected the greater business world by causing the dissolution of the [[Arthur Andersen]] accounting firm, which had been Enron's main auditor for years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2047122.stm|work=BBC News|title=Andersen guilty in Enron case|date=June 15, 2002|access-date=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

Enron filed for bankruptcy in the [[Southern District of New York]] in late 2001 and selected [[Weil, Gotshal & Manges]] as its bankruptcy counsel. It ended its bankruptcy during November 2004, pursuant to a court-approved plan of reorganization. A new board of directors changed the name of Enron to '''Enron Creditors Recovery Corp'''., and emphasized reorganizing and liquidating certain operations and assets of the pre-bankruptcy Enron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enron.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=1&Itemid=2|title=Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. - About ECRC|date=2011-12-06|website=Enron|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206225533/http://www.enron.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=1&Itemid=2|archive-date=2011-12-06|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-04-09}}</ref> On September 7, 2006, Enron sold [[Prisma Energy International|Prisma Energy International Inc.]], its last remaining business, to Ashmore Energy International Ltd.

==History==

=== Pre-merger origins (1925–1985) ===

==== InterNorth ====
One of Enron's primary predecessors was [[InterNorth]], which was formed in 1930, in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] just a few months after [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]]. The low cost of [[natural gas]] and cheap labor supply during the [[Great Depression]] helped to fuel the company's early beginnings. The company doubled in size by 1932 and was able to bring the first natural gas to [[Minnesota]]. Over the next 50 years, Northern expanded even more as it acquired many energy companies. It was reorganized in 1979 as the main subsidiary of a [[holding company]], [[InterNorth]], which was a diversified energy and energy-related products company. Although most of the acquisitions conducted were successful, some ended poorly. InterNorth competed with [[Cooper Industries]] over a hostile takeover of [[Crouse-Hinds Company]], an electrical products manufacturer. InterNorth was ultimately unsuccessful as Cooper bought out Crouse-Hinds. Cooper and InterNorth feuded over numerous suits during the course of the takeover that were eventually settled after the transaction was completed. The subsidiary Northern Natural Gas operated the largest natural gas pipeline company in North America. By the 1980s, InterNorth became a major force for natural gas production, transmission, and marketing as well as for natural gas liquids, and was an innovator in the [[plastics industry]].<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/57/Enron-Corporation.html|title=Enron Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Enron Corporation|website=referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref> In 1983, InterNorth merged with the Belco Petroleum Company, a [[Fortune 500]] oil exploration and development company founded by [[Arthur Belfer]].<ref name=Funding>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/belco-oil-gas-corp-history/|title=Funding Universe: History of Belco Oil & Gas Corp|access-date=September 21, 2017}}</ref>

==== Houston Natural Gas ====
The [[Houston Natural Gas]] (HNG) corporation was initially formed from the Houston Oil Co. in 1925 to provide gas to customers in the Houston market through the building of [[Pipeline transport|gas pipelines]]. Under the leadership of CEO Robert Herring from 1967 to 1981, the company became a large dominant force in the energy industry with a large pipeline network as a result from a prosperous period of growth in the early to mid-1970s. This growth was largely a result of the exploitation of the unregulated Texas natural gas market and the commodity surge in the early 1970s. Toward the end of the 1970s, HNG's luck began to run out with rising gas prices forcing clients to switch to oil. In addition, with the passing of the [[Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978]], the Texas market was more difficult to profit from and as a result, HNG's profits fell. After Herring's death in 1981, [[M.D. Matthews]] briefly took over as CEO in a 3-year stint with initial success, but ultimately, a big dip in earnings led to his exit. In 1984, [[Kenneth Lay]] succeeded Matthews and inherited the troubled, but large diversified energy conglomerate.<ref>{{cite book|title=Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies|last=Bradley|first=Robert L.|publisher=Scrivener|year=2011|isbn=978-0470917367|pages=371–372, 464–467}}</ref>

==== Merger ====
InterNorth, in its conservative success, became a target of corporate takeovers, the most prominent being corporate raider [[Irwin L. Jacobs|Irwin Jacobs.]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A Financial History of Modern U.S. Corporate Scandals from Enron to Reform|last=Markham|first=Jerry W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0765615835|via=Credo Reference}}</ref> InterNorth CEO Sam Segnar, in searching for a company to merge with to fend off takeover attempts as a poison pill, discovered HNG. In May 1985, Internorth acquired HNG for $2.3 billion, 40% higher than the current market price,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/enron.htm|title=The Rise and Fall of Enron|last=Watkins|first=Thayer|website=San Jose State University|access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> in order to avoid the corporate takeover attempt. The combined assets of the two companies would create the second largest gas pipeline system at the time in the United States.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/doe08|title=Enron Corporation|last=Frontain|first=Michael|date=June 12, 2010|website=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> Internorth’s north-south pipelines that served Iowa and Minnesota complemented HNG’s Florida and California east-west pipelines well.<ref name=":1" />

=== Post-merger rise (1985–1991) ===
The company was initially named "HNG/InterNorth Inc.", even though InterNorth was technically the parent.<ref name=":2" /> At the outset, Segnar was CEO for a short time, before he was fired by the Board of Directors whereupon Lay was tapped to be the new CEO. Lay moved the headquarters of the new company back to energy capital Houston. The company then set out to find a new name, spent upwards of $100,000 in focus groups and consulting before "Enteron" was suggested. The name was eventually dismissed over its apparent likening to an intestine and shortened to "Enron".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> (The distinctive logo was one of the final major projects of legendary graphic designer [[Paul Rand]] before his death in 1996.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2015/04/08/looking-back-designs-paul-rand/hjnIvMIwXxYThxjmDXhnZM/story.html|title=Looking back at the designs of Paul Rand - The Boston Globe|last=Feeney|first=Mark|date=April 8, 2015|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/conspiracyoffool00kurt/page/137|title=Conspiracy of fools : a true story|last=Eichenwald|first=Kurt|date=2005|publisher=Broadway Books|isbn=9780767911795|edition=1st trade paperback|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/conspiracyoffool00kurt/page/137 137]|oclc=62936217}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://designobserver.com/feature/the-smartest-logo-in-the-room/6237|title=The Smartest Logo in the Room|last=Bierut|first=Michael|date=February 11, 2008|work=Design Observer|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en}}</ref> Enron still had some lingering problems left over from its merger, however. The company had to pay Jacobs, who was still a threat, over $350 million and reorganize the company.<ref name=":0" /> Lay sold off any parts of the company that he believed didn't belong in the long-term future of Enron. Lay consolidated all the gas pipeline efforts under the Enron Gas Pipeline Operating Company. In addition, the company began to ramp up its electric power and natural gas efforts. In 1988 and 1989, the company began adding power plants and [[cogeneration]] units to its portfolio. In 1989, [[Jeffrey Skilling]], then a consultant at [[McKinsey & Company]], came up with the idea to link natural gas to consumers in more ways, effectively turning natural gas into a commodity. Enron adopted the idea and called it the "Gas Bank". The division's success prompted Skilling to join Enron as the head of the Gas Bank in 1991.<ref name=":2" /> Another major development inside Enron was the beginning of the company's pivot to overseas that was expanded upon in the 1990s. Starting in 1989, the company received a $56 million loan from the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC) for a power plant in Argentina.

====Timeline (1985–1992)====
=====1980s=====

* New regulations gradually create a market-pricing system for natural gas. [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) Order 436 (1985) provides blanket approval for pipelines that choose to become common carriers transporting gas intrastate. FERC Order 451 (1986) deregulates the wellhead, and FERC Order 490 (April 1988) authorizes producers, pipelines, and others to terminate gas sales or purchases without seeking prior FERC approval. As a result of these orders, more than 75% of gas sales are conducted through the spot market, and unprecedented market volatility exists.<ref name="fusaro" />

======July 1985======

* [[Houston]] Natural Gas, run by [[Kenneth Lay]] merges with [[Internorth]], a natural gas company in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], to form an interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline with approximately 37,000 miles of pipeline.<ref name="fusaro">Fusaro, Peter C, ''What went wrong with Enron''.

* [[Jeff Skilling]] hires [[Andrew Fastow]] from the banking industry; he starts as account director and quickly rises within the ranks of ECT<ref name="fusaro" />

=====1991=====
* Enron adopts [[mark-to-market accounting]] practices, reporting income and value of assets at their replacement cost<ref name="fusaro" />
* [[Rebecca Mark]] becomes Chairman and [[CEO]] of Enron Development Corp., a unit formed to pursue international markets<ref name="mimi" />
* [[Andy Fastow]] forms the first of many off-balance-sheet partnerships for legitimate purposes. Later, off-balance-sheet partnerships and transactions will become a way for money losing ventures to be concealed and income reporting to be accelerated.<ref name="fusaro" />

=====1992=====
* Enron acquires Transportadora de Gas del Sur<ref name="fusaro" />

=== 1991–2000 ===
Over the course of the 1990s, Enron made a few changes to its business plan that greatly improved the perceived profitability of the company. First, Enron invested heavily in overseas assets, specifically energy. Another major shift was the gradual transition of focus from a producer of energy to a company that acted more like an investment firm and sometimes a [[hedge fund]], making profits off the margins of the products it traded. These products were traded through the Gas Bank concept, now called the Enron Finance Corp. headed by Skilling.<ref name=":0" />

==== Operations as a trading firm ====
With the success of the Gas Bank trading natural gas, Skilling looked to expand the horizons of his division, Enron Capital & Trade. Skilling hired [[Andrew Fastow]] in 1990 to help with this.

==== Entrance into the retail energy market ====
Starting in 1994 under the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]], Congress allowed states to deregulate their electricity utilities, allowing them to be opened for competition. California was one such state to do so. Enron, seeing an opportunity with rising prices, was eager to jump into the market. In 1997, Enron acquired [[Portland General Electric]] (PGE). Although an Oregon utility, it had potential to begin serving the massive California market since PGE was a regulated utility. The new Enron division, Enron Energy, ramped up its efforts by offering discounts to potential customers in California for switching their electric supplier to Enron from their previous supplier, starting in 1998. Enron Energy also began to sell natural gas to customers in Ohio and wind power in Iowa. However, in 1999, the company ended its retail endeavor, only offering wholesale energy as it was revealed it was spending upwards of $100 million a year.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

====Data management====
As fiber optic technology progressed in the 1990s, multiple companies, including Enron, attempted to make money by "keeping the continuing network costs low," which was done by owning their own network.<ref name="NYT1999">{{cite news|last1=Schiesel|first1=Seth|title=Jumping Off the Bandwidth Wagon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/business/jumping-off-the-bandwidth-wagon.html|access-date=2017-02-17|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1999-07-11|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1997, FTV Communications LLC, a [[limited liability company]] formed by Enron subsidiary FirstPoint Communications, Inc., [[Williams Companies|Williams Communications Group, Inc.]] and [[Montana Power Company|Touch America]].<ref name=PRNEWS>{{cite news|title=Montana Power, Williams Communications, Enron Units Announce Fiber Providers for Portland-to-Los Angeles Network|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|access-date=17 February 2017|work=[[PRNewswire]]|date=17 December 1997|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217071349/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montana-power-williams-communications-enron-units-announce-fiber-providers-for-portland-to-los-angeles-network-77921802.html|archive-date=February 17, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> FTV constructed a 1,380 mile fiber optic network between Portland and Las Vegas.<ref name=PRNEWS/> In 1998, Enron constructed a building in a rundown area of Las Vegas near E Sahara, building right over the "backbone" of fiber optic cables providing service to technology companies nationwide.<ref name="NPR04">{{cite news|title=Profiting from Enron Bankruptcy|url=https://knpr.org/knpr/2004-11/profiting-enron-bankruptcy|access-date=2017-02-17|work=[[Nevada Public Radio]]|date=2004-11-29|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The location had the ability to send "the entire Library of Congress anywhere in the world within minutes" and could stream "video to the whole state of California".<ref name="NPR04"/> The location was also more protected from natural disasters than areas such as Los Angeles or the East Coast.<ref name="NPR04"/> According to ''Wall Street Daily'', "Enron had a secret," it "wanted to trade bandwidth like it traded oil, gas, electricity, etc. It launched a secret plan to build an enormous amount of fiber optic transmission capacity in Las Vegas ...  it was all part of Enron’s plan to essentially own the internet."<ref name="WSdaily">{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Greg|title=SUPERNAP: The World's Most Advanced Data Center|url=https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2015/09/11/supernap-data-center/|access-date=2017-02-17|work=Wall Street Daily|date=2015-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218065430/https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2015/09/11/supernap-data-center/|archive-date=2017-02-18|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Enron sought to have all US internet service providers rely on their Nevada facility to supply bandwidth, which Enron would sell in a fashion similar to other commodities.<ref name="REG2008">{{cite news|last=Vance|first=Ashlee|title=Welcome to Las Vegas - Home of the technology superpower you've never heard of|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/24/switch_switchnap_rob_roy/?page=3|access-date=2017-02-19|work=[[The Register]]|date=2008-05-24|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In January 2000, Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling announced to analysts that they were going to open trading for their own "high-speed fiber-optic networks that form the backbone for Internet traffic". Investors quickly bought Enron stock following the announcement "[[Dot-com bubble|as they did with most things Internet-related at the time]]", with stock prices rising from $40 per share in January 2000 to $70 per share in March, peaking at $90 in the summer of 2000. Enron executives obtained [[windfall gain]]s from the rising stock prices, with a total of $924 million of stocks sold by high-level Enron employees between 2000 and 2001. Head of Enron Broadband Services, Kenneth Rice, sold 1 million shares himself, earning about $70 million in returns. As prices of existing fiber optic cables plummeted due to the vast oversupply of the system, with only 5% of the 40 million miles being active wires, Enron purchased the inactive "dark fibers", expecting to buy them at low cost and then make a profit as the need for more usage by internet providers increased, with Enron expecting to lease its acquired dark fibers in 20 year contracts to providers. However, Enron's accounting would use estimates to determine how much their dark fiber would be worth when "lit" and apply those estimates to their current income, adding exaggerated revenue to their accounts since transactions were not yet made and it was not known if the cables would ever be active. Enron's trading with other energy companies within the broadband market was its attempt to lure large telecommunications companies, such as [[Verizon Communications]], into its broadband scheme to create its own new market.<ref name="WPjan01">{{cite news|last=Behr|first=Peter|title=Broadband Strategy Got Enron in Trouble; Bid to Create Market for Fiber-Optic Space Included Aggressive Accounting|work=[[The Washington Post]]|issue=E01|date=2001-01-01|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

By the second quarter of 2001, Enron Broadband Services was reporting losses. On March 12, 2001, a proposed 20-year deal between Enron and [[Blockbuster Inc.]] to stream [[Video on demand|movies on demand]] over Enron's connections was cancelled, with Enron shares dropping from $80 per share in mid-February 2001 to below $60 the week after the deal was killed. The branch of the company that Jeffrey Skilling "said would eventually add $40 billion to Enron's stock value" added only about $408 million in revenue for Enron in 2001, with the company's broadband arm closed shortly after its meager second-quarter earnings report in July 2001.<ref name="WPjan01"/>

Following the bankruptcy of Enron, telecommunications holdings were sold for "pennies on the dollar".<ref name="NPR04"/> In 2002, Rob Roy of [[Switch (company)|Switch Communications]] purchased Enron's Nevada facility in an auction attended only by Roy. Enron's "fiber plans were so secretive that few people even knew about the auction." The facility was sold for only $930,000.<ref name="NPR04"/><ref name="WSdaily"/> Following the sale, Switch expanded to control "the biggest data center in the world".<ref name="WSdaily"/>

==== Overseas expansion ====
Enron, seeing stability after the merger, began to look overseas for new possible energy opportunities in 1991. Enron's first such opportunity  was a [[Teesside power station|natural gas power plant]] utilizing cogeneration that the company built in [[Teesside|Teesside, UK]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /> The power plant was so large it could produce up to 3% of the United Kingdom's electricity demand with a capacity of over 1,875 [[megawatts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=991|title=Engineering Timelines - Teesside Power Station|website=www.engineering-timelines.com|access-date=2016-07-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Seeing the success in England, the company developed and diversified its assets worldwide under the name of Enron International (EI), headed by former HNG executive [[Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche|Rebecca Mark]]. By 1994, EI's portfolio included assets in The Philippines, Australia, Guatemala, Germany, France, India, Argentina, the Caribbean, China, England, Colombia, Turkey, Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Poland, and Japan. The division was becoming a large share of earnings for Enron, contributing 25% of earnings in 1996. Mark and EI believed the water industry was the next market to be deregulated by authorities and seeing the potential, searched for ways to enter the market, similar to PGE.

In 1998, Enron International acquired [[Wessex Water]] for $2.88 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/05/corporatefraud.enron|title=How Enron's great water adventure ended in tears|date=2002-11-05|website=The Guardian|access-date=2016-07-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wessex Water became the core asset of a new company, Azurix, which expanded to other water companies.

===Misleading financial accounts===
{{Main|Enron scandal}}

In 1990, Enron's Chief Operating Officer [[Jeffrey Skilling]] hired [[Andrew Fastow]], who was well acquainted with the burgeoning deregulated energy market that Skilling wanted to exploit.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In 1993, Fastow began establishing numerous [[limited liability]] [[special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]], a common business practice in the energy industry. However, this also allowed Enron to transfer some of its liabilities so that they would not appear in its accounts, allowing it to maintain a robust and generally increasing stock price and thus keeping its critical investment grade credit ratings.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Enron was originally involved in transmitting and distributing electricity and natural gas throughout the United States. The company developed, built, and operated [[power plant]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] while dealing with rules of law and other infrastructures worldwide.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Enron owned a large network of natural gas pipelines, which stretched coast to coast and border to border including Northern Natural Gas, [[Florida Gas Transmission]], [[Transwestern Pipeline]] company and a partnership in [[Northern Border Pipeline]] from Canada.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The states of California, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had already passed power deregulation laws by July 1996, the time of Enron's proposal to acquire [[Portland General Electric]] corporation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Loren|title=Enron: the rise and fall|page=113|publisher=John Wiley & Son|year=1003|isbn=0-471-47888-1}}</ref> During 1998, Enron began operations in the [[water sector]], creating the [[Azurix]] Corporation, which it part-floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] during June 1999. Azurix failed to become successful in the [[water utility]] market, and one of its major concessions, in [[Buenos Aires]], was a large-scale money-loser.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Enron grew wealthy due largely to marketing, [[promotion (marketing)|promoting]] power, and its high stock price.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Enron was named "America's Most Innovative Company" by the magazine ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' for six consecutive years, from 1996 to 2001.<ref>Sharp, p.13.</ref> It was on the ''Fortune''{{'}}s "100 Best Companies to Work for in America" list during 2000, and had offices that were stunning in their opulence. Enron was hailed by many, including labor and the workforce, as an overall great company, praised for its large long-term pensions, benefits for its workers and extremely [[Vitality curve|effective management]] until the exposure of its corporate fraud. The first [[Financial analyst|analyst]] to question the company's success story was [[Daniel Scotto]], an energy market expert at [[BNP Paribas]], who issued a note in August 2001 entitled ''Enron: All stressed up and no place to go'', which encouraged investors to sell Enron stocks, although he only changed his recommendation on the stock from "buy" to "neutral".<ref>{{cite news|last=English|first=Simon|title=Whistle-blower sent off|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2001-01-20|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

As was later discovered, many of Enron's recorded assets and profits were inflated or even wholly fraudulent and nonexistent. One example of fraudulent records was during 1999 when Enron promised to repay [[Merrill Lynch]]'s investment with interest in order to show a profit on its books. Debts and losses were put into entities formed "offshore" that were not included in the company's [[financial statement]]s, and other sophisticated and arcane financial transactions between Enron and related companies were used to eliminate unprofitable entities from the company's books.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The company's most valuable asset and the largest source of honest income, the 1930s-era Northern Natural Gas company, was eventually purchased by a group of Omaha investors, who relocated its headquarters back to Omaha; it is now a unit of [[Warren Buffett]]'s [[Berkshire Hathaway Energy]]. NNG was established as collateral for a $2.5&nbsp;billion capital infusion by [[Dynegy|Dynegy Corporation]] when Dynegy was planning to buy Enron. When Dynegy examined Enron's financial records carefully, they repudiated the deal and dismissed their CEO, Chuck Watson. The new chairman and CEO, the late Daniel Dienstbier, had been president of NNG and an Enron executive at one time and was forced out of Enron by Ken Lay.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Dienstbier was an acquaintance of Warren Buffett. NNG continues to be profitable now.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2016}}

== 2001 accounting scandals ==
{{Main|Enron scandal}}
In 2001, after a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures perpetrated throughout the 1990s involving Enron and its auditor [[Arthur Andersen]] that bordered on fraud, Enron filed for the then largest [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in history (since surpassed by those of [[Worldcom]] during 2002 and [[Lehman Brothers]] during 2008), resulting in $11 billion in shareholder losses.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/The-10-Biggest-Energy-Company-Bankruptcies.html |title=The 10 Biggest Energy Company Bankruptcies |date=Oct 10, 2014 |publisher=Oilprice.com }}</ref>

[[File:EnronStockPriceAugust2000toJanuary2001.svg|thumb|Stock Price of Enron from August 2000 to January 2002]]

As the scandal progressed, Enron share prices decreased from US $90.56 during the summer of 2000, to just pennies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gilardi.com/pdf/enro13ptable.pdf |title=Enron Corporation (ENRN Q) Common Stock Historical Price Table |publisher=Gilardi.com |access-date=2019-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050722/http://www.gilardi.com/pdf/enro13ptable.pdf |archive-date=2017-10-05 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Enron had been considered a [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue chip]] stock investment, so this was an unprecedented event in the financial world. Enron's demise occurred after the revelation that much of its profit and revenue were the result of deals with [[Special-purpose entity|special-purpose entities]] ([[limited partnership]]s which it controlled). This meant that many of Enron's debts and the losses that it suffered were not reported in its [[financial statement]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The encyclopedia of the industrial revolution in world history |others=Hendrickson, Kenneth E.|date = November 25, 2014|isbn=978-0-8108-8888-3|location=Lanham|oclc=913956423}}</ref>

Enron filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. In addition, the scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the "Big Five" - the world's foremost accounting firms. The company was found guilty of [[obstruction of justice]] during 2002 for destroying documents related to the Enron audit.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Eichenwald|first=Kurt|date=2002-06-16|title=Andersen Guilty in Effort to Block Inquiry on Enron|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/16/business/andersen-guilty-in-effort-to-block-inquiry-on-enron.html|access-date=2020-05-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Since the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, Andersen was forced to stop auditing public companies. Although the conviction was dismissed in 2005 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the damage to the Andersen name has prevented it from reviving as a viable business even on a limited scale. Also, the court ruling was little comfort to the thousands of now unemployed Andersen employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4674892|title=Court Ruling Little Comfort for Ex-Andersen Employees|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

Enron also withdrew a naming-rights deal with the [[Houston Astros]] [[Major League Baseball]] club to have its name associated with their new stadium, which was known formerly as Enron Field (now [[Minute Maid Park]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://houston.astros.mlb.com/hou/ballpark/index.jsp|title=Minute Maid Park|website=Houston Astros Official Site|access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref>

===Accounting practices===
Enron used a variety of deceptive, bewildering, and fraudulent accounting practices and tactics to cover its fraud in reporting Enron's financial information. Special-purpose entities were created to mask significant liabilities from Enron's financial statements. These entities made Enron seem more profitable than it actually was, and created a dangerous spiral in which, each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more financial deception to create the illusion of billions of dollars in profit while the company was actually losing money.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/01/15/0115enron.html|title=Dan Ackman, "Enron the Incredible"|date=January 15, 2002|publisher=Forbes Media|newspaper=Forbes}}</ref> This practice increased their stock price to new levels, at which point the executives began to work on [[insider trading|insider information]] and trade millions of dollars' worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company; the investors, however, did not. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow directed the team which created the off-books companies, and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family, and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation for which he worked and its stockholders.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Arthur Andersen Witnesses.jpg|thumb|Arthur Andersen witnesses]]

During 1999, Enron initiated EnronOnline, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States. By promoting the company's aggressive investment strategy, Enron president and chief operating officer [[Jeffrey Skilling]] helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, trading over $27&nbsp;billion per quarter. The corporation's financial claims, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted [[mark-to-market accounting]], in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if currently real. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out to be losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on [[Wall Street]] during the so-called [[Tech boom]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The encyclopedia of the industrial revolution in world history|others=Hendrickson, Kenneth E.|date = November 25, 2014|isbn=978-0-8108-8888-3|location=Lanham|oclc=913956423}}</ref> But when a company's success is measured by undocumented financial statements, actual balance sheets are inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so increase the stock price. An advancing price meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted (much like a financial "pyramid" or "[[Ponzi scheme]]"). Attempting to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street analyst Richard Grubman,<ref name="million">{{cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2006/04/10/news/newsmakers/enron_trial/index.htm|title=Skilling comes out swinging|last=Pasha|first=Shaheen|date=2006-04-10|publisher=Money/CNN|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference telephone call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied, "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that ... asshole." Though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, it became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's offensiveness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=364x319539|title=Skilling to skeptical financial analyst, "Thanks asshole" - Democratic Underground}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102421772|title=Clean up your act Musk, Tesla's a total disaster!|website=CNBC.com|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Post-bankruptcy===
Enron initially planned to retain its three domestic pipeline companies as well as most of its overseas assets. However, before emerging from bankruptcy, Enron sold its domestic pipeline companies as CrossCountry Energy for $2.45 billion <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shook|first=Barbara|date=September 3, 2004|title=Deals Mark Demise of Energy Merchant Business|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-121550619.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903223316/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-121550619.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 3, 2015|journal=[[Oil Daily]]|publisher=Energy Intelligence Group, Inc.|access-date=June 22, 2014}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> and later sold other assets to [[Vulcan Capital Management]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://capital.vulcan.com/pdf/release_20040809.pdf|title=Vulcan's pipeline grip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028162512/http://capital.vulcan.com/pdf/release_20040809.pdf|archive-date=October 28, 2012|publisher=Investing Private Capital|date=August 2004|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Enron sold its last business, [[Prisma Energy]], during 2006, leaving Enron asset-less.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/enron-closes-sale-of-prisma-energy-to-ashmore|title=Enron closes sale of Prisma Energy to Ashmore|last=Hunt|first=Katherine|website=MarketWatch|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref> During early 2007, its name was changed to Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation. Its goal is to repay the old Enron's remaining creditors and end Enron's affairs.

[[Azurix]], the former water utility part of the company, remains under Enron ownership, although it is currently asset-less. It is involved in several litigations against the government of [[Argentina]] claiming compensation relating to the negligence and corruption of the local governance during its management of the [[Buenos Aires]] water concession during 1999, which resulted in substantial amounts of debt (approx. $620&nbsp;million) and the eventual collapse of the branch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indyprint.info/wp-content/themes/expansion/development/merchantcashadvance.html|title=Merchant Cash Advance Executive Comes Clean On Industry's Dirty Lending Tactics|website=IndyPrint.info|access-date=2016-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104045837/http://www.indyprint.info/wp-content/themes/expansion/development/merchantcashadvance.html|archive-date=2016-11-04|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Soon after emerging from bankruptcy during November 2004, Enron's new board of directors sued 11 financial institutions for helping Lay, Fastow, Skilling and others hide Enron's true financial condition. The proceedings were dubbed the "megaclaims litigation". Among the defendants were [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Citigroup]]. {{As of|2008}}, Enron has settled with all of the institutions, ending with Citigroup. Enron was able to obtain nearly $7.2 billion to distribute to its creditors as a result of the megaclaims litigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/09/09/enron.settlement/index.html |title=Enron investors to split billions from lawsuit |publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref> As of December 2009, some claim and process payments were still being distributed.

Enron has been featured since its bankruptcy in popular culture, including in [[The Simpsons]] episodes ''[[That '90s Show]]'' (Homer buys Enron stocks while Marge chooses to keep her own [[Microsoft]] stocks) and [[Special Edna]], which features a scene of an Enron-themed amusement park ride. The 2007 film ''[[Bee Movie]]'' also featured a joke reference to a [[parody]] company of Enron called "Honron" (a play on the words honey and Enron). The 2017 book ''Bittersweet Symphony'' by Rebecca McNutt featured main character Bailey Kane discussing Enron while remarking, "in devastation there is opportunity, you know." The book also mentions in passing that deceased Enron executive [[J. Clifford Baxter]] "tried to complain, he tried to live with it, he tried to do the right thing but nobody heard him..." The 2003 documentary [[The Corporation (2003 film)|''The Corporation'']] made frequent references to Enron post-bankruptcy, calling the company a "bad apple".

==Insider trading scandal==

===Peak and decline of stock price===
During August 2000, Enron's stock price attained its greatest value of $90.56.<ref name=mclean /> At this time Enron executives, who possessed inside information on the hidden losses, began to sell their stock. At the same time, the general public and Enron's investors were told to buy the stock. Executives told the investors that the stock would continue to increase until it attained possibly the $130 to $140 range, while secretly unloading their shares.

As executives sold their shares, the price began to decrease. Investors were told to continue buying stock or hold steady if they already owned Enron because the stock price would rebound in the near future. Kenneth Lay's strategy for responding to Enron's continuing problems was his demeanor. As he did many times, Lay would issue a statement or make an appearance to calm investors and assure them that Enron was doing well.<ref name="Enron">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidersense.com/enron|website=InsiderSense.com|title=ENRON Insider Sales Roster|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132340/http://www.insidersense.com/enron|archive-date=September 25, 2015|access-date=2017-09-06|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In March 2001 an article by [[Bethany McLean]] appeared in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine noting that no one understood how the company made money and questioning whether Enron stock was overvalued.<ref>{{cite news|title=Enron scandal brings overdue scrutiny of stock analysts|date=2002-03-25|newspaper=USA Today|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

By August 15, 2001, Enron's stock price had decreased to $42. Many of the investors still trusted Lay and believed that Enron would rule the market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/11/29/investing/q_enronanalysts/|title=Where Wall Street went wrong| website=CNN|date=2001-11-29|first=Paul R.|last=La Monica|place=New York|access-date=2017-07-20|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They continued to buy or retain their stock as the equity value decreased. As October ended, the stock had decreased to $15. Many considered this a great opportunity to buy Enron stock because of what Lay had been telling them in the media.<ref name="Enron" />

Lay was accused of selling more than $70 million worth of stock at this time, which he used to repay cash advances on lines of credit. He sold another $29 million worth of stock in the open market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/16/business/enron-s-many-strands-ex-chairman-s-finances-lay-sold-shares-for-100-million.html|title=Enron's Many Strands: Ex-Chairman's Finances; Lay Sold Shares For $100 Million|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref> Also, Lay's wife, Linda, was accused of selling 500,000 shares of Enron stock totaling $1.2&nbsp;million on November 28, 2001. The money earned from this sale did not go to the family but rather to charitable organizations, which had already received pledges of contributions from the foundation.<ref>{{cite web|date=November 17, 2004|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/business/enron-inquiry-turns-to-sales-by-lays-wife.html|title=Enron inquiry turns to sales by lay's wife|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref> Records show that Mrs. Lay made the sale order sometime between 10:00 and 10:20&nbsp;am. News of Enron's problems, including the millions of dollars in losses they hid, became public about 10:30 that morning, and the stock price soon decreased to less than one dollar.

Former Enron executive Paula Rieker was charged with criminal insider trading and sentenced to two years probation. Rieker obtained 18,380 Enron shares for $15.51 a share. She sold that stock for $49.77 a share during July 2001, a week before the public was told what she already knew about the $102&nbsp;million loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600135.html|title=Ex-Enron exec gets two year probation|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-10-06|access-date=2017-07-20|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2002, after the tumultuous fall of Enron's external auditor, and management consultant, Andersen LLP, former Andersen Director, John M. Cunningham coined the phrase, "We have all been Enroned."

The fallout resulted in both Lay and Skilling being convicted of conspiracy, fraud, and insider trading. Lay died before sentencing, Skilling got 24 years and 4 months and a $45 million penalty (later reduced). Fastow was sentenced to six years of jail time, and Lou Pai settled out of court for $31.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidersense.com/blog/2015/9/22/swimming-with-sharks|title=Swimming With Sharks|website=InsiderSense.com|date=September 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132323/http://www.insidersense.com/blog/2015/9/22/swimming-with-sharks|archive-date=2015-09-25|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==California's deregulation and subsequent energy crisis==
{{See also|California electricity crisis}}
During October 2000, [[Daniel Scotto]], the most renowned utility analyst on [[Wall Street]], suspended his ratings on all energy companies conducting business in California because of the possibility that the companies would not receive full and adequate compensation for the deferred energy accounts used as the basis for the California Deregulation Plan enacted during the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQugpO2TGVwC&pg=PA208|title=Financial Statement Analysis: A Practitioner's Guide|first1=Martin S.|last1=Fridson|first2=Fernando|last2=Alvarez|edition=4th|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781118064207|access-date=2017-07-20|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Five months later, [[Pacific Gas & Electric]] (PG&E) was forced into bankruptcy. Republican Senator [[Phil Gramm]], husband of Enron Board member Wendy Gramm and also the second largest recipient of [[Political campaign|campaign]] contributions from Enron,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/congress/article_redirect.cfm?ID=6693/|title=Public Citizen Access to Justice, Financial Reform and Government Accountability|website=Citizen.org|date=2010-12-03|access-date=2013-07-12|df=mdy-all}}</ref> succeeded in legislating California's energy commodity trading deregulation. Despite warnings from prominent consumer groups which stated that this law would give energy traders too much influence over energy commodity prices, the legislation was passed during December 2000.

As the periodical [[Public Citizen]] reported, "Because of Enron's new, unregulated power auction, the company's 'Wholesale Services' revenues quadrupled—- from $12&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2000 to $48.4&nbsp;billion in the first quarter of 2001."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen.org/documents/Blind_Faith.PDF|title=Blind Faith: How Deregulation and Enron's Influence Over Government Looted Billions from Americans|website=Citizen.org}}</ref>

After passage of the deregulation law, California had a total of 38 Stage 3 [[rolling blackout]]s declared, until federal regulators intervened during June 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/policies/legislation/california/subsequentevents.html|title=Subsequent Events California's Energy Crisis|website=EIA.gov|publisher=US Energy Information Administration|access-date=September 6, 2017}}</ref> These blackouts occurred as a result of a poorly designed market system that was manipulated by traders and marketers, as well as from poor state management and regulatory oversight. Subsequently, Enron traders were revealed as intentionally encouraging the removal of power from the market during California's energy crisis by encouraging suppliers to shut down plants to perform unnecessary maintenance, as documented in recordings made at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/02/03/enron.tapes/|title=Tapes: Enron plotted to shut down power plant|website=CNN.com|date=February 3, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/national/04energy.html|title=Tapes Show Enron Arranged Plant Shutdown|last=Egan|first=Timothy|date=February 4, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 26, 2009}}</ref> These acts contributed to the need for rolling blackouts, which adversely affected many businesses dependent upon a reliable supply of electricity, and inconvenienced a large number of retail customers. This scattered supply increased the price, and Enron traders were thus able to sell power at premium prices, sometimes up to a factor of 20x its normal peak value.

Enron had a controlling stake in the Louisiana-based petroleum exploration and production company [[Mariner Energy]].

=== EnronOnline ===
Enron opened EnronOnline, an [[electronic trading platform]] for energy commodities, on November 29, 1999.<ref name="Kolb239">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pV3aMRUKi10C&pg=PA239|title=Financial Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management|last2=Overdahl|first2=James A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|isbn=9780470541746|location=Hoboken, NJ|page=239|last1=Kolb|first1=Robert|author-link1=Robert Kolb}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oPsuIAOls6QC&pg=PA157|title=Energy Derivatives: Trading Emerging Markets|last2=Wilcox|first2=Jeremy|publisher=Energy Publishing Enterprises|year=2000|isbn=9780970222800|location=New York|page=157|last1=Fusaro|first1=Peter C.}}</ref> Conceptualized by the company's European Gas Trading team, it was the first web-based transaction system that allowed buyers and sellers to buy, sell, and trade commodity products globally. It allowed users to do business only with Enron. The site allowed Enron to transact with participants in the global energy markets. The main commodities offered on EnronOnline were natural gas and electricity, although there were 500 other products including [[credit derivative]]s, bankruptcy swaps, pulp, gas, plastics, paper, steel, metals, [[freight]], and TV commercial time. At its maximum, more than $6 billion worth of commodities were transacted by means of EnronOnline every day, but specialists questioned how Enron reported trades and calculated its profits, saying that the same fraudulent accounting that was rampant at Enron's other operations may have been used in trading.<ref name=":4" />

After Enron's bankruptcy in late 2001, EnronOnline was sold to the Swiss financial giant [[UBS]]. Within a year, UBS abandoned its efforts to relaunch the division, and closed it in November 2002.<ref name="Kolb239" /><ref name=":4">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/21/business/ubs-closing-trading-floor-it-acquired-from-enron.html|title=UBS Closing Trading Floor It Acquired From Enron|date=2002-11-21|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Barboza|last=David|access-date=2014-06-23|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== Enron International ===
'''Enron International (EI)''' was Enron's wholesale asset development and asset management business. Its primary emphasis was developing and building natural gas power plants outside North America. Enron Engineering and Construction Company (EECC) was a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron International, and built almost all of Enron International's power plants. Unlike other business units of Enron, Enron International had a strong cash flow on bankruptcy filing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Enron International consisted of all of Enron's foreign power projects, including ones in Europe.

The company's [[Teesside]] plant was one of the largest gas-fired power stations in the world, built and operated by Enron from 1989, and produced 3 percent of the [[United Kingdom]]'s energy needs.<ref name="Electricity Game 2012">"Principal Player in the Electricity Game." Financial Times [London, England] 17 Sept. 1990: 19. Financial Times. Web. July 4, 2012.</ref> Enron owned half of the plant's [[Equity (finance)|equity]], with the remaining 50 per cent split between four regional electricity companies.<ref name="Electricity Game 2012"/>

==== Management ====
[[Rebecca Mark-Jusbasche|Rebecca Mark]] was the CEO of Enron International until she resigned to manage Enron's newly acquired water business, [[Azurix]], during 1997. Mark had a major role in the development of the Dabhol project in India, Enron's largest international endeavor.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dun & Bradstreet Corporation.|title=Financial risk management|date=2007|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-061149-8|location=New Delhi|oclc=97369098}}</ref>

==== Projects ====
Enron International constructed power plants and pipelines across the globe. Some are presently still operating, including the massive [[Teesside]] plant in England. Others, like a barge-mounted plant off Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, cost Enron money by lawsuits and investment losses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Puerto Plata was a barge-mounted power plant next to the hotel ''Hotelero del Atlantico''. When the plant was activated, winds blew soot from the plant onto the hotel guests' meals, blackening their food. The winds also blew garbage from nearby slums into the plant's water-intake system. For some time the only solution was to hire men who would row out and push the garbage away with their paddles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through mid-2000 the company collected a paltry $3.5&nbsp;million from a $95&nbsp;million investment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Enron also had other investment projects in Europe, South America, Argentina, [[Brazil]], Bolivia, [[Colombia]], Mexico, [[Jamaica]], Venezuela, and across the [[Caribbean]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==== India ====
Around 1992 [[India]]n experts came to the United States to find energy investors to help with India's energy shortage problems.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} During December 1993, Enron finalized a 20-year power-purchase contract with the [[Maharashtra State Electricity Board]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The contract allowed Enron to construct a massive 2,015 megawatt power plant on a remote volcanic bluff {{convert|100|mi|km}} south of Mumbai. Construction would be completed in two phases, and Enron would form the [[Dabhol Power Company]] to help manage the plant. The power project was the first step in a $20&nbsp;billion scheme to help rebuild and stabilize India's power grid. Enron, [[General Electric|GE]] (which was selling turbines to the project), and [[Bechtel]] (which was actually constructing the plant), each contributed 10% [[Equity (finance)|equity]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During 1996, when India's Congress Party was no longer in power, the Indian government assessed the project as being excessively expensive and refused to pay for the plant and stopped construction.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the local state-owned utility, was required by contract to continue to pay Enron plant maintenance charges, even if no power was purchased from the plant. The MSEB determined that it could not afford to purchase the power (at Rs. 8 per unit kWh) charged by Enron. The plant operator was unable to find alternate customers for Dabhol power due to the absence of a free market in the regulated structure of utilities in India.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} From 1996 until Enron's bankruptcy during 2001 the company tried to revive the project and revive interest in India's need for the power plant without success.

==== Project summer ====
During the summer of 2001, Enron made an attempt to sell a number of Enron International's assets, many of which were not sold. The public and media believed it was unknown why Enron wanted to sell these assets, suspecting it was because Enron was in need of cash.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barboza|first=David|title=Enron Sought to Raise Cash Two Years Ago|url=http://bodurtha.georgetown.edu/enron/Enron%20Sought%20to%20Raise%20Cash%20Two%20Years%20Ago.htm|publisher=Georgetown University|access-date=7 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215062936/http://bodurtha.georgetown.edu/enron/Enron%20Sought%20to%20Raise%20Cash%20Two%20Years%20Ago.htm|archive-date=December 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Employees who worked with company assets were told in 2000 <ref>Enron Communication, 4th Quarter, 2000</ref> that Jeff Skilling believed that business assets were an outdated means of company worth, and instead he wanted to build a company based on "intellectual assets".

=== Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc. ===
'''Enron Global Exploration & Production Inc. (EGEP)''' was an Enron subsidiary that was born from the split of domestic assets via [[EOG Resources]] (formerly Enron Oil and Gas EOG) and international assets via EGEP (formerly Enron Oil and Gas Int'l, Ltd EOGIL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55212997.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155812/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55212997.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|title=Enron Oil, Gas Production Unit to Become Independent|agency=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News|date=July 20, 1999|last=Davis|first=Michael|access-date=September 6, 2017|website=HighBeam.com}}</ref>  
Among the EGEP assets were the [[Panna-Mukta oilfield|Panna-Mukta]] and the South Tapti fields, discovered by the Indian state-owned [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]] (ONGC), which operated the fields initially.<ref name=Comptroller201009>{{cite web|url=http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2011_2012/Civil_%20Performance_Audits/Report_19/chap6.pdf|title=Performance Audit of Hydrocarbon PSCs - Findings in respect of Panna-Mukta and Mid & South Tapti Fields|date=September 2010|publisher=Comptroller and Auditor General of India|access-date=2012-04-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122011653/http://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/Our_Products/Audit_Report/Government_Wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2011_2012/Civil_%20Performance_Audits/Report_19/chap6.pdf|archive-date=2013-01-22|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service==

During early 2002, Enron was awarded Harvard's (in)famous [[Ig Nobel Prize]] for 'Most Creative Use of Imaginary Numbers.' The various former members of Enron management team all refused to accept the award in person, although no reason was given at the time.

== Enron's influence on politics ==
* Paul Krugman, a current New York Times Opinion Columist, was paid $50,000 a year to serve on Enron advisory board to help the company influence policy and regulation of it’s industry.


[[George W.
