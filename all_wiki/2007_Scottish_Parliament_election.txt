The '''2007 Scottish Parliament election''' was held on Thursday 3 May 2007 to elect members to the Scottish Parliament. It was the third [[general election]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/80046--a.htm#2 | title=Scotland Act 1998 – Part I – Section 2 – General elections | work =opsi.gov.uk}}</ref> to the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] since it was created in 1999. [[2007 Scottish local elections|Local elections in Scotland]] fell on the same day.

The [[Scottish National Party]] emerged as the largest party with 47 seats, closely followed by the [[incumbent]] [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Labour Party]] with 46 seats. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Conservatives]] won 17 seats, the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] 16 seats, the [[Scottish Green Party]] 2 seats and one [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] ([[Margo MacDonald]]) was also elected. The SNP initially approached the Lib Dems for a coalition government, but the Lib Dems turned them down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6631053.stm|title=Lib Dems rule out SNP coalition|work=BBC News|date=7 May 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923063049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6631053.stm|archivedate=23 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Ultimately, the Greens agreed to provide the numbers to vote in an SNP [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|minority government]], with SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6646227.stm |title=SNP and Greens sign working deal |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009115429/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6646227.stm |archivedate=9 October 2007}}</ref>

The [[Scottish Socialist Party]] and the [[Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party]], which won seats in the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003 election]], lost all of their seats. Former [[Member of Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Tommy Sheridan]]'s new party, [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]], also failed to win any seats. [[Campbell Martin]] and Dr [[Jean Turner]] both lost their seats, and [[Dennis Canavan]] and [[Brian Monteith]] retired.

==Background==
{{PoliticsScotland}}
The main issues during the campaign trail were [[NHS Scotland|healthcare]], [[Scottish education system|education]], [[council tax]] reform, [[United Kingdom pension provision|pensions]], [[Union of England and Scotland|the Union]], [[Trident missile|Trident]] (the submarines are based in Scotland), the [[Iraq War]] and more powers for the Scottish Parliament. Some parties proposed [[Raising of school leaving age|raise the school leaving age]] from 16 to 18 and raising the minimum age to purchase [[tobacco]] products from 16 to 18.

[[Jack McConnell]], as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]], entered the election defending a small overall majority of five seats via a coalition of [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] and the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]]. The Lab-LD [[social liberal]] [[coalition government|coalition]] had been in power, with three different First Ministers, since the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first Scottish Parliament election in 1999]]. Opinion polls suggested its majority could be lost in 2007, due to falling support for the Labour Party and rising support for other parties, in particular the [[Scottish National Party|Scottish National Party (SNP)]]. The polls suggested that no single party was likely to acquire an overall majority, nor was there an obvious alternative coalition ready to form a new Executive.

A TNS Poll in November 2006 gave Labour an 8% lead over the SNP which was second behind Labour in terms of numbers of [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs). As the election approached the SNP gained support while Labour's support declined. Based on pre-election projections, there could have been some possibility of an SNP–Liberal Democrat coalition, which might have extended to include the [[Scottish Green Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=104&id=513662005 |title=''Somewhere over the Rainbow Coalition...''

(Solidarity is a new party, having broken away from the SSP in 2006.)

Other parties that campaigned for seats in [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]] included the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), the [[British National Party]] (BNP), the [[Scottish Unionist Party (modern)|Scottish Unionist Party]], the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Scottish Socialist Labour Party]], the [[Christian Peoples Alliance]], the [[Scottish Christian Party]] and the [[Scotland Against Crooked Lawyers Party]].

==Incidents==
[[File:Count machines.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Scanners counting votes in Glasgow's [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]].]]

===Delayed counts===
Some counts in the [[Western Isles]] ([[Barra]] & the [[Uist]]s) were delayed because the chartered helicopter sent to pick up the ballot boxes was delayed by bad weather. The boxes were instead transferred by sea and road to be counted in [[Stornoway]]. The votes were announced around 12.00 on Friday 4 May.

===Vandalism===
A man smashed ballot boxes with a golf club at a polling station at [[Carrick Knowe]] in [[Corstorphine]] in [[Edinburgh]]. About 100 ballots were damaged, some having to be [[Adhesive tape|taped]] back together. The man was arrested on the scene.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6622105.stm |title=Polling clerk tells of 'bedlam' |work=BBC News |date=3 May 2007}}</ref>

===High number of rejected votes===
The number of 'invalid' ballot papers (residual votes) in this election was significantly higher than usual, with a total of 146,099 ballot papers (regional: 60,455 or 2.88%; constituency: 85,644 or 4.075%) being rejected.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/electoral_commission_pdf_file/Scottish-Election-Report-A-Final-For-Web.pdf |title=Scottish elections 2007 The independent review of the Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections 3 May 2007 |work=Electoral Commission |date=October 2007}}</ref> With some constituencies such as Glasgow Shettleston having rejection rates as high as 12.1%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0261379408000279?token=A28DE04953930CC769AAAAC06DEAF1FE4C634B592B28684EEDE2C95EAB0C180B7151E0C015FFC162C3BD2358F9780764 |title=The unfortunate natural experiment in ballot design:The Scottish Parliamentary elections of 2007 |work=Elsevier |date=February 2008}}</ref> For comparison, the rejected ballot paper rate in 2003 was 0.65% for regional ballot papers and 0.66% for constituency ballot papers. In total there were 16 constituencies where the number of rejected ballots exceeded the winning candidate's majority.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0261379408000279?token=A28DE04953930CC769AAAAC06DEAF1FE4C634B592B28684EEDE2C95EAB0C180B7151E0C015FFC162C3BD2358F9780764 |title=The unfortunate natural experiment in ballot design:The Scottish Parliamentary elections of 2007 |work=Elsevier |date=February 2008}}</ref> This led to calls for an independent enquiry into the implementation of the new voting system. The [[BBC Scotland]] Chief Political Editor, Brian Taylor, described the situation as "a disgrace" during their Election Night coverage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6622379.stm |title=Elections marred by vote problems |work=BBC News |date=3 May 2007}}</ref>

There are several reasons for the usually high levels of rejected ballots in the election. One primary reason is that both the regional and constituency ballots were placed on a single sheet of paper. A large-type instruction at the top indicated "you have two votes." Being told that they had two votes, far too many voters used both votes on parties in the regional list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes |first=Eddie |url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=701122007 |title=The Scotsman |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 6 May 2007|accessdate=20 February 2011 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> Although a rough template of the ballot was provided to voters by VoteScotland prior to the election, many ballots in reality had subtle yet consequential differences. Taking the ballot from Glasgow Shettleston for example, although its layout is similar to the sample ballot it has many more parties on the regional ballot, giving the illusion that the list continues onto the next side (constituency ballot). Furthermore, instructions provided to voters using these sheets were abbreviated. While the brief written instructions remained, they were presented in a much smaller font size. The column headings moved above the bold lines defining the columns and the visual prompt of the split arrow leading to the two columns is completely missing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0261379408000279?token=A28DE04953930CC769AAAAC06DEAF1FE4C634B592B28684EEDE2C95EAB0C180B7151E0C015FFC162C3BD2358F9780764 |title=The unfortunate natural experiment in ballot design:The Scottish Parliamentary elections of 2007 |work=Elsevier |date=February 2008}}</ref> This misleading ballot was made more complicated by two additional features of the balloting: several small parties like the Green Party ran one or fewer candidates in the constituency seats and parties were able to choose to put the name of their leader instead of the name of the party in the label for the list seats. (For example, the SNP was listed as "Alex Salmond for First Minister", rather than the party name) Such poor ballot design decisions contributed to [[United States presidential election, 2000 Florida results|a similarly higher rate of spoiled ballots]] in the 2000 United States presidential election in areas of Florida such as Miami-Dade and Duval counties.

Another reason presented was that local elections took place on the same day with a different voting system and different design. Whereas the parliamentary election asked voters to mark a cross, the local council elections asked voters to number/ rank their candidates, as the council elections were under the [[single transferable vote]] system. Undercutting this theory, however, was the fact that the invalid rate in the local elections was far lower than the parliamentary elections (although still greater than in previous local elections) despite single transferable vote being a new system for most voters.

A third proposed reason was that this was the first election where electronic counting of papers had taken place. Many blamed e-counting for the increase in rejected papers, in part because the new machine counting system abandoned many counts during the early hours of Friday morning before all results had been counted. Furthermore, the primary reason for the regional and constituency ballots being placed on the same sheet of paper is due to restrictions on the size of paper the machines could accurately scan. The main company concerned was [[DRS Ltd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drs.co.uk/ |title=Electronic automated data capture services and document scanning specialists |publisher=DRS |accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> Nevertheless, nearly all invalid ballots would have been spoiled no matter how they were counted. However, the last minute redesign of ballot papers that was blamed for the high number of rejections in two electoral regions was done to make electronic voting easier.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6656181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Clue over voter ballot confusion | date=15 May 2007 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>

====Threatened legal actions====
On 5 May 2007, the BBC reported that Labour were considering legal action against some results (particularly [[Cunninghame North (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Cunninghame North]], where the SNP beat Labour by just 48 votes) due to the high number of rejected votes.<ref name="BBC challenge">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6629093.stm|title=Holyrood vote may face challenges |work=BBC News |date=6 May 2007}}</ref> A further challenge was expected from Mike Dailly from the Govan Law Centre, a member of the Labour Party, purportedly on behalf of voters in the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow region]]. He said that the result should be challenged because there were over 10,000 rejected ballots which could have caused a different result if they had counted.  [[Tommy Sheridan]] of [[Solidarity (Scotland)|Solidarity]] was only 2,215 votes short of beating the Greens for the last place as an MSP.<ref name="BBC challenge" />

There were no election petitions raised to challenge the results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Election system ==
There are 73 [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|constituencies]], each electing one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) by the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] ([[first past the post]]) system of election, which are grouped into eight regions.  These regions each elect seven additional member MSPs so as to produce an overall [[Mixed member proportional representation|proportional result]]. The [[D'Hondt method]] is used to calculate which additional member MSPs the regions elect. Each constituency is a sub-division of a region; the additional members system is designed to produce [[proportional representation]] for each region, and the total number of MSPs elected to the parliament is 129.

The election was the first using [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] (see [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions]]) that are not identical to constituencies of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ([[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]). [[Scottish Westminster constituencies]] were replaced with a new set of generally larger constituencies, fewer in number, in 2005.

The [[Arbuthnott Commission]] reported in January 2006, concerning the multiplicity of [[voting system]]s and [[electoral division]]s in Scotland. Council elections on the same day used [[Single Transferable Vote]] for the first time, but there was no change to the Holyrood election system, except regarding use of [[vote-counting machines]], before the 2007 election. Scanners supplied by [[DRS Data Services Limited]] of [[Milton Keynes]], in partnership with Electoral Reform Services, the trading arm of the [[Electoral Reform Society]], were used to electronically count the [[Ballot paper|paper ballots]] in both the Scottish Parliament general election and the [[2007 Scottish local elections|Scottish council elections]], which took place on the same day.<ref>[http://election.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1064&id=588392006 "Electronic counting to take over from tellers at elections"], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 April 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.drs.co.uk/corporate/newsitem.asp?id=106 "Green light for DRS & ERS to deliver e-Count for 2007 Scottish Elections"], press release, DRS Data Services Limited</ref>

==Top target seats of the main parties==
Below are listed all the constituencies which required a [[Swing (politics)|swing]] of less than 5% from the 2003 result to change hands.

Many of the seats that changed hands are not listed here. For example, the Scottish National Party gained several seats ([[Stirling (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Stirling]], [[Edinburgh East and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East & Musselburgh]], [[Gordon (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Gordon]], [[Livingston (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Livingston]] and [[Argyll and Bute (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Argyll & Bute]]) with very large swings, yet did not gain any of their top three targets.
