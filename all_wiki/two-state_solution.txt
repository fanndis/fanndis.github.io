The '''two-state solution''' to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] envisages an independent [[State of Palestine]] alongside the [[Israel|State of Israel]], west of the [[Jordan River]]. The boundary between the two states is still subject to dispute and negotiation, with Palestinian and Arab leadership insisting on the "1967 borders", which is not accepted by Israel. The territory of the former [[Mandate Palestine]] (including [[Status of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]]) which did not form part of the Palestinian State would continue to be part of Israel.

In 1974, a UN resolution on the "Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine" called  for "two States, Israel and Palestine … side by side within secure and recognized borders" together with "a just resolution of the refugee question in conformity with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN resolution 194]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Question of Palestine – General Assembly|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/ga.htm|website=The United Nations – Question of Palestine |access-date=30 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717094435/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/ga.htm|archive-date=17 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="A/RES/3236 (XXIX)">{{cite web|title=A/RES/3236 (XXIX) Question of Palestine |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/025974039ACFB171852560DE00548BBE|website=The United Nations – General Assembly|access-date=30 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101150050/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/025974039ACFB171852560DE00548BBE|archive-date=1 January 2010 |date=22 November 1974}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A/PV.2296 Question of Palestine (concluded) |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/7219f7fe733b856485256236005a4700?OpenDocument|website=The United Nations – General Assembly|access-date=30 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103191021/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/7219f7fe733b856485256236005a4700?OpenDocument|archive-date=3 January 2011|date=22 November 1974}}</ref> The borders of the state of Palestine would be "based on the pre-1967 borders".

The Palestinian leadership has embraced the concept since the 1982 Arab Summit in [[Fes|Fez]].<ref>Mark A. Tessler. ''A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict''. 1994, p. 718</ref> Israel views moves by Palestinian leaders to obtain [[international recognition of the State of Palestine|international recognition of a State of Palestine]] as being unilateral action by the Palestinians and inconsistent with a negotiated two-state solution.

Polls have consistently shown Israeli and Palestinian majorities in favor of a negotiated two-state settlement.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/22230 "How Not to Make Peace in the Middle East"], Hussein Agha and Robert Malley, ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Retrieved Jan. 9, 2009</ref>

There have been many [[Israeli-Palestinian peace process|diplomatic efforts]] to realize a two state solution, starting from the 1991 [[Madrid Conference]]. There followed the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]] and the failed [[2000 Camp David Summit]] followed by the [[Taba Summit|Taba negotiations]] in early 2001. In 2002, the [[Arab League]] proposed the [[Arab Peace Initiative]]. The latest initiative, which also failed, was the [[2013–14 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks|2013–14 peace talks]].

== History of the two-state solution ==
The first proposal for the creation of Jewish and Arab states in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] was made in the [[Peel Commission]] report of 1937, with the Mandate continuing to cover only a small area containing [[Jerusalem]]. The recommended partition proposal was rejected by the Arab community of Palestine,<ref>Swedenburg, Ted (1988) "The Role of the Palestinian Peasantry in the Great Revolt 1936–1939". in ''Islam, Politics, and Social Movements'', edited by Edmund Burke III and Ira Lapidus. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06868-8}} pp. 189–94 & [[Marvin Gettleman|Marvin E.

Partition was again proposed by the [[1947 UN Partition plan]] for the division of Palestine. It proposed a three-way division, again with Jerusalem held separately, under international control. The partition plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership. However, the plan was rejected by the leadership of Arab nations and the Palestinian leadership, which opposed any partition of Palestine and any independent Jewish presence in the area. The [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] for control of the disputed land broke out on the end of the British Mandate, which came to an end with the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]]. The war [[1948 Palestinian exodus|resulted]] in the fleeing or expulsion of 711,000 Palestinians, which the Palestinians call ''Nakba'', from the territories which became the state of Israel.<ref name="un">{{cite web|author=United Nations General Assembly |date=23 August 1951 |url=https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/b792301807650d6685256cef0073cb80/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883?OpenDocument |title=General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine |format=OpenDocument |access-date=3 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822123836/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/b792301807650d6685256cef0073cb80/93037e3b939746de8525610200567883?OpenDocument |archive-date=22 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><!-- Section below transcluded on [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]] --><section begin=Post1967/> Rather than establishing a Palestinian state on land that Israel did not control, the Arab nations chose instead to support the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] and the Palestinian refugees remained stateless.<ref name="Avnon">Avnon, Dan.

=== UN resolution 242 and the recognition of Palestinian rights ===
After the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab–Israeli war]], the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|resolution 242]] calling for Israeli withdrawal from the [[Israeli-occupied territories|territories occupied]] during the war, in exchange for "termination of all claims or states of belligerency" and "acknowledgement of sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area". The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), which had been formed in 1964, strongly criticized the resolution, saying that it reduced the question of Palestine to a refugee problem.<ref name=UNhistory>{{cite web|title=The Question of Palestine and the United Nations|url=https://unispal.un.org/pdfs/DPI2499.pdf|website=United Nations|access-date=2 Aug 2014}}</ref>{{rp|18}}

In September 1974, 56 Member States proposed that "the question of Palestine" be included as an item in the General Assembly’s agenda. In a resolution adopted on 22 November 1974, the General Assembly affirmed Palestinian rights, which included the "right to self-determination without external interference", "the right to national independence and sovereignty", and the "right to return to their homes and property". These rights have been affirmed every year since.<ref name="A/RES/3236 (XXIX)"/>{{rp|24}}

=== PLO acceptance of two-state solution ===
The first indication that the PLO would be willing to accept a two-state solution, on at least an interim basis, was articulated by [[Said Hammami]] in the mid-1970s.<ref>Ayoob, Mohammed. ''The Middle East in world politics''. 1981, p. 90</ref><ref>Ḥusayn Āghā, Shai Feldman, Aḥmad Khālidī, Zeev Schiff. ''Track-II diplomacy: lessons from the Middle East''. 2003, p. 11</ref>

Security Council resolutions dating back to June 1976 supporting the two-state solution based on the pre-1967 lines were vetoed by the United States,<ref>Cattan, Henry. ''The Palestine question''. 1988, p. 307</ref> which supports a two-state solution but argued that the borders must be negotiated directly by the parties. The idea has had overwhelming support in the [[UN General Assembly]] since the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the Division for Palestinian Rights|url=https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f9e33f224e8f88d8852570ec00735e7c?OpenDocument|website=The United Nations – Question of Palestine|access-date=30 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513080317/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/f9e33f224e8f88d8852570ec00735e7c?OpenDocument|archive-date=13 May 2007|date=12 December 2005}}</ref>

The [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] of 15 November 1988, which referenced the [[UN Partition Plan]] of 1947 and "UN resolutions since 1947" in general, was interpreted as an indirect recognition of the [[State of Israel]], and support for a two-state solution. The Partition Plan was invoked to provide legitimacy to Palestinian statehood. Subsequent clarifications were taken to amount to the first explicit Palestinian recognition of Israel.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rabie |first=Mohamed|date=Summer 1992|title=The U.S.-PLO Dialogue: The Swedish Connection |journal= Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=21|issue=4|pages=54–66|doi=10.1525/jps.1992.21.4.00p0140g |jstor=2537663}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Quandt, William B. | author-link = William B.

== Diplomatic efforts ==
{{Main|Israeli–Palestinian peace process}}
In 1975, the General Assembly established the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People. In 1976, the Committee presented two sets of recommendations, one concerned with the [[Palestinian right of return|Palestinians' right of return]] to their homes and property, and the other with their rights to self-determination, national independence and sovereignty. The Security Council discussed the recommendations but failed to reach a decision due to the [[United Nations Security Council veto power|negative vote]] of the United States.<ref name=UNhistory />{{rp|25}}

After the [[First Intifada]] began in 1987, considerable diplomatic work went into negotiating a two-state solution between the parties, beginning with the Madrid Conference in 1991. The most significant of these negotiations was the Oslo Accords, which officially divided Palestinian land into three administrative divisions and created the framework for how much of Israel's political borders with the Palestinian territories function today. The Accords culminated in the [[Camp David 2000 Summit]], and follow-up negotiations at Taba in January 2001, but no final agreement was ever reached. The violent outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]] in 2000 had demonstrated the Palestinian public's disillusionment with the Oslo Accords and convinced many Israelis that the negotiations were in vain.

At the [[Annapolis Conference]] in November 2007, three major parties—The PLO, Israel, and the US—agreed on a two-state solution as the outline for negotiations. However, the summit failed to achieve an agreement.

Following [[Fatah–Hamas conflict|the conflict]] that erupted between the two main Palestinian parties, [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], Hamas [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|took control]] of the Gaza Strip, splintering the Palestinian Authority into two polities, each claiming to be the true representatives of the Palestinian people. Fatah controlled the [[Palestinian National Authority]] in the [[West Bank]] and Hamas [[Governance of the Gaza Strip|Governed in Gaza]].

The latest initiatives were the [[2013–14 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks]] under the guidance of [[John Kerry]], the United States Secretary of State. These talks also failed to reach an agreement.

== Viability ==
By 2010, when direct talks were scheduled to be restarted, continued growth of settlements on the West Bank and continued strong support of settlements by the Israeli government had greatly reduced the land and resources that would be available to a Palestinian state creating doubt among Palestinians and left-wing Israelis that a two-state solution continued to be viable.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/world/middleeast/21assess.html "In Mideast Talks, Scant Hopes From the Beginning"] news analysis by Ethan Bronner in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 20, 2010, accessed August 21, 2010</ref> In January 2012 the European Union Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem found that Israel's continuing settlement activities and the fragile situation of the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem, as well in area C, was making a two-state solution less likely.<ref>Hass, Amira.

On 29 November 2012, the UN General Assembly voted by 138 to 9, with 46 abstentions to recognize Palestine as a "non-member observer state". On the following day, Israeli PM [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] announced the building of 3,000 new homes on land to the east of East Jerusalem, in an area referred to as "E-1".<ref>[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/11/30/166252247/israel-plans-to-expand-settlements-in-east-jerusalem-west-bank Israel Plans To Expand Settlements In East Jerusalem, West Bank] ''[[NPR]]'', 30 Nov 2012.

Israel's decision to build the homes was described by the [[Obama administration]] as "counterproductive", while Australia said that the building plans "threaten the viability of a two-state solution". This is because they claim the proposed E-1 settlement would physically split the lands under the control of the Palestinian National Authority in two, as the extent of the PNA's authority does not extend all the way to the [[River Jordan]] and the [[Dead Sea]].<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-e1-israeli-settlement-20121204,0,1913186.story Israel takes a harder line], ''[[LA Times]]'', 4 Dec 2012.

In a 2002 poll conducted by [[Program on International Policy Attitudes|PIPA]], 72% of both Palestinians and Israelis supported at that time a peace settlement based on the 1967 borders so long as each group could be reassured that the other side would be cooperative in making the necessary concessions for such a settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/international_security_bt/137.php?nid=&id=&pnt=137&lb=brme|title=Large Israeli and Palestinian Majorities Indicate Readiness for Two-State Solution Based on 1967 Borders|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405210125/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/articles/international_security_bt/137.php?nid=&id=&pnt=137&lb=brme|archive-date=2008-04-05}}</ref> A 2013 Gallup poll found 70% of Palestinians in the West Bank and 48% of Palestinians in Gaza Strip, together with 52% of Israelis supporting "an independent Palestinian state together with the state of Israel".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Lydia Saad|author2=Elizabeth Mendes|title=Israelis, Palestinians Pro Peace Process, but Not Hopeful|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/161456/israelis-palestinians-pro-peace-process-not-hopeful.aspx|access-date=29 November 2016|date=March 21, 2013}}</ref>

Support for a two state solution varies according to the way the question is phrased.

In a 2007 poll, almost three quarters of the Palestinian respondents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip approved either a binational or two-state solution; 46% preferred the two-state solution, and 26% preferred the [[binational solution]].<ref name=JMCC-200703>{{citation|url=http://www.jmcc.org/publicpoll/results/2007/no61.pdf|title=On Palestinian attitudes towards the Formation of the National Unity Government|publisher=Jerusalem Media & Communication Centre|id=Poll no. 61, Part One|date=March 2007|access-date=2008-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142657/http://www.jmcc.org/publicpoll/results/2007/no61.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=2007-12-01}}</ref> Support is lower among younger Palestinians; [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] noted: "Increasingly, the Palestinians who talk about a two-state solution are my age."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-israel-one-statemay14,0,5082382.story|title=Can 2 foes live under 1 roof?|author=Richard Boudreaux and Ashraf Khalil|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 14, 2008|access-date=2008-06-17}}</ref> A survey taken before the [[Operation Protective Edge|outbreak of fighting in 2014]] by the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] found that 60 percent of Palestinians say the goal of their national movement should be "to work toward reclaiming all of historic Palestine from the river to the sea" compared to just 27 percent who endorse the idea that they should work "to end the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and achieve a two state solution." WINEP says that "this is a new finding compared to similar (but not identical) questions asked in the past, when support for a two-state solution typically ranged between 40–55 percent".<ref name="vox" />

=== Three-state solution ===
The [[three-state solution]] has been proposed as another alternative.

A number of proposals for the granting of Palestinian citizenship or residential permits to Jewish settlers in return for the removal of Israeli military installations from the West Bank have been fielded by such individuals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1014952.html|title=Let them stay in Palestine - Haaretz - Israel News|date=2010-01-17|access-date=2017-08-23|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117013813/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1014952.html|archive-date=2010-01-17}}</ref> as Arafat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/world/arafat-may-allow-jewish-settlers-to-stay-in-west-bank-2939.html|title=Arafat may allow Jewish settlers to stay in West Bank|date=30 January 2001}}</ref> [[Ibrahim Sarsur]]<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/715018.html ''Arab MK: I would agree to grant settlers Palestinian citizenship''] {{dead link|date=September 2016}}</ref> and [[Ahmed Qurei]].

Israeli Minister [[Moshe Ya'alon]] said in April 2010 that "just as Arabs live in Israel, so, too, should Jews be able to live in Palestine." … "If we are talking about coexistence and peace, why the [Palestinian] insistence that the territory they receive be ethnically cleansed of Jews?".<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=173302 'No need to remove any settlements'] By Herb Keinon, ''Jerusalem Post'', 16 April 2010</ref>

We have found that it is not possible to call upon the  Jewish State for a direct subvention to the Arab State, and neither  practicable nor equitable to set up an Arab State with a budget  so very far from being balanced. We conclude that, if partition  is to be carried out, there is no alternative but that Parliament  should be asked to provide, in some form, sufficient assistance to  enable the Arab State to balance its budget.  (p. 246)...CONCLUSION ... The question whether  partition is practicable involves considerations of two kinds :  practical and political. The former concern chiefly finance and  economics ;.... But the financial and economic difficulties, ..., are of such a nature that we can find no possible way to  overcome them within our terms of reference.   ... we have proposed,  ... a modification of partition which, ... seems to  us, subject to certain reservations, to form a satisfactory basis of  settlement, if His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the  very considerable financial liability involved. There remain the political difficulties. .... But  there is still the possibility that both sides may be willing to accept  a reasonable compromise.}}</ref-->
