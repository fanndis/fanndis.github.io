'''Kurt Westergaard''' (born '''Kurt Vestergaard'''; 13 July 1935) is a  [[Danish people|Danish]] [[cartoonist]] who created [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|the controversial cartoon]] of a terrorist, although not the [[Islamic]] prophet [[Muhammad]] as it is often claimed, wearing a [[bomb]] in his [[turban]].<ref>[https://www.rights.no/2018/12/langlesing-muhammed-tegneren-jeg-angrer-ikke/ Muhammed-tegneren: – Jeg angrer ikke – Human Rights Service]</ref> This cartoon was the most contentious of the 12 [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]], which met with strong reactions from Muslims worldwide who condemned the act, including Western countries. Since the drawing of the cartoon, Westergaard has received numerous death threats and been a target of assassination attempts. As a result, he is under constant police protection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://switch5.castup.net/frames/20041020_MemriTV_Popup/video_480x360.asp?ai=214&ar=1025wmv&ak=null |title=Protesters Burn European Embassies, Consulates, Churches in Damascus and Beirut 4–5 February 2006 |publisher=Switch5.castup.net |accessdate=4 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205162731/http://switch5.castup.net/frames/20041020_MemriTV_Popup/video_480x360.asp?ai=214&ar=1025wmv&ak=null |archivedate=5 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite news|date=2 March 2006 |title=Cartoon Body Count |publisher=Web |url=http://www.cartoonbodycount.com/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326070849/http://www/ |archivedate=26 March 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Life and career==
Westergaard was born on 13 July 1935 in the village of [[Dostrup|Døstrup]], in the [[Himmerland]] area of [[Jutland]].<ref name="politiken fear to anger" /> He grew up in a conservative Christian  family (''[[The Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark|Inner Mission]]'') environment in Himmerland, going to [[Sunday school]].<ref name="pedersen interview"/><ref name="pop p16" /> Westergaard was introduced to [[Cultural Radicalism]] during high school in the 1950s, which he experienced as an "epiphany" and "a liberation from the religious subjugation of his childhood." <ref name="pop p16" /><ref name="berlingske devil under the feet" />

Westergaard is a trained schoolteacher, educated at [[Ranum Seminarium]]. After working as a teacher for some time, he later enrolled at the [[University of Copenhagen]] to study psychology.<ref name="politiken fear to anger" /> He subsequently worked as a teacher for handicapped children, and has been principal of a school in the [[Djursland]] area for the handicapped.<ref name="politiken fear to anger" /><ref name="pedersen interview"/>

Briefly working for the newspaper ''[[Demokraten]]'', he has been a cartoonist for ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' since the early 1980s.<ref name="pedersen interview"/> While working there, he became known for his depiction of Muhammed wearing a bomb in a [[turban]] as part of the [[Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy|Prophet cartoons controversy; including cartoon by Westergaard.]]

In a 2009 interview, Westergaard said he was trying to "show that terrorists get their spiritual ammunition from parts of Islam and with this spiritual ammunition, and with dynamite and other explosives, they kill people."<ref name="canadian interview"/> He takes issue with the way Danish people have judged his intentions, telling Canadian blogger [[Jonathan Kay]] that he has been shunned by many of his former friends: "One of my old friends from the left, he said last year to me 'There are many who say that if something happens to [you], you were asking for it' — that it would be my own fault."

Westergaard has criticised the reaction of [[Immigration to Denmark|immigrant communities]] in Denmark to his cartoon, stating that "many of the immigrants who came to Denmark, they had nothing. We gave them everything – money, apartments, their own schools, free university, health care. In return, we asked one thing – respect for democratic values, including free speech. Do they agree? This is my simple test."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/10/05/jonathan-kay-on-kurt-westergaard-free-speech-and-leftist-refuseniks.aspx  |access-date=1 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}{{dead link|date=April 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Following the release of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] politician [[Geert Wilders]]' film ''[[Fitna (film)|Fitna]]'', which used Westergaard's cartoon without permission, Westergaard made a cartoon depicting Wilders with a bomb and a sign which reads: "Danger! Freedom of expression".<ref name="westerwilders">{{cite news|url=http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/binnenland/2008/03/westergaard_tekent_wilders.html|title=Westergaard tekent Wilders|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=1 April 2008|first=J.|last=Peters|work=SpitsNieuws|language=Dutch |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110623140738/http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/archives/binnenland/2008/03/westergaard_tekent_wilders.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 23 June 2011}}</ref> <!-- Bad tone --> <!-- This is somewhat odd as he didn't object two years ago when Wilders expressed his solidarity with Westergaard by placing the controversial cartoons on his website. -->

===2008 conspiracy and resulting security arrangements===
On 12 February 2008, the [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste|Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] (PET) announced the arrest of three Muslims — two [[Tunisia]]ns and one [[Morocco|Moroccan]]-born Dane — who were charged with planning to murder Westergaard.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7240481.stm |title = Danish cartoons 'plotters' held |work = |publisher = BBC News |date= 12 February 2008 |accessdate =12 February 2008 }}</ref>

After the plot was foiled, the Danish secret service was made responsible for protecting Westergaard. He was placed under police surveillance when traveling to and from work.<ref name="guardian interview"/> His house was fitted with steel doors, a [[Safe room|panic room]], reinforced glass in the windows and surveillance cameras.<ref name="canadian interview"/>

===Attacks===
On 1 January 2010, a 28-year-old [[Somalia|Somali]] Muslim intruder armed with an axe and knife entered Westergaard's house and was subsequently shot and wounded by police.<ref name=w2>{{cite news |first=Jakob Hvide | last=Beim |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article871711.ece |title=Westergaard-angriber skal 25 dage i fængsel -"Westergaard-attack, 25 days in jail (translation) |date=28 December 2009 | work=Dagbladet Politiken  |accessdate=2 January 2010 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/47853-assassination-attempt-on-mohammed-cartoonist.html Assassination attempt on Mohammed cartoonist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104234620/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/47853-assassination-attempt-on-mohammed-cartoonist.html |date=4 January 2010 }}</ref> Westergaard was unharmed due to security precautions in his house. He escaped to a [[Safe room|panic room]] when he saw the intruder standing in the hallway wielding an axe.<ref name="el mundo interview"/> Westergaard was separated from his five-year-old granddaughter whom he left behind sitting in the living room just meters away from the intruder.<ref name="guardian interview"/><ref name=w2/><ref name="el mundo interview"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlingske.dk/danmark/kurt-westergaard-reddet-af-sit-sikringsrum |title=Kurt Westergaard reddet af sit sikringsrum |publisher=Berlingske.dk |date= 2 January 2010|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref>

The intruder attempted to break down the reinforced door with his axe, shouting phrases like "We will get our revenge!", "Revenge!" and "Blood!"<ref name="guardian interview"/><ref name="el mundo interview"/><ref name="daily telegraph terrorist links"/> He failed to get through and was shot in the hand and knee by police officers who arrived on the scene within a few minutes.<ref name="el mundo interview"/><ref name="pet press release"/> The assailant was arrested, taken into custody and charged with the attempted murders of Westergaard and a police officer.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jakob Hvide | last=Beim |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article871711.ece |title=Westergaard-angriber skal 25 dage i fængsel – "Westergaard-attack, 25 days in jail (translation) |date=28 December 2009 | work=Dagbladet Politiken  |accessdate=2 January 2010 |language=Danish}}</ref><ref name="guardian murder charge"/>

This second attempted murder in two years received extensive coverage in the Danish newspapers. The Sunday edition of ''Jyllands-Posten'' included a front-page article about how Westergaard now needs a bodyguard to provide round-the-clock security;<ref name="jp article bodyguard"/> a full-page article on the background of the controversy;<ref name="hansen article"/> an interview with Westergaard by [[Lars Pedersen]];<ref name="pedersen interview"/> a list of quotes showing the "disgust and condemnation" aroused by the attack;<ref name="jp article list of quotes following attack"/> an article about the assailant's appearance in a court in [[Aarhus]];<ref name="nørby article"/> two articles about the man himself, who had apparently been living in Denmark for fifteen years and was known to the intelligence services;<ref name="jp article accused man's background"/><ref name="jp article pet investigation"/> and, in the editorial and in an opinion piece by political commentator Ralf Pittelkow, advocacy of the values Western society is based on, in particular [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].<ref name="jp editorial"/><ref name="pittelkow op-ed"/>

According to [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste|PET]] intelligence, the suspect is closely linked to the Somali Islamist insurgency group [[Harakat al-Shabaab Mujahideen|al-Shabaab]], commonly considered a terrorist organization, as well as an [[al-Qaeda]] affiliate in East Africa.<ref name="daily telegraph terrorist links"/><ref name="pet press release"/><ref name="bbc news terrorist links"/><ref name="the observer terrorist links"/>

On 22 June 2011, the assailant was found guilty of an attempt to perform an act of terrorism and attempted murder, by a unanimous jury. The assailant pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a weapon and breaking and entering, but pleaded not guilty to the other charges. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison followed by permanent deportation from Denmark.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12366076 | work=BBC News | title=Denmark cartoon trial: Kurt Westergaard attacker jailed | date=4 February 2011 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203031349/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12366076 | archive-date=3 February 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-41026550:%C3%B8ksemanden-fik-sk%C3%A6rpet-sin-straf.html | title=Øksemanden fik skærpet sin straf | publisher=[[TV 2 News]] | date=22 January 2011 | accessdate=14 July 2011 | author=Hedegaard, Kristian | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827155441/http://nyhederne-dyn.tv2.dk/article.php/id-41026550:%C3%B8ksemanden-fik-sk%C3%A6rpet-sin-straf.html | archive-date=27 August 2011 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>
