In the first decade of their career, Against Me! had been consistently accused of [[selling out]], whether because of stylistic choices they made, the record label they chose or the venues they played. Recriminations came both from former fans, who at times attempted to disrupt shows and even threatened violence, and journalists who published accusations against the band and at times advocated action against them.  Grace's coming out as transgender won plaudits from many in the punk community for her integrity and rehabilited the band's reputation.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/punk/2019/00000008/00000002/art00003;jsessionid=30a8w8vxmdq6l.x-ic-live-01|title='You want me to surrender my identity?'
