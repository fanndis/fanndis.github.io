==Early life and education==

Scowcroft was born March 19, 1925, in [[Ogden, Utah]], the son of Lucile (née Ballantyne) and James Scowcroft, a grocer and business owner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://csis.org/expert/brent-scowcroft |title=Brent Scowcroft |publisher=[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] |date=2012 |accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> He was a descendant of early 19th-century British immigrants from England and Scotland, along with immigrants from [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. He elaborated upon his relationship with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in a 1999 oral history: "I have close personal ties to some of the church leadership. They would not consider me a good [[Mormon]]. I don’t live by all of the rules the Mormons like—I like a glass of [[wine]] and a cup of [[coffee]]. But yes, I do consider myself a Mormon. It’s part of a religious and a cultural heritage."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/president/bush/oralhistory/brent-scowcroft |title=Brent Scowcroft Oral History |publisher=[[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] |accessdate=August 8, 2020}}</ref>

Scowcroft received his undergraduate degree and commission in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], in June 1947. With the establishment of an independent [[United States Air Force]] in September 1947, his commission transferred to the USAF. Scowcroft subsequently earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1953) and [[Ph.D.]] (1967) in [[international relations]] from [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Aspen Scowcroft">{{cite web |title=Brent Scowcroft |url=https://www.aspeninstitute.org/our-people/brent-scowcroft/ |publisher=[[Aspen Institute]] |accessdate=August 8, 2020}}</ref>

Having envisioned life as a fighter pilot following [[World War II]], Scowcroft completed his pilot training in October 1948 following his commissioning as an Air Force [[Second Lieutenant]] in 1947 and received his Air Force Command Pilot Wings.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=August 6, 2020|title=Brent Scowcroft, a Force on Foreign Policy for 40 Years, Dies at 95|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/politics/brent-scowcroft-dead.html|access-date=August 7, 2020|website=nytimes}}</ref> However, on January 6, 1949, while on flight training with [[North American P-51 Mustang]], his P-51 Mustang aircraft experienced engine trouble after taking-off from [[Manchester–Boston Regional Airport|Grenier Army Airfield]], causing the plane to crash-land. Although his injuries were not critical, Scowcroft assumed that he would never fly again and considered another career within the Air Force.<ref name=":0" /> He served in a variety of operational and administrative positions from 1948 to 1953. In the course of his military career, he held positions at the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], headquarters of the [[United States Air Force]], and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. His other assignments included: faculty positions at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] and the United States Military Academy, and [[Assistant Air Attaché]] in the [[Diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=":0"/>

As a senior officer, General Scowcroft was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, and served in the Long Range Planning Division, Directorate of Doctrine, Concepts and Objectives from 1964 to 1966. He next attended the [[National War College]] at [[Fort McNair]], followed by assignment in July 1968 to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In September 1969, he was reassigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force in the Directorate of Plans as Deputy Assistant for National Security Council Matters.

Scowcroft was a leading [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] critic of American policy towards [[History of Iraq under Ba'athist rule|Iraq]] before and after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]], which war critics in particular have seen as significant given Scowcroft's close ties to former President George H.

This book described what it was like to be in the [[White House]] during the end of the [[Cold War]], as the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed in the early 1990s. Notably, both figures explained why they didn't go on to [[Baghdad]] in 1991: "Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."<ref>{{cite news|title=Scowcroft Blasts W.|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/scowcroft-blasts-w/|first=Katrina|last=vanden Heuvel|date=October 19, 2004|accessdate=August 7, 2020|magazine=The Nation}}</ref>

==Evaluation==
Scholarly evaluations of Scowcroft's performance have been generally favorable. For example [[Ivo Daalder]] and I. M. Destler  quoting other scholars, conclude: 

<blockquote>"Brent Scowcroft was in many ways the ideal national security adviser—indeed, he offers a model for how the job should be done." His "winning formula" consisted of gaining the trust of the key principals of U.S. foreign policymaking, establishing "a cooperative policy process at all levels," one both transparent and collegial, and keeping an "unbreakable relationship with the president," thanks to their close friendship and mutual respect. The result was that Scowcroft "proved to be an extraordinarily effective national security adviser" in comparison with others who have held the office, particularly in light of the difficult and transformative period in which he held office.<ref>Ivo Daalder and I. M. Destler, ''In the Shadow of the Oval Office: Profiles of the National Security Advisers and the Presidents They Served—From JFK to George W. Bush'' (2009), p. 170.</ref></blockquote>Other evaluations from colleagues and national security veterans in both parties echo similar points, as the Atlantic Council wrote in quoting several people after Scowcroft's death: "Looking back on his time working with Scowcroft in the Nixon administration, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger explained that 'in a period when America was tearing itself apart,' Scowcroft’s 'steadiness had a calming influence then as did his faith in his country’s ultimate purposes.' Former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates argued that what 'set Brent apart as National Security Advisor was that he played fair…he did not take advantage of his close relationship with the president to disadvantage others.' John Deutch, former Director of Central Intelligence, recalled that “Brent had the ideal temperament to lead the country. He was smart, deceptively articulate with a calm demeanor that often masked his strategic thinking.'"<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-09-10|title=Celebrating the 'impeccable integrity and unbounded courage' of Brent Scowcroft|url=https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/celebrating-the-impeccable-integrity-and-unbounded-courage-of-brent-scowcroft/|access-date=2020-10-08|website=Atlantic Council|language=en-US}}</ref> 

==Scowcroft award==
Scowcroft was the inspiration and namesake for a special presidential award begun under the George H. W. Bush administration. According to [[Robert Gates]], the award is given to the official "who most ostentatiously falls asleep in a meeting with the president." According to Gates, the president "evaluated candidates on three criteria. First, duration—how long did they sleep? Second, the depth of the sleep. Snoring always got you extra points. And third, the quality of recovery. Did one just quietly open one's eyes and return to the meeting, or did you jolt awake and maybe spill something hot in the process?"<ref name=Gates>{{cite news |last=Wilkie |first=Christina|title=Fall asleep in the Oval Office?
