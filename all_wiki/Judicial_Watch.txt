{{Conservatism US}} 
'''Judicial Watch''' ('''JW''') is an American [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] <!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE WITHOUT TALK PAGE CONSENSUS --> [[activist group]]<ref name="sue-again-and-again" /> that files [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) lawsuits to investigate claimed misconduct by government officials.

Founded in 1994, JW has primarily targeted Democrats, in particular the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]], the [[Presidency of Barack Obama]], and [[Hillary Clinton]]. The organization has described climate science as "fraud science" and has filed lawsuits against government climate scientists. JW has made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims that have been picked up by right-wing news outlets and promoted by conservative figures. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited false claims by Judicial Watch about voter fraud. Courts have dismissed the vast majority of its lawsuits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/judicial-watch-hillary-clinton.html|title=Group’s Tactic on Hillary Clinton: Sue Her Again and Again|first=Jonathan|last=Mahler|date=October 12, 2016|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

==History==

Judicial Watch was founded in 1994 by attorney and [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Activism|activist]] [[Larry Klayman]]. Before leaving the organization in 2003, Klayman hired [[Tom Fitton]], who became president of the organization. In October 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "Judicial Watch's strategy is simple: Carpet-bomb the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits." As of 2016, the organization had nearly fifty employees. Judicial Watch calls itself a nonpartisan educational foundation as well as a media organization. According to the ''Times'', "the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public." Critics accuse JW of "weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes."<ref name=sue-again-and-again/> 

===Clinton Administration===

Judicial Watch came to public attention after filing eighteen lawsuits against the administration of [[US Democratic Party|Democratic]] U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and other figures in the Clinton administration. An early lawsuit was filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of the [[Western Journalism Center|Western Center for Journalism]] (WCJ) in 1998. The lawsuit alleged a retaliatory audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The WCJ was investigating the death of Clinton deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster]] at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fitton|first=Tom|date=2014|title=The Corruption Chronicles|isbn=978-1-4767-6705-5|publisher=[[Threshold Editions]]|pages=16}}</ref>

The organization received considerable financial support from prominent Clinton critics, including $7.74 million from [[Conservatism|conservative]] billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php | title = Recipients by amounts granted by all Scaife foundations | work = Media Transparency | access-date = June 2, 2007 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608130352/http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php | archive-date = June 8, 2007 }}</ref> This led [[Clinton administration]] officials to accuse Judicial Watch of "abusing the judicial system for partisan ends".<ref>{{cite news | title =  Pursuing Clinton Suits Him Just Fine | work = Washington Post | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/klayman053098.htm | author = Segal, David | page = A01 | date = May 30, 1998 | access-date = June 2, 2007 }}</ref>

===Commerce Department trade mission scandal===

{{main|Commerce Department trade mission controversy}}
In 1995, Judicial Watch, Inc. filed an action in the District Court under the FOIA, seeking information from the [[Department of Commerce]] (DOC) regarding DOC's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, DOC produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of DOC's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some DOC officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents. In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Judicial Watch v.

===White House visitor logs===

August 10, 2009 Judicial Watch sent a FOIA request to the US Secret Service asking that official White House visitor logs be made public.

The government failed to produce any records within the required twenty days. In order to force compliance, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the DOD and CIA on June 8, 2011. On January 31, 2014, after legal wrangling, the Pentagon released ''Operation Neptune Spear'' documents to Judicial Watch. One email had the subject line OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear and is proof that days after the original FOIA request U.S. Special Operations Commander, [[William H. McRaven|Admiral William McRaven]] ordered his subordinates to immediately destroy any Osama bin Laden photos they may have had.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/12/osama-bin-laden-photo-corpse/5417135/|title=Admiral: 'Destroy' photos of Osama bin Laden's corpse|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 12, 2014|first=Natalie|last=DiBlasio}}</ref>

Johnson administrations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bender |first=Bryan |title=Judicial Watch sues National Archives over sealed Robert Kennedy records at JFK Library  |date=July 12, 2013 |url=http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2013/07/11/judicial-watch-sues-national-archives-over-sealed-robert-kennedy-records-jfk-library/I140e1fFqfySi2Dbk5a63N/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013215801/http://archive.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2013/07/11/judicial-watch-sues-national-archives-over-sealed-robert-kennedy-records-jfk-library/I140e1fFqfySi2Dbk5a63N/story.html|publisher=The Boston Globe |access-date= August 25, 2015 |archive-date=October 13, 2016 }}</ref>

===Hillary Clinton email lawsuits===

Judicial Watch has currently filed twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails.<ref name="Pete Williams"/>

On February 8, 2016, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The Bureau was forced to formally acknowledge the investigation due to an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. FBI director [[James Comey]] had previously referenced the investigation, although the FBI had declined to confirm or deny it in court filings.<ref>{{cite news|title=FBI formally confirms its investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server |publisher=MSNBC |author=Pete Williams |date=February 8, 2016 |url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/fbi-formally-confirms-its-investigation-hillary-clintons-email-server }}</ref>

A federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016 that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.<ref name="Rosalind S. Helderman"/>

In May 2016 U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted “discovery” to Judicial Watch into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email system. This ruling allowed Judicial Watch to question two close Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, under oath. In a separate FOIA lawsuit concerning Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi terrorist attack, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled Judicial Watch can conduct discovery into the email practices of Clinton and her top aides.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calabresi |first=Massimo |date=2016-05-16|title=Why a Civil Case Over Emails Could Hurt Hillary Clinton More Than the FBI|url=http://time.com/4337518/hillary-clinton-emails-judicial-watch-civil-lawsuit/|work=TIME |access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref>

In a separate case, on March 29, 2016 U.S. District Court Judge [[Royce Lamberth]] granted Judicial Watch limited discovery, citing potential bad faith by the government in responding to requests for documents related to talking points provided to Susan Rice in response to the Benghazi attack.<ref>{{cite news|title=Second judge grants discovery in Clinton email lawsuit |publisher=Politico |author=Josh Gerstein  |date=March 29, 2016 |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/03/hillary-clinton-email-discovery-221338 }}</ref>

A FOIA lawsuit by Judicial Watch led to the release of 2,800 e-mails from Clinton aide [[Huma Abedin]] that were found on the laptop computer of [[Anthony Weiner]], Abedin's estranged husband. Five of the e-mails were classified.<ref>{{cite news|title=Classified emails from Huma Abedin found on Anthony Weiner's laptop |publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution |author=Shelby Lin Erdman  |date=December 29, 2017 |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/national/classified-emails-from-huma-abedin-found-anthony-weiner-laptop/eSsx0ryzKMyDUz119tLeQM/ }}</ref>

===False claims about George Zimmermann protests===

In 2013, Judicial Watch claimed that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration organized protests against George Zimmermann after the Trayvon Martin shooting; ''PolitiFact'' said that this was "mostly false" and that while Justice Department employees were sent to Florida, they "were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/jul/12/judicial-watch/judicial-watch-says-department-justice-unit-organi/|title=Judicial Watch says Department of Justice unit organized protests against George Zimmerman|work=@politifact|access-date=December 25, 2017|language=en}}</ref>

Fitton has made alarmist claims about voter fraud, saying "We have all heard about voter fraud and the attempts by liberal media organs like the ''New York Times'' and Ivory Tower academics to dismiss it as a nonexistent problem.

===Lawsuits against climate scientists===

Judicial Watch, which has claimed that climate science is "fraud science", has filed lawsuits seeking to force the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to release the correspondence of climate scientists who published a 2015 study in the journal ''Science''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/07/climate-scientists-are-under-attack-from-frivolous-lawsuits|title=Climate scientists are under attack from frivolous lawsuits {{!}} Lauren Kurtz|last=Kurtz|first=Lauren|date=July 7, 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 25, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The study had debunked one of the common claims made by those who reject the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change]], namely that there existed global warming "[[Global warming hiatus|hiatus]]" between 1998 and 2012. The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF), American Meteorological Society and Union of Concerned Scientists condemned Judicial Watch, saying that the disclosure of private communications between scientists "would harm (or halt altogether) government scientists' ability to collaborate with colleagues, damage the government's ability to recruit or retain top scientists, and deter critically important research into politically charged fields like climate change". The Judicial Watch lawsuit was inspired by Rep. [[Lamar Smith]], a [[climate change denial|climate change denier]]<ref name="wp20151023">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/10/23/congressional-skeptic-on-global-warming-demands-records-from-u-s-climate-scientists/?postshare=1741445691560607 | title=Congressional skeptic on global warming demands records from U.S. climate scientists | work=Washington Post | date=23 October 2015 | access-date=26 October 2015 | last=Warrick | first=Joby}}</ref> who had accused the authors of the study of "alter[ing] data" to "get the politically correct results they want."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/22/climate-change-science-attacks-threats-trump|title=Climate scientists face harassment, threats and fears of 'McCarthyist attacks'|last=Milman|first=Oliver|date=February 22, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 25, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Mueller and FBI investigations into Russian interference===

In 2017, Judicial Watch helped to stoke Republican attacks against [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019)|Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation]] into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the 2016 election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/no-longer-a-lonely-battle-how-the-campaign-against-the-mueller-probe-has-taken-hold/2017/12/24/441fc726-e5cb-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html|title=No longer a 'lonely battle': How the campaign against the Mueller probe has taken hold|last=Kranish|first=Michael|date=2017-12-24|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-19|last2=Barrett|first2=Devlin|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Demirjian|first3=Karoun}}</ref> Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton has called for the Special Counsel investigation to be shut down, arguing that prosecutors in the probe were too biased against President Trump to conduct a credible investigation, a claim rejected by Republican Senators [[Tom Tillis]] and [[Bob Corker]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/republicans-hammer-mueller-fbi-as-russia-investigation-intensifies/2017/12/06/4a6097ca-dabb-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html|title=Republicans hammer Mueller, FBI as Russia investigation intensifies|last=Barrett|first=Devlin|date=2017-12-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-19|last2=Sullivan|first2=Sean|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>  Fitton furthermore called for shutting down the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]] based on the claim that the Obama administration had turned it into a "[[KGB]]-type operation."<ref>{{cite news|first1=Julie Hirschfeld|last1=Davis|access-date=2020-11-06|title=Trump Calls Justice Department and F.B.I.

===Accusations against the Clinton Foundation===
In January 2018, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton repeated accusations against the Clinton Foundation that it had funneled money intended for charity work in Haiti to pay for Chelsea Clinton's wedding.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/13/politics/bill-clinton-denies-accusations-foundation-funds-wedding/index.html|title=Clinton denies foundation funds paid for wedding|first=Veronica |last=Stracqualursi|work=CNN|access-date=January 15, 2018}}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' fact-checked the claim a year earlier and found that it was "lacking any evidence".<ref name=":6" />

=== George Soros smears ===
In October 2018, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch stirred controversy when he appeared on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business show and used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was "Soros-occupied" territory. The remark echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a "Zionist-occupied government" to refer to Jewish control of the U.S. government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/oct/29/fox-business-news-antisemitism-claims-lou-dobbs-soros-migrant-caravan-comments-|title=Critics accuse Fox of allowing language that fuels antisemitism|last=Durkin|first=Erin|date=2018-10-29|work=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/28/media/lou-dobbs-fox-news-guest/index.html|title=Fox condemns rhetoric used by Lou Dobbs guest as channel's star host faces growing criticism|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref> After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that Farrell would no longer be booked.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/10/29/lou-dobbs-controversy-fox-bans-george-soros-conspiracy-theory-guest/1804634002/|title=Fox bans Lou Dobbs' guest over George Soros conspiracy theory|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":11" />

Farrell promoted the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that a migrant caravan traveling through Central America towards the United States was being directed or funded by the "Soros-occupied State Department".<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/30/662052937/u-s-agency-investigates-taxpayer-funded-anti-semitism-against-george-soros|title=U.S. Agency Investigates 'Taxpayer-Funded Anti-Semitism' Against George Soros|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}</ref> Judicial Watch had been engaged in what NPR described as a "full-throated campaign against Soros".

===Senator's letters to IRS===
According to [[Media Matters for America]], in 2015, Judicial Watch claimed that three newly obtained letters sent by Democatic senator [[Carl Levin]] to the commissioner of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] "discuss how to target conservative groups the senator claimed were 'engaged in political activities'." Media Matters for America reported that Judicial Watch provided a link to the documents on its site, but said it failed to note that one Levin letter did not mention conservatives, while the other two mentioned an equal number of liberal/Democrat and conservative/Republican entities. The Judicial Watch claim was amplified by several conservative media outlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-friends/irs-sen-carl-levin-and-truth-behind-right-wing-medias-latest-phony-conspiracy-theory|title=IRS, Sen.

=== 2020 election voter suppression ===
In 2020, Judicial Watch President [[Tom Fitton]] urged attendees of an event organized by the [[Council for National Policy]] to prevent mail-in ballots from being sent to voters, saying "We need to stop those ballots from going out, and I want the lawyers here to tell us what to do."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jr|first=Robert O'Harrow|title=Videos show closed-door sessions of leading conservative activists: ‘Be not afraid of the accusations that you’re a voter suppressor’|language=en-US|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/council-national-policy-video/2020/10/14/367f24c2-f793-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html|access-date=2020-10-14|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

==Larry Klayman lawsuits==

In 2003, Judicial Watch founder [[Larry Klayman]] left the organization to run for the [[United States Senate]] from Florida.<ref>''Pensacola News Journal'': "Senate candidate Klayman to visit area". February 23, 2004.</ref> In 2006, Klayman sued Judicial Watch and its president, [[Tom Fitton]]. Judicial Watch asserted several claims against Klayman as well.{{cn|date=May 2019}} In 2019, Judicial Watch obtained a $2.8 million verdict against Klayman on its claims of breaches of the severance agreement and trademark infringement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.law360.com/legalethics/articles/1140318/ex-judicial-watch-head-can-t-ditch-2-8m-verdict-in-tm-row|title=Ex-Judicial Watch Head Can't Ditch $2.8M Verdict In TM Row|date=March 19, 2019|work=[[Law360]]}}</ref>

In 2012, a Judicial Watch employee falsely told [[Orly Taitz]] that Klayman had been convicted of not paying child support (Klayman had been indicted, but the charges were later dismissed). Taitz then published the employee's comment on her website. Klayman sued Judicial Watch for defamation, and in 2014, a federal jury awarded Klayman $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/06/10/larry-klayman-wins-one-against-judicial-watch/|title=Larry Klayman wins one against Judicial Watch|first=David|last=Montgomery|date=June 10, 2014|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In 2017, Freedom Watch (Klayman's successor organization to Judicial Watch) unsuccessfully sued Judicial Watch and the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU), alleging they violated the [[Sherman Act]] by colluding to prevent Freedom Watch from participating at the ACU's [[Conservative Political Action Conference]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/511155594-freedom-watch-inc-alleges-judicial-watch-american-conservation-union-is-restraining-trade|title=Freedom Watch Inc. alleges Judicial Watch, American Conservation Union is restraining trade|first=Louie|last=Torres|date=August 1, 2017|work=Legal NewsLine}}</ref>

Klayman had represented three individuals who sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but he failed to obtain Judicial Watch's consent to waive his conflict of interest. Klayman maintained that the [[District of Columbia Bar|D.C. Bar]] had "recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/legaltimes/id=1202660661736/DC-Attorney-Larry-Klayman-Agrees-to-Censure-in-Ethics-Case?mcode=0&curindex=0&back=NLJ&curpage=ALL&slreturn=20140525130723|title=D.C.
