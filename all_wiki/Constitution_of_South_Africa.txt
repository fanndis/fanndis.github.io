{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''Constitution of South Africa''' is the supreme [[law]] of the Republic of [[South Africa]]. It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the [[republic]], it sets out the [[human rights|rights]] and [[Duty|duties]] of its citizens, and defines the structure of the [[Government of South Africa|Government]]. The current [[constitution]], the country's fifth, was drawn up by the [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] elected in 1994 in the [[South African general election, 1994]]. It was promulgated by [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] on 18 December 1996 and came into effect on 4 February 1997, replacing the [[South African Constitution of 1993|Interim Constitution]] of 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/theconstitution/thecertificationprocess.htm |title=The Constitution: The certification process |publisher=Constitutional Court of South Africa |accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref> The first constitution was enacted by the [[South Africa Act 1909]], the longest-lasting to date. Since [[South African Constitution of 1961|1961]], the constitutions have promulgated a republican form of government. 

Since 1996, the Constitution has been amended by seventeen amendment acts. The Constitution is formally entitled the "'''Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996'''." It was previously also numbered as if it were an [[Act of Parliament]]—Act No. 108 of 1996—but, since the passage of the [[Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005|Citation of Constitutional Laws Act]],<ref>Act 5 of 2005.</ref> neither it nor the acts amending it are allocated act numbers.

== History ==

===Previous Constitutions of South Africa===

The [[South Africa Act 1909]], an act of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], unified four British colonies{{dash}}[[Cape Colony]], [[Transvaal Colony]], [[Orange River Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]]{{dash}}into the [[Union of South Africa]], a self-governing [[dominion]].

The [[Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961]] transformed the union into a republic, replacing the [[Queen of South Africa|Queen]] with a [[State President of South Africa|State President]], but otherwise leaving the system of government largely unchanged. By removing the last Commonwealth thresholds, however, the act made the then-apartheid government completely sovereign. In [[South African republic referendum, 1961|a referendum]], the first national election with a solely white electorate, the Act was narrowly approved, with a substantial minority in the [[Cape province]] and a strong majority in [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] opposing it. 

The [[Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1983]], again approved by a whites-only referendum, created the [[Tricameral Parliament]], with separate houses representing [[White South African|White]], [[Coloured]] and [[Indian South African|Indian]] people but without representation for [[black African|black people]]. The figurehead State President and executive [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] were merged into an executive State President, chosen by parliament. This contradiction remains to date and is nearly unique to South Africa (one exception being neighbouring [[Botswana]]).

The [[Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993]] or Interim Constitution was introduced at the end of [[apartheid]] to govern the period of transition. It introduced, for the first time, the framework of a liberal democracy, [[universal adult suffrage]], [[constitutional supremacy]] and a [[bill of rights]].

=== Negotiations ===

An integral part of the [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]] was the creation of a new constitution. One of the major disputed issues was the process by which such a constitution would be adopted. The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) insisted that it should be drawn up by a democratically elected [[constituent assembly]], while the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) feared that the rights of minorities would not be protected in such a process, and proposed instead that the constitution be negotiated by consensus between the parties and then put to a [[referendum]].<ref name="barnes">{{cite web |first1=Catherine |last1=Barnes |first2=Eldred |last2=de Klerk |title=South Africa’s multi-party constitutional negotiation process |year=2002 |work=Owning the process: Public participation in peacemaking |publisher=Conciliation Resources |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/public-participation/southafrica-multiparty-process.php |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="goldstone">{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Goldstone |authorlink=Richard Goldstone |title=The South African Bill of Rights |year=1997 |journal=Texas International Law Journal |volume=32 |pages=451–470}}</ref>

Formal negotiations began in December 1991 at the [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (CODESA). The parties agreed on a process whereby a negotiated [[transitional constitution]] would provide for an elected constitutional assembly to draw up a permanent constitution.<ref name="barnes" /> The CODESA negotiations broke down, however, after the second plenary session in May 1992. One of the major points of dispute was the size of the [[supermajority]] that would be required for the assembly to adopt the constitution: The NP wanted a 75 per cent requirement,<ref name="goldstone" /> which would effectively have given it a veto.<ref name="barnes" />

In April 1993, the parties returned to negotiations, in what was known as the Multi-Party Negotiating Process (MPNP). A committee of the MPNP proposed the development of a collection of "constitutional principles" with which the final constitution would have to comply, so that basic freedoms would be ensured and minority rights protected, without overly limiting the role of the elected constitutional assembly.<ref name="goldstone" /> The parties to the MPNP adopted this idea and proceeded to draft the [[South African Constitution of 1993|Interim Constitution of 1993]], which was formally enacted by [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and came into force on 27 April 1994.

=== Interim Constitution ===

The Interim Constitution provided for a Parliament made up of two houses: a 400-members [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]], directly elected by [[party-list proportional representation]], and a ninety-member [[Senate of South Africa|Senate]], in which each of the nine [[provinces of South Africa|provinces]] was represented by ten Senators, elected by the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]]. The [[Constitutional Assembly of South Africa|Constitutional Assembly]] consisted of both houses sitting together, and was responsible for drawing up a final constitution within two years. The adoption of a new constitutional text required a two-thirds supermajority in the Constitutional Assembly, as well as the support of two-thirds of senators on matters relating to provincial government. If a two-thirds majority could not be obtained, a constitutional text could be adopted by a simple majority and then put to a national referendum in which sixty per cent support would be required for it to pass.<ref name="Klug2010">{{cite book|author=Heinz Klug|title=The Constitution of South Africa: A Contextual Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3p6BAAAQBAJ|date=15 July 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84731-741-4}}</ref>

The Interim Constitution contained 34 constitutional principles with which the new constitution was required to comply. These included [[multi-party democracy]] with regular elections and [[universal adult suffrage]], supremacy of the constitution over all other law, a quasi-[[federalism|federal]] system in place of [[centralised government]], non-[[racism]] and non-[[sexism]], the protection of "all universally accepted fundamental rights, freedoms and [[civil liberties]]," equality before the law, the [[separation of powers]] with an impartial [[judiciary]], provincial and local levels of government with democratic representation, and protection of the diversity of [[language]]s and [[culture]]s. The Bill of Rights, now in [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa]], was largely written by [[Kader Asmal]] and [[Albie Sachs]]. The new constitutional text was to be tested against these principles by the newly established [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]. If the text complied with the principles, it would become the new constitution; if it did not, it would be referred back to the Constitutional Assembly.

=== Final text ===

The Constitutional Assembly engaged in a massive public participation programme to solicit views and suggestions from the public. As the deadline for the adoption of a constitutional text approached, however, many issues were hashed out in private meetings between the parties' representatives.<ref name="barnes" /> On 8 May 1996, a new text was adopted with the support of 86 per cent of the members of the assembly,<ref name="goldstone" /> but in the ''[[First Certification]]'' judgment, delivered on 6 September 1996, the Constitutional Court refused to certify this text.  The Constitutional Court identified a number of provisions that did not comply with the constitutional principles.  Areas of non-compliance included failures to protect the right of employees to engage in collective bargaining; to provide for the constitutional review of ordinary statutes; to entrench fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties and to sufficiently safeguard the independence of the Public Protector and Auditor-General as well as other areas of non-compliance in relation to local government responsibilities and powers.<ref>{{cite SAFLII |litigants=[[Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]]5th, 1996 |court=ZACC |year=1996 |num=26 |parallelcite=1996 (4) SA 744, 1996 (10) BCLR 1253 |date=6 September 1996 |courtname=auto}}</ref>

The Constitutional Assembly reconvened and, on 11 October, adopted an amended constitutional text containing many changes relative to the previous text. Some dealt with the court's reasons for non-certification, while others tightened up the text. The amended text was returned to the Constitutional Court to be certified, which the court duly did in its ''[[Second Certification]]'' judgment, delivered on 4 December.<ref>{{cite SAFLII |litigants=[[Certification of the Amended Text of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa]] |court=ZACC |year=1996 |num=24 |parallelcite=1997 (2) SA 97, 1997 (1) BCLR 1 |date=4 December 1996 |courtname=auto}}</ref> The Constitution was signed by President Mandela on 10 December and officially published in the ''[[Government Gazette of South Africa|Government Gazette]]'' on 18 December. It did not come into force immediately; it was brought into operation on 4 February 1997, by a presidential proclamation, except for some financial provisions which were delayed until 1 January 1998.

Since its adoption, the Constitution has been amended seventeen times; these amendments are described in a separate section [[Constitution of South Africa#Amendments|below]].

== Contents ==

The constitution consists of a preamble, fourteen chapters containing 244 sections,<ref>The last section is numbered 243, but a section 230A was inserted after section 230 by the Sixth Amendment.</ref> and eight schedules. Each chapter deals with a particular topic; the schedules contain ancillary information referred to in the main text.

=== Chapter 1: Founding Provisions ===

{{main|Chapter 1 of the Constitution of South Africa}}

Chapter 1 enshrines in the constitution key national principles, defines the country's [[national flag|flag]] and [[national anthem]], and specifies the official languages and principles of government language policy. It defines South Africa as "one, sovereign, [[democracy|democratic]] state" based on principles of human rights, constitutional supremacy, the [[rule of law]] and universal adult suffrage. The chapter contains a supremacy clause which establishes that all other law and actions are subject to the constitution.

=== Chapter 2: Bill of Rights ===

{{main|Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa}}

Chapter 2 is a [[bill of rights]] which enumerates the [[civil and political rights|civil, political]], [[economic, social and cultural rights|economic, social and cultural]] [[human rights]] of the people of South Africa.

Section 36 allows the rights listed to be limited only by laws of general application, and only to the extent that the restriction is reasonable and justifiable in "an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom."<ref>s 36(1).</ref>

Section 37 allows certain rights to be limited during a [[state of emergency]] but places strict procedural limits on the declaration of states of emergency and provides for the rights of people detained as a result.

=== Chapter 3: Co-operative Government ===

Chapter 3 deals with the relationships between organs of government in the three "spheres"{{dash}}national, [[Provinces of South Africa|provincial]] and [[Municipalities of South Africa|local]]. It lays down a set of principles requiring them to co-operate in [[good faith]] and to act in the best interests of the people. It also requires them to attempt to [[dispute resolution|settle dispute]]s amicably before resorting to the courts.

=== Chapter 4: Parliament ===

Chapter 4 defines the structure of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]], the [[legislative branch]] of the national government. Parliament consists of two houses, the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (the [[lower house]]), which is directly elected by the people, and the [[National Council of Provinces]] (the [[upper house]]), which is elected by the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]].

The Chapter defines the principles governing the election and dissolution of the houses, qualifications for membership of Parliament, [[quorum]] requirements, procedures for the election of presiding officers, and the powers and privileges and immunities of Parliament and its members. It lays down the process for enacting [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] into law; different procedures are provided for constitutional amendments, ordinary bills not affecting provincial matters, ordinary bills affecting provincial matters, and [[money bill]]s.

=== Chapter 5: The President and National Executive ===

Chapter 5 defines the structure of the national executive and the powers of the [[President of South Africa|President]]. It provides for the election and removal of the President by the National Assembly, and limits a President to two five-year terms. It vests in him or her the powers of the head of state and head of government; it provides for the appointment of a [[Cabinet of South Africa|Cabinet]] by the President; and it provides for the accountability to Parliament of the President and Cabinet.

=== Chapter 6: Provinces ===

{{see also|Provincial governments of South Africa}}

Chapter 6 establishes the nine [[provinces of South Africa]] and defines the powers and structure of the provincial governments. The boundaries of the provinces are defined by reference to Schedule 1A to the Constitution, which refers in turn to the boundaries of the [[districts of South Africa|metropolitan and district municipalities]].

In some respects, the chapter is a template which a province may modify to a limited extent by adopting its own provincial constitution. (The only province so far to have done this is the [[Western Cape]].) The chapter provides for a unicameral [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|legislature]], a [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] elected by the legislature as head of the provincial executive, and an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] appointed by the Premier as a provincial cabinet.

The provincial government is given exclusive powers over certain matters, listed in Schedule 5, and powers concurrent with the national government over other matters, listed in Schedule 4. The chapter regulates the conflict between national and provincial legislation on the same topic, setting out the circumstances under which one or the other will prevail.

=== Chapter 7: Local Government ===

Chapter 7 sets out a framework for [[local government]]. It requires [[municipalities of South Africa|municipalities]] to be established for the whole territory of South Africa, and provides for three categories of municipalities, whereby some areas are governed by a single "Category A" municipal authority and others are governed by a two-level system with a larger "Category C" municipality containing multiple "Category B" municipalities. The municipalities are granted the power to administer certain matters listed in Schedules 4 and 5, and the executive and legislative authority is vested in the municipal council. The chapter requires municipal elections to be held every five years.

=== Chapter 8: Courts and Administration of Justice ===

Chapter 8 establishes the structure of the [[judiciary of South Africa|judicial system]]. It defines the hierarchy consisting of [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|Magistrates' Courts]], the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], and the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]. It provides for the appointment of judges by the President on the advice of the [[Judicial Service Commission (South Africa)|Judicial Service Commission]] and establishes a single [[National Prosecuting Authority]] responsible for all criminal prosecutions.

=== Chapter 9: State Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy ===

{{see also|Chapter nine institutions}}

Chapter 9 creates a number of other commissions and offices to protect and support democracy and human rights. These are the [[Public Protector]] (an [[ombudsman]]), the [[South African Human Rights Commission]], the [[Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities]], the [[Commission for Gender Equality]], the [[Auditor-General (South Africa)|Auditor-General]], the [[Independent Electoral Commission (South Africa)|Independent Electoral Commission]] and the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa|Independent Communications Authority]].

=== Chapter 10: Public Administration ===

Chapter 10 lists values and principles for the administration of the [[civil service]] and establishes the [[Public Service Commission (South Africa)|Public Service Commission]] to oversee it.

=== Chapter 11: Security Services ===

Chapter 11 establishes structures for civilian control of the [[South African National Defence Force|Defence Force]], the [[South African Police Service|Police Service]] and the [[State Security Agency (South Africa)|intelligence services]]. It makes the President the Commander-in-Chief of the defence force but places conditions on when and how it may be employed and requires regular reports to Parliament. The police service is placed under the control of the national government but gives provincial governments some power to administer and oversee policing.

=== Chapter 12: Traditional Leaders ===

Chapter 12 recognises the status and authority of [[traditional leader]]s and [[customary law in South Africa|customary law]], subject to the Constitution. It allows for the creation of provincial houses of traditional leaders and a national council of traditional leaders.

The Traditional leaders must have responsibilities in affairs and decision making of the municipality in order to build proper sustainable development to the people that resides on that municipality. Because we have Traditional leaders that don't have daily duties day in and day out; in short they must be part of mayoral council.

=== Chapter 13: Finance ===

Chapter 13 deals with [[public finance]]. It establishes a [[National Revenue Fund]], from which money may be appropriated only by an act of Parliament, and [[Provincial Revenue Fund]]s, from which money may only be appropriated by an act of the provincial legislature. It provides for an equitable distribution of national revenue to the provinces and municipalities, and grants provincial and local governments the powers to raise certain rates and taxes. It requires effective and transparent budgeting at all levels of government and gives the [[National Treasury (South Africa)|National Treasury]] the power to oversee budgetary processes. It places some restrictions on [[government procurement]] and [[government borrowing]]. The chapter establishes the [[Financial and Fiscal Commission (South Africa)|Financial and Fiscal Commission]], to advise government on financial matters, and the [[South African Reserve Bank|Reserve Bank]], to oversee the [[currency]].

===Chapter 14: General Provisions===

The final chapter deals with transitional and incidental provisions. In particular, the first part deals with [[international law]], providing that existing agreements binding South Africa will continue to bind it, and that new agreements (except those of a technical nature) will only be binding once approved by Parliament. It also provides that [[customary international law]] applies in South African unless it conflicts with national law, and that the courts must, where possible, interpret national law to be consistent with international law.

The remainder of the chapter contains a miscellaneous collection of provisions,

* allowing Parliament to enact Charters of Rights which expand on the Bill of Rights;
* allowing recognition of the right of [[self-determination]] of communities within South Africa;
* requiring public funding for [[political parties]] represented in national and provincial legislatures;
* requiring that obligations imposed by the constitution be carried out without delay;
* providing that some executive powers may be delegated by one organ of state to another;
* defining certain terms used in the text of the constitution; and,
* as the Constitution is published in all eleven [[languages of South Africa|official languages]], providing that the [[English language|English]] text is authoritative in the event of a conflict.

Chapter 14 also repeals the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]] and refers to Schedule 6 to govern the process of transition to the new Constitution. Finally, it gives the Constitution its formal title, "Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996," and defines the schedule for its commencement, under which the President set the date of commencement for most sections, although certain sections dealing with financial matters commenced only on 1 January 1998.

=== Schedules ===

* Schedule 1, referred to in [[Constitution of South Africa#Chapter 1: Founding Provisions|Chapter 1]], describes the [[flag of South Africa|national flag]].
* Schedule 1A, referred to in [[Constitution of South Africa#Chapter 6: Provinces|Chapter 6]], defines the [[geographical]] areas of the provinces, by reference to [[map]]s published by the [[Municipal Demarcation Board]] defining the [[districts of South Africa|metropolitan and district municipalities]].
* Schedule 2 contains the texts of the [[oath]]s or [[affirmation in law|solemn affirmations]] to be sworn by political office-holders and judges.
* Schedule 3 describes the procedure for the election of the President by the National Assembly and the election of presiding officers by legislative bodies, as well as the formula whereby seats in the National Council of Provinces are to be allocated to political parties.
* Schedule 4 lists the "functional areas" over which Parliament and the provincial legislatures have concurrent competence to legislate.
* Schedule 5 lists the functional areas over which the provincial legislatures have exclusive competence to legislate.
* Schedule 6 details the transitional arrangements by which institutions existing under the previous constitution were converted into the institutions established by the new constitution. It provides for the continuation of existing laws and the assignment of their administration to the provincial governments where appropriate. It also provides for certain sections of the old constitution to continue in force despite its repeal, and subject to amendments listed in the schedule. It also includes temporary amendments to the Constitution's own text which allowed the Government of National Unity to continue until the 1999 election.
* Schedule 7 lists the laws repealed by the new constitution, these being the interim constitution and the ten amendments made to it.

== Amendments ==

Section 74 of the Constitution provides that a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] to amend the Constitution can only be passed if at least two-thirds of the members of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] (that is, at least 267 of the 400 members) vote in favour of it. If the amendment affects provincial powers or boundaries, or if it amends the Bill of Rights, at least six of the nine provinces in the [[National Council of Provinces]] must also vote for it. To amend section 1 of the Constitution, which establishes the existence of South Africa as a sovereign, democratic state, and lays out the country's founding values, would require the support of three-quarters of the members of the National Assembly. There have been seventeen amendments since 1996.

=== First Amendment ===

{{main|First Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution First Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1997) was signed by the President on 28 August 1997 but had effect retroactively to 4 February 1997 when the constitution came into force. It had three provisions:
* to provide that a person who serves as Acting President of the Republic more than once during a single presidential term only has to swear the [[oath of office]] the first time that they become Acting President.
* to allow the President of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] to designate another judge to administer the oath of office to the President or Acting President, rather than administering it personally.
* to extend the cut-off date for actions for which [[amnesty]] could be granted by the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]], changing it from 6 December 1993 to 11 May 1994.

This last change allowed the TRC to deal with various violent events, particularly the [[Bophuthatswana coup d'état of 1994|Bophuthatswana ''coup d'état'']] and its aftermath, that had occurred in the run-up to the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 general elections]].

=== Second Amendment ===

{{main|Second Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Second Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1998) came into force on 7 October 1998. It had five provisions:
* to extend the [[term of office]] of [[municipal council]]s from four years to five years.
* to extend certain deadlines in the process of transition to the post-apartheid system of local government.
* to allow for the designation of alternates to replace members of the [[Judicial Service Commission (South Africa)|Judicial Service Commission]].
* to give Parliament the ability to assign additional powers or functions to the [[Public Service Commission (South Africa)|Public Service Commission]].
* to rename the Human Rights Commission to the [[South African Human Rights Commission]].

=== Third Amendment ===

{{main|Third Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Third Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 1998) came into force on 30 October 1998. It allowed for [[municipalities of South Africa|municipalities]] to be established across [[Provinces of South Africa|provincial]] boundaries by the agreement of the national and the relevant provincial governments. The changes it made were reversed in 2005 by the Twelfth Amendment.

=== Fourth and Fifth Amendments ===

{{main|Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Fourth Amendment Act and Constitution Fifth Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 1999 and Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 1999) came into force on 19 March 1999. They were passed as two separate amendments because the Fourth contained provisions affecting provincial government, which required the approval of the [[National Council of Provinces]], while the Fifth did not.

The Fourth Amendment:
* clarified that elections to the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] may be called either before or after the term of office of the previous legislature has expired.
* modified the formula for the allocation of delegates' seats to parties in the [[National Council of Provinces]].

The Fifth Amendment:
* clarified that elections to the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] may be called either before or after the term of office of the previous Assembly has expired.
* allowed the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the [[Financial and Fiscal Commission]] to be part-time members.

=== Sixth Amendment ===

{{main|Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Sixth Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 2001) came into force on 21 November 2001. Its main effect was to give the title of "[[Chief Justice of South Africa]]" to the presiding judge of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]], who had previously been titled "President of the Constitutional Court". The presiding judge of the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] (SCA), who had previously had the title of Chief Justice, became instead "President of the Supreme Court of Appeal". The deputy heads of each court were also renamed similarly. Consequentially many provisions of the Constitution had to be amended where they made reference to the President of the Constitutional Court.

These changes were intended to clarify the structure of the [[Judiciary of South Africa|South African judiciary]]. Previously, the President of the Constitutional Court was responsible for various constitutional responsibilities, such as calling the first session of Parliament after an election and presiding over the election of the President of the Republic at that session, while the Chief Justice was responsible for judicial administration, including for example chairing the [[Judicial Service Commission (South Africa)|Judicial Service Commission]]. These responsibilities were merged into a single post, reflecting the pre-eminence of the Constitutional Court at the apex of the court system.

Other provisions of the amendment:

* allowed the term of office of a Constitutional Court judge{{dash}}usually twelve years or until the judge reaches the age of seventy, whichever is shorter{{dash}}to be extended by an Act of Parliament.
* allowed the President to appoint two Deputy Ministers from outside the National Assembly, where previously Deputy Ministers had to be members of the Assembly.
* allowed [[municipal council]]s to bind the authority of future successor councils, as security for a loan.

=== Seventh Amendment ===

{{main|Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Seventh Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2001) came into force on 26 April 2006, except for provisions affecting the [[Financial and Fiscal Commission]] which came into force on 1 December 2003. It made various amendments to provisions affecting the financial management of national and provincial government, including:
* an extension of what is considered a "[[money bill]]" in the national [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]].
* requiring that Division of Revenue Bills (bills dividing revenue between national, provincial and local government) can only be introduced to Parliament by the [[Minister of Finance (South Africa)|Minister of Finance]].
* reducing the size of the Financial and Fiscal Commission from 22 members to nine members, by reducing the number of members chosen by the president from nine to two, and by replacing the nine members chosen by the nine provinces individually with three members chosen by the provinces collectively.
* modifying the mechanisms whereby the national government can control the financial practices of the provincial governments.

=== Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments ===

{{main|Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|Ninth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|Tenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}
{{see|Floor crossing (South Africa)}}

These amendments allowed legislators to [[Floor crossing (South Africa)|cross the floor]], that is, to resign from their political party and join a different party (or form a new party) without losing their elected position. This was not originally allowed because South African elections are based on [[party-list proportional representation]] in which voters choose a political party rather than an individual candidate. Floor crossing therefore means that the composition of the elected bodies no longer represents the preferences of voters.

The Eighth and Ninth Amendments came into force on 20 June 2002, as did an ordinary act of Parliament called the [[Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Act, 2002]]. The Eighth Amendment allowed members of [[municipal council]]s to cross the floor. The Loss or Retention of Membership Act was intended to allow members of the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] to cross the floor. The Ninth Amendment made provision for the reallocation of seats in the [[National Council of Provinces]] when the party composition of a provincial legislature changed as a result of floor crossing.

However, on 4 October 2002, in the case of ''[[United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others]]'', the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] found the Loss or Retention of Membership Act to be unconstitutional, so floor crossing remained prohibited in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures. The Tenth Amendment was introduced to constitutionally allow floor crossing in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures; it came into force on 20 March 2003.

The changes made by these three amendments were reversed when floor crossing was ended in 2009 by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.

=== Eleventh Amendment ===

{{main|Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Eleventh Amendment Act (formerly the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2003) came into force on 11 July 2003. It renamed the Northern Province to [[Limpopo]], altered the procedure for intervention by the national government in a failing provincial government and intervention by a provincial government in a failing municipality, and expanded the powers of the provincial executive when it intervenes in a municipality.

=== Twelfth and Thirteenth Amendments ===

{{main|Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

[[File:South Africa 2006 provincial border changes map.svg|thumb|right|Areas and boundaries affected by the Twelfth Amendment]]

The Constitution Twelfth Amendment Act came into force on 1 March 2006; it altered the boundaries of seven of the [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]]. In the interim constitution the provinces had been defined in terms of [[Magistrate's court (South Africa)|magisterial districts]]; the amendment redefined them in terms of the [[Districts of South Africa|district and metropolitan municipalities]]. The Twelfth Amendment also removed the provisions introduced by the Third Amendment that allowed municipalities to be established across provincial boundaries.

Some of the boundary changes encountered substantial public opposition. The community of [[Matatiele]], which had been transferred from [[KwaZulu-Natal]] to the [[Eastern Cape]], challenged the amendment before the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], which ruled on 18 August 2006 that the [[KwaZulu-Natal Legislature]] had not allowed for the necessary public participation before approving the amendment. The court's order was suspended for eighteen months, and during that time Parliament re-enacted the Matatiele boundary change as the Thirteenth Amendment, which came into force on 14 December 2007.

The people of [[Khutsong]], which had been transferred from [[Gauteng]] to the [[North West (South African province)|North West]], resorted to marches, protests (in some cases violent) and boycotts and stayaways. In 2009 the [[Merafong City Local Municipality|Merafong City Municipality]], which contains Khutsong, was transferred back to Gauteng by the Sixteenth Amendment.

=== Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments ===

{{main|Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}
The Constitution Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment Acts came into force on 17 April 2009; they repealed the [[Floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] provisions introduced by the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Amendments.

The Fourteenth Amendment contained the provisions which affected the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] and the [[National Council of Provinces]] (NCOP), and therefore had to be approved by supermajority in the NCOP as well as the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]], while the Fifteenth Amendment contained the remaining provisions which only had to be approved by the Assembly.

=== Sixteenth Amendment ===

{{main|Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Sixteenth Amendment Act came into force on 3 April 2009. It transferred the [[Merafong City Local Municipality|Merafong City Municipality]] from the [[North West (South African province)|North West]] province to [[Gauteng]] province. This followed community opposition and protest in [[Khutsong]] following from the boundary change introduced by the Twelfth Amendment.

=== Seventeenth Amendment ===

{{main|Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa}}

The Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act came into force on 23 August 2013; along with the [[Superior Courts Act, 2013|Superior Courts Act]] it restructured the judicial system. The amendment:
* declared the [[Chief Justice of South Africa|Chief Justice]] to be the head of the judiciary, with responsibility for administrative oversight of the [[courts of South Africa|courts]].
* expanded the jurisdiction of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] so that, as well as constitutional matters, it has jurisdiction over any matters of general public importance that it chooses to hear.
* removed the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]] over appeals from the [[Labour Appeal Court of South Africa|Labour Appeal Court]] and the [[Competition Appeal Court of South Africa|Competition Appeal Court]].
* altered references to the High Courts so that they are regarded as divisions of a single [[High Court of South Africa]] rather than separate courts.
* allowed the appointment of a Constitutional Court judge as [[acting (law)|acting]] [[Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa|Deputy Chief Justice]] (DCJ) if the position is vacant or the DCJ is absent.
