The '''Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand''' ({{lang-mi|Rōpū Kākāriki o Aotearoa, Niu Tireni}}), commonly known as the '''Greens''', is a [[Green politics|green]] and [[left-wing]] [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political party in New Zealand]].<ref name="Miller">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Raymond|title=Democracy in New Zealand|date=2015|publisher=Auckland University Press|page=169|isbn=9781775588085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1T93CQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PT146}}</ref><ref name="Mazzoleni">{{cite book|last1=Mazzoleni|first1=Juliet Roper; Christina Holtz-Bacha; Gianpietro|title=The Politics of Representation: Election Campaigning and Proportional Representation|date=2004|publisher=Lang|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=9780820461489|page=40}}</ref> Like many green parties around the world, it has four organisational pillars ([[ecology]], [[social justice]], [[grassroots democracy]], and [[nonviolence]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kitschelt|first1=Herbert P.|s2cid=189889610|title=Review of The Global Promise of Green Politics|jstor=657226|journal=Theory and Society|pages=525–533|date=1 January 1985|doi=10.1007/BF00159254}}</ref> The party's ideology combines [[environmentalism]] with left-wing and [[social-democratic]] economic policies,<ref name="Miller"/> including well-funded and locally controlled public services within the confines of a [[steady-state economy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Sustainable Economy for New Zealand|url=https://home.greens.org.nz/sites/default/files/A_Sustainable_Economy_for_New_Zealand.pdf|publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|access-date=1 November 2017|date=12 November 2010}}</ref> Internationally, it is affiliated with the [[Global Greens]].<ref name="globalgreens"/>

==Principles and policies==
[[File:Green Party banner.jpg|thumb|Green Party supporters in Christchurch attending a demonstration, 1 December 2012]]
The Green Party was founded to counter what it sees as the threats to the natural environment and [[Environmental issues in New Zealand|environmental issues]] remain its main focus. In recent times, it has expressed concerns about [[Mining in New Zealand|mining]] of [[National parks of New Zealand|national parks]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/conservation/mining |title=NZ Greens Conservation Mining |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=31 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231083238/http://www.greens.org.nz/conservation/mining |archive-date=31 December 2010  }}</ref> [[Water in New Zealand|fresh water]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/water|title=Campaigns: Water|publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|access-date=31 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231001614/http://www.greens.org.nz/water|archive-date=31 December 2010}}</ref> [[Climate change in New Zealand|climate change]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/climate/ |title=NZ Greens: Campaigns: Climate Change |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203150202/http://www.greens.org.nz/campaigns/climate/ |archive-date=3 December 2008  }}</ref> [[peak oil]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/peakoil/ |title=NZ Greens: Campaigns: Peak Oil |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704070931/http://www.greens.org.nz/campaigns/peakoil/ |archive-date=4 July 2008  }}</ref> and the release of [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] organisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/ge/ |title=NZ Greens: Campaigns: Genetic Engineering |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827205300/http://greens.org.nz/ge |archive-date=27 August 2008  }}</ref> The party has also spoken out in support of [[Human rights in New Zealand|human rights]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/humanrights/ |title=NZ Greens: Campaigns: Human Rights |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629201201/http://www.greens.org.nz/campaigns/humanrights/ |archive-date=29 June 2007  }}</ref> and against [[military]] operations conducted by the [[United States]] and other countries in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/campaigns/peace/ |title=NZ Greens: Campaigns: JustPeace |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071431/http://www.greens.org.nz/campaigns/peace/ |archive-date=4 July 2008  }}</ref>

The party accepts [[Treaty of Waitangi|Te Tiriti o Waitangi]] (the [[Māori language|Māori]] version of the treaty) as the founding document of New Zealand and recognises [[Māori people|Māori]] as {{lang|mi|[[tangata whenua]]}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greens.org.nz/charter|title=The Green Charter|publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|language=en|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref>

In its [[Economy of New Zealand|economic policies]], the Green Party stresses factors such as [[sustainability]], [[tax]]ing the indirect costs of pollution, and [[fair trade]]. It also states that measuring economic success should concentrate on [[measuring well-being]] rather than analysing [[economic indicators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/searchdocs/PR3136.html |title=Greens Call For Dinosaur GDP To Go |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |date=27 March 2000 |access-date=29 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015141001/http://greens.org.nz/searchdocs/PR3136.html |archive-date=15 October 2006  }}</ref> The party wants the eventual introduction of a [[universal basic income]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Income Support Policy |url=https://www.greens.org.nz/income_support_policy |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |access-date=7 August 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

Some of the founding members of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, notably [[Jeanette Fitzsimons]], [[Rod Donald]] and [[Mike Ward (New Zealand politician)|Mike Ward]], had been active members of the Values Party at the outset of the [[Green movement]] in the 1970s.

In May 1990, remnants of the Values Party merged with a number of other environmentalist organizations to form the modern Green Party.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Greens merge |work=[[Auckland Star]] |date=28 May 1990 |page=A3 }}</ref> This sparked a resurgence of support, with the new group winning 6.85% of the vote (but no seats) in the [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]].

===The Alliance years===
The following year, the Greens became co-founding members of the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], a five-party grouping that also consisted of the [[New Zealand Democratic Party for Social Credit|Democrats]], [[New Zealand Liberal Party (1992)|Liberals]], [[Mana Motuhake (political party)|Mana Motuhake]] and [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]].<ref name="Green History"/> The Greens contested the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993]] and [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]s as part of the Alliance.

Until the 1995 annual conference in [[Taupo]], the Greens had no elected leaders. At that conference, Fitzsimons was elected unopposed as female co-leader, and Donald defeated Joel Cayford and Mike Smith in a three-way contest to become male co-leader.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Evening Post (Wellington)|The Evening Post]] |page=2 |title=Greens seek higher profile |date=22 May 1995 }}</ref>

After New Zealand adopted the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system in 1996, the Alliance gained entry to Parliament, bringing three Green [[list MP]]s with them: Fitzsimons, Donald and [[Phillida Bunkle]].<ref>{{cite news |last=White |first=Mike |title=Are the Greens still scary?

In 1997, feeling that membership of the Alliance had subsumed their identity, the Greens took the decision to stand candidates independently of the Alliance at the next election.<ref name="Green History"/> While most of the Green party members left the Alliance, some decided instead to leave the Green Party and stay in the Alliance (including Bunkle, who would later be appointed [[Minister of Customs (New Zealand)|Minister of Customs]] in the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-Alliance coalition government]]). Conversely, some of the Alliance party members who joined the Alliance via other parties decided to leave the Alliance and join the Green Party, notably [[Sue Bradford]] and [[Keith Locke]], who both joined the Alliance via NewLabour.<ref name="Vowels et al">{{cite journal |last1=Vowels|first1=Jack|last2=Coffé |first2=Hilde |last3=Curtin |first3=Jennifer |title=The 2014 New Zealand election in perspective |journal=A Bark but No Bite |date=2017 |pages=1–24 |publisher=ANU Press|jstor=j.ctt1vw0p68.7|isbn=9781760461355}}</ref>

===Green Party in Parliament===
[[File:RodDonaldGreenMP.jpg|upright|thumb|Former Green Party co-leader [[Rod Donald]].]]

====1999 election====
In the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]], the Greens gained 5.16% of the vote and seven seats in Parliament. Fitzsimons also won the electorate seat of [[Coromandel (New Zealand electorate)|Coromandel]]. It is believed that this is the first time a Green candidate won a first-past-the-post parliamentary election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.greens.org.nz/history-green-party#toc-the-1990s-and-the-first-green-party-campaign|title=The History of The Green Party|publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|access-date=28 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128024547/https://home.greens.org.nz/history-green-party#toc-the-1990s-and-the-first-green-party-campaign|archive-date=28 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the ten days it took to count special votes and confirm Fitzsimons' election, [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] concluded a coalition agreement with the Alliance which excluded the Greens. However, the party supported the government on [[confidence and supply]] in return for some input into the budget and legislation. This led to the Greens gaining a $15&nbsp;million energy efficiency and environmental package in the new government's first budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.nz/docs/press/000615budget01-leaders.htm |title=Green Budget Package far reaching |publisher=Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand |date=15 June 2000 |access-date=29 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217220028/http://www.greens.org.nz/docs/press/000615budget01-leaders.htm |archive-date=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Over the term, the Greens developed a good working relationship with the government and also had some input into policy, notably Sue Bradford's amendments to the [[Employment Relations Act 2000]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====2002 election====
In the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], the Greens polled 7.00%, increasing their strength in Parliament to nine seats, although they lost the Coromandel electorate.<ref name="2002 election">{{cite web |title=Official Count Results – Overall Status |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/partystatus.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="Coromandel, 2002">{{cite web |title=Official Count Results – Coromandel |url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2002/electorate-9.html |publisher=Electoral Commission |access-date=7 August 2013}}</ref> The electoral campaign featured strong tensions between the Greens and Labour. The Greens sharply criticised Labour for its plans to allow a moratorium on genetic engineering to expire, and believing that Labour would require their support to form a government, intended to make the extension of this moratorium a non-negotiable part of any deal. After the election, however, Labour and their coalition partner, the Jim Anderton-led [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Coalition]], instead opted to rely on support from [[United Future New Zealand|United Future]], a party with conservative Christian overtones.

Although the Greens no longer had any input into the budget, they maintained a close working relationship with the government, and the Greens remained involved in the legislation process. Often the government needed to rely on Green votes in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House]] to pass legislation not approved by United Future, a conservative [[family values|family-values]] party. The government won praise from political commentators for juggling the two diametrically-opposed parties.

While the moratorium on genetic modification has now expired, the Greens remain heavily involved in attempts to prevent any GM releases under the new regulatory framework, and genetic engineering remains a major topic for the party.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Manhire|first=Toby|date=2019-10-29|title=Young scientists call on Greens to rethink GM stance in the cause of the climate|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/29-10-2019/young-scientists-call-on-greens-to-rethink-gm-stance-in-the-cause-of-the-climate/|access-date=2020-11-01|website=The Spinoff}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-28|title=Time to break the stigma on genetic modification, for the sake of the climate|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/116912619/time-to-break-the-stigma-on-genetic-modification-for-the-sake-of-the-climate|access-date=2020-11-01|website=Stuff|language=en}}</ref>

====2005 election====
In the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], the Greens won 5.30%, returning six of their MPs to Parliament. Despite expressing clear support for a [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]-led government during the campaign,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx?id=54847&cat=975 |title=Greens talk about coalition options |publisher=NZCity |date=12 September 2005 |access-date=28 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10339337 |title=Interview: Jeanette Fitzsimons, Green Party co-leader |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=6 August 2005 |access-date=28 June 2008}}</ref> they were excluded from the resulting coalition, due to a refusal by United Future and NZ First to work with the Greens in cabinet.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10346236">{{cite news|author=Thomson, Ainsley|date=19 September 2005|title=United's 'Mr Reasonable' makes withering attack on Green Party|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/election-2005/news/article.cfm?c_id=1500891&objectid=10346236|access-date=30 October 2011}}</ref> They were, however, able to negotiate a cooperation agreement which saw limited input into the budget and broad consultation on policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/all/files/Green.pdf |title=Labour led Government Co-operation Agreement with the Green Party |date=17 October 2005 |access-date=28 June 2008}}</ref> Both co-leaders were appointed as government spokespeople outside cabinet, with Fitzsimons responsible for Energy Efficiency, and Donald responsible for the [[Buy Kiwi Made]] campaign.

Bradford also introduced, in 2005, the [[Private member's bill|members' bill]] that would become the [[Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007]]. The bill sought to outlaw the legal defence of "reasonable force" for parents prosecuted for assault against children. It led to widespread debate and accusations that MPs supporting the bill were fostering a '[[nanny state]]' approach. Despite this, the Bill became law after it passed its third reading on 16 May 2007 with an overwhelming majority of 113 votes for and 7 votes against.<ref>{{cite news | title = Anti-smacking bill becomes law | publisher = NZPA | date = 16 May 2007 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10440080 | access-date = 16 May 2007}}</ref>

====2008 election====

== Structure ==

=== Three-petal structure ===
The Green Party has three leadership "petals" – bodies of equal standing in the Party. These are the executive, caucus and the policy committee.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2016|title=Constitution of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|url=https://members.greens.org.nz/sites/default/files/2019-11/Green%20Party%20Constitution%2C%20last%20revd%20August%202019.pdf|website=elections.org.nz}}</ref>
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Executive'''
|The Executive is the party's administrative body, responsible for the day to day overall administration of the party, instructed by and answerable to the membership, provinces and Conference.
|-
|'''Caucus'''
|Caucus consists of sitting MPs, some representatives from other parts of the party, and its purpose is to organise and co-ordinate the Green Party's parliamentary activities.
|-
|'''Policy committee'''
|The policy committee is the party's policy-making body, responsible for the development and ratification of Party policy and policy processes. Unlike other parties, the Green Party creates its policy through consensus decision-making amongst its members. The policy committee is composed of elected members from across the country and representatives from other parts of the party.
|}

=== Provinces and branches ===
A province is a collection of branches which has sufficient sense of common identity defined by natural geographical boundaries.<ref name=":0" /> Branches are a collection of members with an [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]]-based geographical area of responsibility.<ref name=":0" />

=== Networks ===
