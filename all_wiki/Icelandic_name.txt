[[File:Icelandic Patronyms.svg|thumb|250px|A simple family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system]]

'''Icelandic names''' are names used by people from [[Iceland]]. Icelandic surnames are different from most other naming systems in the modern [[Western world]] by being [[Patronymic surname|patronymic]] or occasionally [[Matronymic surname|matronymic]]: they indicate the father (or mother) of the child and not the historic family lineage. Iceland shares a common cultural heritage with the [[Scandinavia]]n countries of [[Denmark]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. Unlike other Nordics, Icelanders have continued to use their traditional name system, which was formerly used by all [[Nordic countries]] except partly [[Finland]].{{efn|The system has recently been reintroduced as an option elsewhere in the Nordic countries.

Generally, with few exceptions, a person's last name indicates the [[Given name|first name]] of their father (patronymic) or in some cases mother (matronymic) in the [[genitive]], followed by {{lang|is|-son}} ("son") or {{lang|is|-dóttir}} ("daughter").

Some family names do exist in Iceland, most commonly adaptations from last name patronyms Icelanders took up when living abroad, usually Denmark. Notable Icelanders who have an inherited family name include former prime minister [[Geir Haarde]], football star [[Eiður Guðjohnsen|Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen]], entrepreneur [[Magnús Scheving]], film director [[Baltasar Kormákur|Baltasar Kormákur Samper]], and actress [[Anita Briem]]. Before 1925, it was legal to adopt new family names; one Icelander to do so was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Halldór Laxness]], while another author, [[Einar Hjörleifsson Kvaran|Einar Hjörleifsson]] and his brothers all chose the family name "Kvaran". Since 1925, one cannot adopt a family name unless one explicitly has a legal right to do so through inheritance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Personal Names Act|url=http://eng.innanrikisraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/english/personal-names|publisher=Ministry of the Interior|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grapevine.is/mag/column-opinion/2014/07/10/so-whats-this-naming-law-i-keep-hearing-about/|title=So What's This Naming Law I Keep Hearing About? - The Reykjavik Grapevine|first=|last=grapevine.is|date=10 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>

First names not previously used in Iceland must be approved by the [[Icelandic Naming Committee]] before being used.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=230637 |title=Naming Committee accepts Asía, rejects Magnus |publisher=[[Iceland Review|Iceland Review Online]] |accessdate=12 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314145637/http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=16539&ew_0_a_id=230637 |archive-date=14 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The criterion for acceptance of names is whether they can be easily incorporated into the Icelandic language. With some exceptions, they must contain only letters found in the [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]] (including [[þ]] and [[ð]]), and it must be possible to [[declension|decline]] the name according to the language's [[grammatical case]] system, which in practice means that a [[genitive]] form can be constructed in accordance with Icelandic rules.

Gender-inappropriate names have typically not been allowed; however, in January 2013, a 15-year-old girl named Blær (a masculine noun in Icelandic) was allowed to keep this name in a court decision that overruled an initial [[Icelandic Naming Committee#Blær Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdóttir|rejection by the naming committee]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/blaer-bjarkardottir--icel_n_2589657.html Blaer Bjarkardottir, Icelandic Teen, Wins Right To Use Her Given Name], ''Huffington Post'', 31 January 2013</ref> Her mother Björk Eiðsdóttir did not realize at the time that Blær was considered masculine; she had read a novel by [[Halldór Laxness]], ''[[The Fish Can Sing]]'' (1957), that had an admirable female character named Blær, meaning "light breeze", and had decided that if she had a daughter, she would name her Blær.<ref>[http://thestatelessman.com/2013/01/28/iceland/ Where Everybody Knows Your Name, Because It's Illegal], ''The Stateless Man'', 28 January 2013], ''Huffington Post'', 31 January 2013</ref>

In 2019, changes were announced to the laws governing names. Given names will no longer be restricted by gender. Moreover, Icelanders who are officially registered with [[non-binary gender]] will be permitted to use the patro/matronymic suffix {{lang|is|-bur}} ("child of") instead of {{lang|is|-son}} or {{lang|is|-dóttir}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.icelandreview.com/news/icelandic-names-will-no-longer-be-gendered/|title=Icelandic names will no longer be gendered|first=Larissa|last=Kyzer|date=22 June 2019|work=Iceland Review}}</ref>

==Typical Icelandic naming==
[[File:Pall Jonsson gravestone.jpg|thumb|A gravestone with a patronymic and avonymic: "Páll, son of Jón, son of Mattías"]]
A man named ''[[Jón]] [[Einar]]sson'' has a son named ''[[Ólafur]]''. Ólafur's last name will not be ''Einarsson'' like his father's; it will become ''Jónsson'', indicating that ''Ólafur'' is the son of ''Jón'' (Jóns + son). The same practice is used for daughters. Jón Einarsson's daughter ''[[Sigríður]]'''s last name would not be ''Einarsson'' but ''Jónsdóttir''. Again, the name means "Jón's daughter" (Jóns + dóttir).

In some cases, an individual's surname is derived from a parent's middle name instead of the first name. For example, if Jón is the son of Hjálmar Arnar Vilhjálmsson he may either be named Jón Hjálmarsson (Jón, son of Hjálmar) or Jón Arnarsson (Jón, son of Arnar). The reason for this may be that the parent prefers to be called by the middle name instead of the first name; this is fairly common. It may also be that the parent's middle name seems to fit the child's first name better.

In cases where two people in the same social circle bear the same first name and the same father's name, they have traditionally been distinguished by their paternal grandfather's name (avonymic), e.g. Jón Þórsson Bjarnasonar (Jón, son of Þór, son of Bjarni) and Jón Þórsson Hallssonar (Jón, son of Þór, son of Hallur). This practice has become less common (the use of middle names having replaced it), but features conspicuously in the [[Icelanders' sagas|Icelandic sagas]].

==Matronymic naming as a choice==
The vast majority of Icelandic last names carry the name of the father, but occasionally the mother's name is used: e.g. if the child or mother wishes to end social ties with the father. Some women use it as a social statement while others simply choose it as a matter of style.

In all of these cases, the convention is the same: Ólafur, the son of Bryndís, will have the full name of Ólafur Bryndísarson ("the son of Bryndís"). Some well-known Icelanders with matronymic names are the football player [[Heiðar Helguson]] ("Helga's son"), the novelist [[Guðrún Eva Mínervudóttir]] ("Minerva's daughter"), and the medieval poet [[Eilífr Goðrúnarson]] ("Goðrún's son").

In the Icelandic film ''[[Bjarnfreðarson]]'' the title character's name is the subject of some mockery for his having a woman's name – as Bjarnfreður's son – not his father's. In the film this is connected to the mother's [[radical feminism]] and shame over his paternity, which form part of the film's plot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1534397/|title=Mr. Bjarnfreðarson (2009)|author=TheLurkingFox|date=26 December 2009|work=IMDb|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> Some people have both a matronymic and a patronymic: for example, [[Dagur B. Eggertsson|Dagur Bergþóruson Eggertsson]] ("the son of Bergþóra and Eggert"), the mayor of Reykjavík since 2014. Another example is the girl Blær mentioned above: her full name is Blær Bjarkardóttir Rúnarsdóttir ("the daughter of Björk and Rúnar").

===Gender-neutral patronymics and matronymics===

A gender autonomy act approved by the [[Icelandic Parliament]] in 2019, allows individuals who register their gender as neutral to use ''bur'', a poetic word for "son" to be repurposed as a neuter noun, as a suffix instead of ''son'' or ''dóttir''.<ref name="althingi">{{cite web|url=https://www.althingi.is/altext/149/s/0009.html|title=9/149 frumvarp: mannanöfn &#124; Þingtíðindi &#124; Alþingi|website=althingi.is|accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="althingi2">{{cite web|url=https://www.althingi.is/altext/stjt/2019.080.html|title=Lög um kynrænt sjálfræði. &#124; Þingtíðindi &#124; Alþingi|website=althingi.is|accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="ruv">{{cite web|url=https://www.ruv.is/frett/stulkur-mega-nu-heita-ari-og-drengir-anna|title=Stúlkur mega nú heita Ari og drengir Anna &#124; RÚV|website=ruv.is|accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
Unlike the other Nordic countries, Iceland never formalized a system of family names.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Björnsson |first=Páll |date=Fall 2017 |title=Ættarnöfn - eður ei |journal=Saga }}</ref> A growing number of Icelanders — primarily those who had studied abroad — began to adopt family names in the second half of the 19th century. In 1855, there were 108 family names but by 1910 there were 297.<ref name=":0" /> In 1913, the [[Althing]] legalized the adoption of family names. The Icelanders who had family names tended to be upper-class and serve as government officials.<ref name=":0" />

In 1925, Althing banned the adoption of new family names.<ref name=":0" /> Some of the common arguments against the usage of family names were: they were not authentically "Icelandic"; the usage of -son in family names made it unclear if the name was actually a family name or patronymic; and there were fears that low-class people would adopt the family names of well-known upper-class families.<ref name=":0" /> Some of the common arguments for the usage of family names were: they made it easier to trace lineages; they made it easier to distinguish individuals (a problem in mid-19th century Iceland was that there were so many people named Jón — in fact, one in six Icelandic males were named Jón at the time); and that Iceland ought to follow the lead of its Nordic neighbours.<ref name=":0" />

==Cultural ramifications==
In Iceland, listings such as the telephone directory are alphabetised by first name rather than surname. To reduce ambiguity, the telephone directory goes further by also listing professions. In [[Russia]], where name-patronyms of similar style were historically used (such as ''Ivan Petrovich'' which means ''Ivan, the son of Peter''), the much larger population necessitated the introduction of surnames, and relegated the patronymic to record-keeping middle-name and conversational honorific.

Icelanders formally address others by their first names. By way of example, the former [[prime minister]] [[Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir]] would not be introduced as 'Ms Sigurðardóttir' but either by her first name or her full name, and usually addressed by her first name only. While the name of Icelandic singer [[Björk]] is generally perceived as her stage name,{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} it is actually simply her first name (her full name is Björk Guðmundsdóttir). ''Björk'' is how any Icelander would address her, whether formally or casually.

In the case of two people in the same group having the same given name, perhaps one named Jón Stefánsson and the other Jón Þorláksson, one could address Jón Stefánsson as "Jón Stefáns" and Jón Þorláksson as "Jón Þorláks". When someone holds a conversation with these two people at the same time, the appendage "son" would not need to be used; in that case, the genitive form of the father's name could be used like a nickname, although it is just as common in such cases to refer to people by their middle names (having a middle name being nowadays the general rule for people with a common name like 'Jón').

As a result of the vast majority of people using patronymics, a family will normally have a variety of last names: the children of (married or unmarried) parents Jón Einarsson and Bryndís Atladóttir could be named Ólafur Jónsson and Katrín Jónsdóttir. With matronymics, the children in this example would be Ólafur Bryndísarson and Katrín Bryndísardóttir. Patronymics thus have the formula (genitive case of father's name, usually adding ''-s'', or if the name ends in ''-i'', it will change to ''-a'') + ''son/dóttir/bur'', whereas matronymics are (genitive case of mother's name, often ''-ar'', or if the name ends in ''-a'', it will change to ''-u'') + ''son/dóttir/bur''.

===Outside of Iceland===
The Icelandic naming system occasionally causes problems for families travelling abroad, especially with young children, since non-Icelandic immigration staff (apart from those of other Nordic countries) are usually unfamiliar with the practice and therefore expect children to have the same last names as that of their parents.

Icelandic footballers who work abroad similarly will be referred to by their patronymics, even though such use of the term is considered "improper" from a native Icelandic standpoint. [[Aron Gunnarsson]], for example, wore the name "Gunnarsson" on the back of his uniform in the [[Premier League]] before his move to [[Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)|Al-Arabi]], and was referred to as such by the British media and commentators.

Expatriate Icelanders or people of Icelandic descent who live in foreign countries, such as the significant [[Icelandic Canadians|Icelandic community]] in the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]], usually abandon the traditional Icelandic naming system. In most cases, they adapt to the naming conventions of their country of residence—most commonly by retaining the patronymic of their first ancestor to immigrate to the new country as a permanent family surname, much as other Nordic immigrants did before surnames became fully established in their own countries.<ref>"Icelandic anchor makes Manitoba connection". ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', 26 July 2008.</ref> Alternatively, a permanent family surname may sometimes be chosen to represent the family's geographic rather than patronymic roots; for example, Canadian musician [[Lindy Vopnfjörð]]'s grandfather immigrated to Canada from the Icelandic village of [[Vopnafjörður]].<ref>"Where Are They Now?" ''[[Lögberg-Heimskringla]]'', 24 February 1995.</ref>
