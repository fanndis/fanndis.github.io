==Islington Council==
Hodge was first elected as a Councillor for the London Borough of Islington at a by-election in 1973, representing the Barnsbury ward. She soon became [[Chairman]] of the Housing Committee. This was an important post in a [[Local government|local authority]] which had one of the worst set of housing statistics in London during a period when [[London borough]]s were required to be housing providers and managers.  Hodge's tenure as Housing Chairman oversaw the continuation of a large new housing programme. There was a change of emphasis to the refurbishment of sound older buildings (''e.g.'' [[Finsbury Park (area)|Charteris Road]], [[Archway, London|Alexander Road]] areas), in response to a paper published by the Islington Housing Action Group.<ref>[http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/housing/Pages/islingtonhousingnetwork.aspx Islington Housing Action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624025101/http://www.islington.gov.uk/services/housing/Pages/islingtonhousingnetwork.aspx |date=24 June 2012 }} Retrieved 26 June 2016.</ref>

The Islington Labour Party was badly affected by the defection of members and elected representatives to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. Hodge emerged as Council Leader in 1982, a post she held until 1992.  Hodge was appointed [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in 1978. At that year's [[1978 Islington London Borough Council election|council election]], she was elected to Thornhill ward, before being representing Barnsbury again at the [[1982 Islington London Borough Council election|1982 election]], and moving to Sussex ward at the [[1986 Islington London Borough Council election|1986 election]]. She stood down from the council at the [[1994 Islington London Borough Council election|1994 election]].

===Child abuse controversy===
The end of Hodge's service on [[Islington Council]], prior to her entering Parliament, was marred by the emergence of serious [[child abuse|child abuse allegations]] concerning Council-run children's homes in Islington.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/with-a-past-like-hers-margaret-hodge-might-show-a-bit-more-humility-10098871.html Hodge history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002070641/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/with-a-past-like-hers-margaret-hodge-might-show-a-bit-more-humility-10098871.html |date=2 October 2017 }} Retrieved on 26 June 2016</ref> She has apologised several times since the emergence of the scandal in the 1980s that directly linked her council tenure with what she admitted in 2014 was "shameful naivety" in ignoring the complaints of paedophile victims.<ref name=telegraph-20140406>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10747257/Margaret-Hodge-sorry-as-council-she-led-told-to-investigate-Savile-abuse-allegations.html |title=Margaret Hodge 'sorry' as council she led told to investigate Savile abuse allegations |author1=Robert Mendick |author2=Eileen Fairweather |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=6 April 2014 |access-date=12 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190804034601/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10747257/Margaret-Hodge-sorry-as-council-she-led-told-to-investigate-Savile-abuse-allegations.html |archive-date=4 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1985, Demetrios Panton wrote to Islington Council to complain about abuse suffered while in Council care during the 1970s and 1980s. Panton received an [[Letter of comfort (contract law)|official response]] in 1989, in which the Council denied all responsibility.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/19/childrensservices.childrensministry|title=Timeline: Margaret Hodge row|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2003|access-date=29 March 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823201025/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/nov/19/childrensservices.childrensministry|archive-date=23 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1990, Liz Davies, a senior social worker employed by the borough with her manager, David Cofie, raised concerns about [[sexual abuse]] of children under the care of Islington Council. Correspondence between Hodge and the then Director of Social Work indicates that Hodge declined a request for extra investigative resources.<ref name="Harris0703"/> Instead, the Cofie–Davies investigation was dismissed by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|council officials]] in May 1990 after the [[Metropolitan Police|police]] declared they had found insufficient evidence of abuse; despite this, the two [[social worker]]s continued their enquiries.<ref name="Harris0703">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jul/06/children.childprotection|title=The whistleblower's story|last=Harris|first=Paul|author2=Bright, Martin|author-link2=Martin Bright|date=6 July 2003|work=[[The Observer]]|access-date=13 March 2012|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101209/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jul/06/children.childprotection|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1992, the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' resumed reporting allegations of abuse in the Islington Care Homes.  Its initial report was slated by Hodge as a "sensationalist piece of gutter journalism", although she has since apologised, claiming that her officials had given her false information.<ref name="Fairweather">Eileen Fairweather [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10746412/Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-Islington-is-still-covering-up.html "Jimmy Savile sex abuse: 'Islington is still covering up'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327084224/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/jimmy-savile/10746412/Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-Islington-is-still-covering-up.html |date=27 March 2018 }}, ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 6 April 2014</ref> In 1995, the "White Report" into [[sexual abuse]] in Islington Care Homes confirmed that the Council had [[Dereliction of duty|failed]] to adequately investigate the allegations, claiming that its [[doctrinaire]] interpretation of [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] created a climate of fear at being labelled  [[Homophobia|homophobic]].<ref name="Harris0703"/><ref>Eileen Fairweather [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/witness-stalinist-reluctance-to-study-the-facts-1621767.html "WITNESS: Stalinist reluctance to study the facts"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517041910/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/witness-stalinist-reluctance-to-study-the-facts-1621767.html |date=17 May 2017 }}, ''The Independent'', 30 May 1995</ref>

In 2003, following Hodge's appointment as [[Minister for Children (United Kingdom)|Minister for Children]], Panton went public with his allegations that he had been the subject of abuse in Islington Council care and that, although he had repeatedly raised the matter, he had been ignored. He identified Hodge's complacency as [[Corporate social responsibility|ultimately responsible]] for the abuse that he alleged he had suffered.

==Parliamentary career==
Hodge has served as the Labour [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] for [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] since the [[1994 Barking by-election|by-election on 9 June 1994]] following the death of [[Jo Richardson]]. Whilst still a new MP, she endorsed the candidature of [[Tony Blair]], a former Islington neighbour, for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leadership]], after the sudden death of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] from a heart attack. In 2017, she had a majority of 21,608.

===Ministerial roles===
Hodge was appointed [[Minister for Disabled People|Junior Minister for Disabled People]] in 1998 and was promoted [[Minister of State for Universities|Minister for Universities]] at the new [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] in 2001, in which capacity she piloted the controversial [[Higher Education Act 2004]], remaining in post until 2003 when she became the inaugural [[Minister for Children (United Kingdom)|Children's Minister]]. She was sworn into the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] on 22 June 2003.<ref name="Privy Council appointments"/>

In 2003, Hodge was appointed to the newly created high-profile role of Children's minister, which included responsibility for Special Education, Early Years Education and Childcare, the Young People's Unit, teenage pregnancy, the Family Policy Unit, and general responsibility for child welfare.<ref>Curtis, Polly (13 June 2003).

In 2005, Hodge was moved to become [[Minister of State]] in the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] with primary responsibility for employment. On 17 June 2005, she was criticised for saying that former employees of [[MG Rover]] would be able to obtain jobs at [[Tesco]], a local supermarket. Later, she claimed that this was not what she meant, rather that; she had empathy for those losing their jobs, and was pointing to a new Tesco supermarket as an example of new jobs being created in the area in face of the redundancies at the car manufacturing plant.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article534254.ece Get a job at Tesco, 6,000 Rover workers are told] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215812/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article534254.ece |date=12 June 2011 }} ''Times Online'', 17 June 2005</ref>

===Barking and the BNP===

Hodge once called for British born families to have priority on council house waiting lists over immigrants. This comment received praise from the far-right political party the [[British National Party|BNP]] and led to calls for Hodge to resign. However her comments would be defended by her colleagues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/27/thefarright.communities|title=BNP backs Hodge in housing row|last=Revill|first=Jo|date=26 May 2007|work=The Observer|access-date=16 December 2019|last2=Doward|first2=Jamie|issn=0029-7712|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027111907/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/may/27/thefarright.communities|archive-date=27 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 2006, Hodge commented in an interview with ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' that eight out of ten [[White British|white]] [[working-class]] voters in her [[constituency]] might be tempted to vote for the [[British National Party]] (BNP) at the [[2006 United Kingdom local elections|May 2006 local elections]] because "no one else is listening to them" about their concerns over unemployment, high house prices and the housing of asylum seekers in the area. She said the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] must promote "very, very strongly the benefits of the new, rich multi-racial society which is part of this part of London for me".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4913164.stm|title=Minister says BNP tempting voters|publisher=BBC News|date=16 April 2006|access-date=29 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324051626/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4913164.stm|archive-date=24 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> There was widespread [[media coverage]] of her remarks, and Hodge was strongly criticised for giving the BNP publicity.

===Public Accounts Committee===

=== Garden Bridge Project review ===
In September 2016, London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] asked Hodge to review the [[Garden Bridge|Garden Bridge project]]. Hodge was tasked with determining whether value for money was achieved from the taxpayers' £60,000,000 contribution to the bridge, as well as investigate whether transparency standards were met by public bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37432959|title=London mayor orders review of Garden Bridge project|date=22 September 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104013837/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-37432959|archive-date=4 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In April 2017, Hodge's review was published. Hodge recommended that 'It would be better for the taxpayer to accept the financial loss of cancelling the project than to risk the potential uncertain additional costs to the public purse if the project proceeds.' The report found that decisions on the Garden Bridge were driven more by electoral cycles than value for taxpayers' money, and that there was not an open, fair and competitive process around two procurements. In response, the BBC's transport correspondent, Tom Edwards, reported that 'I can't remember reading a report so damning of a transport project.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39524979|title=Garden Bridge should be scrapped, Hodge review finds|date=7 April 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211013530/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39524979|archive-date=11 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In June 2017, [[Andrew Boff]], a Conservative member of the London Assembly, criticised Margaret Hodge's report on the Garden Bridge, and claimed that she broke Parliamentary rules during her research.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/tories-demand-probe-into-hodges-garden-bridge-inquiry/10020989.article|title=Tories demand probe into Hodge's Garden Bridge inquiry|access-date=11 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171211213745/https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/tories-demand-probe-into-hodges-garden-bridge-inquiry/10020989.article|archive-date=11 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2017, the [[Commons Select Committee on Standards|Parliamentary Standards Committee]] found that Hodge had breached the MPs' code of conduct. The code states MPs should use public resources only "in support of parliamentary duties". The committee ruled that, because the review had been commissioned by an outside body, it been not been carried out as part of Hodge's parliamentary activities. The committee recommended that Hodge apologise to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for the breach on a point of order. Hodge subsequently apologised and said "I carried out this inquiry in good faith and in the public interest. "I think all MPs would benefit from greater clarity in the rules governing the use of offices."

In July 2018, the [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] (NEC) adopted a code of conduct on antisemitism which was based on the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance|IHRA]]'s [[Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]] while omitting or modifying examples of antisemitism, including defining how criticism of Israel can be antisemitic.<ref name=bbcihra>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44863606 |title=New Labour anti-Semitism code criticised |date=17 July 2018 |publisher=BBC |access-date=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730193702/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44863606 |archive-date=30 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Hodge subsequently said that Labour's refusal to adopt the full set of unamended examples for disciplinary purposes "make the party a hostile environment for Jews.

She said she wished to stand and was automatically included in an all woman shortlist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skwawkbox.org/2019/09/28/hodge-triggered-in-barking/|title=Hodge 'triggered' in Barking|last=SKWAWKBOX|date=28 December 2019|website=The SKWAWKBOX|language=en-GB|access-date=28 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928161413/https://skwawkbox.org/2019/09/28/hodge-triggered-in-barking/|archive-date=28 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://labourlist.org/2019/09/margaret-hodge-becomes-second-triggered-labour-mp/|title=Margaret Hodge becomes second 'triggered' Labour MP|last=Rodgers|first=Sienna|date=28 September 2019|access-date=28 September 2019|work=LabourList|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928164810/https://labourlist.org/2019/09/margaret-hodge-becomes-second-triggered-labour-mp/|archive-date=28 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> According to one local member, factors in the decision to hold a selection process included her age, the desire to have an MP who lives in the area and support for the principles of accountability and local democracy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://labourlist.org/2019/10/what-really-happened-when-barking-triggered-margaret-hodge/|title=What really happened when Barking triggered Margaret Hodge|last=Pawson|first=John|date=2 October 2019|access-date=2 October 2019|work=Labour List|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004022310/https://labourlist.org/2019/10/what-really-happened-when-barking-triggered-margaret-hodge/|archive-date=4 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On Monday 28 October 2019, Hodge was reselected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://labourlist.org/2019/10/margaret-hodge-reselected-as-barking-candidate-after-trigger/|title=Margaret Hodge reselected as Barking candidate after trigger|publisher=Labour List|date=28 October 2019|access-date=29 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028232356/https://labourlist.org/2019/10/margaret-hodge-reselected-as-barking-candidate-after-trigger/|archive-date=28 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Use of offshore tax haven==
In 2015 there was considerable controversy about her benefiting, to the tune of £1.5 million from assets repatriated from a Lichtenstein trust in 2011 using the [[Liechtenstein disclosure facility]], that reduced penalties and removed the risk of prosecution for Britons moving undeclared assets back to the UK. Coverage focused on the apparent hypocrisy in her condemnation of the use of tax havens. <ref>https://www.ft.com/content/4d9e16b4-ee3d-11e4-98f9-00144feab7de</ref><ref>https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-chief-given-pound15m-shares-from-tax-haven-ghpz37wn2kp</ref><ref>https://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-hodge-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-alleged-1-5million-tax-haven-shares-1-4054160</ref><ref>https://www.contractorweekly.com/tax-a-ir35-news/hodge-the-hypocrite/amp/</ref>
