"'''Hero'''" is a song by American singer and songwriter [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released on October 19, 1993, via [[Columbia Records]] as the second single from Carey's third [[studio album]], ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993). Originally intended for [[Gloria Estefan]], the song was written and produced by Mariah and [[Walter Afanasieff]]. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting it over to the soundtrack of the [[Hero (1992 film)|film of the same name]]. However, after being convinced to keep it, she changed some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal [[ballads]], with its protagonist declaring that even though people may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, they are "heroes" if they look inside themselves and see their own inner strength; in time, it will help them "find the way".

The song received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics for its lyrical content, while Carey's vocal performance was praised. Aside from its lyrics, "Hero" derived its hook and sound from several musical instruments such as the guitar, piano, and organ. The song experienced strong success in several international markets, and also became Carey's eighth chart topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Additionally, it was ranked number 53 on the Decade-End Chart. Outside the United States, "Hero" enjoyed strong charting, reaching the top five in Canada, France, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway and the top ten in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Due to fan requests and letters, as well as their connection to its personal meaning and content, the song remains one of Carey's most performed songs. Deemed by many as her [[signature song]], the song was originally performed on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' during its original chart run. Additionally, Carey performed it on several live telethons and specials, such as ''[[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti and Friends]]'' and ''[[Michael Jackson & Friends]]'' in 1999, ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'' in 2001, [[Live 8]] in 2005, and the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugural ball]] for [[Barack Obama]] in 2009. Additionally, the song was featured on the set-lists of all of Carey's tours, usually serving as the encore or closing number, and making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the [[Music Box Tour]]. The song was included on several of Carey's compilation albums, ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|#1's]]'' (1998), ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001), ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008), and ''[[Number 1 to Infinity|#1 to Infinity]]'' (2015).

Throughout the course of her career, Carey has re-recorded the song twice and filmed other music videos aside from the original. The first music video for the song was filmed by [[Larry Jordan]] in July 1993 during a private concert at [[Proctor's Theatre (Schenectady, New York)|Proctor's Theatre]], later released on the home video ''[[Here Is Mariah Carey]]''. In 2001, following the [[September 11 attacks]], Carey re-recorded the song as a mash-up single titled "[[Never Too Far/Hero Medley]]", a medley with her single at the time, "[[Never Too Far]]". Additionally, prior to the release of her compilation album ''The Ballads'', Carey re-recorded "Hero" and filmed a new video featuring behind the scenes footage of the studio. "Hero" won two [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Rhythm & Soul Music Awards, one ASCAP Pop Music Award and one [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Pop Award for the Songwriter Award. The song has been covered many times during both studio and live recordings, such as on global singing competitions.

== Background ==
Mariah Carey's second studio album, ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991), contained influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and [[Gospel music|gospel]], as well as her continued work of R&B and soul.<ref name="nickson3">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=55}}</ref> The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, and could not introduce Carey to a different market.<ref name="nickson4">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=57}}</ref> Following these events, Columbia decided to market the singer in a similar fashion to her debut, only have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop record.<ref name="nickson5">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=80}}</ref> Agreeing to the change, Carey and producer [[Walter Afanasieff]] began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993).<ref name="nickson6">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=86}}</ref><ref name="nickson7">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=100–102}}</ref>

The B-side for the single, Everything Fades Away, was never included on the ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' album, and was not performed by Carey for years until the early 2020 leg of her [[The Butterfly Returns]] residency, when she performed parts of the song with her background singers and singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] as part of a series of snippet videos recorded for her fans.

== Writing and recording ==
Aside from her work as a vocalist and record artist, Carey was becoming known as a [[songwriter]], having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career. During the production of ''Music Box'', she was approached by [[Epic Records]] to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff, and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film ''[[Hero (1992 film)|Hero]]'', featuring [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Geena Davis]].<ref name="shapiro">{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=72–73}}</ref> While Carey was interested in the project, Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film, fearing it would hurt her career.<ref name="shapiro"/> Additionally, Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest-selling recording artist to contribute to another label, even a branch of the same parent company, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]].<ref name="bronson"/> So they wanted to try the next best thing, which was to have us write something."<ref name="shapiro"/> Still interested in working for the film, Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film, intended for fellow female singer, [[Gloria Estefan]].<ref name="bronson"/> Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York, and over the course of two hours, composed the song's melody, lyric and concept.<ref name="shapiro"/> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song:
<blockquote>
I went to New York and we were in the studio and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this incredible seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, it was a little bit too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.<ref name="bronson">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=823}}</ref>
</blockquote>

As they completed the song's demo, [[Tommy Mottola]], CEO of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and Carey's fiancé, walked into the studio. After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song would be used for the film ''Hero''.<ref name="bronson"/> Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, "Are you kidding me? You can't give this song to this movie. This is too good. Mariah, you have to take this song. You have to do it."<ref name="bronson"/> Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, [[Key (music)|key]] and instrumentation.<ref name="shapiro"/> After their decision to keep "Hero", Afanasieff went back to the staff at Epic and told them that they had failed to come up with a song for the soundtrack. Estefan never heard the tune was originally meant for her, and the song that ended up in the soundtrack was "[[Hero (1992 film)#Song|Heart of a Hero]]", written, produced and recorded by [[Luther Vandross]].<ref name="bronson"/> In the following weeks, after completing the song, Afanasieff spoke with Bronson about its recording, and how Carey created several versions of the track:
<blockquote>
There was a simpler performance on tape and a more difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She wants to do something that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.<ref name="bronson"/>

It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the [[piano]], [[guitar]] and [[Organ (music)|organ]]. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Alfred Music Publishing]], the song is set in [[time signature|common time]] with a moderate [[tempo]] of 62 beats per minute.

According to author Chris Nickson, "Hero" is one of Carey's most personal and inspirational ballads.<ref name="nickson8"/> Carey has described how the song was never her favorite, however, after all the fan letters and messages she received about the song, she felt the need to perform it as often as possible.<ref name="nickson8"/> In an interview with [[Fred Bronson]], Carey described the song's meaning to her and to fans:
<blockquote>
One person could say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've considered committing suicide every day of my life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.<ref name="nickson8"/>
</blockquote>

The song's lyrics describe of the individual power that lies inside every person, their ability to be their own hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero.<ref name="ingall">{{harvnb|Ingall|1997|pp=137}}</ref> Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire those around them, so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world.<ref name="ingall"/> Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.<ref name="wade">{{harvnb|Wade|2010|pp=110}}</ref>

According to Maryellen Moffitt, author of "See It, Be It, Write It", "Hero" is about looking into oneself and discovering the inner courage inside each individual, and being strong and believing in oneself through times of trouble and adversity.<ref name="moff">{{harvnb|Morffitt|2010|pp=73}}</ref> Morffitt claims the song personally helped him get through difficult moments when "the answers seemed so far away".<ref name="moff"/> Following her taped performance of "[[One Sweet Day]]" at the [[Honda Center]] in Anaheim, California during [[The Adventures of Mimi Tour]], Carey described the song's importance to her and her fans:
<blockquote>
I wrote a song a while back even before "One Sweet Day" and it was not my favorite song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know it was kind of a moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this is for you.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=The Adventures of Mimi Tour DVD|others=[[Mariah Carey]]|date=2006|type=American DVD liner notes|publisher=[[Island Records]]|id=659444-9}}</ref>

== Copyright lawsuits ==
"Hero" was the subject of two copyright [[plagiarism]] cases; one by Christopher Selletti and the other by Rhonda Dimmie, filed in 1993 and 1996.<ref name=spin>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wK_Oz2Yz7IC&q=mariah+carey+hero&pg=PA66|title=The Sound of Sameness|last=Friedman|first=Roger|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=[[Bob Guccione, Jr.|Bob Guccione, Jr]]|date=December 12, 1998|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref> Selletti claimed he had written the song's lyrics in the form of a poem. One day, as he drove [[Sly Stone]] in a limousine to Long Island, he claimed to show him the poem. Selletti claimed Stone complimented the poem, taking it and promising to patent it and earn him royalties.<ref name=fox>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,28109,00.html|title=Mariah Carey's 'Hero': The Envelope Please|last=Friedman|first=Roger|work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|publisher=[[Fox Entertainment Group]].

He filed a lawsuit against Carey, Stone, Sony and Stone's manager Jerry Goldstein. Selletti claimed that Stone must have sold or contributed the lyrics to Carey during the recording of the album in late 1992.<ref name=fox/> However, since Stone did not receive songwriting credits on "Hero", Selletti then dropped the suit against Stone, leaving him against Carey and Sony. Prior to their courtroom meeting, Carey told ''[[New York Daily News]]'' "I feel totally victimized. 'Hero' is my creation and it holds a very special meaning to me. I have every intention of fighting this all the way."<ref name=spin/> In court, Carey provided evidence to her innocence, in the form of a dated lyrical and music notebook, with conceptual info on the song dated back to November 20, 1992, prior to Selletti's meeting with Stone.<ref name=fox/> Additionally, Carey stated the fact that she had originally written it for the film ''Hero'' alongside Afanasieff, making their connection or the involvement of his material impossible. Judge Denny Chin found Carey innocent, and ordered Selletti to pay her a fine.<ref name=spin/>

Years later, after consulting with another lawyer, Selletti made another attempt at suing Carey and Sony. His lawyer, Jeffrey Levitt, had uncovered the fact that the film was released in October 1992, a full six weeks prior to the November 22 dating in Carey's notebook. Additionally, "Heart of a Hero", which was written by [[Luther Vandross]] for the film, was submitted in January 1992, making it impossible for "Hero" to have been the original choice of song for the soundtrack.<ref name=fox/> After uncovering further tapes from the studio dating to the summer of 1992, recordings provided evidence that Carey and Afansieff had indeed discussed and had parts of the song completed well before the film's October release.<ref name=fox/> Following the evidence from both parties, the judge dismissed the case, ruling in Carey's favor for the second time. Following the dismissal of the case, Rhonda Dimmie, another songwriter and an independent singer, filed a lawsuit against Carey, this time claiming the song to have borrowed heavily from her song "Be Your Own Hero".<ref name="walker">{{harvnb|Walker|2008|p=55}}</ref> During the short deposition made by Carey, Afanasieff revealed that they had written the song in two days during the summer of 1992, "within a matter of hours".<ref name=fox/> Soon after, the case was dismissed, with the judge claiming there to not be sufficient evidence on Dimmie's behalf. Following the lawsuits, in 2001 Selletti made further hints to plan another lawsuit, as well as a forensic team of specialists to conduct research on the incident.<ref name=spin/> Following the suits, Cindy Berger, Carey's publicist released the following statement: "This case has been thrown out of court three times. The federal judge after hearing Selletti's story and considering all the evidence ruled the case was a 'complete fabrication' and that it was filed 'to extort a settlement from deep-pocket defendants."<ref name=fox/>

=== Critical response ===
''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' critic [[J.D. Considine]] praised the song, writing, "[Hero] is a lavish, soul-stirring [[ballad]], the sort of thing other singers would pay [[Diane Warren]] to write." Additionally, he called its chorus "uplifting" and "soaring", following praise towards Carey's vocal performance.<ref name="baltimoresun">{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/36030890.html?dids=36030890:36030890&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+17%2C+1998&author=J.D.+CONSIDINE&pub=The+Sun&desc=THE+STARS+ALIGN%3B+It+is+a+rare+day+indeed+that+brings+new+releases+by+chart+toppers+Garth+Brooks%2C+Jewel+and+Mariah+Carey.+We're+all+ears.&pqatl=google|title=The Stars Align; It Is A Rare Day Indeed That Brings New Releases By Chart Toppers Garth Brooks, Jewel and Mariah Carey.

The twelve finalists from the [[The X Factor (British series 5)|fifth series]] of the British TV talent show ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' released a cover of the song on October 27, 2008 for the [[Help for Heroes]] and [[The Royal British Legion]] charities. The finalists performed the single for the first time on October 25, 2008 during Week 3 of the live broadcasts. The single was released on download on October 26, 2008, followed by the physical release the day after.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3367980/X-Factor-single-Hero-tops-charts.html|title=X Factor Single Hero Tops The Charts|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Press Holdings]]|date=November 2, 2008|access-date=April 12, 2011}}</ref>

On October 30, it was announced that the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Alistair Darling]], would waive all tax on copies sold on the single. He said, "I support the efforts being made by the ''X Factor'' contestants and in recognition of that I'm proposing effectively to waive the VAT on the sale of these singles. We will do that by making a donation equivalent to the value of the VAT."<ref name=blk>{{cite web|title=Darling tables tax refund on 'Hero' sales|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]]|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/xfactor/a134141/darling-tables-tax-refund-on-hero-sales.html|last=Rolio|first=Sarah|date=October 31, 2008|access-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref> Following the single's release, the music video was sent to music channels on November 8 before the fifth live show, when the finalists (excluding [[Diana Vickers]], absent because of illness) sang it again. All the finalists appeared in the video, which also showed still images of soldiers in [[Iraq]].<ref name=blk/> The finalists performed the song again with Mariah Carey on November 8, 2008 during Week 5 of the live broadcasts, a week in which Carey's music and career served as the theme.

===Chart performance===
Upon its release, the single was expected to top the charts in the United Kingdom, due to strong promotional push from Cowell and his management.<ref>{{cite web|title=X Factor Secret Single Revealed|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Richard Desmond]]|date=October 4, 2008|access-date=April 13, 2011|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/53366/XFactor-secret-single-revealed-Cowell-record-shock-for-fans/}}</ref> On November 2, 2008, it debuted atop of the [[UK Singles Chart]], staying there for three consecutive weeks and becoming the fastest-selling single of 2008.<ref name=msn-uk>{{cite web|title=X Factor Song To Be The Fastest Seller?|work=[[Entertainment UK]]|publisher=[[EMI Records]]|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28697695|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122090407/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28697695|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 22, 2009|access-date=October 28, 2008}}</ref> The song sold 100,000 copies in the first day of its release and 313,244 copies by the end of the week. It raised over £1 million for Help for Heroes.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

It was suggested that the song would become one of the biggest-selling releases of the decade, with [[HMV Group|HMV]] spokesman Gennaro Castaldo saying: "This is proving to be one of the biggest single releases for years if not the decade. Only [[Leona Lewis]]'s debut hit "[[A Moment Like This#Leona Lewis version|A Moment Like This]]", which sold over 500,000 copies in its first week, can compare. It's selling more than most Christmas No 1s would, and HMV has placed an urgent order for more copies."<ref>{{cite web|title=X Factor 'Hero' 'Biggest Hit of the Decade'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi Médias|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a134107/x-factor-hero-biggest-hit-of-the-decade.html|last=Balls|first=David|date=October 31, 2008|access-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref> On December 28, 2008, the UK Singles Chart listed it as the second biggest selling single for the year end countdown and the nineteenth best-selling single of the decade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7802941.stm|title=Duffy and Burke top 2008 charts|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=December 29, 2008|access-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref> The [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) certified the song double-platinum, denoting shipments of over 1.2 million copies within the country.<ref name="BPI certification-database">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=Certified Awards Search |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=August 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040853/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref>
