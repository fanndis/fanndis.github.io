==Activism==
Villaseñor's fight for climate action was sparked when she was caught in a smoke cloud from the November 2018 [[Camp Fire (2018)|Camp Fire]] in [[California]] during a family visit. As an [[asthma]] sufferer, she became physically ill, during which time she researched the [[climate change]] and temperature rises which contributed to the fire's severity.<ref name="Kaplan WP" /> Her mother, Kristin Hogue, was enrolled in the M.A. in Climate and Society program at [[Columbia University]]<ref name="Kaplan WP" /> and Villaseñor would occasionally attend class with her mother, where she learned about the underlying science of climate change.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Borunda |first1=Alejandra |title=These young activists are striking to save their planet from climate change |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/youth-climate-strike-kids-save-the-world/ |accessdate=July 20, 2019 |work=[[National Geographic]] |date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Soon afterward, she joined New York's chapter of Zero Hour, a group of American youth climate activists.<ref name="Kaplan WP" />
