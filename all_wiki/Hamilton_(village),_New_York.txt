The '''Village of Hamilton''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] located within the town of [[Hamilton, New York|Hamilton]] in [[Madison County, New York]], United States. It is the location of [[Colgate University]] and has a population at 4,239 at the 2010 census.<ref>[https://archive.today/20200212214647/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_5YR_S0101&prodType=table United States Census]</ref> The 2017 movie ''[[Pottersville (film)|Pottersville]]'' starring [[Michael Shannon]] and [[Judy Greer]] was filmed here.

==Geography and climate==
The village, located at {{coord|42|49|32|N|75|32|40|W|type:city}} (42.825646, -75.544673),<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> lies in the Chenango Valley, just south of the headwaters of the [[Chenango River]]. Northeast of the village [[Payne Brook]] starts at [[Lake Moraine (New York)|Lake Moraine]] and travels through the village before converging with the Chenango River. The village is approximately {{convert|40|mi}} southeast of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and {{convert|30|mi}} southwest of [[Utica, New York|Utica]]. The elevation of the village's municipal airport (Hamilton Municipal Airport) is approximately {{convert|1100|ft}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=139:2:3944428165142075::NO:RP::|title=National Elevation Database|publisher=USGS|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village's total area is 2.5&nbsp;square miles (6.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 2.3&nbsp;square miles (6.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (6.37%) is water.

Snowfall is the most notable aspect of the area's climate, which is typical of central [[Upstate New York]] in the vicinity of Syracuse. Snowfall produced by [[lake-effect snow]] from [[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]] usually extends into the [[Mohawk Valley]] and often inland as far as the southern [[Finger Lakes]] and the nearby [[southern tier]] of counties; with snowfall, at a minimum, in the range of 40 to 50&nbsp;inches per season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|title=The Climate of New York|publisher= New York State Climate Office|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> Heavy [[snow squall]]s frequently occur, generating from 1 to 2 feet of snow and occasionally 4 feet or more.<ref>The Climate of New York</ref> The village's average seasonal snowfall is approximately 80&nbsp;inches.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bestplaces.net/city/Hamilton-New_York.aspx#|title=Best Places to Live in Hamilton, New York, Climate|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

==History==
The area that became the town of Hamilton (including the village of Hamilton) originally was inhabited by members of the [[Iroquois]] League, and some of the territory is still considered to be sacred by the [[Oneida Indian Nation]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.colgate.edu/about/hamiltonarea|title=About Colgate, The Hamilton Area|publisher= Colgate University|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> Following the [[American Revolution]], the area was ceded to the State of New York.<ref name="About Colgate, The Hamilton Area">About Colgate, The Hamilton Area</ref>  Until 1878, Hamilton was an original outpost of the [[Chenango Canal]].

The town of Hamilton was founded near what is now [[Earlville, New York|Earlville]] and then it gradually expanded into a wide area populated by farms and settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/hamilton-ny.htm|title=History of Hamilton, NY|publisher= The Boston History Company, 1899|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

The family of the brothers Samuel and Elisha Payne had been prominent in [[Connecticut]] since before the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], in which they had served, possibly at [http://www.nps.gov/fost/index.htm Ft. Stanwix], near what is now [[Rome, New York]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Williams|first= Howard|title= A history of Colgate University, 1819-1969|pages=4â€“5|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.|year= 1969|lccn= 70076810|id=1083.W5}}</ref>  At the close of the Revolutionary War, The pair moved from [[Lebanon, Connecticut]], to the town of Whitestone (now [[Whitesboro, New York]]), a few miles from Utica.<ref>Williams, 4 - 5</ref><ref>Middletown had been founded in 1785 and its fertile and inexpensive land attracted many settlers from New England.

In 1794, Samuel Payne moved southwest from Whitestone into the town of Hamilton, where he started a farm on the hill that is today's location of [[Colgate University]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammond |first= L.M. |title= History of Madison County, state of New York|url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmadison00hamm_0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmadison00hamm_0/page/444 444]|publisher=Truair, Smith & Bruce |year= 1872 |isbn= 978-1-149-40861-2}}</ref><ref>Williams, 5.

[[Colgate University]] was founded in the village in 1819. Today, Colgate's campus is located on what was Samuel Payne's farm. In 1827, the farm, valued at $4,000 (then current dollars) covering {{convert|123|acre}}, was donated by Payne and his wife to the Baptist Theological Society as the new location of the Society's Theological Institution, known as the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution, which later became Colgate.<ref>Hammond, 445</ref> In 1846, the name of Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution was changed to Madison University.<ref name="Colgate University">{{cite web|title=Colgate University - Past, Present, and Future|publisher=Colgate University|url=http://www.colgate.edu/about/past-present-and-future|accessdate=2013-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820071228/http://www.colgate.edu/about/past-present-and-future|archive-date=2013-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> The year 1890 brought about the change in the university's name to Colgate University, in honor of the involvement and financial support of the Colgate family over many years.<ref name="Colgate University"/>

==Government==
The village is governed by a Board of Trustees. It consists of the Mayor, who is presiding officer, and four Trustees. The Mayor and Trustees are elected at the annual village election in June for staggered terms of two-years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villageofhamiltonny.org/Default.aspx?PageID=4
|title=Village of Hamilton, Government Info|publisher=Village of Hamilton|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

The Mayor exercises the executive function and is assisted by the Village Administrator, the Clerk/Treasurer, and the Director of Utilities and Public Works. The Board of Trustees is the legislative body. It enacts local laws, adopts the budget, and exercises oversight over the Village departments, boards, commissions and committees. Trustees are assigned by the Mayor specific oversight and liaison responsibilities. The Mayor appoints all public officers and volunteer members of boards, commissions and committees with the approval of the Board of Trustees. In addition to the elected officials and professional officers, the governance of the Village rests in the hands of about fifty volunteers who serve by appointment on ten boards, commissions, and committees. The Mayor is an ''ex officio'' member of every Village body. Every Trustee serves a liaison on one or more of the bodies.<ref name="ReferenceA">Village of Hamilton, Government Info</ref>

The 2009-2010 annual budget of the village is approximately 5.7 million dollars.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The Village Court<ref>There are close to 1,300 Town and Village Courts (collectively known as the Justice Courts) located in most of New York Stateâ€™s town and villages, none are located in New York City. Town and Village Courts hear actions seeking monetary awards up to $3,000 and small claims proceedings for awards up to $3,000. These courts also handle landlord/tenant matters that may result in an eviction as well as a money judgment for back rent that is due. Town and Village Courts are best known for their small claims parts. On the criminal side, these courts are authorized to handle matters involving the prosecution of misdemeanors and violations that are committed within the town's or village's geographic boundaries.{{cite web|url=http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/townandvillage/introduction.shtml|title= City, Town & Village Courts|publisher=nycourts.gov|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> is independent of Village government. The Village Judge is elected by the voters for a four-year term.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
