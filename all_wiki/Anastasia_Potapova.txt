Potapova is a former junior No. 1, as well as the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships – Girls' Singles|2016 Wimbledon Championships girls' singles]] champion, where she defeated [[Dayana Yastremska]] from [[Ukraine]] in the final.

Potapova debuted in a Grand Slam tournament as a wildcard entry in the qualifying draw of the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships]] defeating [[Elizaveta Kulichkova]] to qualify for the main draw.

==Career==
===Juniors===
[[File:Anastasia Potapova (RUS) (21633694305).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Potapova at the 2015 US Open junior]]
On the junior tour, Potapova has a career-high junior ranking of 1, achieved in July 2016. Potapova has had large success on the junior tour including a semifinal at the [[2016 French Open]], quarterfinals at the [[2016 Australian Open]] and the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships]] and doubles finals at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|2015 US Open]] and the [[2016 French Open]]. Potapova won the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships]] girls' title, defeating [[Dayana Yastremska]] in the final. Two of the seven match points in the final set were overturned by challenges.<ref>{{cite web| title=Potapova: Russian On The Rise | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/content/potapova-russian-rise-0 | work=WTA Tennis | date = 2 July 2016 | accessdate = 8 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Anastasia Potapova wins dream Wimbledon title | url=https://www.itftennis.com/juniors/news/articles/anastasia-potapova-wins-dream-wimbledon-title.aspx | date = 9 July 2016 | accessdate = 8 August 2019}}</ref> This title made her the No. 1 junior in the world.

Potapova's other junior highlights include semifinal appearances at the Trofeo Bonfiglio and the [[Orange Bowl (tennis)|Orange Bowl Championships]], both Grade A events. Her biggest junior title, excluding Wimbledon, is the Nike Junior International in [[Roehampton]], a Grade 1 event, where she defeated other highly rated junior players such as [[Claire Liu]], Jaimee Fourlis, [[Sofia Kenin]], [[Olga Danilović]] and [[Olesya Pervushina]] en route to winning the title.

===2017: Early rise===
Starting her first full year on the tour, Potapova started 2017 unranked as she had only played two professional events entering the year. She defeated rival [[Amanda Anisimova]] in the final at an [[2015 ITF Women's Circuit|25k event]] held in Curitiba.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oktennis.it/2017/03/potapova-anisimova-curitiba-la-finale-del-futuro/|title=Potapova contro Anisimova, a Curitiba la finale del futuro • Ok Tennis|date=2017-03-04|work=Ok Tennis|access-date=2018-09-22|language=it-IT}}</ref> This triumph saw her defeat Teliana Pereira for her first top-200 win, and pushed her into  the top-500 of the rankings for the first time in her career.

She then made her debut at a [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] event, having received a [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] to compete in the qualifying rounds of the [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier Mandatory]] event in [[2017 Miami Open – Women's Singles|Miami]], defeating [[Maria Sakkari]] for her first top-100 win before falling to [[Jana Čepelová]] in straight sets. A series of good runs on clay saw her reaching two ITF semifinals in succession, most particularly at the [[2017 Empire Slovak Open|Empire Slovak Open]] where she was just an inch away from reaching the final, losing 5–7 in the final set against [[Verónica Cepede Royg]], who went on to reach the second week at the French Open.

Potapova was handed another wildcard, this time into the [[2017 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles Qualifying|qualifying draw of Wimbledon]]. She pounced on her chances, steering through all her matches in straight sets to make her [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] main draw debut. However, an untimely fall during her first-round match saw her being forced to retire against [[Tatjana Maria]], ending her impressive run.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/2017/07/04/804297-wimbledon-anastasia-potapova-ends-her-first-grand-slam-main-draw-match-in-heartbreaking-fashion.html|title=Wimbledon: Anastasia Potapova ends her first Grand Slam main draw match in heartbreaking fashion|last=Han|first=Don|date=2017-07-04|work=VAVEL.com|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-us}}</ref>

It was a bleak stretch of results which followed for Potapova, who reached just one ITF quarterfinal through the remainder of the year. She ended the year ranked 242, with a 20–14 win-loss record and eight top-200 wins.

===2018: Breakthrough onto the main tour===
Potapova started 2018 with a final appearance at the [[Sharm El Sheikh]] 15k event, but was upset by world No.769 Yuliya Hatouka there. She then played in her second WTA main-draw match at the [[2018 St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy – Singles|St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy]], where she finally earned her first main draw win against [[Tatjana Maria]] in straight sets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vavel.com/en-us/tennis-usa/2018/01/30/873755-wta-st-petersburg-anastasia-potapova-claims-first-wta-win-of-her-career-ousts-tatjana-maria-in-straight-sets.html|title=WTA St. Petersburg: Anastasia Potapova claims first WTA win of her career, ousts Tatjana Maria in straight sets|last=Han|first=Don|date=2018-01-30|work=VAVEL.com|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-us}}</ref> This set up a blockbuster second-round match between newly crowned Australian Open champion and world number one Wozniacki and Potapova, a clash between experience and youth. However, Potapova was only able to claim one game against Wozniacki, falling 0–6, 1–6 to end her run.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/42907988|title=Caroline Wozniacki: Australian Open champion wins St Petersburg opener|date=2018-02-01|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Potapova made her [[Fed Cup]] debut for [[Russia Fed Cup team|Russia]], but lost on her debut to the higher-ranked [[Viktória Kužmová]], and was unable to lead her country to the victory on that weekend. Another ITF final awaited Potapova, this time coming at the [[2018 O1 Properties Ladies Cup|O1 Properties Ladies Cup]] held in Russia. She ousted the 64th-ranked [[Monica Niculescu]] but was unable to close out her run as she was defeated by second seed [[Vera Lapko]].

Reaching her first professional clay final in [[2018 Torneo Internazionale Femminile Antico Tiro a Volo – Singles|Rome]], she lost to Dayana Yastremska there having just won one game in the process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Rising_Stars/57510/dayana-yastremska-thumps-anastasia-potapova-in-rome-for-the-third-pro-title/|title=Dayana Yastremska thumps Anastasia Potapova in Rome for the third pro title|work=Tennis World USA|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref> Potapova was given the chance to participate in yet another WTA event, and entered the [[2018 Moscow River Cup|Moscow River Cup]] with the help of a wildcard. She defeated two top-100 players and came out of nowhere to make her maiden WTA final,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/teenager-potapova-reaches-first-final-home-soil-moscow|title=Teenager Potapova reaches first final on home soil in Moscow|last=Juzwiak|first=Jason|date=2018-07-28|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}</ref> but faltered at the last hurdle as she fell to fellow 17-year-old [[Olga Danilović]] in a historic clash between the new generation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Rising_Stars/58185/olga-danilovic-and-anastasia-potapova-excel-the-2001-generation-in-moscow/|title=Olga Danilovic and Anastasia Potapova excel the 2001 generation in Moscow|work=Tennis World USA|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en-US}}</ref> She led by a break in the deciding set, but failed to close out the win but still managed to make her top-150 debut with this amazing run.

Potapova lost in the final round of qualifying at the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles Qualifying|US Open]] to [[Julia Glushko]] but rebounded to qualify for her third WTA main-draw appearance at the [[2018 Tashkent Open|Tashkent Open]]. She defeated [[Stefanie Vögele]] and exacted revenge for her Moscow loss against [[Olga Danilović]] in the second round.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/gasparyan-potapova-win-big-reach-tashkent-quarterfinals|title=Gasparyan, Potapova win big to reach Tashkent quarterfinals|last=Livaudais|first=Stephanie|date=2018-09-26|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> She then trounced [[Kateryna Kozlova]] in the semifinals <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/potapova-gasparyan-set-all-russian-final-tashkent|title=Potapova, Gasparyan set up all-Russian final in Tashkent|last=Juzwiak|first=Jason|date=2018-09-28|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> to set up an all-Russian final with [[Margarita Gasparyan]], where she was defeated with a one-sided scoreline.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/gasparyan-caps-comeback-tashkent-title-routs-potapova|title=Gasparyan caps comeback with Tashkent title, routs Potapova|last=Livaudais|first=Stephanie|date=2018-09-29|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref>
