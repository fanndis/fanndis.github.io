The '''Vision for Europe Award''' is an honour that has been bestowed annually since 1995 by the non-profit [[Edmond Israel Foundation]] in "recognition of outstanding achievements in taking Europe into the future."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ei-foundation.lu/vision/index.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121180916/http://ei-foundation.lu/vision/index.htm |archive-date=21 January 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Between 1995 and 2008, the award was presented to the recipient in a ceremony at the Edmond Israel Foundation building in [[Luxembourg City]]. Luxembourg's best-known sculptor [[Lucien Wercollier]] designed the statue presented to the recipients. The first Vision for Europe Award was given to [[Jacques Santer]] in 1995, the year he left his position as [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]] to become President of the [[European Commission]]. The award honored his efforts to unite Europe into a single entity.

Since 2016, the Award is presented during the [[Prague European Summit]]. The statue is produced by the Czech glass manufacturer [[Preciosa (corporation)|Preciosa]].<ref name=preciosa>{{cite web|url=https://www.preciosabeauty.com/zakazkova-vyroba-en-us/trofeje-a-ocenni-en-us/kulturni-ceny-en-us/detail/prague-european-summit | title=Prague European Summit | publisher=preciosabeauty.com | accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>
