'''Mantises''' are an [[Order (biology)|order]] ('''Mantodea''') of [[insect]]s that contains [[List of mantis genera and species|over 2,400 species in about 430 genera]] in 30 families. The largest family is the [[Mantidae]] ("mantids"<!--{{efn|"Mantid" was once almost a synonym for Mantodea, given that few species outside the Mantidae were known; that has changed with recent discoveries.}}-->). Mantises are distributed worldwide in [[Temperate climate|temperate]] and [[Tropics|tropical]] habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name '''praying mantis'''.

The closest relatives of mantises are the [[termite]]s and [[cockroach]]es ([[Blattodea]]), which are all within the [[superorder]] [[Dictyoptera]]. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects ([[Phasmatodea]]), other elongated insects such as [[grasshopper]]s ([[Orthoptera]]), or other unrelated insects with [[raptorial]] forelegs such as mantisflies ([[Mantispidae]]). Mantises are mostly [[ambush predator]]s, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice [[sexual cannibalism]], eating their mates after copulation.

Mantises were considered to have [[Supernatural|supernatural powers]] by early civilizations, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[Assyria]]. A cultural [[trope (literature)|trope]] popular in [[cartoon]]s imagines the female mantis as a ''[[femme fatale]]''. Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as [[pet]]s.

Because of the superficially similar [[raptorial]] [[forelegs]], [[Mantispidae|mantidflies]] may be confused with mantises, though they are unrelated.

[[File:Raptrix perspicua MHNT male.jpg|thumb|Wing arrangement of a typical mantis, adult male ''[[Raptrix perspicua]]''|alt=Mantis wings, the forewing leathery, the hindwing triangular]]

Mantises have large, triangular heads with a beak-like snout and [[mandible]]s. They have two bulbous [[compound eyes]], three small simple eyes, and a pair of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The articulation of the neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.<ref name=NatGeo /> 
The mantis thorax consists of a [[prothorax]], a [[mesothorax]], and a [[metathorax]]. In all species apart from the genus ''[[Mantoida]]'', the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer than the other two thoracic segments. The prothorax is also flexibly articulated, allowing for a wide range of movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.<ref name="prete" /><ref name="close up">{{cite book |last=Siwanowicz |first=Igor |year=2009 |title=Animals Up Close |url=https://archive.org/details/Animals_Up_Close_by_Igor_Siwanowicz_DK |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |pages=[https://archive.org/details/Animals_Up_Close_by_Igor_Siwanowicz_DK/page/n38 38]–39 |isbn=-978-1-405-33731-1}}</ref> Mantids also are unique to the [[Dictyoptera]] in that they have tympanate hearing, with two [[tympanum (anatomy)|tympana]] in an auditory chamber in their metathorax.

The femur itself is the [[Anatomical terms of location|proximal]] segment of the grasping part of the leg.|alt=Raptorial foreleg of a mantis, armed with long spines]]

Mantises have two spiked, grasping forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four legs of a mantis, the [[Arthropod leg#Coxa|coxa]] and [[Arthropod leg#Trochanter|trochanter]] combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment about as long as the [[Arthropod leg#Femur|femur]], which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located at the base of the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate [[Arthropod leg|tarsus]] used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no [[arolium]].<ref name="prete">{{Cite book |title=The Praying Mantids |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |contribution=Morphology and Taxonomy |author=Roy, Roger |year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prayingmantids0000unse/page/21 21–33] |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6174-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/prayingmantids0000unse/page/21}}</ref><ref name="Corrette" />

Mantises can be loosely categorized as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has two sets of wings: the outer wings, or [[tegmen|tegmina]], are usually narrow and leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hindwings, which are clearer and more delicate.<ref name="prete" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Kemper |first=William T. |title=Insect Order ID: Mantodea (Praying Mantises, Mantids) |url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/Portals/0/Gardening/Gardening%20Help/Insect%20Orders/Mantodea.pdf |publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden |access-date=21 September 2015}}</ref>
The abdomen of all mantises consists of 10 [[Tergum|tergites]], with a corresponding set of nine [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] visible in males and seven visible in females. The abdomen tends to be slimmer in males than females, but ends in a pair of [[cercus|cerci]] in both sexes.<ref name="prete" />

A small area at the front called the fovea has greater visual acuity than the rest of the eye, and can produce the high resolution necessary to examine potential prey. The peripheral ommatidia are concerned with perceiving motion; when a moving object is noticed, the head is rapidly rotated to bring the object into the visual field of the fovea. Further motions of the prey are then tracked by movements of the mantis's head so as to keep the image centered on the fovea.<ref name="Corrette">{{cite journal |last1=Corrette |first1=Brian J. |title=Prey capture in the praying mantis ''Tenodera aridifolia sinensis'': coordination of the capture sequence and strike movements |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |date=1990 |volume=148 |pages=147–180 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/148/1/147.full.pdf |pmid=2407798}}</ref><ref name=Simmons>{{cite book |author1=Simmons, Peter J. |author2=Young, David |title=Nerve Cells and Animal Behaviour |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRBHlAYfADUC&pg=PA89 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62726-9 |page=8990}}</ref> The eyes are widely spaced and [[Anatomical terms of location|laterally]] situated, affording a wide [[binocular vision|binocular field of vision]] and precise stereoscopic vision at close range.<ref name=Howard>{{cite book |author1=Howard, Ian P. |author2=Rogers, Brian J. |title=Binocular Vision and Stereopsis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8vqITdETe0C&pg=PA646 |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-508476-4 |page=646}}</ref> The dark spot on each eye that moves as it rotates its head is a [[pseudopupil]].

As their hunting relies heavily on vision, mantises are primarily [[diurnality|diurnal]]. Many species, however, fly at night, and then may be attracted to artificial lights. Mantises in the family [[Liturgusidae]] collected at night have been shown to be predominately males;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bragg | first1 = P.E. | year = 2010 | title = A review of the Liturgusidae of Borneo (Insecta: Mantodea) | journal = Sepilok Bulletin | volume = 12 | pages = 21–36}}</ref> this is probably true for most mantises. Nocturnal flight is especially important to males in locating less-mobile females by detecting their [[pheromone]]s. Flying at night exposes mantises to fewer bird predators than diurnal flight would. Many mantises also have an auditory thoracic organ that helps them avoid bats by detecting their [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] calls and responding evasively.<ref name="Yager">{{Cite book |title=The Praying Mantids |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |year=1999 |contribution=Hearing |author=Yager, David |pages=[https://archive.org/details/prayingmantids0000unse/page/101 101–103] |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6174-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/prayingmantids0000unse/page/101}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David |last2=Engel |first2=Michael, S. |year=2005 |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim_110 |url-access=limited |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/evolutioninsects00grim_110/page/n271 257] |isbn=978-0-521-82149-0}}</ref>

When directly threatened, many mantis species stand tall and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem larger and more threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hindwings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing ([[deimatic]]) [[threat display]], some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward the safety of the ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.<ref name=Prete282 /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yager |first1=D. |last2=May |first2=M. |year=1993 |title=Coming in on a wing and an ear |journal=Natural History |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=28–33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/11/1119_021119_TVbats_2.html |title=Praying Mantis Uses Ultrasonic Hearing to Dodge Bats |publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=17 August 2012}}</ref>

Mantises, like [[stick insect]]s, show rocking behavior in which the insect makes rhythmic, repetitive side-to-side movements. Functions proposed for this behavior include the enhancement of [[crypsis]] by means of the resemblance to vegetation moving in the wind. However, the repetitive swaying movements may be most important in allowing the insects to discriminate objects from the background by their relative movement, a visual mechanism typical of animals with simpler sight systems. Rocking movements by these generally sedentary insects may replace flying or running as a source of relative motion of objects in the visual field.<ref>{{cite journal |author=O'Dea, J.

=== Reproduction and life history ===

The mating season in temperate climates typically takes place in autumn,<ref name="Ene 1964" /><ref name="Maxwell" /> while in tropical areas, mating can occur at any time of the year.<ref name="Maxwell">{{cite book |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |title=The Praying Mantids |contribution=Mating Behavior |author=Michael, Maxwell.

He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by [[gland]]s in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an [[ootheca]]. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground.<ref name="Ene 1964" /> Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of [[parasitoid wasp]]s. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family [[Tarachodidae]], the mother guards the eggs.<ref name="Ene 1964">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00222936408651488 |author=Ene, J.

As in closely related insect groups in the superorder Dictyoptera, mantises go through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult (mantises are among the [[hemimetabolism|hemimetabolous]] insects). For smaller species, the eggs may hatch in 3–4 weeks as opposed to 4–6 weeks for larger species. The nymphs may be colored differently from the adult, and the early stages are often mimics of ants. A mantis nymph grows bigger as it [[ecdysis|molts]] its [[exoskeleton]]. Molting can happen five to 10 times before the adult stage is reached, depending on the species. After the final molt, most species have wings, though some species remain wingless or brachypterous ("short-winged"), particularly in the female sex. The lifespan of a mantis depends on the species; smaller ones may live 4–8 weeks, while larger species may live 4–6 months.<ref name="Prete1999">{{cite book |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |title=The Praying Mantids |contribution=Ecology of Praying Mantids |author=Hurd, I.

=== Sexual cannibalism ===
{{further|Sexual cannibalism}}
[[File:Praying Mantis Sexual Cannibalism European-37.jpg|thumb|Sexual cannibalism in ''Mantis religiosa'']]

Sexual cannibalism is common among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It has sometimes been observed in natural populations, where about a quarter of male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lawrence |first1=S.

The female may begin feeding by biting off the male's head (as they do with regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's movements may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a [[ganglion]] in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior appeared to be an artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ''[[ad libitum]]'' (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating.<ref name=Liske>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80170-0 |title=Sexual behaviour of the Chinese praying mantis |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=916–918 |year=1984 |last1=Liske |first1=E. |last2=Davis |first2=W.

The reason for sexual cannibalism has been debated; experiments show that females on poor diets are likelier to engage in sexual cannibalism than those on good diets.<ref name=Liske2>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/s0003-3472(87)80024-6|title=Courtship and mating behaviour of the Chinese praying mantis, Tenodera aridifolia sinenesis |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=35 |issue= 5|pages=1524–1537 |year=1987 |last1=Liske |first1=E. |last2=Davis |first2=W.

This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01239.x |title=Effects of female feeding regime in a sexually cannibalistic mantid: fecundity, cannibalism, and male response in ''Stagmomantis limbata'' (Mantodea) |journal=Ecological Entomology |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=775–787 |year=2010 |last1=Maxwell |first1=Michael R. |last2=Gallego |first2=Kevin M. |last3=Barry |first3=Katherine L.|s2cid=85923330 }}</ref> The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== In literature and art ===
One of the earliest mantis references is in the ancient Chinese dictionary ''[[Erya]]'', which gives its attributes in poetry, where it represents courage and fearlessness, and a brief description. A later text, the [[:zh:证类本草|''Jingshi Zhenglei Daguan Bencao <!--經史證類大觀本草-->'']] ("Great History of Medical Material Annotated and Arranged by Types, Based upon the Classics and Historical Works") from 1108, gives accurate details of the construction of the egg packages, the development cycle, anatomy, and the function of the antennae.
Although mantises are rarely mentioned in Ancient Greek sources, a female mantis in threat posture is accurately illustrated on a series of fifth-century BC silver coins, including [[didrachm]]s, from [[Metapontum]] in [[Lucania]].<ref name="Campbell2014">{{cite book |last=Bodson |first=Liliane |editor=Campbell, Gordon Lindsay |title=The Oxford Handbook of Animals in Classical Thought and Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ofo5BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA557 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-958942-5 |pages=557–558}}</ref>

Western descriptions of the biology and morphology of the mantises became more accurate in the 18th century.

[[Aldous Huxley]] made philosophical observations about the nature of death while two mantises mated in the sight of two characters in his 1962 novel ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (the species was ''[[Gongylus gongylodes]]''). The naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]]'s humorously autobiographical 1956 book ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'' includes a four-page account of an almost evenly matched battle between a mantis and a [[gecko]].

=== In mythology and religion ===
The mantis was revered by the southern African [[Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] in whose cultures man and nature were intertwined; for its praying posture, the mantis was even named ''{{lang|af|Hottentotsgot}}'' ("god of the [[Hottentot (racial term)|Hottentots]]") in the [[Afrikaans]] language that had developed among the first European settlers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Insek-kaleidoskoop: Die 'skynheilige' hottentotsgot |url=http://www.mieliestronk.com/insek7hotten.html |website=Mieliestronk.com |access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> However, at least for the San, the mantis was only one of the manifestations of a trickster-deity who could assume many other forms, such as a snake, hare or vulture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Siyabona Africa: Kruger National Park: San |url=http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa_bushmen.html |website=Siyabona Africa |access-date=30 June 2017}}</ref> Several ancient civilizations did consider the insect to have supernatural powers; for the Greeks, it had the ability to show lost travelers the way home; in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', the "bird-fly" is a minor god that leads the souls of the dead to the underworld; in a list of 9th-century BC [[Nineveh]] grasshoppers (''buru''), the mantis is named [[Necromancy|necromancer]] (''buru-enmeli'') and [[Divination|soothsayer]] (''buru-enmeli-ashaga'').<ref name="PreteWells">{{cite book |editor1=Prete, Fredrick R. |editor2=Wells, Harrington |editor3=Wells, Patrick H. |editor4=Hurd, Lawrence E. |title=The Praying Mantids |contribution=The Predatory Behavior of Mantids: Historical Attitudes and Contemporary Questions|author1=Prete, Frederick R.|author2=Wells, Harrington|author3=Wells, Patrick H. |name-list-style=amp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQtuB-EVSUC&pg=PA4 |year=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-6174-1 |pages=3–8}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mantid |url=http://www.britannica.com/animal/mantid |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref>

=== As pets ===
[[File:Gray adult female Carolina Mantis.JPG|thumb|Gray adult female [[Carolina mantis]] in human hand]]
Mantises are among the insects most widely kept as pets.<ref name=Kentucky>{{cite web |title=Pet bugs: Kentucky arthropods |url=http://www.uky.edu/Ag/CritterFiles/casefile/bugconnection/petbugs/Kentucky/Kentucky.htm#mantid |publisher=University of Kentucky |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=VanZomeren>{{cite web |last1=Van Zomeren |first1=Linda |title=European Mantis |url=http://www.keepinginsects.com/praying-mantis/species/european-mantis/ |publisher=Keeping Insects |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> Because the lifespan of a mantis is only about a year, people who want to keep mantises often breed them. In 2013 at least 31 species were kept and bred in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States.<ref name=UKmantis>{{cite report |title=Breeding Reports: 1st July 2013–1st October 2013 |type=Newsletter |url=http://www.ukmantisforums.co.uk/newsletters/Oct2013.pdf |publisher=UK Mantis Forums |work=UK Mantis Forums Newsletter |issue=12 |access-date=31 July 2015 |date=October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923103205/http://www.ukmantisforums.co.uk/newsletters/Oct2013.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1996 at least 50 species were known to be kept in captivity by members of the Mantis Study Group.<ref>Bragg, P.E.

=== For pest control ===
Gardeners who prefer to avoid [[pesticide]]s may encourage mantises in the hope of controlling insect pests.<ref name=Doutt>{{cite web |last1=Doutt |first1=R. L. |title=The Praying Mantis (Leaflet 21019)|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/PESTS/pests_PrayingMantis.pdf |publisher=University of California Division of Agricultural Sciences |access-date=31 July 2015}}</ref> However, mantises do not have key attributes of [[biological pest control]] agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators.<ref name=Doutt /> They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects.<ref name=DailySouth /> They therefore have "negligible value" in biological control.<ref name=Doutt />

Two species, the Chinese mantis and the European mantis, were deliberately introduced to North America in the hope that they would serve as pest controls for agriculture; they have spread widely in both the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |title=Praying and Chinese Mantises |url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/58926.html |publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation |access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>

=== Mantis-like robot ===
{{further|Biomimicry}}

A prototype [[robot]] inspired by the forelegs of the praying mantis has front legs that allow the robot to [[walking|walk]], climb steps, and grasp objects. The multi-jointed leg provides dexterity via a rotatable joint. Future models may include a more spiked foreleg to improve the grip and ability to support more weight.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cardona |first1=Ramon |last2=Touretzky |first2=David |title=Leg Design for a Praying Mantis Robot |url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FLAIRS/FLAIRS12/paper/viewFile/4438/4855 |website=Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society |access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>
