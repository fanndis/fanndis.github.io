'''Montecito''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "little mount") is an [[unincorporated community]] and [[census-designated place]] in [[Santa Barbara County, California]], located east of the [[Santa Barbara, California|City of Santa Barbara]].<ref name="LAT 20171212">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-montecito-flammable-privacy-trees-20171212-story.html|title=Ornamental landscaping in celebrity-studded Montecito adds to fire danger|first=Javier |last=Panzar

Montecito occupies the eastern portion of the coastal plain south of the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]]. Parts of the community are built on the lower foothills of the range. Montecito, however, does not include areas such as Coast Village Road, which are usually considered part of Montecito but are actually within the city limits of Santa Barbara. Notable roads spanning Montecito include East Valley Road, Mountain Drive, and Sycamore Canyon Road, all of which form part of [[California State Route 192|State Route 192]]. In addition, the [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101 Freeway]] runs along the south end of town, connecting it with other cities in Santa Barbara County and the rest of [[Southern California]].

==History==
The site of present-day Montecito, along with the entire south coast of Santa Barbara County, was inhabited for over 10,000 years by the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] Indians. The Spanish arrived in the 18th century but left the region largely unsettled while they built the [[Santa Barbara Presidio|Presidio]] and [[Mission Santa Barbara]] farther west.

In the middle of the 19th century, the area was known as a haven for bandits and highway robbers, who hid in the oak groves and canyons, preying on traffic on the coastal route between the towns that developed around the missions. By the end of the 1860s, the bandit gangs were gone, and Italian settlers arrived. Finding an area reminiscent of Italy, they built farms and gardens similar to those they had left behind. Around the end of the 19th century, wealthy tourists from the eastern and midwestern United States began to buy land in the area.<ref>Covarrubias, Amanda (January 19, 2015) [http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-miramar-20150120-story.html "Montecito poised to decide on a modern version of Miramar Hotel"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> It was near enough to Santa Barbara for essential services while still being secluded. Desirable weather and several nearby [[hot spring]]s offered the promise of comfortable, healthy living, in addition to the availability of affordable land.<ref>Baker, p. 61-62</ref>

The Montecito Hot Springs Hotel was built near the largest of the springs, in a canyon north of the town center and directly south of Montecito Peak, in Hot Springs Canyon. The hotel burned down in 1920; it was replaced a few years later by the smaller Hot Springs Club.<ref>Baker, p. 62</ref>

The architect [[George Washington Smith (architect)|George Washington Smith]] is noted particularly for his residences around Montecito, and for popularizing the Spanish Colonial Revival style in early 20th century America, as is [[Lutah Maria Riggs]], who started as a draftsman in Smith's firm, rose to partner, and later started her own firm.

Montecito was evacuated five times in four months between December 2017 and March 2018 because of weather-related events, which included the [[Thomas Fire]], the [[2018 Southern California mudflows]], and flooding related to the [[Pineapple Express]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/story/montecito-is-everything-bad-about-climate-change-in-a-single-california-town/ |title=See Everything Bad About Climate Change in a Single California Town |last=Molteni |first=Megan |date=March 23, 2018 |work=WIRED |access-date=March 24, 2018}}</ref>  The mudflows resulted in 20 reported deaths; 28 others were injured, and at least four people<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/13/all-people-who-died-california-mudslides/1031202001 |title=Here are all the people who died in the California mudslide |work=[[USA TODAY]] |date=January 14, 2018}}</ref> were reported missing.<ref>[http://www.ksby.com/story/37252693/five-people-now-missing-17-killed-in-montecito-mudslides]{{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-mudslide-officials-scramble-clear-debris-another-storm-hits-n837591|title=California scrambles to clear mudslide debris before new storm hits|website=NBC News}}</ref><ref name="SFGate1">{{Cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/us/article/California-storm-follows-fires-bringing-new-12483375.php|title=13 dead in Southern California as rain triggers mudslides|date=January 9, 2018|work=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref><ref name="LATimes-Jan11">{{cite news |last1=Mejia |first1=Brittny |last2=Hamilton |first2=Matt |last3=Etehad |first3=Melissa |last4=Tchekmedyian |first4=Alene |date=January 11, 2018 |title=Up to 43 people still missing in Montecito; dead include four children |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-mudslide-recovery-mainbar-20180111-story.html |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=January 11, 2018}}</ref> [[FEMA]] gave the [[Santa Barbara County Flood Control District]] $13.5 million dollars in 2020.

==Geography and climate==
[[Image:SantaBarbaraCA ButterflyBeach 20170911 1.jpg|thumb|left|Westward view of Butterfly Beach and the coastal bluffs in Montecito]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|9.3|sqmi|km2}}, 99.94% of it land and 0.06% of it water.

Montecito experiences a cool [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') characteristic of coastal Southern California. Because of Montecito's proximity to the ocean, onshore breezes significantly moderate temperatures, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places further inland. With its gentle Mediterranean climate, Montecito has long been a desirable location for horticulturists. March and April are the months to watch gray whales migrate north from Mexico through the [[Santa Barbara Channel]].<ref>Robert Reinhold (March 17, 1991), [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/travel/what-s-doing-in-santa-barbara.html What's Doing In: Santa Barbara] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>
