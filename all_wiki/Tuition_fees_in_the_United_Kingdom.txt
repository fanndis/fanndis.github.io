[[Tuition fees]] were first introduced across the entire United Kingdom in September 1998 under the [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Labour government]] to fund tuition for undergraduate and postgraduate certificate students at universities; students were required to pay up to £1,000 a year for tuition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3013272.stm |title=BBC Q&A: Student Fees |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref><ref name="AlleySmith2004">{{cite news|author=Stuart Alley and Mat Smith |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jan/27/tuitionfees.students |title=Timeline: Tuition fees |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2004-01-27|accessdate=2011-02-12 |location=London}}</ref> However, as a result of the new devolved national administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, there are now different arrangements for tuition fees in each of the nations.
==History==
{{Main|Timeline of tuition fees in the United Kingdom}}
Until 1976, tuition fees were paid by UK students attending a UK university who only qualified for the minimum grant of £50. In 1976 they were abolished, together with the £50 minimum grant.

In May 1996, [[Gillian Shephard]], Secretary of State for Education and Employment, commissioned an inquiry, led by the then Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Sir Ron Dearing]], into the funding of British higher education over the next 20 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/university-fees-in-historical-perspective|title=University fees in historical perspective|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=8 February 2016|website=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> This [[Dearing Report|National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education]] reported to the new Labour Government, in the summer of 1997, stating additional billions of funding would be needed over the period, including £350 million in 1998–99 and £565 million in 1999–2000, in order to expand student enrolment, provide more support for part-time students and ensure an adequate infrastructure.<ref name="BBCPolitics1997">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/07/0723/dearbrief.shtml |title=The Dearing Report |work=BBC Politics 1997 |publisher=BBC |date=1997 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/ |title=The Dearing Report - List of recommendations |publisher=Leeds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref> The committee, as part of its brief, had controversially investigated the possibility of students contributing to the cost of this expansion, either through loans, a graduate tax, deferred contributions or means testing state assistance, as their report notes:<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dearing|first1=Ronald|title=Higher Education in the learning society (1997) - Main Report|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/dearing1997/dearing1997.html|website=Education In England|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>

<blockquote>
<small>20.40</small> We do not underestimate the strength of feeling on the issue of seeking a contribution towards tuition costs: nor do we dispute the logic of the arguments put forward. A detailed assessment of the issues has, however, convinced us that the arguments in favour of a contribution to tuition costs from graduates in work are strong, if not widely appreciated. They relate to equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part-time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income that can be ring-fenced for higher education.

<small>20.41</small> We have, therefore, analysed the implications of a range of options against the criteria set out in paragraph 20.2. There is a wide array of options from which to choose, ranging from asking graduates to contribute only to their living costs through to asking all graduates to contribute to their tuition costs. We have chosen to examine four options in depth
</blockquote>

In response to the findings, the [[Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998]] was published on 26 November 1997, and enacted on 16 July 1998, part of which introduced tuition fees in all the [[countries of the United Kingdom]].<ref name="BBCNews1999">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/how_the_education_systems_work/legislation/134626.stm |title=Teaching and Higher Education Act |publisher=BBC News |date= 1999-05-06 |accessdate=2011-02-12}}</ref>

The act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned.<ref name="Bolton Tuition Fee Statistics">Bolton, Paul.

Following devolution in 1999, the newly devolved governments in Scotland and Wales brought in their own acts on tuition fees. The Scottish Parliament established, and later abolished a graduate endowment to replace the fees.<ref>Bolton, Paul.

[[File:London student protests December 2010.jpg|thumb|right|A banner displayed at a student protest in London against tuition fees in the United Kingdom in December 2010]]

In England, tuition fee caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to £3,000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006–07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006–07 and introduced in Wales in 2007–08. In 2009–10 the cap rose to £3,225 a year to take account of inflation.<ref name="tuition fee stats">Bolton, Paul.

A judicial review against the raised fees failed in 2012, and so the new fee system came into use that September.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17069298 | work=BBC News | title=Tuition fees case: Callum Hurley and Katy Moore lose | date=2012-02-17}}</ref>

Further adjustments were put forth in the 2015 budget, with a proposed fee increase in line with inflation from the 2017–18 academic year onwards, and the planned scrapping of maintenance grants from September 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-33444557|title=Student maintenance grants scrapped|date=8 July 2015|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> The changes were debated by the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in January 2016, rather than in the Commons.

In February 2018, then Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] launched a review of post-18 education funding, including university funding and possible alternatives to tuition fees and loans. The review panel was expected to report back in early 2019, but as of October 2019, the review is yet to be published.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prime Minister launches major review of post-18 funding |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-launches-major-review-of-post-18-education |website=gov.uk |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

In February 2020, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership candidate [[Keir Starmer]] (who went on to win the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2020 Labour leadership election]]), promised to maintain the Labour Party's commitment to abolishing tuition fees.<ref>{{cite news |last= McGuinness |first= Alan |date= 11 February 2020 |title= Labour leadership: Sir Keir Starmer promises to keep Jeremy Corbyn's tuition fees stance |url= https://news.sky.com/story/labour-leadership-sir-keir-starmer-promises-to-keep-jeremy-corbyns-tuition-fees-stance-11931718 |work= Sky News |access-date= 22 April 2020}}</ref>

In England, undergraduate tuition fees are capped at £9,250 a year for UK and Irish students.

====Effect====
Many commentators suggested that the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university.<ref name=guardian18112010>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/nov/18/ipsos-mori-poll-tuition-fees-cuts|title=University tuition fees hike 'will deter most poorer students' – poll|first1=Rachel|last1=Williams|first2=Jeevan|last2=Vasagar|date=18 November 2010|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> However, the gap between rich and poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees.<ref name=guardian13072014>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/aug/13/university-tuition-fee-rise-poorer-students|title=University tuition fee rise has not deterred poorer students from applying|first1=Richard|last1=Adams|first2=education|last2=editor|date=12 August 2014|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes.<ref name=NS122015>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2015/12/worst-place-poor-students-uk-scotland|title=The worst place for poor students in the UK?

A study by Murphy, Scott-Clayton, and Wyness found that the introduction of tuition fees had "increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Murphy |first2=Judith |last2=Scott-Clayton |first3=Gillian |last3=Wyness |title=The End of Free College in England: Implications for Quality, Enrolments, and Equity |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23888 |date=February 2018 |doi=10.3386/w23888 |url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1501.pdf }}</ref>

===Northern Ireland===
Tuition fees are currently capped at £4,030 in Northern Ireland, with loans of the same size available from Student Finance NI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/tuition-fees|title=Tuition fees|date=9 December 2015|website=nidirect}}</ref> Loan repayments are made when income rises above £17,335 a year, with graduates paying back a percentage of their earnings above this threshold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/repaying-your-student-loan|title=Repaying your student loan|date=10 December 2015|website=nidirect}}</ref>

===Scotland===
Tuition fees are handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which does not charge fees from what it defines as "Young Students", or "Dependent Students". Young Students are defined as those under 25, without dependent children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saas.gov.uk/_forms/independent_young_status.pdf|title=Independent /Young (Dependent) Status|last=|first=|date=|website=SAAS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> Fees exist for those outside the young student definition. The tuition fees are usually £1,820 for undergraduate courses for Scottish & Irish students, and £9,250 for students from the rest of the UK. Due to Brexit, from Autumn 2021 EU students will have to pay international tuition fees in Scotland ranging from £10,000 - £26,000 per year depending on the university and degree type unless they have been granted a settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. <ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53354933</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.study.eu/article/tuition-fees-in-scotland|title=Tuition fees in Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=Study.eu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>http://www.saas.gov.uk/_forms/fees_student.pdf</ref> At the postgraduate level, Scots and RUK usually pay the same amount, commonly between £5,000 and £15,000 per year, while tuition fees for international students can run as high as £30,000 per year.<ref name=":0" />

Fee discrimination against students from the rest of the UK has been challenged in the past but deemed legal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/aug/24/scotland-university-fees-human-rights|title=Does Scotland's university fees system breach human rights laws? {{!}} Matthew Kelly|last=Kelly|first=Matthew|date=2011-08-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13090853.legal-challenge-over-fees-for-english-students-fails/|title=Legal challenge over fees for English students fails|website=HeraldScotland|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> The Scottish government confirmed in April 2019 that, with regards to tuition fees, EU students would be treated the same as Scottish students for their whole course if they begin studies up until 2020, regardless of how [[Brexit]] would be enacted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/extension-of-free-tuition-for-eu-students|title=Extension of free tuition for EU students|website=Scottish Government News|language=english|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>

Welsh students used to be able to apply for fee grants of up to £5,190, in addition to a £3,810 loan to cover tuition fee costs costs.<ref name="auto" /> However, the Welsh Government changed this system after the Diamond Review was published. Today students may only access  a tuition fee loan rather than a grant. The changes became effective for students starting University in September 2018. The Welsh Government argued this would allow for higher maintenance loans and grants and these costs are the biggest barrier for poorer students to attend University.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wales unveils means-tested university grants of up to £11,000 a year|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/22/wales-unveils-means-tested-university-grants-of-up-to-11000|date=2016-11-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-05-04}}</ref> 

==Interest fees==
Students and graduates pay interest fees on student loans. Interest starts being added to the student loan from when the first payment is made.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/what-you-pay |title= Repaying your student loan |website= GOV.UK |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref> In 2012 this rate was set at the [[retail price index]] (RPI) plus up to 3% depending on income. Students who started university between 1998 and 2011 pay [[Bank of England base rate]] plus 1% or RPI, whichever is lower. Students who started university before 1998 pay interest set at the RPI rate. As a consequence of the 2012 change, students who graduate in 2017 will pay between 3.1% and 6.1% interest, despite the Bank of England base rate being 0.25%.<ref name=guardian-20170411>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/11/student-loan-interest-rate-rise-uk-inflation-brexit |title=Student loan interest rate set to rise by a third after UK inflation surge |last=Jones |first=Rupert |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 April 2017 |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> In 2018, interest fees rose again, this time to 6.3% for anyone who started studying after 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last= Partington |first= Richard |date= 18 April 2018 |title= Ministers under fire as student loan interest hits 6.3% |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/18/ministers-under-fire-as-student-loan-interest-hits-63 |work= The Guardian |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref>

If those who have taken out a student loan do not update their details with the [[Student Loans Company]] when receiving a letter or an email to update their employment status, or upon leaving the UK for 3 or more months, start a new job or become self-employed, or stop working, then they can possibly face a higher interest rate on their loan.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/update-your-employment-details |title= Repaying your student loan |website= GOV.UK |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref>

In June 2019, the [[Brexit Party]] stated it would scrap all interest paid on student tuition fees and has suggested reimbursing graduates for historic interest payments made on their loans.<ref>{{cite news |date= 30 June 2019 |title= Brexit Party says it will scrap interest on tuition fees |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48819725 |work= BBC News |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref>

In August 2019, government figures uncovered by the Labour Party showed that "students will owe a staggering £8.6bn in interest alone on their loans within five years ... almost double the current debt".<ref>{{cite news |last= Merrick |first= Rob |date= 12 August 2019 |title= Students will owe £8.6bn in loan interest alone within five years, official figures show |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/student-loan-debt-interest-rates-government-a9054806.html |work= The Independent |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Adams |first= Richard |date= 12 August 2019 |title= Graduates in England face increasing debt burden, Labour warns |url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/12/graduates-in-england-face-increasing-debt-burden-labour-warns |work= The Guardian |access-date= 7 November 2019}}</ref>

==Possible alternatives==
There have been two main proposed alternative ways of funding university studies: from general taxation or by a [[graduate tax]].

===Funding from general taxation===
Tuition is paid for by general taxation in Germany, although only around 30% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/education-34132664|title=How Germany abolished tuition fees|first=Sean|last=Coughlan|date=3 September 2015|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datenportal.bmbf.de/portal/de/Tabelle-1.9.5.html|title=Tabelle 1.9.5 - BMBF Daten-Portal|last=BMBF|first=Team Daten-Portal des|website=Daten-Portal des Bundesministeriums für Bildung und Forschung - BMBF|language=de|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] as a 'tax cut for the rich and a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.<ref>http://www.libdemvoice.org/opinion-labours-tuition-fees-policy-is-a-tax-cut-for-the-rich-paid-for-by-the-poor-44497.html</ref>

[[Jeremy Corbyn]], former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader, stated that he would have removed tuition fees and would have instead funded higher education by increasing National Insurance and Corporation Tax.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scrap-tuition-fees-and-give-students-grants-again-says-labours-jeremy-corbyn-10392769.html|title=Jeremy Corbyn: Scrap tuition fees and give students grants again, says Labour leadership contender|work=The Independent|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> In the long term this plan would have been expected to cost the government about £8 billion a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40000409|title=Reality Check: What would wiping student debt cost?|date=22 May 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In July 2017 [[Andrew Adonis, Baron Adonis|Lord Adonis]], former [[Number 10 Policy Unit]] staffer and education minister largely responsible for introducing tuition fees, said that the system had become a "Frankenstein's monster" putting many students over £50,000 in debt. He argued the system should either be scrapped or fees reverted to between £1,000 and £3,000 per the initial scheme.<ref name=guardian-20170707a>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/07/tuition-fees-should-be-scrapped-says-architect-of-fees-andrew-adonis |title=Tuition fees should be scrapped, says 'architect' of fees Andrew Adonis |last=Adams |first=Richard |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20170707b>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/07/tuition-fees-scrapped-debts-graduates-andrew-adonis |title=I put up tuition fees. It's now clear they have to be scrapped |last=Adonis |first=Andrew |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 July 2017 |accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref>

===Graduate tax===
During the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2015 Labour leadership election]], [[Andy Burnham]] said that he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there would be no way to recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.<ref>http://www.ifs.org.uk/budgets/gb2002/chap8.pdf</ref>
