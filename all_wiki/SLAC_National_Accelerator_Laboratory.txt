It is the site of the '''Stanford Linear Accelerator''', a 3.2 kilometer (2-mile) [[linear accelerator]] constructed in 1966 and shut down in the 2000s, which could accelerate electrons to energies of 50&nbsp;[[GeV]].

Today SLAC research centers on a broad program in [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[solid state physics|solid-state physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[medicine]] using X-rays from [[synchrotron radiation]] and a [[free-electron laser]] as well as [[experimental physics|experimental]] and [[theoretical physics|theoretical]] research in [[elementary particle|elementary]] [[particle physics]], [[astroparticle physics]], and [[cosmology]].

==History==
[[File:SLAC_Gate_Sign.jpg|thumb|alt=The entrance to SLAC in Menlo Park.|The entrance to SLAC in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]]]]

Founded in 1962 as the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, the facility is located on {{convert|426|acre|ha|order=flip}} of [[Stanford University]]-owned land on [[Sand Hill Road]] in Menlo Park, California—just west of the University's main campus.  The main accelerator is {{convert|2|mi|km|order=flip|sp=us}} long—the longest linear accelerator in the world—and has been operational since 1966.

Perl]].</ref>

SLAC's meeting facilities also provided a venue for the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] and other pioneers of the [[home computer]] revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In 1984 the laboratory was named an [[List of Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks|ASME National Historic Engineering Landmark]] and an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Stanford_Linear_Accelerator_Center,_1962 |title=Milestones:Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, 1962 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref>

SLAC developed and, in December 1991, began hosting the first [[World Wide Web]] server outside of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml|title=Archives and History Office: Early Chronology and Documents|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

In the early-to-mid 1990s, the Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) investigated the properties of the [[Z boson]] using the Stanford Large Detector.

As of 2005, SLAC employed over 1,000 people, some 150 of whom were [[physicist]]s with [[doctorate degree]]s, and served over 3,000 visiting researchers yearly, operating [[particle accelerator]]s for [[high-energy physics]] and the [[Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory]] (SSRL) for [[synchrotron light]] radiation research, which was "indispensable" in the research leading to the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] awarded to Stanford Professor [[Roger D. Kornberg]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/nobel/2006nobel.html|website=SLAC Virtual Visitor Center|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=19 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805135252/http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/nobel/2006nobel.html|archivedate=5 August 2011|date=n.d.}}</ref>

In October 2008, the Department of Energy announced that the center's name would be changed to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The reasons given include a better representation of the new direction of the lab and the ability to trademark the laboratory's name. Stanford University had legally opposed the Department of Energy's attempt to trademark "Stanford Linear Accelerator Center".<ref name="Daily rename" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.slac.stanford.edu/feature/2008/new-name-for-slac.asp|title=SLAC Today|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

In March 2009, it was announced that the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory was to receive $68.3 million in Recovery Act Funding to be disbursed by Department of Energy's Office of Science.<ref>[http://home.slac.stanford.edu/pressreleases/2009/20090323.htm|title=March 23, 2009 - SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to Receive $68.3 Million in Recovery Act Funding]</ref>

In October 2016, Bits and Watts launched as a collaboration between SLAC and Stanford University to design "better, greener electric grids". SLAC later pulled out over concerns about an industry partner, the state-owned Chinese electric utility.<ref name=SD>{{cite news| author1=Hannah Knowles |author2=Berber Jin |title=Chinese access to research questioned: Disagreements ensue over inclusion and national security |publisher=The Stanford Daily | date=29 May 2019 | volume=255 |issue=66}}</ref>

 }} See also a colleague's logbook at http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000294.</ref> The bulk of the data was collected by the [[SLAC Large Detector]], which came online in 1991. Although largely overshadowed by the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] at [[CERN]], which began running in 1989, the highly [[Helicity (particle physics)|polarized]] electron beam at SLC (close to 80%<ref>Ken Baird, Measurements of A<sub>LR</sub> and A<sub>lepton</sub> from SLD http://hepweb.rl.ac.uk/ichep98/talks_1/talk101.pdf</ref>) made certain unique measurements possible, such as parity violation in Z Boson-b quark coupling.<ref>https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/22c0/158e9d4f5e1f85484aec7150e44b996dbf1a.pdf</ref>

Presently no beam enters the south and north arcs in the machine, which leads to the Final Focus, therefore this section is mothballed to run beam into the PEP2 section from the beam switchyard.

[[File:SLAC detector.jpg|thumb|right|Inside view of the SLD]]

=== SLAC Large Detector ===
The SLAC Large Detector (SLD) was the main detector for the Stanford Linear Collider. It was designed primarily to detect Z bosons produced by the accelerator's electron-positron collisions.  Built in 1991, the SLD operated from 1992 to 1998.<ref>https://www.slac.stanford.edu/gen/grad/GradHandbook/slac.html</ref>

=== PEP ===
PEP (Positron-Electron Project) began operation in 1980, with center-of-mass energies up to 29 GeV. At its apex, PEP had five large particle detectors in operation, as well as a sixth smaller detector. About 300 researchers made used of PEP. PEP stopped operating in 1990, and PEP-II began construction in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/gen/grad/GradHandbook/slac.html|title=The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

=== PEP-II ===
<!-- {{Main|PEP-II}} -->

From 1999 to 2008, the main purpose of the linear accelerator was to inject electrons and positrons into the PEP-II accelerator, an electron-positron collider with a pair of storage rings {{convert|2.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in circumference. PEP-II was host to the [[BaBar experiment]], one of the so-called [[B-Factory]] experiments studying [[CP-symmetry|charge-parity symmetry]].

=== Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource ===
{{Main|Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource}}

The [[Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource]] (SSRL) is a [[synchrotron light]] user facility located on the SLAC campus.  Originally built for particle physics, it was used in experiments where the [[J/psi meson|J/ψ meson]] was discovered. It is now used exclusively for materials science and biology experiments which take advantage of the high-intensity synchrotron radiation emitted by the stored electron beam to study the structure of molecules. In the early 1990s, an independent electron injector was built for this storage ring, allowing it to operate independently of the main linear accelerator.

[[File:GLAST on the payload attach fitting.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]]

=== Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope ===
{{main|Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}}

SLAC plays a primary role in the mission and operation of the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]], launched in August 2008. The principal scientific objectives of this mission are:
*To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in [[Active galactic nucleus|AGNs]], pulsars, and [[Supernova remnant|SNRs]].
*To resolve the gamma-ray sky: unidentified sources and diffuse emission.
*To determine the high-energy behavior of gamma-ray bursts and transients.
*To probe dark matter and fundamental physics.

=== KIPAC ===
{{main|Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology}}

The Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) is partially housed on the grounds of SLAC, in addition to its presence on the main Stanford campus.

===PULSE===

[[Stanford PULSE Institute|The Stanford PULSE Institute (PULSE)]] is a Stanford Independent Laboratory located in the Central Laboratory at SLAC.  PULSE was created by Stanford in 2005 to help Stanford faculty and SLAC scientists develop ultrafast x-ray research at LCLS. PULSE research publications can be viewed [https://scholar.google.com/citations?sortby=pubdate&hl=en&user=cJvCrvsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works here].

=== LCLS ===

The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a [[free electron laser]] facility located at SLAC.  The LCLS is partially a reconstruction of the last 1/3 of the original linear accelerator at SLAC, and can deliver extremely intense x-ray radiation for research in a number of areas. It achieved first lasing in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/|title=SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source|accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>

The detector complex is visible to the east, on the right side]]

The laser produces hard X-rays, 10<sup>9</sup> times the relative brightness of traditional synchrotron sources and is the most powerful x-ray source in the world. LCLS enables a variety of new experiments and provides enhancements for existing experimental methods. Often, x-rays are used to take "snapshots" of objects at the atomic level before obliterating samples. The laser's wavelength, ranging from 0.13 to 6.2&nbsp;nm (200 to 9500 [[electron volt]]s (eV))<ref name="SOFT X-RAY MATERIALS SCIENCE SXR">{{cite web | title=SOFT X-RAY MATERIALS SCIENCE (SXR) |url=https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public/Instruments/SXR/Pages/Specifications.aspx

===LCLS-II===
The LCLS-II project is to provide a major upgrade to LCLS by adding two new X-ray laser beams. The new system will utilize the {{Convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} of existing tunnel to add a new superconducting accelerator at 4&nbsp;GeV and two new sets of undulators that will increase the available energy range of LCLS. The advancement from the discoveries using this new capabilities may include new drugs, next-generation computers, and new materials.<ref>{{cite news|title=LCLS-II Upgrade to Enable Pioneering Research in Many Fields|url=http://www.cryogenicsociety.org/csa_highlights/lcls_ii_upgrade_to_enable_pioneering_research_in_many_fields/|accessdate=15 August 2015|work=Cryogenic Society of America|date=8 July 2015}}</ref>

===FACET===
In 2012, the first two-thirds (~2&nbsp;km) of the original SLAC LINAC were recommissioned for a new user facility, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET). This facility was capable of delivering 20&nbsp;GeV, 3&nbsp;nC electron (and positron) beams with short bunch lengths and small spot sizes, ideal for beam-driven [[plasma acceleration]] studies.<ref>[http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/ipac2012/papers/weppp010.pdf FACET: SLAC's new user facility]</ref> The facility ended operations in 2016 for the constructions of LCLS-II which will occupy the first third of the SLAC LINAC. The FACET-II project will re-establish electron and positron beams in the middle third of the LINAC for the continuation of beam-driven plasma acceleration studies in 2019.

===NLCTA===

The Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA) is a 60-120 MeV high-brightness electron beam linear accelerator used for experiments on advanced beam manipulation and acceleration techniques. It is located at SLAC's end station B. A list of relevant research publications can be viewed [https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/ard_public/tfd/facilities/nlcta/Pages/Recent-Publications.aspx here].

== Other discoveries ==
*SLAC has also been instrumental in the development of the [[klystron]], a high-power [[microwave]] amplification tube.
*There is active research on [[plasma acceleration]] with recent successes such as the doubling of the energy of 42 GeV electrons in a meter-scale accelerator.
*There was a ''[[Paleoparadoxia]]'' found at the SLAC site, and its skeleton can be seen at a small museum there in the Breezeway.<ref>[http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/paleo.html Stanford's SLAC Paleoparadoxia] much thanks to Adele Panofsky, Dr. Panofsky's wife, for her reassembly of the bones of the Paleoparadoxia uncovered at SLAC.</ref>
*The SSRL facility was used to reveal hidden text in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. X-rays from the synchrotron radiation lightsource caused the iron in the original ink to glow, allowing the researchers to photograph the original document that a Christian monk had scrubbed off.<ref>
