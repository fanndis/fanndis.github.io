'''West London''' is a popularly, but informally and inexactly defined part of [[London]], [[England]].

The area lies north of the [[River Thames]] and extends from its historic and commercial core of [[Westminster]] and the [[West End of London|West End]] to the [[Greater London]] boundary, much of which is formed by the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]]. Some interpretations of the area include the boroughs of [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] and [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], making [[Watling Street|ancient Watling Street]], the boundary in those [[outer London|outer]] areas. The constituent districts of West London were once part of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Middlesex]].

The area emerged from Westminster, an area just west of the [[City of London]], which owed its importance to the consecration of [[Westminster Abbey]] and after that, the establishment of the [[Palace of Westminster]]. Westminster and the [[West End of London|West End]] are also part of [[Central London]]. The term West London is used to differentiate the area from other informal radial divisions of London, the ''Metropolitan Compass'';<ref>A phrase used, for instance, by Dickens in the Uncommercial Traveller, Ch 3</ref> [[North London]], [[East London]] and [[South London]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/east-is-poor-west-is-posh-south-is-rough-and-north-is-intellectual-londoners-views-on-the-citys-9088834.html|title='East is poor, West is posh, South is rough and North is 'intellectual': Londoners' views on the city's postcodes revealed|last=Blundy|first=Rachel|date=27 January 2014|website=Evening Standard}}</ref>

===London Plan===
The [[London Plan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk//what-we-do/planning/london-plan|title=The London Plan|date=November 11, 2015|website=London City Hall}}</ref> defines two areas of London as ''International Centres'', the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Knightsbridge]], both in the west of London. Five of the thirteen ''Metropolitan Centres'' in the Plan might be described as being in West London (dependent on definition of the area): [[Ealing]], [[Hounslow]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], [[Uxbridge]] and [[Shepherds Bush]].

Eleven of the Plan's thirty-eight ''Opportunity Areas'' might be described as part of West London; [[Kensal Green|Kensal Canalside]], [[Paddington]], [[Earl's Court]] and [[West Kensington]], [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Wealdstone]], [[Park Royal]], [[Old Oak Common]], [[Southall]], [[Tottenham Court Road]], Victoria, [[Wembley]] and [[White City, London|White City]]. One of the Plan's seven ''Intensification Areas'', [[Holborn]], could be described as part of the West.

===Major employers===
[[London Heathrow Airport]] is a major employer in West London, and the [[University of West London]] has more than 47,000 students.<ref name=UWL>{{cite web|title=The economic impact of the University of West London|url=https://www.UWL.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Departments/About-us/OE_UWL_report_WEB.pdf|format=PDF; 850&nbsp;MB|website=UWL.ac.uk|publisher=[[University of West London]] / [[Oxford Economics]]|date=May 2013|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>

==Emergence==
The development of the area began with the establishment of the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbey]] on a site then called [[Thorney Island (Westminster)|Thorney Island]], the choice of site may in part relate to the [[Watling Street#Westminster Natural Ford|natural ford]] which is thought to have carried [[Watling Street]] over the [[River Thames|Thames]] in the vicinity.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Loftie's Historic London (review) |journal=The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art |volume=63 |issue=1,634 |date=19 February 1887 |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1RJAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271 |accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref> Tradition dates the foundation to the 7th Century AD with written records dating back to the 960s or early 970s.<ref name=wpage>{{cite web|title='Benedictine monks: St Peter's abbey, Westminster', in A History of the County of London: Volume 1, London Within the Bars, Westminster and Southwark, |first= William |last=Page|location=London|year=1909|pages=433–457|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/london/vol1/pp433-457 |accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref> The Island and surrounding area became known as Westminster in reference to the church.

The legendary origin<ref>http://www.choirschools.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Abbey-Fishy-Tale.pdf</ref> is that in the early 7th century, a local fisherman named Edric, ferried a stranger in tattered foreign clothing over the Thames to [[Thorney Island (London)|Thorney Island]]. It was a miraculous appearance of [[Saint Peter|St Peter]], a fisherman himself, coming to the island to [[consecration|consecrate]] the newly built church, which would subsequently develop into [[Westminster Abbey]]. He rewarded Edric with a bountiful catch when he next dropped his nets. Edric was instructed to present the [[Sæberht of Essex|King]] and [[Mellitus|St. Mellitus, Bishop of London]] with a salmon and various proofs that the consecration had already occurred . Every year on 29 June, St Peters day, the [[Worshipful Company of Fishmongers]] presents the Abbey with a salmon in memory of this event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/fishmongers-company|title=Fishmongers' Company|first=PixelToCode|last=pixeltocode.uk|website=Westminster Abbey}}</ref>

The [[Palace of Westminster]] subsequently developed, with Parliament being based there from its establishment in 1265. The presence of the centre of government as a distinct focus for growth, accompanied by the proximity of the City, ensured that western London was the fastest growing part of early London.

In 1720, [[John Strype|John Strype's]] ‘Survey of London’ described Westminster as one of the then four distinct areas of London;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhi.ac.uk/strype/tableOfcontent.jsp|title=John Strype's Survey of London Online|website=www.dhi.ac.uk}}</ref> in it he describes the [[City of London]], [[City and Liberty of Westminster|Westminster (West London)]], [[Southwark|Southwark (South London)]], and [[East London|'That Part beyond the Tower' (East London)]]. The area now usually referred to as [[North London]] developed later.

As well as the proximity of the centre of government, the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City.<ref>Robert O. Bucholz and Joseph P. Ward: ''London: A Social and Cultural History, 1550–1750''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012, p. 333</ref>
A further factor facilitating rapid growth in West London was the very large number of bridges linking the area to South London and the area beyond; by contrast, even today, there are no bridges east of [[Tower Bridge]], partly as the river becomes wider as it heads east.

Like other areas of the capital, West London grew rapidly in the Victorian era as a result of railway-based commuting; with the building of the termini at [[London Paddington station|Paddington]] and [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]], and the lines radiating from them, having a particularly profound effect. This trend continued in the twentieth century and was subsequently reinforced by motorcar-based commuting.

The size of London stabilised after the establishment of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] shortly after the Second World War.

== Official designations ==
The term 'West London' has been used for a variety of formal purposes with the boundaries defined according to the purposes of the designation.

===Planning Policy sub-region===
[[File:London plan sub regions (2011).svg|right|350px]]
The 2011 iteration of the London Plan<ref name="Places">{{cite web | url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/london-plan/current-london-plan/london-plan-chapter-two-londons-places/policy-25 | title=Policy 2.5 Sub-regions | author=London City Hall}}.</ref> included an altered 'West' sub-region, to be used for planning, engagement, resource allocation and progress reporting purposes. It consists of the [[London Borough]]s of [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], [[London Borough of Ealing|Ealing]], [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]], [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]], [[London Borough of Hounslow|Hounslow]] and the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond upon Thames]].
As well as including outer areas of West London, the sub-region also includes areas south of the river, not usually counted as part of West London; areas of the cross-river [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]].

The [[List of sub-regions used in the London Plan|2004-2008 and 2008-2011 versions]] of the sub-region varied in their composition.

=== W postcode area ===
The W (Western) postcode area was introduced in 1857<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.postalmuseum.org/discover/collections/postcodes/|title=Postcodes|website=The Postal Museum}}</ref> to facilitate the distribution of mail. The postcode area is a sub-set of West London in some definitions or the extent of West London in others, since it does not include areas frequently counted as part of North West London. 

Many areas with a SW postcode are in fact in West London and are north of the river, such as [[Chelsea, London | Chelsea]] and [[South Kensington]].
