'''Abstinence''' is a self-enforced restraint from indulging in bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving [[pleasure]]. Most frequently, the term refers to [[sexual abstinence]], or abstinence from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], drugs, or [[food]].  

Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of [[repression (psychological)|repression]]. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences.

==Abstinence in religion==
Abstinence may arise from an [[ascetic]] over indulgent, hasidic point of view in natural ways of procreation, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life of desire, to a chosen ideal, by following a path of renunciation.

For [[Jew]]s, the principal day of fast is [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement.

For [[Muslim]]s, the period of fasting lasts during the whole month of [[Ramadan]], from dawn to dusk.

In both Christianity and Islam, amongst others, [[pre-marital sex]] is prohibited.

[[Catholic]]s abstain from food and drink for an hour prior to taking [[Holy Communion]], and from meat on [[Ash Wednesday]] and on Fridays except [[Solemnity|solemnities]]. In the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Book of Common Prayer]] prescribes certain days as days for fasting and abstinence, "consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday)".<ref name="Buchanan2006">{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Colin|title=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|date=27 February 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English |isbn=9780810865068|page=182|quote=In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, there is a list of "Days of Fasting, or Abstinence," consisting of the 40 days of Lent, the ember days, the three rogation days (the Monday to Wednesday following the Sunday after Ascension Day), and all Fridays in the year (except Christmas, if it falls on a Friday).}}</ref> Orthodox Christians abstain from food and drink from midnight on the day they receive Holy Communion, and abstain from meat and dairy on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year, as well as during Great Lent. Catholics distinguish between [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting and abstinence]]; the former referring to the discipline of taking one full meal a day, and the latter signifying the discipline of eating no meat (fish is allowed). Some [[Protestant]]s, especially [[Methodist]]s and [[Baptist]]s, have preferred to abstain from drinking alcohol and the use of tobacco.

[[Mormons]] abstain from certain foods and drinks by combining spiritual discipline with health concerns. Mormons also fast one day a month, for both spiritual and charitable reasons (the money saved by skipping meals is donated to the needy). The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] encourages the consumption of only clean meats as specified in [[Leviticus]] and strongly discourages the consumption of alcohol, smoking, and the use of [[narcotics]].<ref name="adventist">{{cite web

In [[India]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Jain]]s, [[Sikhs]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]]{{cn|date=October 2015}} abstain from eating meat and fish (basically, all living animals) on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life. Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of [[Hinduism]]. In addition, lay and monastic Buddhists refrain from killing any living creature and from consuming intoxicants, and [[bhikkhu]]s keep vows of chastity. In [[Theravada]] Buddhism, bhikkhus also refrain from eating in the afternoon, and cannot accept money. Jains abstain from violence in any form, and will not consume living creatures or kill bugs or insects.<ref>[[Ahimsa in Jainism]]</ref>

==Medicine==
{{medref|section|date=November 2017}}
In medicine, abstinence is the discontinuation of a drug, often an [[drug addiction|addictive]] one. This might, in addition to craving after the drug, be expressed as [[withdrawal syndromes]]. In the Basic Text of Narcotics Anonymous, a large fellowship following the 12-steps outlined by AA, NA is outlined to be "a program of complete abstinence from all mood or mind-altering substances."{{cn|date=November 2017}} This description includes alcohol, because alcohol is a drug, and is widely known to include any kind of prescription narcotics, like pain-killers (opiates), anti-anxiety medicine (benzodiazepines) or diet pills (amphetamines). The practice of abstinence is a learned behavior, and comes slowly over time - time spent listening and sharing in NA and AA meetings, behavioral health psychology group or individualized therapies, and hanging out with people in the recovery support community.

==Types of abstinence==

===Food===
{{Further|Fasting|Vegetarianism|Veganism}}
[[File:Womans-Holy-War.jpg|thumb|"Woman's Holy War. Grand Charge on the Enemy's Works". An allegorical 1874 political cartoon print, which somewhat unusually shows temperance campaigners (alcohol prohibition advocates) as virtuous armored women warriors (riding sidesaddle), wielding axes Carrie-Nation-style to destroy barrels of Beer, Whisky, Gin, Rum, Brandy, Wine and Liquors, under the banners of "In the name of God and humanity" and "Temperance League". The foremost woman bears the shield seen in the [[Seal of the United States]] (based on the U.S. flag), suggesting the patriotic motivations of temperance campaigners.

''Fasting'' is primarily the act of willingly abstaining from some or all food, [[drink]], or both, for a period of time. A fast may be total or partial concerning that from which one fasts, and may be prolonged or intermittent as to the period of fasting.  Fasting practices may preclude sexual activity as well as food, in addition to refraining from eating certain types or groups of foods; for example, one might refrain from eating [[meat]].
A complete fast in its traditional definition is abstinence of all food and liquids except for water.

''Vegetarianism'' is the practice of a diet that excludes meat (including [[Game (food)|game]], marine mammals and slaughter by-products), [[poultry]], fowl, [[fish]], [[shellfish]] and other sea creatures.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>
There are several variants of the diet, some of which also exclude [[egg (food)|eggs]] or products produced from animal labour such as [[dairy product]]s and [[honey]].

===Tobacco smoking===
{{Further|Smoking cessation}}
''Smoking cessation'' is the action leading towards the discontinuation of the consumption of a smoked substance, mainly tobacco, but it may encompass [[cannabis smoking|cannabis]] and other substances as well.

===Alcohol===
{{Further|Teetotalism}}
''Teetotalism'' is the practice and promotion of complete abstinence from [[alcoholic beverage]]s.

Some common reasons for choosing teetotalism are [[religion|religious]], [[health]], [[family]], [[philosophical]] or [[society|social]] reasons, and, sometimes, as simply a matter of taste preference.  When at [[bar (establishment)|drinking establishments]], they either abstain from drinking or consume non-alcoholic beverages such as tea, coffee, water, juice, and [[soft drink]]s.

Contemporary and [[colloquial]] usage has somewhat expanded teetotalism to include strict abstinence from most "recreational" [[intoxicants]] (legal and illegal, see [[controlled substances]]). Most teetotaller organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants.

===Pleasure===
{{Further|Work-life balance}}
A general abstinence from pleasures or [[leisure]], either partial or full, may be motivated by ambition, [[career]] or general self-respect (excluding the point of view that even the latter examples may be regarded as sources of pleasure).

It is widely accepted that abstinence from [[drug addiction|addictive drugs]] gives successful outcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} However, it is not certain whether a general abstinence from pleasures of leisure yields higher productivity. Too much work generates [[Stress (biological)|stress]] and its potential adverse effects. Furthermore, the effort itself to achieve abstinence may consume willpower from its ultimate purpose. Total abstinence from pleasure or leisure is practically impossible and instead an individual [[work-life balance]] is necessary.
