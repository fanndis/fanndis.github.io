'''Siumut''' (lit.

Siumut is led by [[Kim Kielsen]], the current [[Prime Minister of Greenland]].

Party members have been elected to both the [[parliament of Greenland]] and the [[parliament of Denmark]].

Siumut was formed in 1971 as a political movement, and became a party in 1977. Following the establishment of [[Greenland#Home rule and self-rule|home rule for Greenland]] in January 1979, the party won 13 of 21 seats in the [[1979 Greenlandic general election]] for the newly formed [[Parliament of Greenland]], and party chairman [[Jonathan Motzfeldt]] became the first [[Prime Minister of Greenland]].<ref name="Cook2001"/><ref name="Thomas2010"/>

==History==
Following the [[1991 Greenlandic general election]], Motzfeldt stepped down and was replaced by [[Lars Emil Johansen]], also of Siumut, who governed in coalition with [[Inuit Ataqatigiit]].<ref name="Cook2001"/> 

From 1997, and until 2002, Motzfeldt was again Prime Minister, until he was succeeded by [[Hans Enoksen]].<ref name="Thomas2010"/> From 1979 until 2009 and since 2013, members of Siumut have served as Greenland's Prime Minister.  In the [[2005 Greenlandic general election|15 November 2005 general election]], the party won 30.7% of the popular vote and 10 out of 31 seats in the parliament. In the [[2009 Greenlandic general election|2009 general election]], it won 26.5% of the popular vote and 9 seats and in the [[2013 Greenlandic general election|2013 election]], it won 42.8% of the popular vote and 14 out of 31 seats. At the [[2014 Greenlandic general election|2014 election]] the party was still the largest party, but it lost three members of the parliament and has now 11 members.

==Positions==
The party was an observer affiliate of the [[Socialist International]].<ref>[http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticlePageID=928 Member Parties of the Socialist International]</ref> 

Siumut representatives sitting in the [[Danish parliament]] have been attached to the parliamentary group of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].<ref name="Thomas2010"/>

Note: In the [[1994 Danish general election]], an ''independent'' won a seat in the Danish Parliament, but it seems the '''Siumut''' party did not contest that particular election.
