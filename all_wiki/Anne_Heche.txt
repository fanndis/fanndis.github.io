Long]]'' (1995). She also appeared in the straight-to-video erotic thriller ''[[Wild Side (1995 film)|Wild Side]]'' (1995) as [[Joan Chen|Joan Chen's]] lesbian lover.

The disaster film ''Volcano'', about the formation of a volcano in [[Los Angeles]], had her star with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Gaby Hoffmann]], playing a [[seismology|seismologist]].

She portrayed the minor role of a backwoods loner in the slasher thriller [[sleeper hit]] ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', starring [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Ryan Phillippe]], and [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]. Despite her limited screen time in the film, Heche was considered a "standout" by some critics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefilmfile.com/reviews/i/97_iknowwhat.htm|title=Dustin Putman's Review: I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) - [TheMovieBoy]|website=www.thefilmfile.com}}</ref> such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/reviews/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-111731125/|title=I Know What You Did Last Summer|first1=Derek|last1=Elley|date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> She obtained the part of a presidential advisor opposite [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]] in the political satire ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', a role that was originally written for a man.<ref name="Yahoo!

Heche's first starring role came in the 1998 romantic adventure ''[[Six Days, Seven Nights]]'', where she appeared opposite [[Harrison Ford]], portraying a New York City journalist ending up with a pilot (Ford) in a deserted island following a crash landing. She had been cast in the film one day before her [[same-sex relationship]] with [[Ellen DeGeneres]] went public.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://home.nyc.rr.com/alweisel/usanneheche.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107234757/http://home.nyc.rr.com/alweisel/usanneheche.htm|archivedate=January 7, 2005|title=Anne Heche|last=Weisel|first=Al|work=[[Us Weekly]]|date=February 1998}}</ref> Although Heche was cast in a second starring role shortly thereafter as [[Vince Vaughn]]'s love interest in the drama ''[[Return to Paradise (1998 film)|Return to Paradise]]'' (1998), she felt that her relationship with DeGeneres destroyed her prospects as a leading woman.<ref name="Anne Heche Is Playing It Normal Now">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/02/magazine/02heche-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|title=Anne Heche Is Playing It Normal Now|first=Alex|last=Witchel|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 31, 2009}}</ref> According to Heche, "People said, 'You're not getting a job because you're [[gay]]".<ref name="Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche speak at March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, Bi and Equal Rights for Liberation">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGPwoaTXFZ8|title=Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche speak at March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, Bi and Equal Rights for Liberation (video)|date=March 23, 2000}}</ref> She commented: "How could that destroy my career?

Heche starred in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a [[remake]] of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. In the updated version, she took on the role originally played by [[Janet Leigh]], [[Marion Crane]], an embezzler who arrives at an old motel run by [[serial killer]] [[Norman Bates]] (played by Vince Vaughn in their second collaboration). ''Psycho'' earned negative reviews, and despite a US$60 million budget, it made a lukewarm US$37.1 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Van Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| website=Web Wombat| accessdate=March 30, 2009}}</ref> In an otherwise negative review of the film, [[Janet Maslin]] of ''The New York Times'' felt that Heche was "refreshingly cast in Marion's role", while noting that her portrayal was "as almost as demure as Ms. Leigh's, yet she's also more headstrong and flirty".<ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260|title=FILM REVIEW: PSYCHO; The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=December 5, 1998|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}</ref> Her 1998 films have remained the only theatrically released films in which she has had a leading role.

===2000s===
Most of her roles in the early 2000s were in independent films and television; she played the role of Dr. Sterling in the film adaptation of [[Elizabeth Wurtzel|Elizabeth Wurtzel's]] autobiography about [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], ''[[Prozac Nation (film)|Prozac Nation]]'', with [[Christina Ricci]] and [[Jessica Lange]]. Premiered at the 2001 [[Toronto International Film Festival]], the film received a DVD release in 2005.

In 2002 Heche made her Broadway debut in a production of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning drama ''[[Proof (play)|Proof]]'',  acting as a young woman who has inherited her father's mathematical genius and mental illness. ''The New York Times'' found Heche to be "consequential" in her portrayal, and comparing her to [[Mary-Louise Parker]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], who had previously played her character in other productions of the play, stated: "[...] Ms. Heche, whose stage experience is limited and who is making her New York stage debut at 33, plays the part with a more appeasing ear and more conventional timing, her take on the character is equally viable. Her Catherine is a case of arrested development, impatient, aggressively indignant, impulsive".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/19/movies/theater-review-a-light-quick-anne-heche-makes-proof-a-new-play.html|title=THEATER REVIEW; A Light, Quick Anne Heche Makes 'Proof' a New Play|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=July 19, 2002|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> In 2004, Heche received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the [[Lifetime Network|Lifetime]] movie ''[[Gracie's Choice]]'', as well as a [[Saturn Award]] nomination for Best Actress for her performance in the CBS television film ''The Dead Will Tell''.

====Nancy Heche====
Heche and her mother, Nancy, have been estranged since Heche confronted her about sexual abuse she claims to have suffered at the hands of her father.<ref>[https://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124024&page=1#.UXmnrCnn_IU Anne Heche Is Pregnant]. ''[[ABC News]]'' (September 6, 2001)</ref> In her 2001 memoir, ''Call Me Crazy'', Heche wrote that when she contracted genital [[herpes]] as an infant, her mother insisted that it was a diaper rash and refused to take her to the doctor.<ref>{{cite book|first=Anne|last=Heche|title=Call Me Crazy|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|location=New York City|date= 2001|isbn=978-0743424417|page=55}}</ref> Nancy was outraged by her daughter's allegations, responding, "I am trying to find a place for myself in this writing, a place where I as Anne's mother do not feel violated or scandalized." She added, "I find no place among the lies and blasphemies in the pages of this book."<ref name="Heche's Mother, Sister Are Outraged">{{cite web|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman|authorlink=Stephen M.

Heche's sister, Abigail, a jewelry designer,<ref>{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Kessler|url=http://www.thebeachcoast.com/issues/2011/november-2011/folk-art-and-fascinators.html |title=Folk Art and Fascinators |website=TheBeachCoast.com|publisher=Scribes Ink Publishing|location=Lakeside, Michigan|date=November 2011|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130203172146/http://www.thebeachcoast.com/issues/2011/november-2011/folk-art-and-fascinators.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref> added, "It is my opinion that my sister Anne truly believes, at this moment, what she has asserted about our father's past behavior; however, at the same time, I would like to point out that Anne, in the past, has expressed doubts herself about the accuracy of such memories." She said, "Based on my experience and her own expressed doubts, I believe that her memories regarding our father are untrue. And I can state emphatically, regardless of Anne's beliefs, that the assertion that our mother knew about such behavior is absolutely false."<ref name="Heche's Mother, Sister Are Outraged"/>

Nancy has denied Heche's allegation that her brother Nathan committed suicide: "I have talked to his youth pastor, and he said that Nathan was committed to the Lord, he loved Jesus, and I do not believe that that was suicide, but the death of his father from homosexuality three months earlier could certainly have stirred up a lot of confusion for him."<ref name="Nancy Heche"/>

Since her husband's death from [[AIDS]], Nancy has been a Christian therapist and motivational speaker, who lectures on behalf of [[James Dobson]]'s [[Focus on the Family]] about "overcoming homosexuality".<ref name="Anne Heche Is Playing It Normal Now"/> In 2009, Anne Heche told ''The New York Times'':{{quote|My mother's had a very tragic life. Three of her five children are dead, and her husband is dead. That she is attempting to change gay people into straight people is, in my opinion, a way to keep the pain of the truth out. People wonder why I am so forthcoming with the truths that have happened in my life, and it's because the lies that I have been surrounded with and the denial that I was raised in, for better or worse, bore a child of truth and love. My mother preaches to this day the opposite of that core of my life. It is no mistake that she still stands up against love. And one wonders why I'm not rushing to have her meet my children.<ref name="Anne Heche Is Playing It Normal Now"/>}}

In 2011, Heche told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that she doubts she will be able to ever repair her relationship with her mother.<ref name="Anne Heche: There was no joy in my family"/>
