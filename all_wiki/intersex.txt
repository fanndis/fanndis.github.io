According to World Health Organization:
Intersex is defined as a congenital anomaly of the reproductive and sexual system. An estimate about the birth prevalence of intersex is difficult to make because there are no concrete parameters to the definition of intersex.

In biological terms, [[biological sex|sex]] may be determined by a number of factors present at birth, including:<ref name="KnoxSchacht2011">Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline.

* the type of [[gonad]]s—ovaries or testicles,

* the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]] in females), and

People whose characteristics are not either all typically male or all typically female at birth are intersex.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex |title=What is intersex? |publisher=Intersex Society of North America |accessdate=18 November 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110143819/http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex |archive-date=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Some intersex traits are not always visible at birth; some babies may be born with ambiguous genitals, while others may have ambiguous internal organs (testes and ovaries). Others will not become aware that they are intersex unless they receive genetic testing, because it does not manifest in their phenotype.

During the [[Victorian era]], medical authors introduced the terms "[[true hermaphrodite]]" for an individual who has both ovarian and testicular tissue, "male pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with testicular tissue, but either female or ambiguous sexual anatomy, and "female pseudo-hermaphrodite" for a person with ovarian tissue, but either male or ambiguous sexual anatomy. Some later shifts in terminology have reflected advances in genetics, while other shifts are suggested to be due to pejorative associations.<ref name="cabral2014" />

{{further|Intersex rights by country}}
Human rights institutions are placing increasing scrutiny on harmful practices and issues of discrimination against intersex people. These issues have been addressed by a rapidly increasing number of international institutions including, in 2015, the Council of Europe, the United Nations [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[World Health Organization]]. These developments have been accompanied by [[International Intersex Forum]]s and increased cooperation amongst civil society organizations. However, the implementation, codification, and enforcement of intersex human rights in national legal systems remains slow.

A [[hermaphrodite]] is an organism that has both male and female reproductive organs. Until the mid-20th century, "hermaphrodite" was used synonymously with "intersex".<ref name="Cawadias, A.

Currently, hermaphroditism is not to be confused with intersex, as the former refers only to a specific phenotypical presentation of sex organs and the latter to a more complex combination of phenotypical and genotypical presentation. Using ''hermaphrodite'' to refer to intersex individuals is considered to be stigmatizing and misleading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |title=Is a person who is intersex a hermaphrodite? &#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |accessdate=5 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701061246/http://www.isna.org/faq/hermaphrodite |archive-date=1 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> ''Hermaphrodite'' is used for animal and plant species in which the possession of both ovaries and testes is either serial or concurrent, and for living organisms without such gonads but present binary form of reproduction, which is part of the typical life history of those species; ''intersex'' has come to be used when this is not the case.

Of the 1.7%, 1.5 percentage points (88% of those considered intersex in this figure) consist of individuals with [[late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (LOCAH). [[Leonard Sax]] stated that "[f]rom a clinician’s perspective, however, LOCAH is not an intersex condition."<ref name=sax/>

The figure of 1.7% is still maintained by Intersex Human Rights Australia "despite its flaws".<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://ihra.org.au/16601/intersex-numbers/| title=Intersex population figures| date=2013-09-28| access-date=19 September 2018| archive-date=17 July 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717183724/https://ihra.org.au/16601/intersex-numbers/| url-status=live}}</ref> "This estimate relates to any 'individual who deviates from the Platonic ideal of physical dimorphism at the chromosomal, genital, gonadal, or hormonal levels' and thus it encapsulates the entire population of people who are stigmatized – or risk stigmatization – due to innate sex characteristics."

Individuals with diagnoses of [[disorders of sex development]] (DSD) may or may not experience stigma and discrimination due to their sex characteristics, including sex "normalizing" interventions.  Human rights institutions have called for the de-medicalization of intersex traits, as far as possible.<ref name="SenateOnSterilisation" /><ref name="coe" /><ref name="fra" /><ref name="iachr" />

The common pathway of [[sexual differentiation]], where a productive human female has an XX chromosome pair, and a productive male has an XY pair, is relevant to the development of intersex conditions.

During fertilization, the sperm adds either an X (female) or a Y (male) chromosome to the X in the ovum. This determines the genetic sex of the embryo.<ref name="Kolodny">{{Cite book|title=Textbook of Sexual Medicine|last1=Kolodny|first1=Robert C.|last2=Masters|first2=William H.|last3=Johnson|first3=Virginia E.|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1979|isbn=978-0-316-50154-5|edition=1st|location=Boston|author2-link=William Masters|author3-link=Virginia E. Johnson|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/textbookofsexual00kolo}}</ref> During the first weeks of development, genetic male and female fetuses are "anatomically indistinguishable", with primitive gonads beginning to develop during approximately the sixth week of gestation. The gonads, in a "bipotential state", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name="Kolodny" /> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.

At around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In typical female differentiation, the [[Müllerian duct|Müllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.
In males, the Müllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name="Kolodny" />
By birth, the typical fetus has been completely "sexed" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.

===Signs===
There are a variety of symptoms that can occur. Ambiguous genitalia being the most common sign, there can be [[micropenis]], [[clitoromegaly]], partial [[labial fusion]], electrolyte abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, unexpected changes at puberty, hypospadias, labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls and  [[undescended testes]] (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys.<ref name=":0"/>

====Ambiguous genitalia====

Ambiguous genitalia may appear as a large [[clitoris]] or as a small penis.
[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]
Because there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline ("[[hypospadic]]"), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.

==== Measurement systems for ambiguous genitalia ====
The [[orchidometer]] is a medical instrument to measure the volume of the testicles. It was developed by Swiss pediatric endocrinologist [[Andrea Prader]]. The [[Prader scale]]<ref name=MDPRAD>{{Cite news| last1 =  Diamond| first1 =  Milton| last2 =  Linda| first2 =  Watson| author-link1 =  Milton Diamond| title =  Androgen insensitivity syndrome and Klinefelter's syndrome: sex and gender considerations| periodical =  Child Adolesc Psychiatric Clin N Am| year =  2004| issue =  13| pages =  623–640| url =  http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2004-ais-and-klinefelters.html| url-status =  live| archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20130701141723/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2004-ais-and-klinefelters.html| archive-date =  1 July 2013| df =  dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Quigley scale]] are visual rating systems that measure genital appearance.

==== Other signs ====

In order to help in classification, methods other than a genitalia inspection can be performed. For instance, a [[karyotype]] display of a tissue sample may determine which of the causes of intersex is prevalent in the case. Additionally, electrolyte tests, endoscopic exam, ultrasound and hormone stimulation tests can be done.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82PGmX_eM8sC&q=intersex+treatment&pg=PA476|title=Health Care Ethics in Canada|last1=Baylis|first1=Françoise|last2=Borgerson|first2=Kirstin|last3=Hoffmaster|first3=Barry|last4=Sherwin|first4=Susan|date=2011-10-06|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780176504649|access-date=28 May 2020|archive-date=29 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200829030154/https://books.google.com/books?id=82PGmX_eM8sC&pg=PA476&dq=intersex+treatment#v=onepage|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Causes===

Intersex can be divided into four categories which are: 46, XX intersex; 46, XY intersex; true gonadal intersex; and complex or undetermined intersex.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

====46, XX intersex====

This condition used to be called "female [[pseudohermaphroditism]]". Persons with this condition have female internal genitalia and karyotype (XX) and various degree of external genitalia [[virilization]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kamijo|first1=H.|last2=Narita|first2=O.|date=November 1997|title=[Female pseudohermaphroditism]|journal=Nihon Rinsho.

The [[labia]] fuse, and the [[clitoris]] enlarges to appear like a penis. The causes of this can be male hormones taken during pregnancy, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, male-hormone-producing tumors in the mother and [[aromatase deficiency]].<ref name=":0" />

====46, XY intersex====

This condition used to be called "male pseudohermaphroditism". This is defined as incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Migeon|first=C.

====True gonadal intersex====

This condition used to be called "[[true hermaphroditism]]". This is defined as having asymmetrical gonads with ovarian and testicular differentiation on either sides separately or combined as ovotestis.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Iqbal|first1=Muhammad Zafar|last2=Jam|first2=Mazhar Rafee|last3=Saleem|first3=Muhammad|last4=Ahmad|first4=Mushtaq|date=2011-07-30|title=True Hermaphrodite: A Case Report|journal=APSP Journal of Case Reports|volume=2|issue=2|pages=16|issn=2218-8185|pmc=3418019|pmid=22953283}}</ref>  In most cases, the cause of this condition is unknown; however, some research has linked it to exposure to common agricultural [[pesticide]]s.<ref name=":1" />

====Complex or undetermined intersex====

This is the condition of having any chromosome configurations rather than 46, XX or 46, XY intersex.<ref name=":0" /> This condition does not result in any imbalance between internal and external genitalia.<ref name=":0" /> However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels, overall sexual development, and altered numbers of sex chromosomes.<ref name=":0" />

=== Conditions ===
{{further|Disorders of sex development}}
There are a variety of opinions on what conditions or traits are and are not intersex, dependent on the definition of intersex that is used. Current human rights based definitions stress a broad diversity of sex characteristics that differ from expectations for male or female bodies.<ref name="unfe-fact" /> During 2015, the [[Council of Europe]],<ref name="coe" /> the [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]]<ref name="fra" /> and [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]]<ref name="iachr" /> have called for a review of medical classifications on the basis that they presently [[Intersex human rights|impede enjoyment of the right to health]]; the Council of Europe expressed concern that "the gap between the expectations of human rights organisations of intersex people and the development of medical classifications has possibly widened over the past decade".<ref name="coe" /><ref name="fra">{{Citation| last = European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights| title = The fundamental rights situation of intersex people| date = April 2015| url = http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-focus-04-intersex.pdf| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305072423/http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-focus-04-intersex.pdf| archive-date = 5 March 2016| df = dmy-all| access-date = 3 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="iachr">{{Citation| publisher = Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos| last = Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos| title = Violencia contra Personas Lesbianas, Gays, Bisexuales, Trans e Intersex en América| date = 12 November 2015| url = http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf| language = es| url-status=live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160107143635/http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/informes/pdfs/ViolenciaPersonasLGBTI.pdf| archive-date = 7 January 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

===Rationales===

Medical interventions take place to address physical health concerns and psychosocial risks. Both types of rationale are the subject of debate, particularly as the consequences of surgical (and many hormonal) interventions are lifelong and irreversible. Questions regarding physical health include accurately assessing risk levels, necessity, and timing. Psychosocial rationales are particularly susceptible to questions of necessity as they reflect social and cultural concerns.

There remains no clinical consensus about an evidence base, surgical timing, necessity, type of surgical intervention, and degree of difference warranting intervention.<ref name="2016dsd">{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1159/000442975| pmid = 26820577| issn = 1663-2818| volume = 85| issue = 3| last1 = Lee| first1 = Peter A.| last2 = Nordenström| first2 = Anna| last3 = Houk| first3 = Christopher P.| last4 = Ahmed| first4 = S.

===Types===
* '''Feminizing and masculinizing surgeries''': Surgical procedures depend on diagnosis, and there is often concern as to whether surgery should be performed at all. Typically, surgery is performed shortly after birth. Defenders of the practice argue that it is necessary for individuals to be clearly identified as male or female in order for them to function socially and develop "normally". Psychosocial reasons are often stated.<ref name="lee" /> This is criticised by many human rights institutions, and authors. Unlike other aesthetic surgical procedures performed on infants, such as corrective surgery for a [[cleft lip]], genital surgery may lead to negative consequences for sexual functioning in later life, or feelings of freakishness and unacceptability.<ref name="ISNA4">Intersex Society of North America (24 May 2006).
