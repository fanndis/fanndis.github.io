The '''George Foster Peabody Awards''' (or simply '''Peabody Awards''' or the '''Peabodys'''<ref name="dailycourier" />) program, named for the American businessman and philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody|George Peabody]], honor the most powerful, enlightening, and invigorating stories in television, radio, and online media. Programs are recognized in seven categories: news, entertainment, documentaries, children's programming, education, interactive programming, and public service. Peabody Award winners include [[radio]] and [[television stations]], networks, online media, producing organizations, and individuals from around the world.

Established in 1940 by a committee of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], the Peabody Award was created to honor excellence in radio broadcasting. It is the oldest major electronic media award in the United States. Final Peabody Award winners are selected unanimously by the program's Board of Jurors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/about#judging |title=Peabody; Who We Are|author=Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication|accessdate=2017-09-18}}</ref>
Reflecting excellence in quality storytelling, rather than popularity or commercial success, Peabody Awards are distributed annually to 30 out of 60 finalists culled from more than 1,000 entries.<ref name="Shearer">{{cite web |first=Lee |last=Shearer |url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/032701/uga_0327010006.shtml |title=UGA names new Peabody director |work=[[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date=2001-03-27 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605141124/http://onlineathens.com/stories/032701/uga_0327010006.shtml |archivedate=2013-06-05 }}</ref><ref name="dailycourier">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0UwLAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,4207961&dq=peabody-award+television+1948&hl=en |work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]] |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |first=Frazier |last=Moore |authorlink=Frazier Moore |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Emmys over?

==History==
In 1938, the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] formed a committee to recognize outstanding achievement in [[radio broadcasting]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQ1SAAAAIBAJ&pg=2642,2766145&dq=1939+national+association+of+broadcasters+peabody&hl=en |work=[[The Albany Herald]] |date=1989-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Broadcasters Honor Rusk}}</ref> Committee member Lambdin Kay, public-service director for [[WSB (AM)|WSB radio]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], Georgia, at the time, is credited with creating the award, named for businessman and philanthropist [[George Foster Peabody]], who donated the funds that made the awards possible.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Radio: New Order of Merit |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765429,00.html |journal=[[TIME]] |publisher=Time Inc. |date=7 April 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2009}} {{Subscription required|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref name="thestreet">{{cite news |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11048680/60-minutes-journalist-to-deliver-ugas-peabody-smithgall-lecture.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630102916/http://www.thestreet.com/story/11048680/60-minutes-journalist-to-deliver-ugas-peabody-smithgall-lecture.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-06-30 |title=60 Minutes Journalist To Deliver UGA's Peabody-Smithgall Lecture |publisher=[[TheStreet.com]] |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}</ref> Fellow WSB employee Lessie Smithgall introduced Lambdin to John E.

The Peabody Awards were originally issued only for [[radio]] programming, but [[television]] awards were introduced in 1948. In the late 1990s additional categories for material distributed via the [[World Wide Web]] were added.<ref name="dailycourier"/> Materials created solely for theatrical [[motion picture]] release are not eligible.

==Peabody judging==
The Peabody Awards judging process is unusually rigorous.<ref name="variety"/> Each year, more than 1,000 entries are evaluated by some 30 committees composed of a number of faculty, staff, and students from the [[University of Georgia]] and other higher education institutions across the country.<ref name="thecitizen">{{cite web |first=Lance |last=Cummins |url=http://www.thecitizen.com/archive/main/archive-040317/weekend/w-07.html |title=Local student to judge Peabodys |publisher=TheCitizen |date=2004-03-17 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155611/http://www.thecitizen.com/archive/main/archive-040317/weekend/w-07.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}</ref> Each committee is charged with screening or listening to a small number of entries and delivering written recommendations to the [[The George Foster Peabody Awards Board of Jurors|Peabody Board of Jurors]], a ~17-member panel of scholars, critics, and media-industry professionals.<ref name="thecitizen"/> [[The George Foster Peabody Awards Board of Jurors|Board members]] discuss recommended entries as well as their own selections at intensive preliminary meetings in California and Texas. The Board convenes at the [[University of Georgia]] in early April for final screenings and deliberations. Each entrant is judged on its own merit, and only unanimously selected programs receive a Peabody Award.<ref name="variety"/> For many years, there was no set number of awards issued. However, in 2016 the program instituted the Peabody 30, representing the best programs out of a field of 60 nominees. Prior to this, the all-time record for Peabody Award recipients in a single year was 46 in 2013.<ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/75244/peabody-hands-out-a-record-46-awards "Peabody Hands Out A Record 46 Awards,"] from TVNewsCheck, 4/2/2014</ref>

==Peabody Awards Archive==
The Peabody Awards Collection is the flagship of The Walter J. Brown Media Archive & Peabody Awards Collection. The archives are housed in the Richard B. Russell Building Special Collections Libraries on the north campus of [[The University of Georgia]]. The mission of the Peabody Archive is to preserve, protect, and provide access to the moving image and sound materials that reflect the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and its people. The collection contains nearly every entry for the first major broadcast award given in the [[United States]]. Entries began in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and at least 1,000 new entries are received every year—programs created by local, national, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children's programming. Once judging is complete, all entries are moved to the Main Library for in-depth cataloging, access, and long-term preservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libs.uga.edu/media/about/history.html|title=History :: UGA Libraries Walter J.
