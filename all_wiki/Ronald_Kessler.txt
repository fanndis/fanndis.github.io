Kessler's book, ''The FBI: Inside the World's Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency'', led to the dismissal by President Clinton of [[William S. Sessions]] as [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI director]] over his abuses. According to ''The Washington Post'', "A Justice Department official ... noted that the original charges against Sessions came not from FBI agents but from a journalist, Ronald Kessler [who uncovered the abuses while writing a book about the FBI, leading to Sessions' dismissal by President Clinton] ..."<ref>''The Washington Post'', June 19, 1993, page A1; ''The Washington Post'', July 20, 1993, page A1.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said Kessler's FBI book "did indeed trigger bureau and Justice Department investigations into alleged travel and expense abuses [by FBI Director William Sessions, leading to his departure] ...<ref>{{cite news |first=John|last=MacKenzie|title=How the G-Men Measure Up Now|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/12/books/how-the-g-men-measure-up-now.html|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 12, 1993}}</ref>

In his book ''The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI,'' Kessler presented the first credible evidence that [[Bob Woodward|Bob Woodward's]] and [[Carl Bernstein|Carl Bernstein's]] [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] source dubbed [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] was FBI official [[W. Mark Felt]]. The book said that Woodward paid a secret visit to Felt in California and had his limousine park ten blocks away from Felt's home and walked to it so as not to attract attention.<ref>''The Washington Times'', June 2, 2005, page A11; ''[[New York Post]]'', June 3, 2005, page 14; ''The Washington Post'', December 20, 2008, page A1.</ref> ''The New York Times'' said the book offers an "understanding of the institution's history, as well as an account of what it is like to be on the inside ...

Kessler's book, ''In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes With Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect'', was described by ''USA Today'' as a "fascinating exposé ... high-energy read ... amusing, saucy, often disturbing anecdotes about the VIPs the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] has protected and still protects ...

On April 14, 2012, Kessler broke the story that the Secret Service had removed and sent home agents assigned to protect President Obama during his trip to Cartagena, Colombia, because they had been involved in hiring prostitutes there.<ref>''The Washington Post'', April 14, 2012, page A18</ref>

Kessler's book ''The Secrets of the FBI'' presents revelations about the Russian spy swap, Marilyn Monroe's death, Vince Foster's suicide, the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, and J.

For the first time, it tells how the FBI caught spy Robert Hanssen in its midst and how secret teams of FBI agents break into homes, offices, and embassies to plant bugging devices without getting caught and shot as burglars.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/02/138916011/home-visits-and-other-secrets-of-the-fbi|title=Home Visits And Other Secrets Of The FBI|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite press release|title=The Secrets of the FBI by Ronald Kessler|url=http://crownpublishing.com/2011/08/01/press-release-the-secrets-of-the-fbi-by-ronald-kessler/|date=August 1, 2011|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=FBI secret ops help prevent new 9/11: Author|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/02/earlyshow/main20086778.shtml|date=August 2, 2011|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}</ref>

On November 9, 2012, Kessler broke the story that an FBI investigation led to the resignation of David H. Petraeus as CIA director. The concern was that Petraeus had put himself in a compromised position, opening himself to potential blackmail by foreign intelligence services.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Newsmax]]|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|date=November 9, 2012 |accessdate= November 11, 2012|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/petraeus-resigns-cia-affair/2012/11/09/id/463573|title=FBI Investigation Led to Petraeus Resignation}}</ref> Kessler's subsequent story on Nov 11 said an FBI source had told him on Oct 10 that agents on the case were outraged because they were told by senior officials that the FBI was going to hold their findings in limbo until after the election, when Petraeus would be told to resign. The day after the election, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of National Intelligence, told the CIA director to resign.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Newsmax]]|first=Ronald|last=Kessler|date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate= November 14, 2012|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/petraeus-affair-fbi-investigation/2012/11/11/id/463697

===Criticism===
Kessler's writings have been criticized in publications such as ''The Washington Post'' and ''The Week'' for overt partisanship and a lack of journalistic rigor.

{{quote|Every book ever written has mistakes. But experts are supposed to get the main things right, and reporters generally follow through when someone tells them something. Too often, Kessler seems to have listened to his sources, written their words down, and then simply printed as fact their allegations or observations without checking on them.|Marc Ambinder|''The Week'', August 6, 2014}}

In a note to ''The Week'', Kessler disputed charges of inaccuracy, including uncertainty over whether then-Vice President Joe Biden had spent a million dollars of taxpayer funds to take personal trips on Air Force Two back and forth between Washington and his home in Wilmington. The publication agreed to update Ambinder's article, saying that "... author Ronald Kessler provided ''The Week'' with documentation from the Air Force about Vice President Biden's travel" and linked to the Air Force's letter responding to Kessler's Freedom of Information Act request with the official record of Biden's flights back and forth between Washington and Wilmington with their cost as listed in Kessler's book ''The First Family Detail''.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Week]]|title=The Weird Inaccuracies In Ronald Kesslers New Book On The Secret Service|accessdate=August 31, 2014 |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/265890/the-weird-inaccuracies-in-ronald-kesslers-new-book-on-the-secret-service}}</ref>

Noting Kessler's extraordinary access to the then Secret Service Director, Mark Sullivan, during the writing of ''In The President's Secret Service'', [[James Bamford]] wrote in a review in ''The Washington Post'' that:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/21/AR2009082101668.html|title=James Bamford Reviews Ronald Kessler's 'In the President's Secret Service'|work=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

{{quote|... in light of an odd decision by the current director, Mark Sullivan, the motto should be changed to "Have You Heard This One?" During the Bush administration, hoping for some good, ego-enhancing publicity, Sullivan broke with his agency's long-standing policy of absolute silence and allowed Ronald Kessler to get an earful. The chief Washington correspondent for Newsmax.com, which bills itself as "the #1 conservative news agency online," Kessler had written very positive books about CIA Director George Tenet, first lady Laura Bush and President George W. Bush, and Sullivan was probably hoping for the same treatment.

Hearing that Sullivan had given Kessler his blessing, scores of current and former agents -- Kessler claims more than 100 -- agreed to talk to him. But rather than use that wealth of information to write a serious book examining the inner workings of the long-veiled agency or the new challenges of protecting the first black president, the author simply milked the agents for the juiciest gossip he could get and mixed it with a rambling list of their complaints.|James Bamford|''The Washington Post'', August 23, 2009}}

However, in reviewing Kessler's book ''In the President's Secret Service'', FactCheck.org said, "His [Kessler's] book quotes both flattering and unflattering observations about presidents of both parties."<ref name="Kessler"/>

A September 30, 2014 ''Politico'' piece by Kessler on Secret Service blunders, including allowing a knife-wielding intruder to race into the White House and failing to detect gun shots at the White House until four days later,<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Politico Magazine]]|title=Obamas Life Is At Risk|accessdate=October 1, 2014|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/09/obamas-life-is-at-risk-111501_Page2.html#.VCwGQvldWAh}}</ref> was criticized by Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo for allegedly implying that because he had not taken steps to correct the problems within the agency by replacing the director, President Obama would be at fault if the Secret Service's security breakdowns led to his own assassination.<ref>{{cite news|title=Really Politico|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=October 1, 2014|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/really-politico}}</ref> A subsequent editor's note called that a misinterpretation. The reference in question said, "Agents tell me that it's a miracle an assassination has not already occurred. Sadly, given Obama's colossal lack of management judgment, that calamity may be the only catalyst that will reform the Secret Service."

According to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report on CIA torture and the report itself as reported in ''The New York Times'', Kessler's book, ''The CIA at War'', "included inaccurate claims about the effectiveness of CIA interrogations" provided by the CIA to Kessler and ''New York Times'' reporter Douglas Jehl, such as the claim that the arrests of terrorist suspects were based on information from interrogations of other terrorists under torture. The report said this rationale was used to justify the use of torture.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-document.html#p430 The Senate Committee’s Report on the CIA’s Use of Torture], ''The New York Times'' December 9, 2014</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-key-points.html 7 Key Points From the C.I.A. Torture Report], By JEREMY ASHKENAS, HANNAH FAIRFIELD, JOSH KELLER and PAUL VOLPE, ''The New York Times'', December 9, 2014</ref> In a comment to ''The New York Times'', Kessler said he corroborated what he was told with the FBI, and he called the Senate report discredited because it was written only by Democratic lawmakers and did not include interviews with many of the main players.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/09/world/cia-torture-report-key-points.html]</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/us/politics/report-says-cia-used-media-leaks-to-advantage.html</ref> Subsequently, [[John O.
