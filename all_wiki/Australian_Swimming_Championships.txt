The '''Australian Swimming Championships''' is the national [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] championships for [[Australia]]. They are organised by [[Swimming Australia]] and separate championships are held annually in both [[long course]] (50m) and [[short course]] (25m) pools. The two meets are the country's top domestic meet for their respective course.

The meet usually also double as a selection event for international competitions such as the: [[Olympic Games|Olympics]], [[Paralympics]], [[FINA World Aquatics Championships|World Championships]], [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Pan Pacific Swimming Championships|Pan Pacific Championships]]. Some consider the meet the second-toughest domestic competition in the world, behind the USA's [[United States Swimming National Championships|national championships]].

The first edition of the championships was held in Sydney in January 1896 with events at the Natatorium, Sutherland Dock (Cockatoo Island) and on the Hawkesbury River.

The state that wins the most points at the championships is awarded the Kieran Shield, named in memory of [[Barney Kieran|Barney B. Kieran]], a swimmer from New South Wales, who was a world record holder, and who died, aged 18, in 1905.<ref>{{Cite web | last =Fletcher | first =Russell | title =1904-1905 - Membership 86. | work =Melbourne Collegians Water Polo Club Inc. - A History - 1894-1994 - The Beginning | publisher =Melbourne Collegians Water Polo Club Inc. | url =http://www.mcwaterpolo.com/about/2_THE_BEGINNING.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =19 July 2011 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120327213146/http://www.mcwaterpolo.com/about/2_THE_BEGINNING.pdf | archive-date =27 March 2012 | url-status =dead }}</ref>
