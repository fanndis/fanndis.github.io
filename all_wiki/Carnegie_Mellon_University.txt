== Institutional formation ==
[[File:Andrew Carnegie, three-quarter length portrait, seated, facing slightly left, 1913.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Andrew Carnegie, founder of the Carnegie Technical Schools]]
The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in [[Pittsburgh]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Committee on Education, United States House of Prepresentatives|title=Charges Against the Federal Board for Vocational Education, Volume 3|date=1920|publisher=Government Printing Office|location=Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTsXAAAAYAAJ&q=clifford%20b%20connelley&pg=PA1805|access-date=June 25, 2015}}</ref> by the [[Scottish American]] industrialist and philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]], who wrote the time-honored words "My heart is in the work", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers (many of whom worked in his mills). Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] founded by industrialist [[Charles Pratt]] in 1887.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&dat=19020116&id=zZ4-AAAAIBAJ&pg=3973,2142724|title=Boston Evening Transcript – Google News Archive Search|work=google.com|access-date=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512201902/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&dat=19020116&id=zZ4-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=R1oMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3973,2142724|archive-date=May 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the [[Margaret Morrison Carnegie College|Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women]].

The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers [[Andrew Mellon]] (who went on to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]]) and [[Richard B. Mellon]] in honor of their father, [[Thomas Mellon]], patriarch of the [[Mellon family]]. The Institute began as a research organization which performed work for government and industry on a contract and was initially established as a department within the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1927, the Mellon Institute incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed and it moved to its new, and current, location on Fifth Avenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/mellon-institute.html|title=Mellon Institute at Carnegie Mellon University National Historic Chemical Landmark|website=American Chemical Society|language=en|access-date=2019-07-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202539/https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/mellon-institute.html|archive-date=November 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1967, with support from [[Paul Mellon]], Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. Carnegie Mellon's coordinate [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, closed in 1973 and merged its academic programs with the rest of the university.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MMCC|url=http://www.carnegiemellontoday.com/article.asp?Aid=347|publisher=carnegiemellontoday.com|access-date=February 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221125329/http://www.carnegiemellontoday.com/article.asp?Aid=347|archive-date=February 21, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
[[File:AWMellon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Andrew Mellon]], co-founder of the Mellon Institute]] The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. CMRI closed in 2001 and its programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities.<ref>{{cite web|title=CMU closing its Carnegie Mellon Research Institute|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20010331cmuhealth2.asp|publisher=post-gazette.com|access-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214223/http://old.post-gazette.com/healthscience/20010331cmuhealth2.asp|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] and [[Squirrel Hill]] neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.

For decades the center of student life on campus was "''Skibo Hall''", the University's student union. Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical of [[Mid-Century Modern]] architecture, but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully wi-fi enabled. Known as ''University Center'', the building was dedicated in 1996. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon re-dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university, Jared Cohon.<ref>{{cite news|title=CMU student center to be renamed for Cohon|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/03/24/CMU-student-center-to-be-renamed-for-Cohon/stories/201403240210|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|year=2014|access-date=March 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326001925/http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2014/03/24/CMU-student-center-to-be-renamed-for-Cohon/stories/201403240210|archive-date=March 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

A large grassy area known as "the Cut" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as "the Mall" running perpendicular. The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building.

The northwestern part of the campus (home to Hamburg Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, and Gates Hillman Complex) was acquired from the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] in the 1980s.

In 2006, Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall sculpture [[Walking to the Sky]], which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Ave between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall. The sculpture was controversial for its placement, the general lack of input that the campus community had, and its (lack of) aesthetic appeal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tartan reflects on the people and events of 2005–2006|url=http://www.thetartan.org/2006/5/1/forum/thistles_and_thorns|publisher=The Tartan|year=2006|access-date=January 7, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114015946/http://www.thetartan.org/2006/5/1/forum/thistles_and_thorns|archive-date=January 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In April 2015, Carnegie Mellon University, in collaboration with [[Jones Lang LaSalle]], announced the planning of a second office space structure, alongside the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center, an upscale and full-service hotel, and retail and dining development along Forbes Avenue. This complex will connect to the Tepper Quadrangle, the Heinz College, the Tata Consultancy Services Building, and the Gates-Hillman Center to create an innovation corridor on the university campus. The effort is intended to continue to attract major corporate partnerships to create opportunities for research, teaching, and employment with students and faculty.<ref>{{cite news|title=CMU proposes hotel, office, retail complex to help remake Forbes Avenue|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2015/04/22/CMU-carnegie-mellon-university-plans-hotel-retail-development-as-part-of-innovation-corridor-pittsburgh/stories/201504220154|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|year=2015|access-date=April 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424191829/http://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2015/04/22/CMU-carnegie-mellon-university-plans-hotel-retail-development-as-part-of-innovation-corridor-pittsburgh/stories/201504220154|archive-date=April 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Campus architecture and design ===
The campus began to take shape in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style of [[Henry Hornbostel]], a winner of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of what is now the [[Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture]].

There was little change to the campus between the first and [[World War II|second World War]]. A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along [[Forbes Avenue]], but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts (former Graduate School of Industrial Administration) building (1952) and ending with Wean Hall (1971) saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the University's growing national reputation in [[artificial intelligence]], business, robotics and the arts. In addition, an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along [[Schenley Park]]. A ravine long known as "The Cut" was gradually filled in to campus level, joining "the Mall" as a major campus open space.

[[File:Carnegie Mellon Hamerschlag Hall and Scott Hall.jpg|thumb|left|Hamerschlag, Roberts, and Scott Halls are three of the teaching facilities of the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]]]
The buildings of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style. The [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new image. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of University President [[Richard Cyert]] (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly US$12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than US$110 million in the late 1980s. The work of researchers in new fields like [[robotics]] and [[software engineering]] helped the university to build on its reputation. One example of this approach was the introduction of the university's "[[Andrew Project|Andrew]]" computing network in the mid-1980s. This pioneering project, which linked all computers and workstations on campus, set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and research. On April 24, 1984, ''cmu.edu'', Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain became one of the first six [[.edu]] domain names.

Within the past two decades, the university has built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center), business school building (Posner Hall), student union and several dormitories. Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s (decade), and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after. Several computer science buildings, such as [[Newell Simon Hall]], also were established, renovated or renamed in the early 2000s (decade). The university has most recently completed building the Gates Hillman Complex and continues renovating historic academic and residence halls.

On April 15, 1997, [[Jared Cohon|Jared L. Cohon]], former dean of the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]], was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's Board of Trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. His strategic plan aimed to leverage the University's strengths to benefit society in the areas of [[biotechnology]] and [[life sciences]], information and security technology, [[environmental science]] and practices, the [[fine arts]] and [[humanities]], and business and [[policy|public policy]]. In 2006, following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier [[Mike Rann]], CMU opened a campus of the [[Heinz College]] in the historic [[Torrens Building]] in [[Adelaide]], Australia. President Cohon's term ended on June 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon.

On July 1, 2003, Carnegie Mellon launched "Insp!re Innovation", a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. Half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations. The campaign brought in a total of $1.19 billion, with $578.5 million going toward Carnegie Mellon's endowment. It also enabled the university to establish 31 endowed professorships, 97 endowed fellowships and 250 endowed scholarships.<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/campaign/about/index.html Inspire Innovation: About the Campaign – Carnegie Mellon Web Site.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130174202/http://www.cmu.edu/campaign/about/index.html |date=November 30, 2009 }}.

== Student life ==
Carnegie Mellon's student life includes over 400 student organizations, art galleries, and various unique traditions. Student organizations provide social, service, media, academic, spiritual, recreational, sport, religious, political, cultural, and governance opportunities. Carnegie Mellon's campus houses several galleries such as ''The Frame'', a student-devoted gallery, and the [[Regina Gouger Miller Gallery]], an art gallery that specializes in contemporary professional artists. The [[Carnegie Mellon School of Music]], [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] and the student-run theatrical organization [[Scotch'n'Soda]] provides campus with a variety of performance arts events. The university has a strong Scottish motif inspired by Andrew Carnegie's Scottish heritage, as well as the Mellon family's Scots-Irish ancestry. Examples include Scotty, the [[Scottish Terrier]] mascot, ''[[The Tartan (Carnegie Mellon University)|The Tartan]]'' student newspaper, [[Skibo Castle|Skibo]] Gymnasium, The [[Thistle]] yearbook, and the [[Céilidh]] weekend every fall semester for homecoming.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

=== Traditions ===
{{Main|Carnegie Mellon University traditions}}
[[File:The Fence at Carnegie Mellon University.jpg|thumb|right|The Fence]]
* '''The Fence''' – In the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge which connected Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence.The administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walking Tour|url=http://www.cmu.edu/walkingtour/|publisher=cmu.edu|access-date=February 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516000420/http://www.cmu.edu/walkingtour/|archive-date=May 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as "the Cut". Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may "take" the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6&nbsp;am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered "the world's most painted object," by the Guinness Book of World Records{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.
* '''Spring Carnival''' – Usually held in April, Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the school year. In addition to classic carnival attractions, the Spring Carnival features the "Buggy Sweepstakes" and "Booth" (a competition between various organizations to build small, elaborate booths based on a theme chosen each year).

[[File:CarnegieMellonBuggy.jpg|thumb|right|Two pushers exchange the buggy for [[Kappa Delta Rho]] on the first hill of Sweepstakes.]]
* '''Buggy Races''' – Buggy, officially called Sweepstakes, is a race around [[Schenley Park]]. It can be thought of as a relay race with five runners, using the buggy vehicle as the baton. Entrants submit a small, usually torpedo-shaped, vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhill. The vehicles are unpowered, including the prohibition of such energy-storing devices as flywheels. They are, however, steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone, arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanism. Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their heads.

[[File:mobot.jpg|thumb|right|A Mobot competing in the annual Mobot challenge]]
* '''Mobot''' – "Mobot,' a [[portmanteau]] for "mobile robot," is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 1994. In this event, robots try (autonomously) to pass through gates, in order, and reach the finish line. There is a white line on the pavement connecting the gates, and the line is normally used to find the gates, though it is not mandated by the rules that the robots follow the line.
* '''Bagpipers''' – As one of only a handful of colleges offering a bachelor's degree in [[bagpipe]] music and the only to offer a Masters, Carnegie Mellon University's Pipes and Drums features the sounds of Scottish bagpipes and performs at University events. Director of the Pipes and Drums is champion piper [[Andrew Carlisle]] from Northern Ireland, a highly decorated solo piper and longtime member of nine times World Pipe Band Champions Field Marshal Montgomery. The ensemble actively competes at Highland Games in Grade Three in the Eastern United States.
* '''The [[Carnegie Mellon University Kiltie Band|Kiltie Band]]'''- Carnegie Mellon's Kiltie Band, dressed in full Scottish regalia, including kilts and knee socks, performs during every home football game.
* '''Autographing the Green Room''' – Seniors in the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] sign the Green Room's walls and ceilings before leaving the university. Supposedly, Oscar-winning actress [[Holly Hunter]] broke university tradition by signing the Green Room during her freshman year. With the construction of the Purnell Center in 1998 the School of Drama no longer occupied the old Green Room, so this tradition has gone away.

=== Housing ===
Carnegie Mellon offers conventional housing for its students through single-gender, coeducational, and special interest options. Students can choose from a variety of housing options. The three options for first-year students are standard, prime, and apartment-style living. The Standard is a typical college dormitory setting, a long hallway with a series of double (two people to a room). Prime offers more privacy through suite-style rooms. Apartment-style living is available through the Residence on Fifth and Shirley apartments. Upperclassmen have additional options for housing, which include town houses and a larger variety of one or two bedroom apartments. There are 20 residential buildings on campus and five off campus in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh.<ref name="CMU Housing">{{cite web|title=CMU Housing|url=http://www.housing.cmu.edu/buildings/|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|access-date=July 26, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724042655/http://www.housing.cmu.edu/buildings/|archive-date=July 24, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

First-year students are assigned to the dedicated first-year residence halls on campus including: Morewood E-Tower, Residence on Fifth, Shirley Apartments, as well as Boss, Donner, Hamerschlag, McGill, Mudge, Scobell, and Stever houses. Approximately a third of upperclassmen choose to continue living on campus through university housing.

{{Main|Fraternities and sororities at Carnegie Mellon University}}
The Greek tradition at Carnegie Mellon University began over 100 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus, [[Theta Xi]], in 1912. The Panhellenic sorority community was founded in 1945, by [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]. The Chi Omega chapter at Carnegie Mellon transformed into an independent sorority, Zeta Psi Sigma, and has since become [[Alpha Chi Omega]]. The [[Alpha Phi]] chapter was created in April 2013. There is one Asian American interest sorority – [[alpha Kappa Delta Phi]] (colony), and one Asian American interest fraternity – [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]].

Currently, Carnegie Mellon University has thirteen active fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]] (colony), [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], and [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]].

In addition to participating in campus traditions such as Buggy and Booth, the fraternities and sororities hold an annual fundraiser called Greek Sing, one of the largest Greek events of the year. Each year, the organizations vote on a cause to support and raise money through ticket sales, ad sales, corporate sponsorships and donations. Each organization performs a 13-minute-long original show or a rendition of a popular show. In Spring 2010, Greek Sing raised over $42,000 for St. Jude Children's Research

[[File:Football at Carnegie Mellon.jpg|thumb|Football at Gesling Stadium.]]
On November 28, 1926, the 6–2 Carnegie Technical Institute football team shut out the undefeated [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] 19–0 at [[Forbes Field]]. Knute Rockne, the coach of the Irish at the time, was so confident that the Irish would defeat "tiny Carnegie Tech" that he decided to skip the game and travel to Chicago to watch the Army-Navy football game for scouting purposes. It was only later that he found out by telegram that the Irish had suffered their first loss of the season. ESPN compared the upset to the Appalachian State victory over the University of Michigan in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tech's Greatest Victory|url=http://www.carnegiemellontoday.com/article.asp?Aid=380|publisher=carnegiemellontoday.com|access-date=February 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317194853/http://www.carnegiemellontoday.com/article.asp?Aid=380|archive-date=March 17, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was ranked the fourth-greatest upset in [[college football]] history by [[ESPN]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Upset special: With Rockne gone, Irish took a Michigan-like tumble|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&id=3006504|publisher=sports.espn.go.com|access-date=February 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106053812/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&id=3006504|archive-date=November 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== CMU food pantry ===
In October 2017, Carnegie Mellon took part in a study conducted by the University of Pittsburgh's Office of Child Development that examined food insecurity among students. The results from the CMU survey demonstrated that 19% of student respondents felt some sense of food insecurity, which is defined by the study as "a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Blog/CMU-Pantry.html|title=Open for Business: CMU Pantry aims to reduce student food insecurity on campus - Student Government - Carnegie Mellon University|last=University|first=Carnegie Mellon|date=2018-11-08|website=www.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212190400/https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Blog/CMU-Pantry.html|archive-date=February 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> In an effort to address the need for food security, CMU opened the doors to an on-campus pantry on November 9, 2018.

The pantry gives visitors the opportunity to pick up non-perishables and fresh produce for their household free of charge every two weeks. The pantry is accessible to all graduate and undergraduate CMU students, and is located in the Residence on Fifth dormitory in Oakland.
