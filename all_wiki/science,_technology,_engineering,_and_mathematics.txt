{{short description|Group of academic disciplines}}
'''Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] ('''SMET'''),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education|title=STEM Education Curriculum|last=Hallinen|first=Judith|date=Oct 21, 2015|website=ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA}}</ref> is a broad term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].<ref name="fas.org">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.<ref name="fas.org"/> The ''science'' in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major [[branches of science]]: [[natural science]]s, including [[biology]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]]; and [[formal science]]s, of which [[mathematics]] is an example, along with [[logic]] and [[statistics]]. The third major branch of science, [[social science]] such as: [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]], are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with [[humanities]] and [[art]]s to form another counterpart [[acronym]] named [[Humanities, arts, and social sciences|HASS - Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences]]. [[Psychology]] however is considered a major part of STEM, besides the other 2 subjects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtu.edu/registrar/pdfs/core-and-hass-list-18-19-v2.pdf|title=Language, Thought, and Values}}</ref> In the United States/ United Kingdom education system, in [[elementary school|elementary]], [[middle school|middle]], and [[high school]]s, the term ''science'' refers primarily to the natural sciences, with mathematics being a standalone subject, and the social sciences are combined with the humanities under the umbrella term ''[[social studies]]''.

The change was, in part, instigated at an interagency meeting by Peter Faletra the director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists. The acronym was adopted by [[Rita Colwell]] and other science administrators in the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) in 2001. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF which was used by a variety of educators including Charles E. Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=The Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer & IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}</ref> In the early 1990s, CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.

=== China ===
To promote STEM in China, the Chinese government issued a guideline in 2016 on national innovation-driven development strategy, instructing that by 2020, China should become an innovative country; by 2030, it should be at the forefront of innovative countries; and by 2050, it should become a technology innovation power.

In February 2017, the Ministry of Education in China has announced to officially add STEM education into the primary school curriculum, which is the first official government recognition of STEM education. And later, in May 2018, the launching ceremony and press conference for the 2029 Action Plan for China's STEM Education was held in Beijing, China. This plan aims to allow as many students to benefit from STEM education as possible and equip all students with scientific thinking and the ability to innovate. In response to encouraging policies by the government, schools in both public and private sectors around the country have begun to carry out STEM education programs.

However, in order to effectively implement STEM curricula, full-time teachers specializing in STEM education and relevant contents to be taught are needed. At present, China lacks qualified STEM teachers and a training system is yet to be established.

=== Singapore ===
STEM is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) has been promoting since 2013, and currently, all secondary schools have such a programme. It is expected that by 2023, all primary schools in Singapore will have an ALP. There are no tests or exams for ALPs. The emphasis is for students to learn through experimentation – they try, fail, try, learn from it and try again. The MOE actively supports schools with ALPs to further enhance and strengthen their capabilities and programmes that nurtures innovation and creativity.

The Singapore Science Centre established a STEM unit in January 2014, dedicated to igniting students’ passion for STEM. To further enrich students’ learning experiences, their Industrial Partnership Programme (IPP) creates opportunities for students to get early exposure to the real-world STEM industries and careers. Curriculum specialists and STEM educators from the Science Centre will work hand-in-hand with teachers to co-develop STEM lessons, provide training to teachers and co-teach such lessons to provide students with an early exposure and develop their interest in STEM.

=== Thailand ===
In 2017, Thai Education Minister Dr Teerakiat Jareonsettasin said after the 49th Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) Council Conference in Jakarta that the meeting approved the establishment of two new SEAMEO regional centres in Thailand. One would be the STEM Education Centre, while the other would be a Sufficient Economy Learning Centre.

Teerakiat said that the Thai government had already allocated Bt250 million over five years for the new STEM centre. The centre will be the regional institution responsible for STEM education promotion. It will not only set up policies to improve STEM education, but it will also be the centre for information and experience sharing among the member countries and education experts. According to him, “This is the first SEAMEO regional centre for STEM education, as the existing science education centre in Malaysia only focuses on the academic perspective. Our STEM education centre will also prioritise the implementation and adaptation of science and technology.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seameo.org/Main_about/90|title=SEAMEO Secretariat|website=www.seameo.org|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

Thailand government schools have been hampered by budget, but those private international schools have done an outreach to secure training for their STEM teachers and have explored the conduct of such training using latest robotics technologies and coding - such as those offered by [http://sturiel.com/about-us/ St. Uriel Education].

The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology (IPST) has initiated a STEM Education Network whose objectives are to encourage integrated learning activities and enhance student creativity and application of knowledge in daily or professional life, and to establish a collaborative network of public and private organisations and personnel in promoting STEM education in Thailand.

This network includes the National STEM Education Centre, 13 Regional STEM Education Centres, which were founded last year, schools in the STEM Education Network and other supporting networks. Regional STEM Education Centres are located in large-scale secondary schools in selected provinces, each centre works as a hub of academic support for teachers and educational personnel in the region and disseminates the STEM education concept in its areas of responsibility. These centres also act as a co-ordinating agency linking IPST, local personnel and institutes in basic and higher education, as well as other public and private organisations.

Each of the 13 STEM Education Centres is a centre for six satellite schools in their locations: two primary schools, two secondary schools and two opportunity extension schools. In Bangkok, there are two centres: Bodindecha School and Samsenwittayalai School. The STEM Education Network also consists of subordinate networks and systems to support the operation of the major units. These include the Academic Mentor University Network, Supervisor Network, Academic Mentor Network, STEM Ambassador network, STEM Personnel Recognition Program and iSTEM Resource Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/456725/a-stem-education|title=A Stem education|last=Limited|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|website=https://www.bangkokpost.com|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sturiel.com/about-us/|title=Singapore STEM Robotics Coding Cultural Exchange Education Edutour|website=St. Uriel Education|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>

==== Education ====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}
 
STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

==== Gender gaps in STEM ====
Although women make up 47% of the workforce <ref>[https://www.commerce.gov/news/reports/2017/11/women-stem-2017-update "Women in STEM: 2017 Update"], U.S. Department of Commerce.</ref> in the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half.<ref>[http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/inventors_summary.pdf "Who Becomes an Inventor in America? The Importance of Exposure to Innovation"], Opportunity Insights.</ref> Campaigns from organizations like the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] aimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020.

==== American Competitiveness Initiative ====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}</ref>

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, beginning in 2012 many private education organizations have STEM education initiatives.

In 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Liên minh STEM organized the first National STEM day, followed by many similar events across the country.

in 2015, Ministry of Education and Training included STEM as an area needed to be encouraged in national school year program.

In May 2017, Prime Minister signed a Directive no. 16<ref>http://vanban.chinhphu.vn/portal/page/portal/chinhphu/hethongvanban?class_id=2&mode=detail&document_id=189610</ref> stating: "Dramatically change the policies, contents, education and vocational training methods to create a human resource capable of receiving new production technology trends, with a focus on promoting training in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), foreign languages, information technology in general education; " and asking "Ministry of Education and Training (to): Promote the deployment of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in general education program; Pilot organize in some high schools from 2017 to 2018.

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}</ref> In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archive-date=2014-10-18}}</ref> In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.<ref>{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}</ref>

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.<ref>{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}</ref>
