'''Acronym''' (styled '''ACRONYM''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[United States|American]] [[501(c)(4)]] [[non-profit]] corporation, co-founded by [[Tara McGowan]] and [[Michael Dubin]] in 2017. The organization is one of the major coordinators and producers of [[digital media]] campaigns aligned with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and has been hired by or has provided support to various other organizations including the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], [[Emily's List]], [[Everytown for Gun Safety]], and [[Planned Parenthood]].
