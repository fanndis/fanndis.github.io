== Political career ==
[[File:KAS-Gröhe, Hermann-Bild-13263-1.jpg|thumb|Hermann Gröhe on advertising of Jungen Union 1990]]
Gröhe was active member of ''[[Junge Union]] (JU)'' the youth organization of CDU which he joined as a schoolboy 1975. He led the JU as federal chairman from 1989 till 1994.

Becoming a member of CDU in 1977, Gröhe has been a member of the [[German Bundestag]] since the [[1994 German federal election|1994 elections]], representing the [[Neuss I]] constituency. Between 1998 and 2005, he was his parliamentary group's spokesperson on human rights and humanitarian aid. He subsequently served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 2005 until 2008.

From 2008 until 2009, Gröhe briefly served as Minister of State at the Federal Chancellery under Chancellor Angela Merkel. In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], he was a member of the working group on economic affairs and energy, led by [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] and [[Rainer Brüderle]].

===Secretary General of the CDU, 2009–2013===
As successor of [[Ronald Pofalla]], Gröhe was secretary general of the CDU 2009-2013;<ref name=cv/> serving as the campaign manager in the [[2013 German federal election|2013 elections]].<ref>[http://www.dw.de/introducing-the-new-german-cabinet/g-17297820 Introducing the new German cabinet: Party loyalist] Deutsche Welle. Retrieved 16 December 2013</ref> He was credited with marshalling [[Angela Merkel]]’s electoral victory that year, the party's best result since [[German reunification]] in [[1990 German federal election|1990]].<ref>Patrick Donahue (December 15, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-15/merkel-s-third-term-cabinet-social-democratic-party-ministers German Chancellor Merkel’s Third-Term Cabinet: List of Ministers] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] following the elections, Gröhe was part of the 15-member leadership circle chaired by Merkel, [[Horst Seehofer]] and [[Sigmar Gabriel]].

===Federal Minister of Health, 2013–2018===
Following the formation of the [[third Merkel cabinet|third cabinet]] of Chancellor Angela Merkel, Gröhe took office as [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]]. His deputies were Ingrid Fischbach and [[Annette Widmann-Mauz]].

In October 2014, Gröhe's elderly care reform bill, which is supposed to better fit the individual needs of those in care and expected to cost the government a further 1.2 billion euro ($1.5 billion), was passed by the Bundestag.<ref>Elizabeth Schumacher (October 17, 2014), [http://www.dw.de/germany-passes-elderly-care-reform-despite-oppositions-criticism/a-18002085 Germany passes elderly care reform despite opposition's criticism] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

In December 2014, Gröhe was surprisingly contested by [[Jens Spahn]] for a place on the CDU's ruling council, in a move that was widely seen as crystallizing the generational tensions within the party. Spahn's election bid was backed by the then 72-year-old finance minister, [[Wolfgang Schäuble]].<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (December 7, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/215aad24-7e17-11e4-b7c3-00144feabdc0.html Political upstart challenges Germany’s greying leaders] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Shortly before the vote at the annual CDU party conference, Gröhe withdrew his candidacy and Spahn was elected.<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (December 9, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ebaac9b8-7fc2-11e4-acf3-00144feabdc0.html Merkel eyes relief for German taxpayers] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

During his time in office, Gröhe also focused heavily on [[global health]] issues. Alongside his colleague [[Gerd Müller (politician)|Gerd Müller]], he travelled to [[Ghana]] and [[Liberia]] right after the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic]] in 2015.<ref>Daniel Tost (April 8, 2015), [http://www.euractiv.com/section/development-policy/news/german-ministers-visit-west-africa-with-lessons-from-ebola/ German ministers visit West Africa with ‘lessons from Ebola’] ''EurActiv''.</ref> That same year, he accompanied Merkel when she spoke at the opening of the annual [[World Health Assembly]] in Geneva on the need for reforming the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to ensure there is prompt response to health emergencies.<ref>Sarah Boseley (May 18, 2015), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/angela-merkel-plan-restructure-world-health-organisation Plan to reform WHO after Ebola to be unveiled by Angela Merkel] ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> As part of Germany's [[41st G7 summit|G7 presidency in 2015]], he brought together G7 Health Ministers to adopt a declaration addressing [[antimicrobial resistance]] (AMR).

In March 2016, Gröhe was appointed by [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] to the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth, which was co-chaired by presidents [[François Hollande]] of [[France]] and [[Jacob Zuma]] of [[South Africa]].<ref>[https://www.who.int/hrh/com-heeg/comm_heeg_commissioners/en/ High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth – Commissioners] [[World Health Organization]].</ref> He later led Germany's delegation to the [[2016 High Level Meeting on Ending AIDS]] in New York.

Ahead of the [[2017 German federal election|2017 elections]], Gröhe was elected to lead his party's campaign in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state.<ref>[http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/hermann-groehe-fuehrt-landesliste-der-nrw-cdu-zur-bundestagswahl-an-aid-1.6616991 Landesvertreterversammlung: Gröhe führt Landesliste der NRW-CDU zur Bundestagswahl an] ''[[Rheinische Post]]'', February 18, 2017.</ref> In the negotiations to form a [[Fourth Merkel cabinet|fourth]] coalition government under Merkel, he led the working group on health policy, alongside [[Malu Dreyer]] and [[Georg Nüßlein]].<ref>[https://www.cdu.de/artikel/mitglieder-der-cdu-den-koalitionsverhandlungen-mit-csu-und-spd Members of the Coalition Talks with CSU and SPD] CDU.</ref>
