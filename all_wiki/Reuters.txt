'''Reuters''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɔɪ|t|ər|z|audio=Reuters (spoken word).ogg}}) is an international [[news organization]] owned by [[Thomson Reuters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://agency.reuters.com/en/about-us.html |title=About us|website=Reuters Agency |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> It employs some 2,500 journalists and 600 [[photojournalist]]s in about 200 locations worldwide.<ref name=":0" /> 

The agency was established in [[London]] in 1851 by the German-born [[Paul Reuter]]. It was acquired by the [[Thomson Corporation]] in 2008 and now makes up the media division of Thomson Reuters.

==History==
===19th century===
[[Paul Reuter]] worked at a book-publishing firm in [[Berlin]] and was involved in distributing radical pamphlets at the beginning of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in 1848]]. These publications brought much attention to Reuter, who in 1850 developed a prototype news service in [[Aachen]] using [[homing pigeon]]s and electric [[telegraphy]] from 1851 on, in order to transmit messages between [[Brussels]] and Aachen,<ref name=britannica-r/> in what today is Aachen's Reuters House.

Reuter moved to [[London]] in 1851 and established a news wire agency at the [[Royal Exchange, London|London Royal Exchange]]. Headquartered in London, Reuter's company initially covered commercial news, serving banks, brokerage houses, and business firms.<ref name=britannica-r>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/500259/Reuters|title=Reuters (news agency)|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=26 March 2010|accessdate=3 November 2012}}</ref> The first newspaper client to subscribe was the London ''[[Morning Advertiser]]'' in 1858, and more began to subscribe soon after.<ref name=britannica-r/><ref name=morning-ad>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2d12iZkgOwC&pg=PA1366|title=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|first=Mark A. | last=Stevens|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|pages=1,366|isbn=978-0877790174|year=2001}}</ref> According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "the value of Reuters to newspapers lay not only in the financial news it provided but in its ability to be the first to report on stories of international importance."<ref name=britannica-r/> It was the first to report [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s assassination in [[Europe]], for instance, in 1865.<ref name=britannica-r/><ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/04/reuters.pressandpublishing|title=Reuters: a brief history|last=Allen|first=Katie|date=4 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=19 February 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011004608/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/04/reuters.pressandpublishing|archive-date=11 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1865, Reuter incorporated his private business, under the name Reuter's Telegram Company Limited; Reuter was appointed managing director of the company.<ref name="funding-universe">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/reuters-group-plc-history/|title=History of Reuters Group PLC|website=Funding Universe|accessdate=8 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1872, Reuter's expanded into the [[Far East]], followed by [[South America]] in 1874. Both expansions were made possible by advances in overland telegraphs and undersea cables.<ref name=guardian/> In 1878, Reuter retired as managing director, and was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Herbert de Reuter]].<ref name="funding-universe" /> In 1883, Reuter's began transmitting messages electrically to London newspapers.<ref name=guardian/>

===20th century===
[[File:Roderick Jones.jpg|thumb|Roderick Jones, general manager 1915–1941]]
Reuter's son [[Herbert de Reuter]] continued as general manager until his death by suicide in 1915. The company returned to private ownership in 1916, when all shares were purchased by [[Roderick Jones (1877–1962)|Roderick Jones]] and Mark Napier; they renamed the company "Reuters Limited", dropping the apostrophe.<ref name="funding-universe" /> In 1923, Reuters began using radio to transmit news internationally, a pioneering act.<ref name=guardian/> In 1925, the [[Press Association]] (PA) of [[Great Britain]] acquired a majority interest in Reuters, and full ownership some years later.<ref name=britannica-r/> During the world wars, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Reuters: "came under pressure from the British government to serve national interests. In 1941 Reuters deflected the pressure by restructuring itself as a private company." In 1945 Reuters was the first broadcasting company to broadcast news of [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s attempts to negotiate with the western allies through [[Count Bernadotte]], a Swedish nobleman. The new owners formed the Reuters Trust.<ref name=guardian/> In 1941, the PA sold half of Reuters to the Newspaper Proprietors' Association, and co-ownership was expanded in 1947 to associations that represented daily newspapers in [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].<ref name=britannica-r/> The Reuters Trust Principles were put in place to maintain the company's independence.<ref name=aboutus>{{cite web |url=http://thomsonreuters.com/about-us/company-history/ |title=Company History |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=7 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503234856/http://thomsonreuters.com/about-us/company-history/ |archive-date=3 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At that point, Reuters had become "one of the world's major news agencies, supplying both text and images to newspapers, other news agencies, and radio and television broadcasters."<ref name=britannica-r/> Also at that point, it directly or through national news agencies provided service "to most countries, reaching virtually all the world's leading newspapers and many thousands of smaller ones," according to ''Britannica''.<ref name=britannica-r/>

In 1961, Reuters scooped news of the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name=read/> Reuters was one of the first news agencies to transmit financial data over oceans via computers in the 1960s.<ref name=britannica-r/> In 1973, Reuters "began making computer-terminal displays of foreign-exchange rates available to clients."<ref name=britannica-r/> In 1981, Reuters began supporting electronic transactions on its computer network and afterwards developed a number of electronic brokerage and trading services.<ref name=britannica-r/> Reuters was floated as a public company in 1984,<ref name=read/> when Reuters Trust was listed on the [[stock exchange]]s<ref name=guardian/> such as the [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE) and [[NASDAQ]].<ref name=britannica-r/> Reuters later published the first story of the Berlin Wall being breached in 1989.<ref name="read">{{Cite book|title=The Power of News: The History of Reuters|last=Read|first=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0198207689|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198207689.001.0001}}</ref>

===21st century===
Reuters' share price grew during the [[dotcom boom]], then fell after the banking troubles in 2001.<ref name=guardian/> In 2002, ''Britannica'' wrote that most news throughout the world came from three major agencies: the [[Associated Press]], Reuters, and [[Agence France-Presse]].<ref name=britannica-two>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/news-agency#ref203528|title=News agency|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=23 August 2002|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> 

Until 2008, the Reuters news agency formed part of an independent company, [[Reuters Group|Reuters Group plc]]. Reuters merged with [[Thomson Corporation]] in Canada in 2008, forming Thomson Reuters.<ref name="britannica-r" /> In 2009, Thomson Reuters withdrew from the LSE and the NASDAQ, instead listing its shares on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] (TSX) and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE).<ref name="britannica-r" /> The last surviving member of the Reuters family founders, [[Marguerite, Baroness de Reuter]], died at age 96 on 25 January 2009.<ref name="abc">{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-26/baroness-de-reuter-last-link-to-news-dynasty-dies/2586782|title=Baroness de Reuter, last link to news dynasty, dies|date=26 January 2009|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=21 February 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627034038/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-26/baroness-de-reuter-last-link-to-news-dynasty-dies/2586782|archive-date=27 June 2018|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|agency=Reuters}}</ref> The parent company Thomson Reuters is headquartered in [[Toronto]], and provides financial information to clients while also maintaining its traditional news-agency business.<ref name="britannica-r" />

==Criticism and Controversies==

===Policy of objective language===
[[File:Reuters Building.jpg|thumb|Reuters building entrance in [[New York City]]]]
Reuters has a policy of taking a "value-neutral approach" which extends to not using the word ''terrorist'' in its stories. The practice attracted criticism following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="Moeller">{{Cite book|title=Reporting War: Journalism in Wartime|last=Moeller|first=Susan D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415339988|editor-last=Allan|editor-first=Stuart|pages=[https://archive.org/details/reportingwarjour0000unse/page/68 68]|chapter=A Moral Imagination: The Media's Response to the War on Terrorism|editor-last2=Zelizer|editor-first2=Barbie|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/reportingwarjour0000unse/page/68}}</ref> Reuters' editorial policy states: "Reuters may refer without attribution to terrorism and counterterrorism in general, but do not refer to specific events as terrorism.

===Climate change reporting===
{{Over-quotation|section=yes|date=October 2019}}
In July 2013, David Fogarty, former Reuters [[global warming|climate change]] correspondent in Asia, resigned after a career of almost 20 years with the company and wrote about a "climate of fear" which resulted in "progressively, getting any climate change-themed story published got harder" following comments from then deputy editor-in-chief [[Paul Ingrassia]] that he was a "[[climate change sceptic]]". In his comments, Fogarty stated: "Some desk editors happily subbed and pushed the button. Others agonised and asked a million questions. Debate on some story ideas generated endless bureaucracy by editors frightened to make a decision, reflecting a different type of climate within Reuters—the climate of fear," and that "by mid-October, I was informed that climate change just wasn't a big story for the present. …Very soon after that conversation I was told my climate change role was abolished."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/reuters-exposed-publication-openly-hostile-to-climate-coverage-top-editor-doubts-climate-science-c58788de7966/|title=Reuters Exposed: Publication Openly Hostile to Climate Coverage, Top Editor Doubts Climate Science|last=Kroh|first=Kiley|date=16 July 2013|website=[[ThinkProgress]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510045029/http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/07/16/2307291/reuters-exposed-publication-openly-hostile-to-climate-coverage-top-editor-doubts-climate-science/|archive-date=10 May 2015|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.commondreams.org/headline/2013/07/17-1|title=Climate Change 'Climate of Fear': Reporter Blows Whistle on Reuters|last=Lazare|first=Sarah|date=17 July 2013|work=[[Common Dreams]]|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150220204142/http://www.commondreams.org/news/2013/07/17/climate-change-climate-fear-reporter-blows-whistle-reuters|archive-date=20 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/26/reuters-climate-change-scepticism-coverage|title=Reuters' climate-change coverage 'fell by nearly 50% with sceptic as editor'|last=Goldenberg|first=Suzanne|date=26 July 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019221128/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/26/reuters-climate-change-scepticism-coverage|archive-date=19 October 2017|author-link=Suzanne Goldenberg}}</ref> Ingrassia, formerly{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Reuters' managing editor, previously worked for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] for 31 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris O'Shea |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/reuters-sends-paul-ingrassia-to-london_b80658 |title=Reuters Sends Paul Ingrassia to London &#124; FishbowlNY |publisher=Mediabistro.com |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref> Reuters responded to Fogarty's piece by stating: "Reuters has a number of staff dedicated to covering this story, including a team of specialist reporters at Point Carbon and a columnist.

Subsequently, climate blogger [[Joseph J. Romm|Joe Romm]] cited a Reuters article on climate as employing "[[false balance]]", and quoted Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, Co-Chair of Earth System Analysis at the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research|Potsdam Institute]] that "[s]imply, a lot of unrelated climate skeptics nonsense has been added to this Reuters piece. In the words of the late Steve Schneider, this is like adding some nonsense from the [[Flat Earth Society]] to a report about the latest generation of telecommunication satellites. It is absurd." Romm opined: "We can't know for certain who insisted on cramming this absurd and non-germane 'climate sceptics nonsense' into the piece, but we have a strong clue. If it had been part of the reporter's original reporting, you would have expected direct quotes from actual skeptics, because that is journalism 101. The fact that the blather was all inserted without attribution suggests it was added at the insistence of an editor."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/false-balance-lives-at-reuters-climatologist-slams-absurd-use-of-unrelated-climate-skeptics-nonsense-1974f293eb77/|title=False Balance Lives At Reuters: Climatologist Slams 'Absurd' Use of 'Unrelated Climate Skeptics Nonsense'|last=Romm|first=Joe|date=21 July 2013|work=[[ThinkProgress]]|accessdate=17 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190618073048/https://thinkprogress.org/false-balance-lives-at-reuters-climatologist-slams-absurd-use-of-unrelated-climate-skeptics-nonsense-1974f293eb77/|archive-date=18 June 2019}}</ref>

===Photograph controversies===
According to [[Ynetnews]], Reuters was accused of bias against Israel in its coverage of the [[2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict]] after the wire service [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy|used two doctored photos]] by a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] freelance photographer, Adnan Hajj.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286966,00.html|title=Reuters admits altering Beirut photo|last=Lappin|first=Yaakov|date=6 August 2006|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322144849/https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3286966,00.html|archive-date=22 March 2019}}</ref> In August 2006, Reuters announced it had severed all ties with Hajj and said his photographs would be removed from its database.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/01/18/idUSL18678707|title=Reuters toughens rules after altered photo affair Photos|date=7 January 2007|accessdate=15 August 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125013009/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL18678707|archive-date=25 January 2016|agency=Reuters}}</ref>

In 2010, Reuters was criticised again by ''[[Haaretz]]'' for "anti-Israeli" bias when it cropped the edges of photos, removing commandos' knives held by activists and a naval commando's blood from photographs taken aboard the ''Mavi Marmara'' during the [[Gaza flotilla raid]], a raid that left nine Turkish activists dead. It has been alleged that in two separate photographs, knives held by the activists were cropped out of the versions of the pictures published by Reuters.<ref name="Haaretz20100608">{{cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/1.5130826|title=Reuters under fire for removing weapons, blood from images of Gaza flotilla|last=Mozgovaya|first=Natasha|date=8 June 2010|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=8 June 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615183040/https://www.haaretz.com/1.5130826|archive-date=15 June 2018}}</ref> Reuters said it is standard operating procedure to crop photos at the margins, and replaced the cropped images with the original ones after it was brought to the agency's attention.<ref name="Haaretz20100608"/>

===Accusations of pro-Fernando Henrique Cardoso bias===
In March 2015, the Brazilian affiliate of Reuters released a text containing an interview with Brazilian ex-president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] about the ongoing [[Operação Lava Jato|Petrobras scandal]]. Petrobras is a state owned oil company in Brazil. In 2014, it was discovered that many politicians of Brazil were involved in corruption due to giving contracts of the company to different corporations for exchange of money. After this scandal, a text was released which contains Brazil's former president Fernando Henrique's interview.  
One of the paragraphs mentioned a comment by a former Petrobras manager, in which he suggests corruption in that company may date back to Cardoso's presidency. Attached to it, there was a comment between parenthesis: "{{lang|pt|Podemos tirar se achar melhor}}" ("we can take it out if [you] think better"),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2015/03/24/para-blindar-fhc-reuters-propoe-em-materia-podemos-tirar-se-achar-melhor/|title=Para blindar FHC, 'Reuters' propõe em matéria: 'podemos tirar se achar melhor'|date=25 March 2015|work=[[Jornal do Brasil]]|accessdate=25 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011132452/http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2015/03/24/para-blindar-fhc-reuters-propoe-em-materia-podemos-tirar-se-achar-melhor/|archive-date=11 October 2017|language=Portuguese|trans-title=To protect FHC, 'Reuters' proposes in matter: 'we can take it off if you think it's better'.}}</ref> which is now absent from the current version of the text.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://br.reuters.com/article/topNews/idBRKBN0MJ2B120150323|title=Entrevista-FHC diz que Lula tem mais responsabilidade política em caso Petrobras do que Dilma|last1=Winter|first1=Brian|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=25 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106150147/http://br.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRKBN0MJ2B120150323|archive-date=6 November 2018|agency=Reuters Brasil|language=Portuguese|trans-title=ENTREVISTA-FHC says Lula has more political responsibility in Petrobras case than Dilma}}</ref> It suggests that former president was involved in corruption and he wants them to cut out that text.  The agency later issued a text in which they confirm the mistake, explaining it was a question by one of the Brazilian editors to the journalist who wrote the original text in English, and that it was not supposed to be published.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cartacapital.com.br/blogs/midiatico/podemos-tirar-se-achar-melhor-podemos-2154/|title=Podemos tirar, se achar melhor|date=24 March 2015|work=[[CartaCapital]]|accessdate=24 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619213112/https://www.cartacapital.com.br/blogs/midiatico/podemos-tirar-se-achar-melhor-podemos-2154/|archive-date=19 June 2019|publisher=Editora Confiança|language=Portuguese|trans-title="We can take it off, if you think it's better"}}</ref>

===Funding by the UK Government===
In November 2019 the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|UK Foreign Office]] released archive documents confirming that it had provided funding to Reuters during the 1960s and 1970s so that Reuters could expand its coverage in the Middle East. An agreement was made between the [[Information Research Department|Information Research Department (IRD)]] and Reuters for the [[HM Treasury|UK Treasury]] to provide £350,000 over 4 years to fund Reuters' expansion. The UK government had already been funding the Latin American department of Reuters through a shell company; however, this method was discounted for the Middle East operation due to the accounting of the shell company looking suspicious, with the IRD stating that the company "already looks queer to anyone who might wish to investigate why such an inactive and unprofitable company continues to run."<ref name=BBC13012020>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50637200|title=How the UK secretly funded a Middle East news agency|last=Rosenbaum|first=Martin|date=13 January 2020|publisher=[[BBC]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114084803/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50637200|archive-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Instead, the [[BBC]] was used to fund the project by paying for enhanced subscriptions to the news organisation which the treasury would reimburse the BBC for at a later date. The IRD acknowledged that this agreement would not give them editorial control over Reuters, although the IRD believed it would give them political influence over Reuters' work, stating "this influence would flow, at the top level, from Reuters' willingness to consult and to listen to views expressed on the results of its work.”<ref name=BBC13012020 /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-media/britain-secretly-funded-reuters-in-1960s-and-1970s-documents-idUKKBN1ZC20F|title=Britain secretly funded Reuters in 1960s and 1970s - documents

==== Accusation of collaboration with the CIA ====
The American journalist [[Carl Bernstein]], known for helping to investigate [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], started in 1977 an investigation on the relationship between the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the Media. He interviewed several CIA agents and published an article in which he concluded that Reuters was one of the many media companies that secretly collaborated with the Agency to spread propaganda.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Carl|date=|title=The CIA and the Media|url=http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408030842/http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php|archive-date=2020-04-08|access-date=2020-11-15|website=www.carlbernstein.com}}</ref>
