'''Trayvon Benjamin Martin''' (February 5, 1995 – February 26, 2012) was a 17-year-old [[African-American|African American]] from [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], who was [[shooting of Trayvon Martin|fatally shot]] in [[Sanford, Florida]] by [[George Zimmerman]], a 28-year-old [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] American. Martin had gone with his father on a visit to his father's fiancée at her [[townhouse]] at [[The Retreat at Twin Lakes]] in Sanford. On the evening of February 26, Martin was walking back to the fiancée's house from a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman, a member of the community watch, saw Martin and reported him to the Sanford Police as suspicious. Several minutes later, there was an altercation and Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.

Zimmerman was injured during the altercation with Martin. He said he shot Martin in self-defense<ref name=reach/> and was not charged at the time. The police said there was no evidence to refute his claim of self-defense, and Florida's [[stand your ground law]] prohibited them from arresting or charging him. After national media focused on the incident, Zimmerman was eventually charged and tried, but a [[Trial of George Zimmerman|jury acquitted him]] of [[second-degree murder]] and [[manslaughter]] in July 2013.

Martin was born in [[Miami]], Florida, and attended both Norland Middle School and [[List of middle schools in Miami-Dade County|Highland Oaks Middle School]], in north [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]. He attended [[Miami Carol City Senior High School|Miami Carol City High School]] in Miami Gardens for his freshman and sophomore years. At the time of the shooting, Martin was a [[high school junior|junior]] at [[Dr. Michael M. Krop High School]] in north Miami-Dade.

Following Martin's death, rallies, marches and protests were held across the nation. In March 2012, hundreds of students at his high school held a walkout in support of him. An online petition calling for a full investigation and prosecution of Zimmerman garnered 2.2 million signatures. Also in March, the media coverage surrounding Martin's death became the first story of 2012 to be featured more than the [[2012 United States presidential election|presidential race]], which was underway at the time. A national debate about racial profiling and 'stand your ground' laws ensued. The governor of Florida appointed a task force to examine the state's self-defense laws. Martin's life was scrutinized by the media and bloggers. The name Trayvon was [[Twitter|tweeted]] more than two million times in the 30 days following the shooting.<ref name="cbsny rallies"/><ref name="usa syg"/><ref name="coverage of martin case"/><ref name="mcclatchy tweets"/><ref name="mherald"/><ref name="msnbc petn">{{cite news|author=Miranda Leitsinger|title=How one man helped spark online protest in Trayvon Martin case|url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/29/10907662-how-one-man-helped-spark-online-protest-in-trayvon-martin-case|publisher=MSNBC|date=March 29, 2012|accessdate=September 14, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330080822/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/29/10907662-how-one-man-helped-spark-online-protest-in-trayvon-martin-case|archivedate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> More than 1,000 people attended the viewing of his remains the day before his funeral, which was held on March 3, 2012 in [[Miami, Florida]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Trayvon Martin shooting protest 2012 Shankbone 9.JPG|thumb|Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton at an event in 2012]]
Martin was born in 1995 in Miami, Florida, to Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who divorced in 1999. At the time of the shooting, Fulton was a program coordinator for the Miami Dade Housing Authority, and Tracy Martin was a truck driver; they lived near each other in Miami Gardens. Martin's older maternal half-brother, Jahavaris Fulton, was a college student at the time (who would later testify in the Zimmerman trial).<ref name="tampa school"/><ref name="nbc jahavaris">{{cite news |author=Frank Thorp and Matthew DeLuca|title=Trayvon Martin's brother interning in office of Florida congresswoman|url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/19/19563695-trayvon-martins-brother-interning-in-office-of-florida-congresswoman?lite|publisher=NBC News|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/ff5d3f1f21844de2b99641b3fdf81154|title=Florida teen's mother says screams are her son's|last=Hightower|first=Kyle|website=AP NEWS|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref><ref name="SCHOOL">{{cite news |author=Bianca Prieto and Robert Nolin|title=Tensions still simmer in Trayvon Martin shooting case|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-03-17/news/os-trayvon-martin-shooting-tension-20120317_1_shooting-death-english-teacher-uncle|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=March 17, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="nbcmiami school">{{cite news |author=Ari Odzer|title=Krop Senior High Students Honor Fallen Classmate Trayvon Martin with "Chain of Life"|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Krop-Senior-High-Students-Honor-Fallen-Classmate-Trayvon-Martin-With-Chain-of-Life-144022006.html|publisher=NBC Miami|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="cnn jahvaris">{{cite news |title=Live Coverage of the George Zimmerman Trial |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1307/05/cnr.01.html|publisher=CNN|date=July 5, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref>

After being divorced, Martin's father married Alicia Stanley, who had two daughters from a previous marriage. They met when Martin was about three years old. Stanley and Martin's father were together for about 14 years. Stanley told [[Anderson Cooper 360°|CNN's Anderson Cooper]] that before she and Tracy Martin separated, Trayvon was with her 90% of the time, and that she went to all his football games and took care of him when he was sick. She said that Trayvon was a kind and loving person, not a 'thug' as the media portrayed him.<ref name="tampa school"/><ref name="stanley1">{{cite news |author=Wendy Widom|title=Alicia Stanley, Trayvon Martin's Stepmother, Finally Speaks Out|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/families-in-the-loop/2013/07/alicia-stanley-george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-2013/|publisher=Chicago Now|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="stanley2">{{cite news |author=Kirsten West Savali|title=Trayvon Martin's Stepmother Speaks Out (Video)|url=http://newsone.com/2622820/trayvon-martin-alicia-stanley/|publisher=NewsOne|date=June 30, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Alicia Stanley's interview aired on June 28, 2012<br>* [http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/28/exclusive-martins-stepmother-says-i-exist/ Video of Stanley's interview on AC360°]<br>* [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1306/28/acd.01.html Transcript of Stanley's interview on AC360°]|group="Note"}}

When Martin was nine years old, he saved his father's life by pulling his father, who had been immobilized by burns to the legs, out of a fire in their apartment.<ref name="tampa school"/><ref name="usa cousin"/> Martin enjoyed [[Sports game|sports video games]].<ref name="martin2"/> He washed cars, babysat, and cut grass to earn his own money.<ref name="tampa school"/><ref name="usa cousin"/><ref name="martin2">{{cite news |author=Kim Segal|title=Protesters declare 'I am Trayvon Martin,' but who was he?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/30/us/trayvon-martin-profile|publisher=CNN|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> Martin's former football coach said Martin had been one of the best players on their football team (The Wolverines) that played at Forzano Park in [[Miramar, Florida]]. Martin played for the Wolverines from age 8 to 13, and sometimes sat out because his father benched him "because he messed up in school".<ref name="usa cousin"/> Martin had played [[American football|football]] at the park since he was five years old and his team was coached in part, by his father. During his years in [[high school]], Martin volunteered at Forzano Park, working in the concession stand, sometimes staying until 8 or 9 p.m., before going home. Martin's former football coach said he was a shy child and always walked with his [[hoodie]] and headphones on listening to music.<ref name="martin2"/>

Martin's cousin Stephen Martin, who had been in a park telling jokes with Trayvon the night before his death, said that he and Trayvon had been like brothers growing up. He recalled that Trayvon had been very skilled at assembling, repairing, and riding [[Minibike|pocket bikes]] and [[Types of motorcycles|dirt bikes]]. Miriam Martin, Trayvon's aunt, and Stephen's mother, said her nephew had often stayed over visiting her family. She also said that Trayvon was fond of wearing a hoodie: "it could be 100 degrees outside and he always had his hoodie on."<ref name="usa cousin">{{cite news |author=Yamiche Alcindor|title=Trayvon Martin: Typical teen or troublemaker?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/12/11/trayvon-martin-profile/1761373/|work=USA Today|date=December 11, 2012|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref>

Martin had wanted to fly or repair airplanes and in mid-2009, enrolled in "Experience Aviation", a seven-week program in [[Opa-locka, Florida]], run by award-winning aviator [[Barrington Irving]]. According to Irving, Martin was a polite youth "[who] reminded me of myself because I had a strong interest in football until I fell in love with aviation." After Martin graduated from the program, he spent the next summer as a volunteer, helping out new students in the aviation program. According to his parents, Martin had hoped to attend the [[University of Miami]] or [[Florida A&M University]].<ref name="martin2"/>

=== Martin's later teenage years ===
When Martin started high school, his goal of playing professional football was put aside in favor of a career working with airplanes.<ref name="martin2"/> Martin attended [[Carol City High School]] in Miami Gardens for his freshman year and most of his sophomore year, before he transferred to [[Dr. Michael M. Krop High School|Krop High School]] in north Miami-Dade in 2011. While in his first year at Carol City, Martin attended classes in the mornings at the high school and then went to [[George T. Baker Aviation School]] for the rest of his school day. Martin's ninth-grade teacher, who taught him, three classes of [[Aerospace]] Technology at the Baker Aviation School, said he was a normal student, well-behaved, who passed all his classes. According to another teacher at Carol City, math was his favorite subject, and she said she never saw Martin show disrespect. Some students at Carol City compared Martin's death to that of [[Emmett Till]], one of the nation's most infamous civil rights cases.<ref name="tampa school"/><ref name="usa cousin"/><ref name="martin2"/>

Martin's mother had him transferred to Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, which has approximately 2,700 students, for his junior year. Fulton said that her son had average performance in school, and she transferred him because she thought Krop High School was better and she wanted a different environment for him. While a student at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School, Martin had behavioral issues. At the time of the shooting, he was serving a ten-day suspension for having a marijuana pipe and an empty bag containing marijuana residue. He had been suspended twice before, for tardiness and [[truancy]] and marking up a door with graffiti.  The suspension for graffiti was in October 2011, when Martin was observed by a school police officer on a security camera "hiding and being suspicious" in a restricted area of the school. According to the officer, he later observed Martin marking up a door with "W.T.F." ("what the fuck?"). When his backpack was searched the next day by a [[Miami-Dade County Public Schools Police Department|Miami-Dade School Police]] officer, looking for the graffiti marker, the officer found a dozen pieces of women's jewelry, a watch and a screwdriver that was described by the school police officer as a burglary tool. The jewelry found in his backpack included silver wedding bands and earrings with diamonds. When Martin was asked by the officer if the jewelry belonged to his family or a girlfriend, he said a friend had given it to him.  When asked for the name of the friend, Martin declined to provide it.  The school police impounded the jewelry and sent photographs of it to detectives at Miami-Dade to investigate it further. No evidence surfaced at that time that the jewelry was stolen. An attorney for Martin's family said the parents did not know about the jewelry or screwdriver. Martin was not charged with any crime related to these suspensions and did not have a juvenile record.<ref name="Suspend3x">{{cite news |author=Jeff Burnside and Brian Hamacher|title=Trayvon Martin Suspended From School Three Times|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/Trayvon-Martin-Suspended-From-School-Three-Times-Report-144403305.html|publisher=WTVJ (NBC 6 Miami)|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="multiple suspensions">{{cite news |author=Frances Robles|title=Multiple suspensions paint complicated portrait of Trayvon Martin|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/03/26/v-fullstory/2714778/thousands-expected-at-trayvon.html|work=Miami Herald |date=March 26, 2012|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

=== Digital footprint ===
Martin, known on [[Twitter]] by the nickname "Slimm", posted thousands of tweets over a period of months, according to the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. Martin tweeted his last message two days before he was shot in February 2012.{{#tag:ref|<ref name="mcclatchy tweets"/> The ''Miami Herald'' verified that the account was indeed Trayvon Martin's by cross-referencing his posts with those of the people he referenced.|group="Note"}} According to the ''Herald'', Martin's [[digital footprint]] portrayed him as having a sense of humor and a preoccupation with girls, and sometimes using profanity when discussing sex in his tweets. Martin also enjoyed making jokes on Twitter about [[Urban culture|street culture]], and posted [[YouTube]] excerpts from films like ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'' and ''[[Next Friday]]'', which both made fun of street culture. Martin liked [[Hip hop music|rap music]] and tweeted about [[Tupac Shakur]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and [[Mystikal]]. He often quoted explicit song lyrics in his tweets. Martin's postings sometimes reflected a personal nature with references to [[Krispy Kreme]] doughnuts, ice cream, movies and all-night study sessions. The ''Miami Herald'' also reported that Martin was not happy at Krop High School: in one of his tweets he had written, "WULD I MISS KROP??

Friends of Martin, who had known him from Highland Oaks Middle School and Carol City High School and corresponded with him over Twitter, said Martin was not prone to violence. One friend said he was the "walk away" type of guy: "he'd rather walk away than fight." She also said that she had never seen Martin's purported grills, and did not know he had them until she saw the picture on the news, and that she never saw him in public with them on. Another friend from Twitter who had known him since middle school said he was funny and had liked to joke around and make people laugh. A professor of media law at the [[University of Florida]], Lyrissa Lidsky, said Martin's social media posts should be taken with a [[grain of salt]], because they do not necessarily reflect what a teenager was like in person. She said a person's online persona may not reflect a true image of who they are, especially with young people. University of Florida criminal law professor Kenneth Nunn said when he was concerned about a person's character, he would look at anything, including what Martin's behavioral traits have been, or may have been over time.<ref name="mcclatchy tweets"/>

At a banquet for [[Associated Press]] Broadcasters in Florida, Benjamin Crump, and Mark O'Mara, Zimmerman's defense attorney, both said the role that social media played immediately following Martin's death set a precedent. Crump said that social media had given people who normally would not have a voice in matters like this a chance to engage in the case. O'Mara said the misinformation that was tweeted following Martin's death "caused a firestorm that wasn't a full picture".<ref name="sentinel crumpomara">{{cite news |author=Desiree Stennett|title=O'Mara, Crump agree: Social media playing key role in Trayvon case|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-04-27/news/os-benjamin-crump-mark-omara-20130427_1_benjamin-crump-trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=April 27, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name="cbsmiami crumpomara">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press|title=Social Media's Impact On Trayvon Martin Case|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2013/04/28/social-medias-impact-on-trayvon-martin-case/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=April 28, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref>

== Aftermath and media discourse ==

=== 2012 ===
Martin's parents, upset that an arrest had not been made in their son's death, contacted Martin's sister-in-law, an attorney who put them in touch with [[Benjamin Crump]], a [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] attorney from [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. Crump took their case ''[[pro bono]]'' and retained Natalie Jackson, an attorney familiar with Sanford and Seminole County who specialized in women's and children's cases, to help with the Martin case. On March 5, Jackson asked Ryan Julison to help as well. A [[publicist]], Julison initially approached several national media contacts about covering the shooting. Over the next few days and weeks, the national media started reporting on the shooting, including: [[Reuters]], ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC World News]]'' and [[CNN]].<ref name="reuters"/><ref name="abc first report">{{cite news |author=Matthew Rosenbaum|title=Florida Family Seeks Justice After Unarmed Teen Shot By Neighborhood Watch Captain|url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-family-seeks-justice-unarmed-teen-shot-neighborhood/story?id=15888961|publisher=ABC News|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name="cnn first report">{{cite news|author=Vivian Kuo|title=Florida teen's shooting by watchman questioned|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-12/justice/justice_florida-teen-shot_1_martin-family-gated-community-dispatcher|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119100258/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-12/justice/justice_florida-teen-shot_1_martin-family-gated-community-dispatcher|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|publisher=CNN|date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name="post first report">{{cite news |author=Paul Farhi|title=Trayvon Martin story found the media|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trayvon-martin-story-found-the-media/2012/04/12/gIQA9VGmDT_story.html|work=The Washington Post|date=April 12, 2012|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' reported that in the 30 days following the shooting, the name Trayvon was tweeted more than two million times.<ref name="mherald"/>

On March 8, Kevin Cunningham, a social media coordinator who had read about Martin's death, created a petition on [[Change.org]], which became the largest in the website's history a few weeks later with 2.2 million signatures. Cunningham said he started the online petition demanding that authorities prosecute Zimmerman and when the number of signatures reached 10,000, he transferred the petition to Martin's parents after Change.org contacted him. Cunningham was the media coordinator for KinderUSA, and said he fell in love with social media during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolution]] and was inspired by the [[Death of Khaled Mohamed Saeed|death of Khaled Said]]. He thought Martin's death could be a similar situation where the death of one person could trigger a reevaluation of society, and revolutionize the justice system and the culture.<ref name="msnbc petn"/>

In July, President Obama [[Speeches of Barack Obama#"Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago", 2013|made comments]] about the death of Martin after the acquittal of Zimmerman. He said, "I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see ... if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than defuse potential altercations." The President also talked about his experiences of being an African American man in this country and a history of racial disparities in the law and how it's applied to the African American community, in everything from the death penalty to drug laws. The President said it was those experiences that affected how the African American community interpreted what happened that night in Florida.
