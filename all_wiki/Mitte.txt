'''Mitte''' is the first and most central [[boroughs and localities of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin]]. The borough consists of six sub-entities: [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte proper]], [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]], [[Hansaviertel]], [[Moabit]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]].

It is one of the two boroughs (the other being [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]) which were formerly divided between [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]]. Mitte encompasses Berlin's historic core and includes some of the most important tourist sites of Berlin like [[Museum Island]], the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] and [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]], [[Checkpoint Charlie]], the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|TV tower]], [[Brandenburg Gate]], [[Unter den Linden]], [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter five of which were in former East Berlin.

==Geography==
[[File:2006 Berliner Dom Front.jpg|left|thumb|[[Berlin Cathedral]] and [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Television Tower]]]]
Mitte ([[German language|German]] for "middle", "centre") is located in the central part of Berlin along the [[Spree]] River. It borders on [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]] in the west, [[Reinickendorf]] in the north, [[Pankow]] in the east, [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] in the southeast, and [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]] in the southwest.

In the middle of the Spree lies Museum Island (''Museumsinsel'') with its museums and [[Berlin Cathedral]] (''Berliner Dom''). The central square in Mitte is [[Alexanderplatz]] with the prominent [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower), Germany's highest building, and the large railway station with connections to many subway ([[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]), tramway ([[Berlin tram|Straßenbahn]]), city trains ([[S-Bahn Berlin|S-Bahn]]) and buses.

There are some important streets which connect Mitte with the other boroughs, e.g. the boulevard Unter den Linden which connects Alexanderplatz to the west with Brandenburg Gate and runs further as [[Straße des 17. Juni]] to the [[Berlin Victory Column|Victory Column]] and the centre of former West Berlin in [[Charlottenburg]], or [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] to [[Friedrichshain]] and the eastern suburbs.

==History==
[[File:Berlin - Checkpoint Charlie 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Checkpoint Charlie]],1963]]
The former Mitte district had been established by the 1920 [[Greater Berlin Act]] and comprised large parts of the historic city around [[Alt-Berlin]] and [[Cölln]]. Brandenburg Gate was the western exit at the Berlin city boundary until 1861.

Between 1961 and 1990, the area's East Berlin portion was surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] on the north, south and west. There were some border control points, the most notable of which was [[Checkpoint Charlie]] between [[Kreuzberg]] and Mitte, which was operated by the [[United States Army]] and was open to foreigners and diplomats.

Two other checkpoints were at Heinrich-Heine-Straße/[[Prinzenstraße (Berlin U-Bahn)|Prinzenstraße]] east of Checkpoint Charlie, open to citizens of West Germany and West Berlin and on [[Invalidenstraße]] in the north on the border with the West Berlin Tiergarten district (the present-day [[Moabit]] locality).

== Regierungsviertel (Government District) ==
The government district is located in the locality of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] around the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building.]] Most institutions of the German government have their seat at the Regierungsviertel 
* [[Bundestag]], the German parliament in the old [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building]]

== Tiergarten Park ==
[[Tiergarten (park)|Großer Tiergarten]] is the name of the biggest urban park in Mitte, located in the [[Tiergarten, Berlin|same-named locality]]. Tiergarten Park was established as a hunting ground in the 16th century by the Prussian kings. Today it is enclosed by densely built-up areas by [[Hansaviertel]] and [[Moabit]] in the north, the Government District in the east and the [[City West]] and the Embassy Quarter in the southwest.

Many cultural monuments and memorials are located in the Tiergarten Park, like the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]], the [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)|Soviet War Memorial]] and a historic rose garden. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], the biggest victim group of the Nazi dictatorship, is located on the east side of the park, near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and the place where [[Reich Chancellery|Hitler's New Reich Chancellery]] once was.

== Kulturforum ==
The Kulturforum was built in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of [[West Berlin]], after most of the once unified city's cultural assets had been lost behind the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of [[Hans Scharoun]], and the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] was designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]].
