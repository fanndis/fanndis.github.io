Including assumed debt, the total purchase price was about $67.1&nbsp;billion.  The deal was aimed at increasing AT&T's market share in the pay-TV sector; its existing [[AT&T U-verse|U-verse]] brand had modest market share (5.7&nbsp;million users compared to DirecTV's 20&nbsp;million US customers as of 2014) and operates in only 22 states. It also gave AT&T access to fast-growing Latin American markets, where DirecTV has 18&nbsp;million subscribers.

The deal faced regulatory approval by the FCC, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], and some Latin American governments. It was expected to take about 12 months to complete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-purchase-directv-49b-deal/2014-05-18|title=AT&T to purchase DirecTV in $49B Deal|last=Marek|first=Sue|work=Fierce Cable|date=May 18, 2014 |access-date=May 18, 2014}}</ref>  The deal was also contingent on the combined company's ability to renew its exclusive rights to carry the [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] service beyond the [[2015 NFL season]] on "substantially the terms discussed between the parties."<ref name="lat-sundayticket">{{cite web|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=DirecTV deal with AT&T includes NFL Sunday Ticket exit clause |date=May 19, 2014|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-directv-att-nfl-sunday-ticket-20140519-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

The acquisition was officially approved by the FCC on July 24, 2015; it is subject to conditions for four years, requiring AT&T to expand its fiber-optic broadband service to additional customers, public libraries, and schools, and to "refrain from imposing discriminatory usage-based allowances or other discriminatory retail terms and conditions on its broadband internet service".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/07/att-directv-merger-fcc-approval-1201484821/|title=AT&T & DirecTV Merger Gets FCC Approval – With Conditions|website=Deadline.com|date=July 24, 2015 |access-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/24/8876267/att-directv-merger-approved|title=FCC approves AT&T–DirecTV merger|website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=July 24, 2015|access-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref>

At an analyst meeting in August 2015, AT&T announced plans to converge DirecTV and its [[IPTV]]-based U-verse service around a common "home entertainment gateway" platform based upon DirecTV hardware, with "very thin hardware profiles". AT&T Entertainment and Internet Services CEO John Stankey explained that the new platform would offer "single truck roll installation for multiple products, live local streaming, improved content portability, over-the-top integration for mobile broadband, and user interface re-engineering. All of these are steps that are planned to deliver that premium effortless entertainment experience anywhere."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/ATT-Outlines-the-Changes-DirecTV-and-UVerse-Users-Will-See-134789 |title=AT&T Outlines the Changes DirecTV (and U-Verse) Users Will See|last=Bode|first=Karl|work=DSL Reports|date=August 14, 2015|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-stop-investing-u-verse-cpe-will-move-new-home-architecture-using-direct/2015-08-12|title=AT&T to stop investing in U-verse CPE, will move to new in-home architecture using DirecTV system|last=Dano|first=Mike|work=FierceCable|date=August 12, 2015|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/att-put-genie-u-verse-s-bottle/393005|title=AT&T to Put 'Genie' Into U-Verse's Bottle|last=Baumgartner|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=August 17, 2015|access-date=August 20, 2015}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

On December 2, 2015, AT&T announced plans to phase out the DirecTV brand as part of the introduction of the new platform, which will be marketed as AT&T Entertainment.

In February 2016, ''Bloomberg'' reported that AT&T was in the process of phasing out the U-verse IPTV service by encouraging new customers to purchase DirecTV satellite service instead, and by ending the production of new set-top boxes for the service. An AT&T spokesperson denied that U-verse was being shut down, and explained that the company was "leading its video marketing approach with DirecTV" to "realize the many benefits" of the purchase, but would still recommend U-verse TV if it better-suited a customer's needs. AT&T CFO John Stephens had also previously stated that DirecTV's larger subscriber base as a national service gave the service a higher degree of leverage in negotiating carriage deals, thus resulting in lower content costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-16/at-t-takes-u-turn-on-u-verse-as-it-pushes-users-toward-directv|title=AT&T Takes U-Turn on U-Verse as It Pushes Users Toward DirecTV|last=Moritz|first=Scott|work=Bloomberg|date=February 16, 2016|access-date=February 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/distribution/att-stops-making-u-verse-tv-boxes-report/402596|title=AT&T Stops Making U-verse TV Boxes: Report|last=Baumgarnter|first=Jeff|work=MultiChannel News|date=February 16, 2016|access-date=February 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercecable.com/story/att-reportedly-halts-u-verse-set-top-production-latest-directv-push/2016-02-16|title=AT&T reportedly halts U-verse set-top production in latest DirecTV push|last=Frankel|first=Daniel|work=Fierce Cable|date=February 16, 2016|access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>

In the past, receivers were manufactured by DirecTV and other companies, including [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Philips]], [[Sony Electronics]], [[Panasonic]], [[Mitsubishi Electronics]], and [[Toshiba]]. Other companies' DirecTV receivers have been phased out and DirecTV now designs their own models with companies such as [[Pace Micro Technology]] of Britain, [[LG Electronics|LG]] of South Korea (which had manufactured boxes under the LG and [[Zenith Electronics]] names), and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] of France (which had previously manufactured boxes under the RCA name, GE (under license), and the [[ProScan]] brand). DirecTV and [[TiVo]] announced on September 3, 2008, that they will work together to develop a version of the TiVo service for DirecTV's broadband-enabled HD DVR platform.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=DIRECTV|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=P4900010|title=DirecTV and TiVo to Launch New HD DirecTV DVR with TiVo Service|date=September 3, 2008|access-date=September 4, 2008}}</ref> Originally scheduled to launch in the second half of 2009, it was expected to be available in spring 2010 but delayed again.<ref name="tivoReinvent">{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/439948-Can_TiVo_Reinvent_Itself_.php|title=Can TiVo Reinvent Itself?|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 14, 2009|publisher=Multichannel News|access-date=December 14, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615224505/http://www.multichannel.com/article/439948-Can_TiVo_Reinvent_Itself_.php|archive-date=June 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was finally released on December 6, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=CNET|title=DirecTV TiVo DVRs coming to select markets this week?|author=Don Reisinger|date=December 6, 2011|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57337590-17/directv-tivo-dvrs-coming-to-select-markets-this-week/}}</ref> The new unit, model THR22, is now available in select markets.<ref name="2011-12-08-tivo">{{cite web |url=http://www.tivo.com/products/source/satellite/tivo-directv/ |title=DIRECTV TiVo – DIRECTV DVR with TiVo service – TiVo |publisher=TiVo |date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125073343/http://www.tivo.com/products/source/satellite/tivo-directv/ |archive-date=January 25, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="2011-12-08-directv">{{cite web|title=HD DVR – Tivo® for DIRECTV |url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/technology/tivo_receiver|publisher=DirecTV| date=December 8, 2011}}</ref> The THR22 DVR does not have all the features of the HR24 DVRs.<ref name="THR22 vs HR24">{{cite web|title=THR22 DIRECTV HD TiVo DVR FAQ|url=http://www.weaknees.com/thr22-directv-hd-tivo-faq.php|publisher=weaKnees|access-date=December 20, 2011}}</ref>

DirecTV typically uses a fixed {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[Parabolic antenna|dish antenna]] to receive its signals. Traditionally an 18×24-inch elliptical was used; however, most new installations use an 18×20-inch antenna to receive signals from three [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite positions simultaneously. These systems are becoming more common as DirecTV attempts to squeeze more programming onto its growing systems. DTV is now installing a dish that has five [[low-noise block converter|LNBs]] for [[high-definition television|HDTV programming]] and local channels in selected markets. These systems receive signals from up to five separate satellites in both the {{Ku band}} and {{Ka band}}. After the new satellite, [[DirecTV satellite fleet#DirecTV-11|DirecTV 11]], is fully operational, DirecTV will stop supplying dual, triple, and five-LNB dishes to all customers and move to supplying a three-LNB Ka/Ku dish known as the Slimline3. This dish will see orbital locations 99, 101, and 103 degrees West. The Slimline3 will be the new standard install dish (for HD and SD programming), while the five-LNB Slimline will be used for installs in areas that receive local or international programming from orbital locations 110 or 119. The Slimline3 looks nearly identical to its predecessor, aside from a smaller LNB.

The new DirecTV HD channels require an H20/HR20 or H21/HR21/HR22/HR23/H24/HR24 [[set top box]] (STB). In order to receive the new HD channels (channels added after September 2007), all HD receivers except the HR23 must have a [[B band|B-Band]] converter installed. If the converter is not installed, viewers can only receive older HD channels (channels 70–99). The B-Band Converter (BBC) is also not required with the new Single Wire Multiswitch (SWM or SWiM) system, which preselects the satellite and transponder tuning and can feed up to 8 tuners via a single coaxial cable. The "HR" moniker designates the receiver as an [[High-definition television|HD]] [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) model.

Only the H20/HR20 support direct reception of [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[ATSC]] broadcasts. The H21/HR21/HR22/HR23/H24/HR24 receivers do not have a built-in ATSC tuner, but the AM21 external tuner is available. In addition, there is [[HDMI]] support for [[HDTV]]s with an HDMI port. New STBs also support [[MPEG-4]] standard for HD *Programming. DirecTV also offers the AM21 (an ATSC add-on for the HR21), the HR21-Pro (an HD-DVR with 100 hours HD or 400 hours SD recording capacity), and an online DVR scheduler.
* ''DirecTV Receiver'' is a common standard-definition model. D12 was the last one produced, as this type of receiver is being slowly phased out, according to DirecTV's February 28, 2008 Investors Info.
* ''DirecTV HD Receiver'' (H10/H20/H21/H23/H24/H25) is a receiver which can receive an HD signal and broadcast in 1080i resolution. H25 is the latest version. After a 2009 software upgrade, the H2n series is capable of receiving 1080p resolution. The H2n series is also the only series capable of operating with the Whole-Home DVR.
* ''DirecTV Plus DVR'' (R15/R16/R22) is a standard receiver with a built-in digital video recorder. It contains a 160 GB (new models as of 2010 have a 360 GB) hard disk using the [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] 40-pin connection and can store up to 100 hours of programming. R16-300 is the last of these line of receivers; they are being slowly phased out, according to DirecTV's February 28, 2008 Investors Info. The R22 is a "watered down" HR21 as it can receive MPEG4 and has all the features of the HD DVR, including HD output. However, the unit is locked to output standard definition only. In 2010 the R22 is unlocked to output HD output.
* ''DirecTV Plus HD-DVR'' (HR20/HR21/HR22/HR23/HR24), the most advanced everyday-consumer receiver in the lineup, is capable of full 1080p high definition and combines both high-definition and DVR capabilities in one unit. It contains a 320&nbsp;GB hard drive (500&nbsp;GB on the HR22, HR23, and HR24) using the [[Serial ATA|SATA]] interface connection. The DirecTV Plus HD DVR also features Media Share, allowing users to view photos and listen to music stored on their computer (with compatible DLNA server software) on their TV, and Whole-Home DVR Service which allows them to watch any recorded program on any HD or HD-DVR receiver in the house. The HR24 is the latest, with the HR23 being its predecessor. The HR24 like the HR21, HR22, and HR23, lacks an ATSC tuner as the HR20s had, but does support the AM21 external tuner for over-the-air channels. The HR24 can be expanded to 2TB drive on the eSATA port for up to 480 hours of HD and 1,750 hours of SD recording.
* ''DirecTV Pro HD-DVR'' (HR21-Pro), the most advanced home theater receiver with HD and DVR in one unit, has a larger capacity hard drive, better cooling and is rack mountable. The DirecTV Pro HD DVR also features Media Share, allowing users to enjoy photos and music stored on their Intel Viiv processor technology-based PC on their TVs. HR24 is the latest (May 2010). Guide scrolling and channel surfing is much faster than previous models.
* ''The DirecTV "[[Genie (DVR)|Genie]]" Home Media Center HD DVR'' (HR-34) the successor to the HR-24 features the ability to record 5 shows at once, allows for Picture in Picture, and has 1 TB of hard drive space allowing for 200 hours of high-definition recording or 800 hours of [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] recording. A second-generation Genie, the HR44, is now available and the HR34 has been discontinued. A new generation Genie, the HR54, has been released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.solidsignal.com/showthread.php/3860-Solid-Signal-goes-quot-Hands-On-quot-with-the-new-HR44-Genie-DVR |title=Solid Signal goes "Hands On" with the new HR44 Genie DVR – The Solid Signal Blog |publisher=Forums.solidsignal.com |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>
* ''The DirecTV H44 "Genie Lite"'' was released to the public in July 2015. As delivered, it provides the Genie experience including controlling client boxes and standalone television. With the addition of a specific, DIRECTV-branded hard drive it converts into a five-tuner DVR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.solidsignal.com/showthread.php/7622-Solid-Signal-s-HANDS-ON-REVIEW-DIRECTV-H44-Genie-Lite-and-external-hard-drive |title=Solid Signal's HANDS ON REVIEW: DIRECTV H44 Genie Lite and external hard drive – The Solid Signal Blog |publisher=Forums.solidsignal.com |access-date=2016-01-07}}</ref>
* ''DirecTV Sat-Go'' ("Satellite-To-Go") is the world's first portable satellite TV system, conceived by producer [[Rick Rosner]].<ref name="manly20078">Manly, Lorne (January 8, 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/08/technology/08satellite.html?sq=Rick+Rosner&scp=5&st=cse From the Mind of a TV Producer, Satellite Television in a Portable Box.] ''The New York Times''</ref> It combines a receiver, antenna and TV all in one easy-to-carry unit. It was discontinued in 2010.
* ''DirecTV DVR with TiVo Service'' (THR22) uses the same technology as the HR22 but has a TiVo user interface. The interface is currently the older SD one. This DVR does connect to the Internet, but only for TiVo program guide information. Currently, the THR22 cannot download program content via broadband.<ref name="THR22 vs HR24"/>

AT&T's planned over-the-top service for DirecTV will not require a satellite dish or a receiver to receive DirecTV programming, but simply a high-speed internet connection. DirecTV Now will be available through [[digital media player]] devices such as [[Roku]], [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Chromecast]], and [[Apple TV]].<ref name="OTT1" /><ref name="OTT2" /><ref name="OTT3" />

==Access card history==
DirecTV transmits programming with [[encryption]] to mitigate [[pirate decryption|signal piracy]]. The receiver (also known as an IRD, or "integrated receiver-decoder") utilizes [[ISO/IEC 7816]] [[smart card]]s which tell the receiver how to decrypt the programming for viewing. In a continuing effort to combat piracy, an access card generation is created approximately every two years, superseding the old set. DirecTV is now utilizing the fifth generation of access cards.
* P1, also known as F cards, were used until 1997. F cards have a picture of a satellite and the DSS logo on the front.
* P2, also known as H cards, were introduced in 1996 and eventually replaced F cards. H cards look the same as F cards. H cards were in use until 2002.
* P3, also known as HU cards, were introduced in 1999 and were used until April 2004. HU cards have a picture of a football player, a basketball, a clapperboard, and a film canister on the front. HU cards originally shipped with receivers with serial numbers above 0001 700 000. These were removed from circulation because piracy plagued the system.
* P4 cards were introduced in 2002 and are currently still in use. P4 cards are labeled "Access Card: 4."
* D1 cards were introduced in 2004 following compatibility problems with the P4 cards in some receivers. These cards can be identified by the silver edges, and simply bear the word "DirecTV" on the front (no number).
* D2/P12 cards were introduced in 2005. D2 cards can be identified by a two-toned blue dot pattern resembling the DirecTV logo in addition to the DirecTV logo and the words "DirecTV Access Card," while the P12 card has a picture of a satellite on the front. The P12 card is the only card that will work with R15, H20, and HR20 series receivers.
* O cards are the current "standard issue" card. They can be identified with the words "Now part of the AT&T family."

DirecTV has battled with an active signal piracy underground for many years. One infamous event that temporarily hampered pirates was known as 'Black Sunday', which took place one week before Super Bowl Sunday in 2001. Hackers saw a string of software updates starting in late 2000 that seemed harmless, but included code that once complete searched for and destroyed 98% of hacked smart cards. Hacks continued after that event.<ref>{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/01/25/directv_attacks_hacked_smart_cards/|title=DirecTV attacks hacked smart cards|publisher=Theregister.co.uk|date=2001-01-25|access-date=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/05/tarnovsky?currentPage=all |work=Wired|title=From the Eye of a Legal Storm, Murdoch's Satellite-TV Hacker Tells All|date=May 30, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/revisiting-the-black-sunday-hack.html|title=Revisiting the Black Sunday Hack|publisher=Coding Horror|date=2008-05-31|access-date=2012-08-26}}</ref>

Like its competitors, DirecTV offers [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) and interactive services.

To handle the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive HDTV broadcasting, DirecTV rebroadcasts local HDTV stations using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] [[codec]] while employing a newer transmission protocol ([[DVB-S2]]) over the newer satellites. This allows DirecTV to squeeze much more HD programming over its satellite signal than was previously feasible using the older [[MPEG-2]] compression and [[Digital Satellite Service|DSS]] protocol it has been using. This technology will be gradually expanded to the existing satellites as customer equipment is replaced with new MPEG-4-capable receivers.

Receiving channels encoded in MPEG-4 requires newer receivers, such as the H20 as well as the 5-LNB K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>u</sub> dish. DirecTV has contracted with Britain's [[Pace Micro Technology]], Korea's [[LG Electronics]] and France's [[Thomson SA|Thomson]] to manufacture these new receivers. Pace manufactures the DirecTV Plus HD DVR (Model HR20-700, and HR21-700) and [[LG Electronics]] offers the Model H20-600 receiver, while Thomson provides the Model H20-100 and HR20-100 DVR receivers. DirecTV has admitted to software issues with some of the H20 receivers and HR20 DVRs, which have been plagued with random problems since they were released in mid-2006. DirecTV regularly released software updates for the HR20 receivers, in an effort to reduce issues to an acceptable level.

DirecTV has phased out its original [[TiVo]]-branded HD DVR, the HR10-250, which can only decode the older MPEG-2 signals. All DirecTV-delivered local HDTV stations (outside of the NYC and LA network stations) are encoded in MPEG-4. The HR10-250 cannot receive the MPEG-4 local HDTV stations in these markets but can still receive over-the-air [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] broadcasts in these markets. After a multi-year hiatus, TiVo and DirecTV are developing a new TiVo-enabled HD DVR that will be able to receive/decode DirecTV's current MPEG-4 satellite signals. Originally slated for release in the second half of 2009, it is now available in select markets.<ref name="2011-12-08-tivo"/><ref name="2011-12-08-directv"/>

==4K television==
In November 2014, DirecTV became the first television provider to begin offering [[4K resolution|4K]] [[ultra-high definition]] content. On launch, 4K content was limited to renting a small library of on-demand films, downloaded to the subscriber's Genie DVR (some 4K content can also be pre-loaded automatically to the set-top box via the Genie Recommends feature). The 4K service could also only be used on "DirecTV 4K Ready" televisions, which support [[RVU protocol]]; this was limited to selected [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] 4K televisions released in 2014.<ref name="cnet-4kdirectv">{{cite web|title=DirecTV launches 4K exclusive to Samsung TVs|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/directv-launches-4k-exclusively-to-samsung-tvs/|website=CNET|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

In 2015, DirecTV introduced 4K Genie Mini set-top boxes, which can be connected to any [[HDMI]] 2.0/[[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|HDCP]] 2.2-compliant devices to provide 4K video.<ref name="techhive-directv4kgenie">{{cite web|title=DirecTV solves its 4K TV compatibility problem with new Genie Mini set-top boxes|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2973627/video-players/directv-solves-its-4k-tv-compatibility-problem-with-new-genie-mini-set-top-boxes.html|website=TechHive|publisher=IDG|access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

In April 2016, DirecTV began live sports broadcasts in 4K to eligible subscribers, including coverage from the [[2016 Masters Tournament]],<ref name="engadget-directv4k">{{cite web|title=DirecTV's first live 4K show is the Masters golf tournament|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/09/directv-first-live-4k-show/|website=Engadget|access-date=12 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="svg-masters4k">{{cite web|title=The Masters in 4K: DirecTV, CBS Sports Tee Up First Live 4K UHD Broadcast in U.S.|url=http://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/03/09/directv-tees-up-first-live-4k-production-at-the-masters/|website=Sports Video Group|access-date=12 March 2016}}</ref> 25 ''[[MLB Network]] Showcase'' baseball games in the 2016 season (subject to local [[Major League Baseball blackout policy|blackout restrictions]]) beginning April 15, 2016,<ref name="variety-4kmlbn">{{cite web|title=DirecTV to Carry MLB Network Games in 4K Ultra HD|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/directv-mlb-4k-ultra-hd-1201751249/|website=Variety|access-date=14 April 2016}}</ref> and all [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame college football]] home games during the 2016 season.<ref name="mcn-4knd">{{cite web|title=DirecTV To Offer Notre Dame Football Telecasts In 4K|url=http://www.multichannel.com/news/content/directv-offer-notre-dame-football-telecasts-4k/407605|website=Multichannel News|access-date=12 September 2016}}</ref>

==Local channels==
DirecTV also offers local channels like [[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], [[Telemundo]], [[Univision]], and some [[independent station]]s in markets covering over 99.2% of U.S. TV households.<ref name="DTV Locals">{{cite web|title=HD Locals|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/hd/hd_locals|publisher=DirecTV|access-date=2013-06-30}}</ref> In markets that lack an OTA CW affiliate, DirecTV offers [[The CW Plus]] or [[KTLA]] from Los Angeles (both in standard definition, only). Because DirecTV does not carry local [[digital subchannel]]s, however, broadcast networks such as [[MeTV]] and [[Antenna TV]] are not available on DirecTV in most markets.

Subscribers located in areas that cannot receive an adequate terrestrial television signal and/or who live in a small market that only has a couple of stations can receive feeds from New York and Los Angeles for CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox, as well as a feed from the CW Plus, though a waiver from the local affiliate stations may be required to allow this, approved at their discretion. National [[PBS Satellite Service|PBS]] and ION channels are also available.

In the largest markets, local channels are carried on the satellite at 101°W. In some smaller markets, the local channels are carried on a second satellite located at 119°W which requires a slightly larger dish with two or three [[Low-noise block converter|LNBs]] or the newer K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>u</sub> 5-LNB dish. In a few smaller markets, local stations are located on a satellite at 72.5°W that requires a second dish to be installed.

In late 2005, DirecTV began providing local HDTV channels to the largest markets, requiring newer receivers with a larger dish capable of receiving signals from up to five satellites at once. The K<sub>u</sub>-band signals on the newer K<sub>a</sub>/K<sub>u</sub> dish are received from 101°W, 110°W, and 119°W, while K<sub>a</sub>-band signals are from 99°W and 103°W.

Local television channels are transmitted over [[optical fiber]] links, [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] satellite uplink, [[microwave]], and conventional terrestrial transmission to [[Satellite truck|uplink centers]] located throughout the United States.

==Programming==
{{See also|Audience (TV network)}}
DirecTV's exclusive general entertainment channel [[Audience Network]] had dozens of original and acquired programs, most of them unedited and commercial-free. It had its own exclusive [[3DTV]] channel called [[n3D]] that launched in 2010 and shut down in 2012. DirecTV serves [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[JetBlue]], and [[United Airlines]].

DirecTV owned regional sports networks [[AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh]], [[AT&T SportsNet Southwest]], [[AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain]], and [[Root Sports Northwest]] (all under the umbrella of [[AT&T Sports Networks]]). It also owned minority shares of [[Game Show Network]] and [[MLB Network]]. DirecTV is also the exclusive U.S. rights holder to the [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] sports package. It also exclusively carries the "DirecTV Experience", which includes bonus coverage of [[Men's major golf championships|men's major golf tournaments]] and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tennis tournaments]], including live feeds not available on other networks such as [[CBS]] (formerly), [[NBC]], [[ESPN]], [[Golf Channel]] and [[Tennis Channel]] that cover the events. DirecTV was also the exclusive provider of defunct sports packages [[NASCAR Hot Pass]] and [[Mega March Madness]]. Plus soon are [[Ginx eSports TV]], and [[eGG Network]].

==Marketing==
Beginning in 2006, DirecTV began a series of [[commercials]] in which characters from popular movies and television shows [[break the fourth wall]] to tout the service's picture quality and the number of channels available in high definition. Instead of using [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] the original actors normally reprise their roles on recreated sets, and resulting footage is mixed with the original scenes. The productions are recent and appeal to DirecTV's "male-oriented marketing message."<ref name="farhi">Farhi, Paul. "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601540.html Scene 1, Double Take 2]" ''The Washington Post'', August 7, 2007.</ref> These characters include [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]], ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]''), Bill Harding ([[Bill Paxton]], ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''), The Economics Teacher ([[Ben Stein]], ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''), [[Dr. Emmett Brown]] ([[Christopher Lloyd]], ''[[Back to the Future]]''), [[Burton Guster]] ([[Dulé Hill]], ''[[Psych]]''), [[C.J.

Also in this series of commercials were [[Peyton Manning]], [[Eli Manning]], and [[Archie Manning]] promoting [[NFL Sunday Ticket]], and [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] promoting [[NASCAR Hot Pass]]. Cartoon characters have also been used in the ads, beginning with [[Scooby-Doo]] and the Mystery, Inc. gang. Recent commercials have also featured model [[Hannah Davis (model)|Hannah Davis]] and a "talking" horse.

DirecTV during that time also ran series of ads that take shots at cable television's service (or lack of service). Beginning in March 2010, they did a spoof of the classic game show ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' with [[Alex Trebek]] hosting the show. The series of commercials both pays homage to the [[Goodson-Todman]] game show, and take shots at both cable and DirecTV's archrival [[Dish Network]], who later sued for [[false advertising]]. Another series of commercials, promoting the 2010 NFL Sunday Ticket package of all-football programming, featured neighbors committing uncivil acts to neighbors who watched the "wrong" football team. One spot had a woman leaving a snack platter for a neighbor on which the food spelled out "DIRT BAG"; another showed a dog trashing a neighbor's property; yet another showed an on-duty policeman knocking on a DirecTV customer's door, stunning him with a taser and leaving him passed out in his open doorway. In August 2011, [[Deion Sanders]] began appearing in DirecTV's ads for NFL Sunday Ticket, urging people to switch from cable. These ads originally claimed NFL Sunday Ticket is now "free" for new customers for one year with a subscription to their Premiere package and a two-year contract. In response, on August 4, 2011, [[Comcast]] sued DirecTV for false advertising.<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/472011-Comcast_Looks_To_Sack_DirecTV_s_Sunday_Ticket_Campaign.php Comcast Looks To Sack DirecTV's Sunday Ticket Campaign] ''Multichannel News'' August 4, 2011</ref> Comcast dropped the case on August 19, 2011, after DirecTV altered the ads to remove the word "free", changing it to "at no extra charge".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120621201232/http://www.multichannel.com/article/472609-Comcast_Drops_Suit_Against_DirecTV_Over_NFL_Sunday_Ticket_Ads.php Comcast Drops Suit Against DirecTV Over NFL Sunday Ticket Ads] ''Multichannel News'' August 20, 2011</ref>

===DirecTV blimp===
[[File:DirecTV Blimp over Las Vegas.jpg|thumb|DirecTV blimp flying over West Las Vegas during the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2015]]
The DirecTV blimp named "lefty" was launched in October 2007 at the [[MLB]] [[World Series]] in [[Boston]] and has been seen all over the [[United States]] since its inception.

==Consumer protection lawsuits and violations==

===Washington State Attorney General civil complaint===
On December 14, 2009, the Washington Attorney General's office filed a civil complaint against DirecTV seeking injunctive and other relief. The complaint was filed in the public interest when the Attorney General's office determined after a one-year investigation by its [[consumer protection]] division, that the company allegedly engaged in numerous repeated violations of the state's Consumer Protection Act.

The complaint alleged unfair or deceptive practices which include, but are not limited to:

* Unclear disclosures concerning rebate terms and conditions
* Unclear and/or unfair advertising for use of the term "free";
* Automatically extending contracts when customers require equipment repairs, upgrade equipment or move;
* Failing to disclose financial terms and conditions that the company's least expensive package of $29.99 per month is only available to customers who meet certain financing conditions and agree to have the costs automatically charged or debited.
* The suit also alleged that some cancellation fees assessed by the company were considered to be unfair, and
* That the company unfairly retained consumer deposits made to obtain services. Those who cancel service prior to the end of their contract lose part of the deposit and may also be charged cancellation fees.

The Attorney General's Office asked the court to compel DirecTV to change its business practices, impose civil penalties and provide restitution for consumers.

The case brought by Washington state was settled in December 2010, with DirecTV agreeing to pay over $1&nbsp;million, and to correct many of its business practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atg.wa.gov/pressrelease.aspx?id=26982|title=Washington Attorney General's 1 million DIRECTV settlement sends clear signal |publisher=Atg.wa.gov |date=December 14, 2010 |access-date=2013-01-16}}</ref> DirectTV subsequently settled a similar suit with the other 49 states and the District of Columbia for $13.25&nbsp;million.<ref>[https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/crime_and_courts/states-reach-million-settlement-with-directv/article_e3e57376-0b8c-11e0-8864-001cc4c002e0.html States reach $13.25 million settlement with DirecTV], Associated Press (December 18, 2010).</ref><ref>[https://gantdaily.com/2010/12/15/13-25-multi-state-settlement-reached-with-directv-over-allegations-of-deceptive-advertising/ $13.25 Multi-state Settlement Reached with DIRECTV over Allegations of Deceptive Advertising], ''Gant Daily'' (December 15, 2010).</ref>

===California class action lawsuit===
In September 2008, consumers filed a class action lawsuit with the Los Angeles Superior Court to stop DirecTV's practice of charging early cancellation penalties to subscribers. The lawsuit claims that DirecTV fails to disclose the penalty to new customers or to existing customers who replace their equipment or add a new receiver and that these practices are unlawful. In September 2009, a motion for a preliminary injunction was filed to block the company from automatically removing the fees from customers’ bank accounts or charging their credit card accounts without their prior knowledge and written consent until the lawsuit is resolved.<ref>{{cite news|title=DirecTV Takes Disputed Fees Out of Customer Accounts, Suit Charges |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2009/09/directv_fees.html|access-date=August 3, 2010|newspaper=Consumer Affairs|date=September 25, 2009}}</ref>

===Telemarketing violations===
In December 2005, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission imposed a $5.3&nbsp;million penalty on DirecTV for its violations of federal telemarketing regulations. It was the largest civil penalty the FTC had ever announced in a case enforcing any consumer protection law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/12/directv.shtm |title=DirecTV to Pay $5.3 Million Penalty for Do Not Call Violations |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=2011-06-24 |access-date=2012-08-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926054313/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/12/directv.shtm |archive-date=September 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Deceptive advertising===
On March 11, 2015, the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed a lawsuit against DirecTV for deceptive advertising. The FTC claims the following:
* DirecTV failed to properly disclose important terms of its TV packages.
* DirecTV typically advertised 12-month deals without noting that:
** A two-year contract is required, 
** Package prices rise substantially during the second year, and 
** Early cancellation fees may be imposed.
* DirecTV failed to mention that offers of free premium channels, such as [[HBO]], would result in charges if the channels were not canceled before the free period ended.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/11/8191179/directv-deceptive-advertising-charges-ftc|title=FTC alleges DirecTV deceptively advertised TV packages|website=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=March 11, 2015|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>
