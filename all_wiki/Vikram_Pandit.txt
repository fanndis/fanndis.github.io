==Early life and education==
Vikram Pandit was born in [[Dhantoli]] locality of [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra]], India, to an affluent [[Marathi language|Marathi]] family.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urh9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT87|title=Crash: Lessons from the entry and exit of CEOs|page=87|author=R Gopalakrishnan|date=17 December 2018|publisher=Penguin Random House India Private Limited|isbn=9789353053864|accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/vikram-pandit-s-citigroup-growing-out-of-washington-s-control--20110328 |title=The Resurrection |author=Michael Hirsh |work=[[National Journal]] |date=28 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922090625/http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/vikram-pandit-s-citigroup-growing-out-of-washington-s-control--20110328 |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}</ref> His father, Shankar B. Pandit, was an executive director at Sarabhai Chemicals in [[Baroda]].<ref name=VSP-03/><ref name=VSP-33/><ref name=VSP-04/>

Pandit studied at Bishop Cotton School in Nagpur,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/Bishop-Cotton-School-starts-CBSE-pattern-school/articleshow/18147732.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Bishop Cotton School starts CBSE pattern school}}</ref> and then completed his schooling at the [[Wadala#List of schools|Dadar Parsee Youths Assembly High School]] in [[Dadar]], [[Mumbai]]. When Pandit was 16 years old, he moved to the United States<ref name=VSP-03/> to attend [[Columbia University]]<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=525386&ticker=C |title= Executive Profile Vikram S. Pandit|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date = 14 November 2014}}</ref> for his undergraduate program and, in 1976, earned his B.S. degree in [[electrical engineering]] in only three years. He then completed his M.S. in electrical engineering in 1977. Pandit subsequently turned to economics and finance and earned an MBA and PhD in finance from [[Columbia Business School]] in 1986, after publishing a [[dissertation or thesis|thesis]] involving a complex financial puzzle, titled "Asset prices in a heterogeneous consumer economy."<ref name=VSP-03/><ref name=VSP-06/><ref name=VSP-07/><ref name=VSP-D-01/>

==Professional career==

===Early career and Morgan Stanley (1983–2005)===
During his early professional years, he taught economics at Columbia, then had a stint as a professor at [[Brock University]] in [[St. Catharines|St. Catharines, Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

He joined [[Morgan Stanley]] as an associate in 1983, one of the first Indians to join the company.<ref name=VSP-05/><ref name=VSP-03/><ref name=VSP-08/> In 1990, Vikram Pandit was chosen as the managing director and head of the US [[Equity (finance)|Equity]] [[Syndicate]] unit of Morgan Stanley and by 1994, he had risen to become managing director (MD) and head of its worldwide [[Morgan Stanley#Institutional Securities|Institutional securities]] division.

He was instrumental in building Morgan Stanley's [[electronic trading platform]] and [[prime brokerage]] division and in 2000, ultimately rose to the post of president and [[chief operating officer]] of its worldwide operations of the [[Morgan Stanley#Institutional Securities|Institutional securities]] and [[Investment banking]] businesses.<ref name=VSP-09/>

In 2005, after more than two decades with Morgan Stanley, Vikram Pandit decided to leave the firm along with [[John Havens]] after being passed over by [[Philip J. Purcell]].<ref name=VSP-95/><ref name=VSP-96/>

===Post Morgan Stanley and joining Citigroup (2006&nbsp;– 2012)===
In March 2006, Pandit and [[John Havens]], along with Guru Ramakrishnan (former global head of trading, technology and new products in the equities group at Morgan Stanley), started the [[hedge fund]] Old Lane LLC.<ref name=VSP-10/> Citi bought the company in 2007 for $800 million, bringing both Pandit and Havens into Citi leadership.<ref name=VSP-11/> Citi named Pandit chairman and CEO of [[Citigroup#Citi Alternative Investments|Citi Alternative Investments (CAI)]] unit and he later led Citi's [[Citigroup#Citi Institutional Clients Group|Institutional Clients Group]].

On 11 December 2007, Pandit was named the new CEO of [[Citigroup]], replacing interim-CEO [[Winfried Bischoff|Sir Winfried Bischoff]]. Pandit was strongly supported by then interim chairman of Citigroup [[Robert Rubin]],<ref name=VSP-13/> the effective successor to [[Chuck Prince]]. Prince had resigned as chairman and CEO of Citigroup in November 2007, due to unexpectedly poor third-quarter performance, mainly due to [[collateralized debt obligation|CDO]]- and [[mortgage-backed security|MBS]]-related losses.

On 11 February 2009, Pandit testified to Congress that he had declared to his board of directors, "My salary should be [[One-dollar salary|$1 per year]] with no bonus until we return to profitability."<ref name=VSP-97/><ref name=VSP-98/><ref name=VSP-99/> He also struck an apologetic tone for letting the bank consider completing the purchase of a private jet plane after receiving some $45 billion in [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) funds.<ref name=TARP-F-01/> His total 2009 compensation was $128,751, with a base salary of $125,001 and other compensation of $3,750.<ref name=VSP-22/>

In January 2011, after working for two years for a salary of $1 a year, his annual base was raised to $1.75 million for the progress Citi made under Vikram's leadership.<ref name=VSP-22/><ref name=VSP-15/><ref name=VSP-21/> After posting five consecutive quarterly profits, Citigroup in May 2011, announced $23.2m retention award to Pandit making him one of the highest paid CEOs.<ref name=VSP-24/><ref name=VSP-26/> In April 2012, shareholders voted against increasing his pay to $15 million. About 55% of the votes cast were against the compensation package.<ref name=VSP-19/>

His co-chairing of Davos 2012 was criticized,<ref name="Bloomberg 26 January 2012"/> with Mike Mayo, an analyst with [[Crédit Agricole]] in New York remarking: "What kind of signal does that send, that the bank that was the worst-performing in our country over the last decade and whose stock price is still down significantly since he took over, is the ambassador for our financial industry?"<ref name="Bloomberg 24 January 2012"/> At Davos 2012, Pandit said that Citigroup was going "back to the basics of banking" in response to public anger about the financial crisis, and argued that, "The single biggest issue facing us is the question of jobs," giving an estimate of 400 million jobs in the next 10 years.<ref name="Bloomberg 25 January 2012"/>

====Resignation====
On 16 October 2012, Pandit unexpectedly resigned as Citigroup CEO.<ref name="NYT October 2012"/> [[Michael Corbat]], previously Citigroup's CEO of Europe, Middle East, and Africa, was named as his replacement.<ref>{{cite news|last=de La Merced|first=Michael J.|title=Pandit Steps Down as Citi's Chief|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/pandit-steps-down-as-citis-chief/?hp|work=The New York Times|date=16 October 2012}}</ref> While Pandit and the company maintain that he resigned, [[Bloomberg News]] cited anonymous board sources indicating that Pandit was forced out by the board after eroding investor confidence and damaging company relations with regulators over an extended period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Citigroup Board Said to Oust Pandit After Multiple Setbacks |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/citigroup-board-said-to-oust-vikram-pandit-over-poor-execution.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018000823/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/citigroup-board-said-to-oust-vikram-pandit-over-poor-execution.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 }}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' later identified Chairman [[Michael E.

====Compensation====
While CEO of Citigroup in 2007, Vikram S. Pandit earned an annualized compensation of $3,164,320, which included a base salary of $250,000, stocks granted of $2,914,320, and options granted of $0.<ref name=VSP-22/> In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $38,237,437, which included a base salary of $958,333, stocks granted of $28,830,000, and [[stock option|options]] granted of $8,432,911. However, after adjusting for Citigroup's sunken share price, the package was worth just a few million dollars.<ref name=VSP-21/> Pandit received $165 million for his hedge fund which was purchased by Citi in 2007.<ref name=VSP-20/> The fund has since been closed. In 2012, Citigroup shareholders voted in favor of a non-binding resolution to reject a $15 million pay package for Pandit. In November 2012, Pandit was paid about $6.7 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-09/citigroup-ex-ceo-pandit-gets-6-7-million-compensation-for-2012.html|title=Citigroup Will Pay Former Chief Pandit $6.7 Million|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=30 January 2013|first=Donal|last=Griffin|date=10 November 2012}}</ref>
