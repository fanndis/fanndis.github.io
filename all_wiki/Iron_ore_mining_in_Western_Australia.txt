'''Iron ore mining in Western Australia''', in the 2018–19 [[Fiscal year#Australia|financial year]], accounted for 54 percent of the total value of the state's resource production, with a value of [[Australian dollar|A$]]78.2 billion. The overall value of the minerals and petroleum industry in [[Western Australia]] was A$145 billion in 2018-19, a 26 percent increase on the previous financial year.<ref name="wamp2018">{{cite web |title=Western Australian Mineral and Petroleum Statistics Digest 2017–18 |date=2018 |url=http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Documents/About-Us-Careers/Stats_Digest_2017-18.pdf |publisher=Government of Western Australia Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety |accessdate=12 June 2019 |location=East Perth, WA}}</ref><ref name="dmp2019">{{cite web|title=Western Australian Mineral and Petroleum Statistics Digest 2018–19 |url=http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/Documents/About-Us-Careers/Stats_Digest_2018-19.pdf|website=Department of Mines and Petroleum|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=1 April 2020|location=East Perth, WA|format=pdf|date=2019}}</ref>

Western Australia's [[iron ore]] output for 2018–19 was 794 million tonnes, a decrease of 5 percent on 2017–18. The bulk of Western Australian ore went to China, which imported 82% of 2018 production, followed by Japan with 7.5% and South Korea with 6%.

==History==
While the Pilbara iron ore deposits were known, such as the [[Mount Whaleback mine|Mount Whaleback deposit]] discovered in 1957 by Stan Hilditch, it was not until 1960, when the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] lifted the embargo on iron ore exports that it had put in place because of concerns the mineral was in short supply, that mining began in earnest.<ref name="Herald" >[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Western-Australia/Newman/2005/02/17/1108500208593.html Newman] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published: 8 February 2004, accessed: 10 November 2010</ref> Up until the mid-1960s, iron ore production in Western Australia, and Australia as a whole, was negligible, in the range of less than 10 million tons a year. By the mid-1970s, this figure had reached 100 million tonnes, with the majority coming from Western Australia. Production slightly declined in the 1980s but it improved in the 1990s, reaching 150 million tonnes for the country by 1997 and 200 million tonnes by 2003.<ref name="Digestnine" >[http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/Statsdigest09web.pdf Western Australian Mineral and Petroleum Statistic Digest 2008-09] [[Department of Mines and Petroleum]] website, accessed: 26 November 2010</ref>

The first mine in the Pilbara, the [[Goldsworthy mine]], was developed in 1965 by Mount Goldsworthy Mining Associates, a joint venture between the British-owned [[Consolidated Gold Fields|Consolidated Goldfields (Aust) Pty Ltd]], [[Cyprus Mines Corporation]] of Los Angeles, and [[Utah Construction Company|Utah Construction & Mining Company]] of San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron Ore (Mount Goldsworthy) Agreement Act 1964 |url=https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/prod/filestore.nsf/FileURL/mrdoc_19719.htm/$FILE/Iron%20Ore%20(Mount%20Goldsworthy)%20Agreement%20Act%201964%20-%20%5B01-d0-01%5D.html?OpenElement |website=Western Australian Legislation |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel’s Office, Government of Western Australia |accessdate=5 April 2019 |date=1964}}</ref> A private railway line, the [[Goldsworthy railway]], as well as port facilities at [[Finucane Island]], [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]], were also constructed. On 1 June 1966, the first shipment of iron ore from the Pilbara left on board the ''Harvey S. Mudd''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Utah Development profit reflects Japanese price rise | date = 11 December 1973 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19731211&id=2bIpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EeUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2040,4135322 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | page = 20 | accessdate = 2012-10-01}}</ref><ref name="History" >[http://www.bhpbilliton.com/bb/ourBusinesses/ironOre/history.jsp History of the Iron Ore Industry and the Pilbara] BHP Billiton website, accessed: 10 November 2010</ref>

BHP's operations in [[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]] date back to 1968, when the Mount Whaleback mine was opened, the biggest single [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] iron ore mine in the world. A new town, Mount Newman, was constructed, as well as a 426 kilometre railway line, the [[Mount Newman railway]]. The first train left Mount Newman on 1 January 1969 and the first shipment of Newman ore left port on 1 April 1969 on board of the ''Osumi Maru''.<ref name="History" /> Newman remained a "closed" company town until 1981.<ref name="Herald" />

[[File:Mount Goldsworthy Exploration Camp.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Early exploration camp at Mount Goldsworthy (1964)]]
In 2008-09, expenditure for exploration in iron ore in Western Australia increased by 33 percent compared to the previous financial year, 2007-08. The A$560 million spend on iron ore exploration accounted for 45 percent of all mineral exploration expenditure in the state.<ref name="Digestnine" />

===Production===
[[File:Major West Australian Commodities 2008-2009 ($ million).png|thumb|right|300px|Major commodity mix, 2008-2009.]]
The bulk of iron ore production in Western Australia comes from the [[Pilbara]] region of the state. A number of mines however are also located in the [[Mid West (Western Australia)|Mid West]] and [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] regions as well as in the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]].<ref name="Digestnine" />

The big two producers, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] and [[BHP]] accounted for 90 percent of all iron ore production in the state in 2008-09, with the third-biggest producer being the [[Fortescue Metals Group]].<ref name="Digestnine" />

Rio Tinto operates twelve iron ore mines in Western Australia, BHP seven, Fortescue two, all of those are located in the Pilbara region.<ref name="Digestnine" />

===Railways===
==== Pilbara region ====
[[File:Iron ore Pilbara 2.svg|180px|thumb|left|Iron ore mines in the [[Pilbara]] region.]]
The three largest iron ore producers operate private rail networks to transport ore from their mines to ports on the coast.

BHP operates the [[Goldsworthy railway]] and the [[Mount Newman railway]], both terminating at Port Hedland.

Rio Tinto operates the [[Hamersley & Robe River railway]], formed in a 2001 merger of the Hamersley and Robe River railways. The two lines terminate at Cape Lambert and Dampier.

FMG's [[Fortescue railway]], a relative newcomer, started operation in 2008. The line terminates at Port Hedland.<ref name="Fmgrail">[http://www.fmgl.com.au/IRM/content/project_infrastructure_rail.htm Infrastructure: Rail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123223509/http://www.fmgl.com.au/IRM/content/project_infrastructure_rail.htm |date=23 November 2010 }} Fortescue website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref> Before deciding to construct its own line, the National Competition Council of Australia received an application from FMG, on 15 June 2004, to use part of the Mount Newman railway and also part of the Goldsworthy railway.<ref>[http://www.ncc.gov.au/index.php/application/mount_newman Mt Newman Railway] National Competition Council of Australia website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref>

Other mines connect to port using the state government-owned railways. Examples are Windarling Range and [[Koolyanobbing]] - from Koolyanobbing to the port of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]]; [[Koolanooka]] and Mungada using a 60km spur line linking to the state network at [[Morawa, Western Australia|Morawa]]; and [[Mt Gibson]] trucking to an ore loading siding at [[Perenjori]].<ref name=cliffs/><ref>{{cite web |title=Koolanooka 1961 to Today |url=https://www.morawa.wa.gov.au/Assets/Documents/Koolanooka_historical_brochure.pdf |publisher=Shire of Morawa |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>

===Ports===
In the Pilbara, iron ore is shipped from Port Hedland, Dampier and Cape Lambert. The latter two ports are exclusively used by Rio Tinto, while Port Hedland is used by BHP, FMG and Atlas Iron.

Port facilities at Port Hedland consist of Nelson Point and Finucane Island, both BHP, and Herb Elliott Port, used by FMG. In Dampier, ore is shipped from Parker Point and East Intercourse Island.

The non-Pilbara mines ship their ore out of other ports: Windarling Range ships from the port of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]];<ref name=cliffs>{{cite web|title=Yilgarn Operations - 2013 Triennial Performance Review |url=http://www.cliffsnaturalresources.com/EN/CorpResponsibility/ResponsibleBusiness/Documents/2013%20Triennial%20Performance%20Review%20%20MS%20627,%20802%20and%20907%20-%20Final.pdf|website=Cliffs Natural Resources|accessdate=25 November 2015|location=Cleveland, OH|page=3|format=pdf|date=2013}}</ref> the Jack Hills, Koolanooka, Mungada and Mt Gibson mines ship from [[Geraldton]].<ref>[http://www.sinosteelmidwest.com.au/projects/koolanookablue-hills.html Koolanooka/Blue Hills (Haematite)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017032658/http://www.sinosteelmidwest.com.au/projects/koolanookablue-hills.html |date=17 October 2010 }} Sinosteel Midwest website, accessed: 28 November 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.crosslands.com.au/index.php?id=121 Jack Hills Iron Ore Mine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221003207/http://www.crosslands.com.au/index.php?id=121 |date=21 February 2011 }} Crosslands resources website, accessed: 28 November 2010</ref>

BHP is currently spending A$1.85 billion on its ''Rapid Growth Project 4'', aimed at increasing its annual iron ore output to 155 million tonnes. To achieve this, upgrades to both mines and port facilities are necessary. The project is scheduled for completion by 2010. As a follow-up, ''Rapid Growth Project 5'', with a budget of A$4.8 billion, targets a further production increase of 50 million tonnes annually. Additionally to upgrades at the mines and ports, it will also include duplication of existing railway lines and is scheduled for completion in late 2011.<ref name="Digestnine" /> The [[Jimblebar mine]] is part of another expansion project, launched in 2010 and aimed at increasing production from the Pilbara mines to 240 million tonnes of iron ore annually by 2013.

===Export===
China, in 2008-09, was the main importer of Western Australian iron ore, having taken 64 percent, or A$21 billion in value. Japan was the second-most important market with 21 percent, followed by [[South Korea]] with 10 percent and [[Taiwan]] with 3. In comparison, [[Europe]] is a small market for ore from the state, having taken only one percent of the overall production in 2008-09.<ref name="Digestnine" />

==Criticism==
The iron ore mining boom in Western Australia experienced since the early 2000s has not exclusively been seen as positive. Communities in the Pilbara region have seen a large influx of residential and [[Fly-in fly-out]] workers which has seen land prices skyrocket and has negatively affected tourism as accommodation has become sparse.<ref name="Geoone" >[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070926-australia-mining.html New Australia Mining Boom Taking Toll on Outback Life - Page 1] ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', published: 26 September 2007, accessed: 6 December 2010</ref><ref name="Geotwo" >[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070926-australia-mining_2.html New Australia Mining Boom Taking Toll on Outback Life - Page 2] ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'', published: 26 September 2007, accessed: 6 December 2010</ref>

===Australian Aboriginals===
[[Australian Aboriginal]] culture in the region is deeply connected to the land and water and the mining activities threaten the fragile desert environment of the Pilbara. Locals in the Pilbara argue that the wealth generated by the local mining industry is passing them by and they are left behind. A lack of accommodation and the unattractive nature of relocating to the "dusty outback" resulted in a majority work force of fly-in fly-out workers, depriving local towns of the benefits of a high-earning permanent population.<ref name="Geotwo" />

Mining companies in Australia have, since 1992, changed their attitude towards the local Aboriginal population. In 1992, the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] began to recognise the land rights of the [[Indigenous Australians]], opening an opportunity for the latter to engage in negotiations with mining companies to press for compensation and for assistance in preserving cultural artifacts. However, some Aboriginals feel short-changed, given the enormous profits made from mining, and also consider the financial benefits and employment opportunities as insufficient compensation for the destruction caused to their habitat.<ref name="Geotwo" />

Aboriginal mining companies have been able to secure contracts with the big international mining companies. In 2007, BHP Billiton awarded a A$300 million contract to Ngarda Civil and Mining, an [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]]-owned company, to manage the [[Yarrie mine]], the largest ever mining contract awarded to an Aboriginal company.<ref>[http://www.ngarda.com.au/Key+Projects/Downloads_GetFile.aspx?id=1393 Fact Sheet: Yarrie Mine Operations] Ngarda Civil and Mining website, accessed: 6 December 2010</ref><ref name="Abc" >[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/02/16/2821191.htm?site=northwestwa&source=rss Looking for opportunities] ''[[ABC North West WA]]'', published: 16 February 2010, accessed: 6 December 2010</ref> As part of the five-year contract, BHP Billiton planned to increase the number of Aboriginal workers at the mine to 70, out of a total of 90 workers. The managing director of Ngarda, Brian Taylor, saw this contract as a positive step, moving Aboriginal people in the region away from government welfare and into permanent employment. Western Australian Aboriginals, in 2007, suffered from an unemployment rate of 14 percent in the state, compared to 3.3% for the general population.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/indigenous-firm-wins-300m-bhp-deal/story-e6frg9df-1111114348053 Indigenous firm wins $300m BHP deal] ''[[The Australian]]'', published: 5 September 2007, accessed: 6 December 2010</ref> Of the 12,000 people employed by BHP Billiton in its Pilbara operations in 2010, 700 were indigenous. Rio Tinto also, as of 2010, employs 700 indigenous workers in its Pilbara operations, comprising 6 percent of its overall work force. FMG, under the leadership of [[Andrew Forrest]], is driving a national program which aims to find 50,000 jobs for indigenous workers in Australia.<ref name="Abc" /> Companies like BHP, FMG and Rio Tinto have programs aimed at increasing the number of Aboriginal employees in their operations.<ref name="Geotwo" /> Indigenous Australians in Western Australia in 2001 accounted for 3.1% of the population.

Companies however lack an understanding of [[Aboriginal culture]], which requires young men to be sent to the bush for up to six weeks to hunt and learn about their culture. Companies are often unwilling to award their indigenous employees this time off to be able to perform these important traditions.<ref name="Abc" />
