The '''Doctor of Social Science''' ('''DSocSci''', '''SScD''' or '''DSSc''') degree is the highest degree offered by some universities in the field of [[social sciences]], for which other universities confer a [[Ph.D.]]. 

Like the PhD, it is recognized<ref>http://www.americangraduateeducation.com/articles/en/research-doctorate.htm</ref> as a terminal research degree that requires a substantial original thesis.

In North America, the only universities to offer a Doctor of Social Science are Royal Roads University in British Columbia, Canada, and Wilmington University in New Castle, Delaware, United States.
