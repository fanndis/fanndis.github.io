The '''economy of Ukraine''' is an [[Emerging markets|emerging]] [[free market]] economy. It grew rapidly from 2000 until 2008 when the [[Great Recession]] began worldwide and reached Ukraine as the [[2008-2009 Ukrainian financial crisis]]. The economy recovered in 2010 and continued improving until 2013. From 2014 to 2015, the Ukrainian economy suffered a downturn, with the GDP in 2015 being slightly above half of its value in 2013. In 2016, the economy again started to grow. By 2018, the Ukrainian economy was growing rapidly, and reached almost 80% of its size in 2008. 

The depression during the 1990s included [[hyperinflation]] and a fall in economic output to less than half of the [[GDP]] of the preceding [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]]. GDP growth was recorded for the first time in 2000, and continued for eight years.<ref name="NBU">[http://www.bank.gov.ua/Engl/Macro/ Ukraine.

===Industries===
[[File:Zenit-2 rocket ready for launch.jpg|thumb|[[Zenit-2]], produced by [[Yuzhmash]], Ukrainian rocket manufacturer]]
In Ukraine covering about 20 major industries, namely power generating, fuel, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical and gas, machine-building and metal-working, forest, wood-working and wood pulp and paper, construction materials, light, food and others.<ref>[http://www.usndt.com.ua/industry.htm Industry of Ukraine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231025730/http://www.usndt.com.ua/industry.htm |date=31 December 2010 }}</ref> Industry accounted for 26% of GDP in 2012. The country possesses a massive high-tech industrial base, including [[electronics industry|electronics]], [[arms industry]] and [[space program]].

==== Mining and production ====
Ukraine is one of the world's most important mineral producing countries, in terms of both the range and size of its reserves. There are nearly 8,000 separate deposits, harboring some 90 different minerals, of which about 20 are economically significant. About half of all the known deposits are under exploitation. Coal reserves in Ukraine amount to 47.1 billion tons. The annual domestic demand for coal as fuel is about 100 million tons, of which 85 percent can be satisfied by domestic production. Ukraine has oil and gas fields that meet 10 percent of her oil and 20 percent of her gas consumption, respectively. Ukraine contains natural gas reserves of 39.6 trillion cubic feet, but only about 20 percent of the country's demand is met by domestic production. Deposits of iron ore (estimated at 28 billion tons), manganese ore (3 billion tons), chalk and limestone (1.5 billion tons) are also large in Ukraine. The domestic industrial sector suffers from constant energy shortages and energy supply payment debts totaling about $792 million at the end of 1995.

===== Iron and steel =====

Ukraine is rich in mineral deposits, including iron ore (of which it once produced 50 percent of the entire Soviet output), manganese ore (of which it produced 40 percent of world output during the Soviet era), mercury, titanium,<ref>[http://www.unian.info/economics/1719371-ukraines-2016-exports-of-titanium-ore-up-571-on-year.html Ukraine's 2016 exports of titanium ore up 57.1% on year], [[UNIAN]] (12 January 2017)</ref> and nickel.

Ukraine has a major ferrous metal industry, producing [[cast iron]], [[steel]] and pipes. Among its economy leading companies in that field are [[Metinvest]], [[Kryvorizhstal]], AzovStal, [[Ilyich Steel & Iron Works]], and others. As of 2012, Ukraine is the world's [[Steel production by country|tenth largest steel producer]] (according to [[World Steel Association]]).

====Chemical industry====
Another important branch is the country's [[chemical industry]] which includes the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], mineral [[fertilizer]]s and [[sulfuric acid]].

====Strategic and defense complex====
[[File:T-84 Oplat guided onto a tank transporter.jpg|thumb|[[BM Oplot]], produced by the [[Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau|KMDB]] guided onto a [[tank transporter]]]]

Ukraine's defense industry is organized around [[Ukroboronprom]], a state owned conglomerate of over 130 companies. These companies include Soviet era giants such as [[Ivchenko-Progress]] aircraft design bureau that was opened in 1945, to newer companies such as [[RPC Fort]] which came into existence in the 1990s. Ukraine is also among the top 10 [[Weapons|arms]] exporters in the world. The signing of recent large contracts may put Ukraine into 6th place among biggest arms traders, after the [[United States]], [[Russian Federation]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Israel]].<ref name="Interfax-Ukraine">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/60596/ Ukraine may become world's sixth biggest arms trader] [Kyiv Post]</ref> The output of Ukrainian defense plants grew 58% in 2009, with largest growth reported by aircraft builders (77%) and ship builders (71%).<ref name="Interfax-Ukraine"/>

In 2013 Ukraine's defense sector manufactured a total of 11.7 billion UAH worth of goods, 10 billion UAH of which were exported. In the first 9 months of 2014 Ukraine's defense sector produced a record 13 billion UAH worth of goods, the increase was largely due to government orders for the [[War in Donbass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/rus/news/ukroboronprom_za_9_mesyatsev_izgotovil_produktsii_bolshe_chem_za_ves_proshliy_god_1676552|publisher=Ukrinform|title=Укроборонпром за 9 месяцев изготовил продукции больше, чем за весь прошлый год|access-date=21 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810202336/http://www.ukrinform.ua/rus/news/ukroboronprom_za_9_mesyatsev_izgotovil_produktsii_bolshe_chem_za_ves_proshliy_god_1676552|archive-date=10 August 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

====Fuel and energy complex====
{{See also|Natural gas in Ukraine|Energy in Ukraine}}

===== Fuel industry =====
Ukraine imports 90% of its oil and most of its natural gas. Russia ranks as Ukraine's principal supplier of oil, and Russian firms own and/or operate the majority of Ukraine's refining capacity. Natural gas imports come from Russia - which delivers its own gas, as well as the gas from Turkmenistan.  Ukraine transports Russian gas to the EU through its well-developed gas pipelines system, being Europe's vitally important connection. The country's dependence on Russian gas supplies dramatically affects its economics and foreign policy, especially after the 2014 Russia–Ukraine gas disputes.

However, Ukraine is independent in its electricity supply, and exports to Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe.  This is achieved through a wide use of nuclear power and hydroelectricity.  Recent energy strategy intends gradual decreasing of gas- and oil-based generation in favor of nuclear power, as well as [[energy saving]] measures including lower industrial gas consumption.  Reform of the still inefficient and opaque energy sector is a major objective of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank programs with Ukraine.

Ukraine is a partner country of the European Union|EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security,
wikt:convergence|convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of Internal energy market|EU internal energy market principles,
supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.<ref>[http://www.inogate.org INOGATE website]</ref>

====Automotive industry====

==== Aircraft and aerospace industry ====
[[File:Antonov An-225 Beltyukov-1.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'', the largest aircraft in the world]]
Ukraine is one of nine countries with a full cycle of [[aerospace]] hardware engineering and production{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Besides to design and production of passenger and transportation [[aircraft]], Ukraine also boasts a network of aircraft repair enterprises, including companies involved in recovery of military planes and [[helicopter]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In March 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created State aircraft building concern «Aviation of Ukraine» (SACAU), which is governed by the Ministry of industrial policy. Production of [[An-148]] aircraft is now one of the most prospective projects for Ukrainian plane manufacturing industry with 35 units manufactured since 2009 (together with Russian production). The aircraft were engineered by Antonov Scientific and Production Complex Design Office ([[Antonov]] ANTK).  The largest single [[airplane]] in the world, [[Antonov An-225 Mriya]] was also designed by Antonov ANTK and made in 1988.  Gross production of light and ultra light planes in Ukraine does not exceed 200 units per annum.  Production of [[hang-glider]]s and [[paraglider]]s of all designs makes nearly 1,000 units each year. Most of produced devices are exported (the buyers of Ukrainian-made ultra light aircraft are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, etc.).

Since the [[Ukrainian crisis]], aerospace industry revenues have fallen by 80%.<ref name="guardian-20160309">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/ukraine-needs-russia-nicolai-petro |title=Why Ukraine needs Russia more than ever |author=Nicolai Petro |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2016 |accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> In June 2016, the Antonov Corporation merged with the state-owned military conglomerate UkrOboronProm, forming Ukrainian Aircraft Corporation within its structure.

====Shipbuilding====
{{main|Shipbuilding in Ukraine}}
[[File:Explorer II South Georgia.jpg|thumb|[[MV Minerva]] − one of the passenger ships built in Ukraine]]
The USSR's collapse put Ukraine's [[shipbuilding]] into a long-term decline. It lasted until 1999 and was mostly due to a minimum volume of state shipbuilding orders. In general, between 1992 till 2003, the 11 [[shipyards]] of the country produced 237 navigation units for a total value of USD 1.5 billion. Production facilities are not working near full capacity, and customers are not always timely in paying for services. Growth of production volumes was witnessed at the enterprises of shipbuilding industry over 2000-2006. State support and the opening of [[free economic zone]]s, foremost at enterprises based in [[Mykolaiv]] were of crucial recent developments in Ukraine's shipbuilding industry. Within the Mykolaiv Special Economic Zone, enterprises like [[Damen Shipyards Okean]], [[Black Sea Shipyard|Chornomorskyi (Black Sea) Shipbuilding Plant]], [[Shipyard named after 61 Communards|61 Communards Shipbuilding Plant]], as well as the Veselka (Rainbow) paint and insulation enterprise are implementing investment projects targeted to raise efficiency and quality in primarily export-oriented vessel building through production upgrades. The new engineering developments and high potential of Ukrainian [[designer]]s give ability to build high quality vessels with competitive prices.
There are 49 shipbuilding companies registered in Ukraine. They are able to build a wide range of vessel types: [[powerboat]]s, [[barge]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s (dry cargo ship), [[tanker (ship)|tankers]], liquefied gas carriers, etc. Ukraine is one of the 10 largest shipbuilding countries in Europe.<ref name="shipbuilding">[http://www.mayger.ua/en/market-review/shipbuilding-in-ukraine-investments-and-government-support/ Shipbuilding in Ukraine]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ukrexport.gov.ua/eng/economy/brief/ukr/201.html |title=Shipbuilding of Ukraine (2007) |access-date=28 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002925/http://ukrexport.gov.ua/eng/economy/brief/ukr/201.html |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Although typically known as the industrial base of the Soviet Union, agriculture is a large part of Ukraine's economy. In 2008 the sector accounted for 8.29% of the country's GDP and by 2012 has grown to 10.43% of the GDP. Agriculture accounted for $13.98 billion value added to the economy of Ukraine in 2012, however despite being a top 10 world producer of several crops such as wheat and corn Ukraine still only ranks 24 out of 112 nations measured in terms of overall agricultural production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Ukraine/Agriculture/All-stats|publisher=Nation Master|title=Ukraine Agriculture Stats|access-date=4 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108144144/http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/profiles/Ukraine/Agriculture/All-stats|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?commodity=corn|publisher=Index Mundi|title=Corn Production by Country in 1000 MT}}</ref> Ukraine is the world's largest producer of [[sunflower]] oil,<ref name="UkrInform">[http://www.blackseagrain.net/about-ukragroconsult/news-bsg/german-expert-sunflower-oil-grows-in-price-in-ukraine-due-to-its-low-world-reserves German expert: Sunflower oil grows in price in Ukraine due to its low world reserves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723025406/http://www.blackseagrain.net/about-ukragroconsult/news-bsg/german-expert-sunflower-oil-grows-in-price-in-ukraine-due-to-its-low-world-reserves |date=23 July 2011 }} [UkrAgroConsult - BlackSeaGrain]</ref> a major global producer of [[grain]] and [[sugar]], and future global player on [[meat]] and [[dairy]] markets.

In 2014 Ukraine total grain crop was estimated to be record 64 million metric tons. However, in 2014 several regions have declared (themselves) independence (and are no longer under control of Ukrainian central authorities) resulting in the [[War in Donbass]] and the [[Crimea Crisis]]{{#tag:ref|[[Crimea]] is currently [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|under dispute by Russia and Ukraine]].<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web|last=Gutterman |first=Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/18/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140318 |title=Putin signs Crimea treaty, will not seize other Ukraine regions |publisher=Reuters.com |accessdate=2014-03-26}}</ref>|group=nb}}, hence the actual available crop yield was closer to 60.5 million metric tons.

However, complex laws and regulations, poor [[corporate governance]], weak enforcement of contract law by courts, and [[Political corruption|corruption]] all continue to stymie direct large-scale foreign investment in Ukraine. While there is a functioning [[stock market]], the lack of protection of shareholders' rights severely restricts portfolio investment activities.

As of April 2011 total foreign direct investment stock in Ukraine stood at $44.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]].<ref>http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/operativ/operativ2007/zd/zd_rik/zd_u/pi_07u.html</ref> Statistics from [[FDi Magazine]] show Ukraine suffered a year on year decline in foreign direct investment between 2010 and 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Trend-Tracker/Ukraine-suffers-year-on-year-FDI-decline | work=fDiIntelligence.com | title=Ukraine suffers year-on-year FDI decline|date=13 August 2013}}</ref>

Many companies, owned by foreigners, have been successfully operating in Ukraine since its independence. These include companies in agriculture, such as [[Kyiv-Atlantic Group]], founded in 1994 by David Sweere. He sold its business in Minnesota and invested in Ukraine, believing in its huge potential. The company has been operating at a profit since 2002. As a result, he became the fifth richest among the Westerners who made their fortune in Ukraine.<ref name="kyivpost.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.kyivpost.com//data/files/01.jpg/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627224211/http://www.kyivpost.com//data/files/01.jpg |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} The 10 Richest Expats in Ukraine by KyivPost</ref>

According to the [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2012-2013 "the country’s most important challenge is the needed overhaul of its institutional framework, which cannot be relied on because it suffers from [[red tape]], lack of transparency, and favoritism".<ref>[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2012-13.pdf The Global Competitiveness Report 2012–2013], [[World Economic Forum]] (2012)</ref>

Since the late 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} the government has pledged to reduce the number of government agencies, streamline the regulatory process, create a legal environment to encourage entrepreneurs, and enact a comprehensive tax overhaul. Outside institutions — particularly the [[International Monetary Fund]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} — have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of reforms and have threatened to withdraw financial support. But reforms in some politically sensitive areas of structural reform and land privatizations are still lagging.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Environmental issues==
{{Update section|date=January 2016}}
Ukraine is interested in cooperating on regional environmental issues. Conservation of natural resources is a stated high priority, although implementation suffers from a lack of financial resources. Ukraine established its first nature preserve, [[Askania-Nova]], in 1921 and has programs to breed [[endangered species]].

The country has significant environmental problems, especially those resulting from the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster]] in 1986 and from industrial pollution. In accordance with its previously announced plans, Ukraine permanently closed the [[Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station]] in December 2000. In November 2001, Ukraine withdrew an application it had made to the [[EBRD]] for funding to complete two new reactor units to compensate for the energy once produced by Chernobyl. Ukrainian concern over reform conditions attached to the loan - particularly tariff increases needed to ensure loan repayment—led the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to withdraw the application on the day the EBRD Board was to have considered final approval. Work on the so-called "object shelter" to permanently entomb the reactor where the world's worst nuclear accident occurred has been slower than anticipated but continues. Design work as well as structural improvements to the "sarcophagus" erected by the Soviet Union are largely complete, and construction on the new shelter was scheduled to begin in 2004.

Ukraine also has established a [[Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources (Ukraine)|Ministry of Environment]] and has introduced a pollution fee system that levies taxes on air and water emissions and solid [[waste disposal]]. The resulting revenues are channelled to environmental protection activities, but enforcement of this pollution fee system is lax.
