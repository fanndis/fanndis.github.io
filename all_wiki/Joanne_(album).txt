'''''Joanne''''' is the fifth studio album<!--Fifth is correct; The Fame was her first, Born This Way was her second, Artpop was her third, Cheek to Cheek was her fourth even if it was a collaborative album--> by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. It was released on October 21, 2016, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]].  Gaga, [[Mark Ronson]] and [[BloodPop]] handled its production with a variety of collaborators including [[Kevin Parker (musician)|Kevin Parker]], [[Emile Haynie]], [[Jeff Bhasker]] and [[Josh Homme]]. Musically, ''Joanne'' is a "stripped-down" [[country music|country]], [[soft rock]] and [[dance-pop]] record, which emphasize the singer's vocal abilities. Lyrically, the album delves into the theme of family and life's emotions; the death of Gaga's aunt Joanne Stefani Germanotta deeply influenced the record.

The release and promotion of the album marked a softening of Gaga's image, who took on a more stripped-down, singer-songwriter-oriented look, consisting mainly of a pink, wide-brimmed [[cowgirl]] hat, vintage denim and pastel colors, evoking the 1970s. The singer's experience working on the television series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' influenced ''Joanne's'' creative process. To promote the album, three singles were released: "[[Perfect Illusion]]", "[[Million Reasons]]" and the [[Joanne (Lady Gaga song)|title track]]. "Perfect Illusion" was released as the album's lead single on September 9, 2016, and reached number one in France, while "Million Reasons" reached number four in the United States. A piano version of the title track was released to radio in selected territories as the album's third single. Gaga promoted the album with her [[Joanne World Tour]] which began in August 2017 and ended in February 2018.

''Joanne'' received generally positive reviews from critics and became Gaga's fourth consecutive album to reach number one in the United States. It also topped the charts in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, the international charts of Japan and Korea, as well as reached the top ten in over 25 countries. It earned [[Music recording certification|certifications]] in some of them. ''Joanne'' was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]]. Two of its singles, "Million Reasons" and "Joanne" were nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]], for which the latter won the award.

Gaga named the album after Joanne Stefani Germanotta, her father's sister. She died on December 18, 1974, at age 19 due to complications arising from [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]].<ref name="joannewho"/> Gaga, whose middle name is Joanne (Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta), recognized her aunt's death had a profound effect on her family<ref name="title1"/> and her work. The booklet in her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), contained a poem titled ''For a Moment'' written by Joanne.<ref name="joannewho"/>

Gaga credits Joanne with helping her overcome addiction problems, and dedicated [[The Fame Ball Tour]] to her. The singer tattooed the date of Joanne's death on her left biceps, between lines of a verse from a poem by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]. The singer's parents opened a restaurant called Joanne Trattoria in New York in 2012. Gaga has often said that although she never met her, Joanne was "one of the most important figures in my life".<ref name="joannewho">{{cite web|last=Redfearn|first=Dominique|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7511076/lady-gaga-joanne-story-behind-album-title|title=Who Is Joanne?

Along with revealing the album's title, Gaga also unveiled the cover artwork.

She added, "Gaga was the first to ever request this hat in pink, because it's her favorite color". Tamez named it "Lady Joanne" and added that Gaga had her change the shape, color and the ribbon on the hat. While designing the cover and the overall image, Tamez and Gaga spoke of using more [[pastel colors]], inspired by the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crocker|first=Lizzie|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/25/lady-gaga-heads-a-hat-renaissance.html|title=Lady Gaga Heads a Hat Renaissance|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=October 25, 2016|accessdate=October 27, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027160135/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/25/lady-gaga-heads-a-hat-renaissance.html|archivedate=October 27, 2016}}</ref>

Family is an underlying theme on ''Joanne''. Gaga explained the album "goes through all of [life]'s emotions".<ref name="rsfamily"/> While crafting it, she envisioned a girl in the middle of the country, who would understand the singer's lyrics and find a human connection. To achieve that, Gaga said in an interview with [[E!]] she decided to encompass an assortment of genres, including "[crossing] between country and funk, pop, dance, rock, electronic music, folk". The tragic early demise of Joanne Germanotta added to the emotional quotient of the songs, as well as to their lyrics. Along with identity, feelings such as loss, heartbreak, frustration, desire and nostalgia also influenced the album. The singer clarified that with ''Joanne'' she wanted to go "out into the world&nbsp;... bringing with me its deepest stories that I have of my life and turning them into songs that I hope will touch people in a deep and meaningful way about their own lives and their own stories."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/803141/heartbreak-loss-lust-and-illusion-decoding-lady-gaga-s-emotional-lyrics-from-joanne|title=Heartbreak, Loss, Lust and Illusion: Decoding Lady Gaga's Emotional Lyrics From Joanne|last=Schnurr|first=Samantha|date=October 21, 2016|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=October 21, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209181457/http://www.eonline.com/news/803141/heartbreak-loss-lust-and-illusion-decoding-lady-gaga-s-emotional-lyrics-from-joanne|archivedate=February 9, 2017}}</ref>

The singer's experience working on ''American Horror Story'' influenced ''Joanne''{{'}}s creative process. Gaga mentioned: "I have returned to something I've believed in so much, which is the art of darkness."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/27/lady-gaga-american-horror-story-music|title=Lady Gaga Says American Horror Story Experience Will 'Inform' Her Upcoming Music|last=Stack|first=Tim|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=August 27, 2015|accessdate=August 29, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828133408/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/27/lady-gaga-american-horror-story-music|archivedate=August 28, 2015}}</ref> Being on the show also impacted her vocals. She explained that she would "listen" more to the music and then write. She added that ''Joanne'' would talk less about her painful time during the ''Artpop'' era and would have more clarity; "Now I'm thinking more about what it is I want to say and what I want to leave on Earth. It's less an expression of all my pain", she concluded.<ref name="fifthalbum"/> The album became an outlet for the singer to relieve herself of the "pain and anguish" she felt from the constant expectations people had of her music.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/17/lady-gaga-next-album-everything-we-know|title=Everything we know about Lady Gaga's next album|last=Nolfi|first=Joey|date=August 17, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818175544/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/17/lady-gaga-next-album-everything-we-know|archivedate=August 18, 2016}}</ref>

Other influences came from the men in Gaga's life, from her father Joe Germanotta and ex-fiancé [[Taylor Kinney]]. She said that using her "rebellious spirit" she wanted to understand the different relationships she had gone through, saying that ''Joanne'' was not a "sad album. It's an album that is very revealing of me as a woman".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-album-joanne-absolutely-influenced-fiance/story?id=42508932|title=Lady Gaga Says New Album 'Joanne' Is 'Absolutely' Influenced by Ex-Fiance|last=McKenzie|first=Joe|date=October 13, 2016|accessdate=October 21, 2016|publisher=[[ABC News]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022023036/https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lady-gaga-album-joanne-absolutely-influenced-fiance/story?id=42508932|archivedate=October 22, 2016}}</ref> According to Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', "The act of being Lady Gaga had drowned out the brilliant music, and the importance of Lady Gaga had somehow muddied the simple pleasure of being her fan: It was her authenticity, in all of its strangeness and lofty artistic pursuit, that spoke to us. That seemed to have gone missing." He felt that with ''Joanne'', Gaga was able to eliminate that redundancy and present herself as an "evolved performer", who could lay down bare emotions in the songs, rather than "mask" them in [[electronic music]] beats.<ref name="beast">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/21/joanne-unveils-lady-gaga-s-shocking-next-act-being-normal.html|title=Joanne' Unveils Lady Gaga's Shocking Next Act: Being Normal|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=October 21, 2016|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022163758/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/21/joanne-unveils-lady-gaga-s-shocking-next-act-being-normal.html|archivedate=October 22, 2016}}</ref>

Since Gaga did not want to restrict the music on ''Joanne'' to any particular genre, the album includes styles from dance-rock to introspective [[country music]]. The singer professed a fascination with all aspects of country music, which in turn influenced the album's music.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/lady-gaga-talks-garth-brooks-fandom-country-influences-w445181|title=Lady Gaga Talks Garth Brooks Fandom, New Album's Country Influence|last=Hudak|first=Joseph|date=October 17, 2016|accessdate=October 22, 2016|work=Rolling Stone|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020054543/http://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/lady-gaga-talks-garth-brooks-fandom-country-influences-w445181|archivedate=October 20, 2016}}</ref> In terms of production and composition, ''Joanne'' continued the "stripped-down" approach to music Gaga had taken following ''Artpop'', emphasizing her vocals and the songwriting.<ref name="beast"/> In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Gaga said the tracks consisted of "stories about my family, my sister, my father and his sister.

The electronic "[[John Wayne (song)|John Wayne]]" is more tongue-in-cheek lyrically, with Gaga including [[cowboy]] references in the lyrics: "I just love a cowboy, I know it's bad, but I'm, like, can I just hang off the back of your horse and can you go a little faster?".<ref name="hptrack"/> Gaga's vocals are accompanied by Homme's guitar, and the track alludes to her previous relationships, with comparisons to actor [[John Wayne]].<ref name="bbin"/><ref name="ibtimes"/> The Beck-composed track "Dancin' in Circles" is a pop song, consisting of a dance beat, a spoken-word [[Bridge (music)|middle 8]] section, and lyrics about having a good time by oneself.<ref name="hptrack"/> It was described by Nicholas Mojica of the ''[[International Business Times]]'' as an "ode to [[masturbation]]".

According to Mark Savage of [[BBC Music]], "[[Perfect Illusion]]" is a [[Dance-rock|disco-rock]] song, composed around a building chord sequence, which he felt leads to a "compelling sense of urgency".

==Promotion==
Chris Willman of ''Billboard'' wrote that the promotional "blitz" for ''Joanne'' "felt like something from a bygone era" due to the traditional route taken by Gaga and her team, in place of surprise album launches. During her interview on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' Gaga confirmed that she wanted to promote ''Joanne'' in the "old-school style". The events leading up to the release were described by Willman as "the most culturally ubiquitous rollout since [[Taylor Swift]]'s ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' two years ago".<ref name="joannepromo"/> He theorized that after the perceived commercial disappointment with ''Artpop'', Gaga's management wanted to make sure of a comeback with ''Joanne''. Adding to this was the musical and stylistic change that Gaga underwent with the release, which would have confused her core audience and fans without promotion. Willman concluded that the promo would "provide a pre-[[Super Bowl LI halftime show|Super Bowl]] primer to Middle America&nbsp;— that somewhere between the [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|meat dress]] and the Tony Bennett collaboration, Gaga has settled into a middle path".<ref name="joannepromo">{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7556921/lady-gaga-joanne-promo-blitz-industry|title=Will Lady Gaga's Old-School Promo Blitz for 'Joanne' Pay Off?

''Billboard'' ranked it as the 32nd-best album of 2016, adding that the "kitchen-sink pop album" had an "instant-classic breakup ballad" in "Million Reasons", which enabled Gaga to reclaim "her sweet spot with ''Joanne''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/photos/7597536/billboards-50-best-albums-of-2016-critics-picks/20|title=50 Best Albums of 2016|work=Billboard|date=December 14, 2016|accessdate=December 14, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215035502/http://www.billboard.com/photos/7597536/billboards-50-best-albums-of-2016-critics-picks/20|archivedate=December 15, 2016}}</ref> ''Digital Spy''{{'}}s Lewis Corner placed the record at number nine, believing that "simplicity" was the key to the album's success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a816398/best-albums-of-2016/|title=20 best albums of 2016: who have we crowned No.1?|work=Digital Spy|last=Corner|first=Lewis|date=December 8, 2016|accessdate=December 12, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211220200/http://www.digitalspy.com/music/feature/a816398/best-albums-of-2016/|archivedate=December 11, 2016}}</ref> ''Joanne'' was ''NME'' magazine's 20th-best album of the year, with the publication highlighting how it hearkened back to the stripped-down sound employed by Gaga in her early years as an artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/nme-best-albums-2016-1869261|title=NME's Albums of the Year 2016|work=[[NME]]|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=November 24, 2016|last=Bartleet|first=Larry|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124161104/http://www.nme.com/list/nme-best-albums-2016-1869261|archivedate=November 24, 2016}}</ref> For ''Rolling Stone'', the album was the seventh-best release of 2016, with a writer from the magazine feeling that, "Gaga's soft-rock transformation takes the pop star into a new direction without losing her flair for the dramatic and penchant for the kitschy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-best-pop-albums-of-2016-w455459/lady-gaga-joanne-w455570|title=Rolling Stone's 20 Best pop albums of 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 19, 2016|accessdate=December 19, 2016|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221143037/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/20-best-pop-albums-of-2016-w455459/lady-gaga-joanne-w455570|archivedate=December 21, 2016}}</ref> The album was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]], while "Million Reasons" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniel|title=Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars Lead 2018 Grammy Nominees|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-kendrick-lamar-bruno-mars-lead-2018-grammy-nominees-w512734|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=November 28, 2017|date=November 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129223333/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jay-z-kendrick-lamar-bruno-mars-lead-2018-grammy-nominees-w512734|archive-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> "Million Reasons" was one of the award-winning songs at the [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/2018-bmi-pop-awards|title=Mark Ronson Receives the BMI Champion Award at the 66th BMI Pop Awards|publisher=Broadcast Music, Inc.|date=May 8, 2018|accessdate=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509155757/https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/2018-bmi-pop-awards|archivedate=May 9, 2018}}</ref> The piano version of the title track won Best Pop Solo Performance at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/lady-gaga|title=Lady Gaga: Grammy Artist List|date=February 10, 2019|accessdate=February 10, 2019|publisher=The Recording Academy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190210021540/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/lady-gaga|archive-date=February 10, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
