==Career==
Del Toro surfaced in small television roles during the late 1980s, playing mostly thugs and drug dealers on programs such as ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and the NBC miniseries ''[[Drug Wars: The Camarena Story]]''. He appeared in the 1987 music video for [[Madonna]]'s song "[[La Isla Bonita]]" as a background character sitting on a car hood. Film roles followed, beginning with his debut in ''[[Big Top Pee-wee]]'' (1988) and as Dario in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989),<ref name="actors"/> in which 21-year-old del Toro held the distinction of being the youngest actor ever to play a Bond [[henchman]]. Del Toro continued to appear in film including ''[[The Indian Runner]]'' (1991), ''[[China Moon]]'' (1994), ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'' (1992), ''[[Money for Nothing (1993 film)|Money for Nothing]]'' (1993), ''[[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]'' (1993) and ''[[Swimming with Sharks]]'' (1994).

His career gained momentum in 1995 with his breakout performance in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', where he played the mumbling, wisecracking Fred Fenster.<ref name="actors"/> The role won him an [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male]] and established him as a character actor. This led to stronger roles in independent and major studio films, including playing Gaspare in [[Abel Ferrara]]'s ''[[The Funeral (1996 film)|The Funeral]]'' (1996) and winning a second consecutive Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his work as Benny Dalmau in ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), directed by his friend, artist [[Julian Schnabel]]. Del Toro also shared the screen with [[Robert De Niro]] in the big-budget thriller ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'' (1996), in which he played Juan Primo, a charismatic Puerto Rican baseball star. He subsequently starred opposite [[Alicia Silverstone]] in ''[[Excess Baggage (1997 film)|Excess Baggage]]'' (1997), which Silverstone produced.

For ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', the 1998 film adaptation of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s famous book, he gained more than 40&nbsp;lbs. (about 18&nbsp;kg) to play [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]] (a.k.a. [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]), Thompson's lawyer and drug-fiend cohort.<ref name="actors"/> The surrealistic film, directed by [[Terry Gilliam]], has earned a [[cult film|cult following]] over the years.

Del Toro's performances in four films in 2000 gained him a mainstream audience. First, the crime yarn ''[[The Way of the Gun]]'' reunited him with ''The Usual Suspects'' screenwriter [[Christopher McQuarrie]]. A few months later, he stood out among a first-rate ensemble cast in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''Traffic'', a complex dissection of the North American [[war on Drugs|drug wars]]. As Javier Rodriguez — a Mexican border policeman struggling to remain honest amid the corruption and deception of illegal drug trafficking — del Toro, who spoke most of his lines in Spanish, gave a performance that dominated the film.<ref name="actors"/> His performance swept all of the major critics' awards in 2001. Del Toro won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], becoming the fourth living Oscar winner whose winning role was a character who speaks predominantly in a non-English language. Del Toro is also the third Puerto Rican actor to win an Oscar, after [[Jose Ferrer]] and [[Rita Moreno]].<ref name="actors"/> The year he won his Oscar marked the first time that two actors born in Puerto Rico were nominated in the same category (the other actor was [[Joaquin Phoenix]]). In his acceptance speech, del Toro thanked the people of both [[Nogales, Arizona]] and [[Nogales, Sonora]] and dedicated his award to them. In addition to the Oscar, he also won the [[Golden Globe Award]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] award for Best Actor. ''Traffic'' was also a success at the box office. This was soon followed by a small role as the [[diamond]] thief Franky Four Fingers in [[Guy Ritchie]]'s hip caper comedy ''Snatch'' and a role as a [[intellectual disability|mentally challenged]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] man in ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'', directed by his old friend [[Sean Penn]].<ref name="actors"/>

In 2003, del Toro appeared in two films: ''[[The Hunted (2003 film)|The Hunted]]'', co-starring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and the drama ''[[21 Grams]]'', co-starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Naomi Watts]]. He went on to earn another [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] Oscar nomination for his performance in the latter. He then appeared in the [[film adaptation]] of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[graphic novel]] ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]], and ''[[Things We Lost in the Fire (film)|Things We Lost in the Fire]]'', the English-language debut of celebrated Danish director [[Susanne Bier]].
