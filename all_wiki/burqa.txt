The Arab version of the burqa is called the '''[[boshiya]]''', and is usually black in color.

The term ''burqa'' is sometimes conflated with ''[[niqāb]]''. In more precise usage, niqab is a face veil that leaves the eyes uncovered, while a burqa covers the entire body from the top of the head to the ground, with only a mesh screen allowing the wearer to see in front of her. The burqa is also not to be confused with the [[hijab]], a garment which covers the hair, neck and all or part of the chest, but not the face.<ref>

The burqa and other types of face veils have been attested since pre-Islamic times. Face veiling has not been regarded as a religious requirement by most Islamic scholars, past or present. However, some scholars, especially those belonging to the [[Salafi movement]], view it as obligatory for women in the presence of non-related (''[[mahram]]'') males. Women may wear the burqa for a number of reasons, including compulsion, as was the case in [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Afghanistan during Taliban rule]].

==Pre-Islamic use of the face veil==

[[File:Temple_of_baal07(js).jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Islamic relief showing veiled Middle Eastern women, [[Temple of Bel|Temple of Baal]], Palmyra, Syria, 1st century CE.]]

The face veil was originally part of women's dress among certain classes in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was adopted into Muslim culture during the Arab conquest of the Middle East.<ref>See for instance F. R. C. Bagley, "Introduction", in B. Spuler, ''A History of the Muslim World. The Age of the Caliphs'', 1995, X; for a different view T. Dawson, "Propriety, practicality and pleasure : the parameters of women's dress in Byzantium, A.D. 1000-1200", in L. Garland (ed.), ''Byzantine women: varieties of experience 800-1200'', 2006, 41-76.</ref>

However, although Byzantine art before Islam commonly depicts women with veiled heads or covered hair, it does not depict women with veiled faces. In addition, the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], writing in the first century AD, refers to some [[Medes|Median]] women veiling their faces;<ref>''Geography'' 11.13.9-10.:"[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D13%3Asection%3D10 Some say that Medeia introduced this kind of dress when she, along with Jason, held dominion in this region, even concealing her face whenever she went out in public in place of the king] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221063028/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D13%3Asection%3D10 |date=21 December 2016 }}"</ref> and the early third-century Christian writer [[Tertullian]] clearly refers in his treatise ''The Veiling of Virgins'' to some "pagan" women of "Arabia" wearing a veil that covers not only their head but also the entire face.<ref>''The Veiling of Virgins'' Ch. 17. Tertullian writes, "The pagan women of Arabia, who not only cover their head but their whole face, so that they would rather enjoy half the light with one eye free than prostitute the face, will judge you. (''Judicabunt vos Arabiae feminae ethnicae quae non-caput, sed faciem totam tegunt, ut uno oculo liberato contentae sint dimidiam frui lucem quam totam faciem prostituere'')."</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria]] commends the contemporary use of face coverings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/02093.htm |title=Clement of Alexandria, 'Going to Church' Chapter XI, Book 3, Paedagogus |quote=Woman and man are to go to church decently attired, with natural step, embracing silence, possessing unfeigned love, pure in body, pure in heart, fit to pray to God.

Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|author=Hadia Mubarak}}</ref> have agreed that women are not required to cover their face.

=== Scriptural sources ===

Although the Quran commands both men and women to behave modestly and contains no precise prescription for how women should dress, certain Quranic verses have been used in exegetical discussions of face veiling. Coming after a verse which instructs men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, verse 24:31 instructs women to do the same, providing additional detail:<ref name=mubarak/><ref name=siddiqui>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Siddiqui, Mona | year= 2006 | title=Veil |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|publisher=Brill| doi= 10.1163/1875-3922_q3_EQCOM_00103 }}</ref>

{{quote|Tell the believing women to lower their eyes, guard their private parts (''furuj''), and not display their charms (''zina'') except what is apparent outwardly, and cover their bosoms with their veils (''khumur'', sing. ''khimar'') and not to show their finery except to their husbands or their fathers or fathers-in-law [...]}}

The verse goes on to list a number of other types of exempted males. Classical Quranic commentators differed in their interpretation of the phrase "except what is apparent outwardly". Some argued that it referred to face and hands, implying that these body parts need not be covered, while others disagreed.<ref name=mubarak/><ref name=siddiqui/>

Another passage, known as the "mantle verse" (33:59), has been interpreted as establishing women's security as a rationale for veiling:<ref name=siddiqui/>

{{quote|O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the women of the faithful, to draw their wraps (''jalabib'', sing. ''jilbab'') over them. They will thus be recognized and no harm will come to them. God is forgiving and kind.}}

Based on the context of the verse and early Islamic literature, this verse has been generally understood as establishing a way to protect the Muslim women from a hostile faction who had molested them on the streets of Medina, claiming that they confused them with slave girls.<ref name=siddiqui/><ref name=amer26-28>{{Cite book|first=Sahar  |last=Amer | year=2014 | title=What Is Veiling? |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press (Kindle edition)|pages=26–28}}</ref>

The exact nature of garments referred to in these verses, ''khimar'' and ''jilbab'', has been debated by traditional and modern scholars.<ref name=siddiqui/><ref name=amer26-28/>

Islamic scholars who hold that face veiling is not obligatory also base this on a narration from one of the canonical [[hadith]] collections (sayings attributed to [[Muhammad]]), in which he tells Asma', the daughter of [[Abu Bakr]]: "O Asmaʿ, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this", pointing to her face and hands (Abū Dawūd, Book 32, Number 4092).<ref name=mubarak/> According to [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], traditional hadith scholars have not viewed this narration as providing proof on its own, because its recorded chain of transmission made them uncertain about its authenticity, but those who argued that face veiling is not required have used it as supporting evidence strengthened by other textual sources, such as those recording customary practice at the time of Muhammad and his companions.<ref name=qaradawi/>

===Classical jurisprudence===

When veiling was discussed in early [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] beyond the context of [[Salah|prayer]], it was generally considered an "issue of social status and physical safety". Later, during the medieval era, Islamic jurists began to devote more attention to the notion of ''[[Intimate parts in Islam|awra]]'' (intimate parts) and the question of whether women should cover their faces.<ref name=bucar54>{{Cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Bucar| year=2013 | title=The Islamic Veil: A Beginner's Guide |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] (Kindle edition)|pages=54–55}}</ref> The majority opinion which emerged during that time, predominant among [[Maliki]] and [[Hanafi]] jurists, held that women should cover everything except their faces in public. In contrast, most medieval [[Hanbali]] and [[Shafi'i]] jurists counted a woman's face among the ''awra'', concluding that it should be veiled, except for the eyes.<ref name=siddiqui/><ref name=bucar54/> The Hanbali jurist [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d. 1328 CE) was an influential proponent of the latter view, while the Hanafi scholar [[Burhan al-Din al-Marghinani]] (d. 1197 CE) stressed that it was particularly important for a woman to leave her face and hands uncovered during everyday business dealing with men. There was a difference of opinion on this question within the legal schools.<ref name=bucar54/> Thus, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] quotes classical Shafi'i and Hanbali jurists stating that covering the face is not obligatory.<ref name=qaradawi/>

In the [[Ja'fari|Shi'a Ja'fari school of fiqh]], covering the face is not obligatory.<ref>{{cite web

===Salafi views===
According to the Salafi point of view, it is obligatory (fard) for a woman to cover her entire body when in public or in presence of non-mahram men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/21536|title=Awrah|date=7 March 2008|author=IslamQA.info|publisher=IslamQ&A|accessdate=2 June 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617151221/http://islamqa.info/en/ref/21536|archivedate=17 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.com/en/ref/11774|title=Ruling on covering the face, with detailed evidence|date=7 March 2008|author=IslamQA.info|publisher=IslamQ&A|accessdate=2 June 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929001126/http://islamqa.com/en/ref/11774|archivedate=29 September 2008}}</ref> Some interpretations say that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind, asexual or gay men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/92753/blind |title=Is it permissible to take off the khimar in front of a blind man? |website=Islamqa.info |date=2006-11-07 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&FatwaId=113271 |title=Women revealing their adornment to men who lack physical desire - Islam web ladies' |website=Islamweb |accessdate=2017-02-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084325/http://www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php?page=showfatwa&FatwaId=113271 |archivedate=27 December 2016}}</ref><ref>''Queer Spiritual Spaces: Sexuality and Sacred Places'', p. 89, Kath Browne, Sally Munt, Andrew K.

The Salafi scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]] wrote a book expounding his view that the face veil is not a binding obligation upon Muslim women, while he was a teacher at [[Islamic University of Madinah]]. His opponents within the Saudi establishment ensured that his contract with the university was allowed to lapse without renewal.<ref name=glo66>Meijer, ''Global Salafism'', pg. 66.</ref>

===Reasons for wearing===

There exists no single reason why women may wear the burqa, and this practice must be understood within a particular social context. A woman may wear it to express her piety, her views on sexual modesty, her rejection of Western notions of sexuality, her desire for increased mobility or privacy in a social environment dominated by men, or her membership in a political movement. In the most publicized context, women were required, often against their will, to wear the burqa by the [[Taliban]] as a matter of policy during their rule of Afghanistan.<ref name=campo/>

Chadaree use in the remainder of Afghanistan is variable and is observed to be gradually declining in Kabul.

Some years ago {{When|date=May 2019}}, a group of [[Haredi]] (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish women in Israel began donning the Burqa as a symbol of piety.

[[Syria]] is a [[Baathist]] state and discourages the wearing of [[hijab]].

In 2017 the government of [[Tajikistan]] passed a law requiring people to "stick to traditional national clothes and culture", which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tajikstan passes law 'to stop Muslim women wearing hijabs'|author=Harriet Agerholm|date=1 September 2017|newspaper=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tajikstan-muslim-hijabs-stop-women-law-headscarfs-central-asia-islam-a7923886.html }}</ref>

====France====
{{Main|French ban on face covering}}
Wearing the burqa has not been allowed in French public schools since 2004 when it was judged to be a religious symbol like the Christian cross. This ruling was the application of an established 1905 law that prohibits students and staff from wearing any clearly visible religious symbols. The law relates to the time where the [[Secularism in France|secular French state]] took over control of most schools from the [[Catholic Church]]. It does not apply to private or religious schools. This was followed on 22 June 2009, when the [[Nicolas Sarkozy|president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy]], said that burqas are "not welcome" in France, commenting that "In our country, we cannot accept that women be prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity".<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicolas Sarkozy: burqa not welcome in France |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 June 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/5603070/Nicolas-Sarkozy-burqa-not-welcome-in-France.html|accessdate=23 August 2010|location=London|first1=Our|last1=Foreign}}</ref> The [[French National Assembly]] appointed 32 lawmakers from right- and left-wing parties to a six-month fact-finding mission to look at ways of restricting its use.<ref>{{cite news|title=France sets up burka commission|work=BBC News|date=23 June 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8114590.stm|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> On 26 January 2010, the commission reported that access to public services and public transport should be barred to those wearing the burqa. On Tuesday 13 July 2010 the Assembly overwhelmingly approved a bill banning burqas and [[niqab]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doland|first=Angela|title=France Burqa Ban: French Parliament Approves Ban on Face Veils|work=The Huffington Post|date=13 July 2010|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/13/france-burqa-ban-french-p_n_644433.html|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>

On 14 September 2010, the [[French Senate]] overwhelmingly [[French ban on face covering|approved a ban]] on burqas in public, with the law becoming effective beginning on 11 April 2011. When the measure was sent in May to the parliament they said "Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place".<ref>French Senate Approves Burqa Ban (CNN)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/14/france.burqa.ban/index.html?hpt=T2|title=CNN – French Senate approves burqa ban|publisher=CNN|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref>

The ban is officially called "The bill to forbid concealing one's face in public". "It refers neither to Islam nor to veils. Officials insist the law against face-covering is not discriminatory because it would apply to everyone, not just Muslims. They cite a host of exceptions, including motorcycle helmets, or masks for health reasons, fencing, skiing or carnivals".<ref>{{cite news|last=Doland|first=Angela|title=France Burqa Ban: French Parliament Approves Ban on Face Veils|work=The Huffington Post|date=13 July 2010|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/13/france-burqa-ban-french-p_n_644433.html|accessdate=10 February 2011}}</ref>

====Germany====
In a 2016 speech, accepting her nomination for reelection, the German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] called for banning the burqa in Germany "wherever legally possible", which was interpreted as support for the earlier proposal by Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]] to outlaw full-face veils in public buildings.

In August 2017, the state of [[Lower Saxony]] banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools. This change in the law was prompted by a Muslim pupil in [[Osnabrück]] who wore the garment to school for years and refused to take it off.

====Italy====
In Italy, by an anti-terrorism Law passed in 1975, it is forbidden to wear any dress that hides the face of a person. At that time, Italy was facing domestic (not Islam-related) terrorism.

On 27 January 2012, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning any clothing that would hide the wearer's identity.

On 22 May 2015, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning wearing a burqa in public places. Public places would have included public transportation, educational institutes, public health institutes, and government buildings. In the courtroom a burqa or a nikab could not be worn. In the public space a burqa and nikab would have been allowed. Police officers could have requested one to remove face-covering clothing for identification purposes. There were exceptions, such as during carnival or other festivities, and when face-covering clothing was necessary as a sports or job requirement. Opposition party D66 commented on the burqa abolishment as tokenism, while PVV labelled the ban unsatisfactory. Minister of Internal Affairs, Plasterk, has stated that setting a norm is important.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kabinet stemt in met boerkaverbod|newspaper=NRC Handelsblad|date=22 May 2015|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2015/05/22/kabinet-stemt-in-met-beperkt-boerkaverbod/|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weinig bijval voor boerka-plan|publisher=NOS|date=22 May 2015|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/2037001-weinig-bijval-voor-boerka-plan.html|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref>

The May 2015 bill did not pass either, but a new bill was proposed in November 2015, which was eventually made into law. On 26 June 2018, a partial ban on face covering (including burqas) on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions was enacted, with a number of exceptions.<ref name="edition.cnn.com"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/06/27/it-took-10-years-but-the-dutch-far-right-finally-managed-to-pass-a-burqa-ban/|title=It took 10 years, but the Dutch far right finally managed to pass a burqa ban|last=Mellen|first=Ruby|date=27 June 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=28 June 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/world/europe/netherlands-face-covering-ban.html|title=Netherlands Approves Partial Ban on Face Coverings|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=27 June 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 June 2018|last2=Stack|first2=Liam|language=en}}</ref>
From 1 August 2019 a national burka ban was introduced in the Netherlands.

As of August 2019, 200-400 Dutch women are believed to wear a burqa or niqab.<ref>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dutch-burqa-ban-unworkable-on-first-day-as-police-transport-refuse-to-enforce-it</ref>

====Norway====
In June 2018, the parliament of Norway passed a bill banning clothing covering the face at educational institutions as well as daycare centres, which included face-covering Islamic veils. The prohibition applies to pupils and staff alike.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.no/20180606/norway-bans-burqa-and-niqab-in-schools|title=Norway bans burqa and niqab in schools|date=2018-06-06|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713072525/https://www.thelocal.no/20180606/norway-bans-burqa-and-niqab-in-schools|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bt.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/8wKd2W/Vedtok-forbud-mot-nikab-i-alle-undervisningssituasjoner|title=Nå blir det forbudt med nikab i norske skoler|work=Bergens Tidende|access-date=2018-06-10|language=nb-NO}}</ref>

==== Sweden ====
In 2012, a poll by [[Uppsala University]] found that Swedes responded that face-covering Islamic veils are either completely unacceptable or fairly unacceptable, 85% for the burqa and 81% for the [[Niqāb|niqab]]. The researchers noted these figures represented a compact resistance to the face-covering veil by the population of Sweden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uppsalauniversitet.se/nyheter-press/pressmeddelanden/pressmeddelande-visning/?id=1844&typ=pm|title=Mångfaldsbarometern 2012: Extremt negativa attityder permanentas och riskerar växa - Uppsala universitet|website=uppsalauniversitet.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-07-12|quote=Svaren innebär att motståndet i Sverige mot Burka och Niqab är kompakt, 84,4 respektive 81,6 procent anser att de är ganska eller helt oacceptabla.

In December 2019, the municipality of [[Skurup]] banned Islamic veils in educational institutions. Earlier, the municipality of [[Staffanstorp]] approved a similar ban.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=96&artikel=7369615|title=Skurup förbjuder slöja i skolan|last=Malmöhus|first=P4|work=Sveriges Radio|access-date=2019-12-19|language=sv}}</ref>

====Switzerland====
The burka was outlawed in the canton of [[Ticino]] after a citizen initiative to hold a referendum. With 65% in favour of a ban and it was ruled that the ban was constitutional, the ban took effect in July 2016. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to CHF 10,000.<ref name="independent_8July2016">{{cite news|title=Muslims face fines up to £8,000 for wearing burkas in Switzerland|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/muslims-fined-8000-wearing-burkas-niqab-switzerland-ticino-islamic-dress-a7124586.html|accessdate=8 July 2016|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>

In September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of [[St. Gallen|St Gallen]]. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-burqas/swiss-canton-becomes-second-to-ban-burqas-in-public-idUSKCN1M30J2|title=Swiss canton becomes second to ban burqas in public|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|United Kingdom debate over veils}}
Face veils have caused debate in the United Kingdom. A senior member of the previous government, [[Jack Straw]], asked Muslim women from his constituency to remove any veils covering their faces during face-to-face meetings with him. He explained to the media that this was a request, not a demand, and that he made sure that a woman staffer remained in the room during the meeting. A media outcry followed{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. Some Muslim groups said that they understood his concerns, but others rejected them as prejudicial.<ref>{{cite news|title='Remove full veils' urges Straw|work=BBC News|date=6 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5411954.stm|accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> A poll in 2011 indicated that 66 percent of British people supported banning the burqa in all public places.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two-thirds Brits want burqa ban|work=[[YouGov]]|date=14 April 2011|url=http://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/04/14/two-thirds-brits-want-burqa-ban/|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref> However, a ban on burqas was ruled out by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government, and in 2018 [[Theresa May]] stated "we do not support a ban on the wearing of the veil in public".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45083275|agency=BBC|title=Boris Johnson faces criticism over burka 'letter box' jibe|date=6 April 2018}}</ref>

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In 2010, Australian Liberal Senator [[Cory Bernardi]] called for the burqa to be banned in Australia, branding it "un-Australian". The ban did not go ahead but the debate about the burqa continues.<ref>{{cite news|title=Burqa bans: thinly veiled discrimination?|url=http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/voices/poll-position/burqa-bans-thinly-veiled-discrimination.htm|accessdate=15 December 2011|newspaper=Australian Times|date=14 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509165004/http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/voices/poll-position/burqa-bans-thinly-veiled-discrimination.htm|archive-date=9 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/burqua-ruling-must-be-made-by-sa-speaker-lyn-breuer/story-e6frea6u-1225944811804|title=Demand for hijab ruling causes uproar in State Parliament|publisher=Adelaide Now|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, Carnita Matthews of Sydney was sentenced to six months jail for making a statement accusing a police officer of attempting to forcibly lift her niqab, which news sources initially referred to incorrectly as a burqa.<ref name="costs">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/burqa-wearing-woman-carnita-matthews-to-seek-costs/story-e6frfkvr-1226080347298|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Burqa wearing-woman Carnita Matthews to seek legal costs|date=23 June 2011}}</ref> The officer had pulled her over for a random breath test and then ticketed her for a licence infringement. Matthews allegedly then submitted a signed complaint to a police station while wearing a niqab. Judge Clive Jeffreys overturned the conviction in June 2011, citing what he thought were differences between the signature on her license and that on the complaint.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fife-Yeomans|first=Janet|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/new-twist-in-carnita-matthews-burqa-case/story-e6freuzi-1226085143698|title=No covering up similar signatures in Carnita Matthews burqa case|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 July 2011|accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref> She then proceeded to seek legal costs.<ref name="costs"/> Matthews was subsequently revealed to have a considerable record of unpaid fines and licence revocations that cast doubt on her character.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/muslim-woman-accused-of-making-false-police-statement-avoids-jail-over-identity-doubt/news-story/5b693561f28957a281b53049291e7932 |title=Carnita Matthew, accused of making a false statement, has history of not paying fines|date= 22 June 2011|website=www.news.com.au}}</ref>
On 4 July 2011, New South Wales became the first Australian state to pass laws allowing police to demand that burqas (and other head gear such as motorcycle helmets) be removed when asking for identification.

In October 2014, the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra decreed that female visitors wearing a face covering would have to sit in the separated glassed-in areas of the public gallery normally reserved for schoolchildren. This was in response to a planned disruptive action by a political activist group. Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that he opposed this restriction.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-02/abbott-seeks-to-overturn-parliament-burka-restrictions/5787072 "Tony Abbott steps in to have Parliament House burka restrictions overturned"].

In August 2017, Senator [[Pauline Hanson]] arrived at the Senate wearing a burqa in protest, calling for the garment to be banned. Following the incident, [[ReachTEL]] polled 2,832 Australians and found that the majority supported banning the wearing of the burqa in public places.<ref>ReachTEL survey (23 August 2017)

===Canada===
====Quebec====

On 18 October 2017, the Quebec provincial government passed bill 21,<ref>http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-21-42-1.html</ref> which requires people to show their face when giving or receiving public services. The bill allows exemptions (including for religious motives) on a "case by case" basis, but despite this, the legislation was still regarded as a ban on burqas and niqabs by its detractors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boissinot|first=Jacques|title=How will Quebec's Bill 21 work?

{{As of|2018|July}}, the ban has been suspended by at least two judges for violating the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. It was first suspended in December 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-religion-quebec-lawsuit/canadian-judge-suspends-quebec-niqab-ban-idUSKBN1DW01B|title=Canadian judge suspends Quebec niqab ban|last=Paperny|first=Anna Mehler|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ca.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idCAKBN1JO3CI-OCADN|title=Second Canadian judge suspends Quebec niqab ban|last=Paperny|first=Anna Mehler|work=CA|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-CA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-bill-62-face-covering-july1-1.4724863|title=Judge suspends Quebec face-covering ban, says it appears to violate charter {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}</ref>
