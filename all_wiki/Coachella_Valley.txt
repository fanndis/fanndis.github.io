The '''Coachella Valley''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|oʊ|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|ə}} {{respell|KOH|ə|CHEL|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|l|ə}} {{respell|koh|CHEL|ə}})<ref>''Languagehat.com'' which quotes {{cite book|title=California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names|publisher=Gudde and Bright|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001249.php|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> is an arid [[rift valley]] in the [[Colorado Desert]] of [[Southern California|Southern California's]] [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]].  The valley extends approximately {{convert|45|mi|abbr=on}} southeast from the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] to the northern shore of the [[Salton Sea]], and is approximately {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} wide along most of its length. It is bounded on the northeast by the [[San Bernardino Mountains|San Bernardino]] and [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]], and on the southwest by the [[San Jacinto Mountains|San Jacinto]] and [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa Mountains]].

The Valley is best known as the location of several wintertime resort cities, especially [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], that are popular destinations for [[Snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]—people who live in cold climates and seek out warmer weather during the winter. The valley is also known for a number of annual events, including the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], the [[Stagecoach Festival|Stagecoach Country Music Festival]], and the [[Riverside County Fair and National Date Festival]], all held in [[Indio, California|Indio]]. Other events include the [[Modernism Week|Palm Springs Modernism Week]], [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]], the [[ANA Inspiration]] and [[Desert Classic]] golf tournaments, and the [[Indian Wells Masters]] tennis tournament.

In addition to Palm Springs and the area's largest city [[Indio, California|Indio]], the valley is home to the resort cities of [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]], [[Indian Wells, California|Indian Wells]], [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]], [[Palm Desert, California|Palm Desert]], and [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]]. Because it is a major winter destination, the valley's population fluctuates from almost 500,000 in April to around 200,000 in July and around 800,000 by January.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is estimated that 3.5 million conventioneers and tourists visit the valley each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rc-hr.com/DesertJobs/tabid/1473/Default.aspx |title=Desert Jobs |publisher=Riverside County HR Dept. |date=March 2013 |access-date=12 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701201547/http://rc-hr.com/DesertJobs/tabid/1473/Default.aspx |archivedate=1 July 2012 }}</ref>

The Coachella Valley connects with the core of the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area to the west via the [[San Gorgonio Pass]], a major transportation corridor that includes [[Interstate 10]] and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. The Coachella Valley is sometimes called the "Desert Empire" to differentiate it from the broader [[Inland Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2018}}

There is some contention as to the origin of the name. Early maps show the area as ''"Conchilla,"'' the Spanish word for "seashell." Since the area was once a part of a vast inland sea, tiny fossilized mollusk shells can be found in the area. Even though the area had been surveyed by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]] in 1857, whose survey party used camels to cross the desert, primarily along the path of the historic [[Bradshaw Trail]], it was not until the coming of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and the discovery of abundant [[artesian aquifer|artesian]] wells later in the 19th century that the area began to expand. Cindarella Courtney was the first non-Indian child born in Indio in 1898.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The first boy, David Elgin, was born in 1899.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The coming in 1926 of [[U.S. Route 99 (California)|U.S. Route 99]] northward through Coachella and Indio and westward toward [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] more or less along the present route of [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] helped further open both agriculture, commerce and tourism to the rest of the country. So too did the coming of [[California State Route 111|State Highway 111]] in the early 1930s, which cut a diagonal swath through the valley and connected all of its major settlements.<ref>Nordland, Ole J. (May 1968) [http://www.cvwd.org/news/publication_docs/coachella_valleys_golden_years.pdf "Coachella Valley's Golden Years"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201065734/http://www.cvwd.org/news/publication_docs/coachella_valleys_golden_years.pdf |date=February 1, 2015 }} ''Coachella Valley County Water District''</ref> Dr. [[June McCarroll]], then a nurse with the Southern Pacific whose office fronted U.S. 99 in Indio, is credited with being the first person to delineate a divided highway by painting a stripe down the middle of the roadbed in response to frequent head-on collisions.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The standard was refined and adopted worldwide. Doctor McCarroll is memorialized by a stretch of I-10 through Indio named in her honor.

The Coachella Valley became popular among celebrities from [[Frank Sinatra]] to [[Dakota Fanning]] who came to enjoy vacations and winter homes in the desert resort community. It became a real estate destination in the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Palm Springs has become a tourist attraction. In a 2003 [[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] publication review,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Palm Springs was ranked one of the top 10 global vacation destinations, and the smallest one in population.

==Geography==
The Coachella Valley is the northernmost extent of the vast [[Salton Trough]], also called the Cahuilla Basin, which includes the Salton Sea, and the [[Imperial Valley]] in the [[United States]], as well as the [[Mexicali Valley]] and [[Colorado River Delta]] in [[Mexico]].<ref>[http://ca.water.usgs.gov/groundwater/gwatlas/basin/terminal.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211131548/http://ca.water.usgs.gov/groundwater/gwatlas/basin/terminal.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}</ref> The trough is a result of combined tectonic activity of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which follows the northeastern side of the valley, and the [[East Pacific Rise]] that runs up through the [[Gulf of California]] to the Salton Sea.

{{wide image|Joshua tree keys view pano more vertical.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the view south from Keys View in the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]], [[Joshua Tree National Park]], California, United States.

In the valley floor, the [[San Andreas Fault]] is clearly visible. At the rear right is the {{convert|11500|ft|m|adj=mid|tall}} [[San Gorgonio Mountain]]}}
The area is surrounded on the southwest by the [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa Mountains]], by the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the west, the [[Little San Bernardino Mountains]] to the east and [[San Gorgonio Mountain]] to the north. These mountains peak at around {{convert|11000|ft|m}} and tend to average between {{convert|5000|and|7000|ft|m}}. Elevations on the Valley floor range from {{convert|1600|ft|m}} above sea level at the north end of the Valley to {{convert|250|ft|m}} below sea level around Mecca.<ref>[http://www.cvconservation.org/coachellavalley.html Coachella Valley | Coachella Valley Climate | Agriculture | Soils | Water<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154118/http://www.cvconservation.org/coachellavalley.html |date=2012-04-25 }}</ref>  In the summer months daytime temperatures range from {{convert|104|°F}} to {{convert|112|°F}} and nighttime lows from {{convert|75|°F}} to {{convert|86|°F}}. During winter, the daytime temperatures range from {{convert|68|°F}} to {{convert|88|°F}} and corresponding nights range from {{convert|46|°F}} to {{convert|65|°F}} making it a popular winter resort destination. The surrounding mountains create Thermal Belts in the immediate foothills of the Coachella Valley, leading to higher night-time temperatures in the winter months, and lower daytime temps during the summer months. Due to its warm year-round climate the region's agricultural sector produces fruits such as mangoes, figs and dates.

The Valley is the northwestern extension of the [[Sonoran Desert]] to the southeast, and as such, is extremely arid. Most precipitation falls during the winter months from passing mid-latitude frontal systems from the north and west, nearly all of it as rain, but with snow atop the surrounding mountains. Rain also falls during the summer months as surges of moisture from both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California are drawn into the area by the [[North American Monsoon|desert monsoon]]. Occasionally, the remnants of a Pacific tropical cyclone can also affect the valley. In 1976, [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|Tropical Storm Kathleen]] brought torrential rain and catastrophic flooding to the Coachella Valley as it swept in from the Pacific, traversing the region from south to north.

The irrigation of over {{convert|100000|acre|ha|sigfig=3}} of the Valley since the early 20th century has allowed widespread agriculture. In its 2006 annual report, the Coachella Valley Water District listed the year's total crop value at over $576 million or almost $12,000 per acre.<ref>[http://www.cvwd.org/news/publicinfo/2006_annual_water_quality_report.pdf Annual Water Quality Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621014259/http://www.cvwd.org/news/publicinfo/2006_annual_water_quality_report.pdf |date=2007-06-21 }}, cvwd.org. Retrieved August 2011</ref> The [[Coachella Canal]], a concrete-lined aqueduct built between 1938 and 1948 as a branch of the [[All-American Canal]], brings water from the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] to the Valley. The [[Colorado River Aqueduct]], which provides drinking water to Los Angeles and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], crosses the northeast end of the Valley along the base of the Little San Bernardino Mountains (the [[Joshua Tree National Park]]).

The [[San Andreas Fault]] traverses the Valley's east side. Because of this fault, the Valley has many hot springs. The Santa Rosa Mountains to the West are part of the [[Elsinore Fault Zone]]. The results of a prehistoric [[sturzstrom]] can be seen in Martinez Canyon. The Painted Canyons of Mecca feature smaller faults as well as Precambrian, Tertiary and Quaternary rock formations, unconformities, badlands and desert landforms. Seismic activity is what triggers earthquakes, a natural, but occasionally destructive phenomena in the Coachella Valley. Fault lines cause hot water springs or geysers to rise from the ground. These natural water sources made habitation and development possible in the otherwise inhospitable desert environment of the Coachella Valley. Major earthquakes have affected the Coachella Valley. For instance, the [[1992 Landers earthquake]] caused some damage in the valley. An earthquake of local origin which caused considerable damage was the [[1986 North Palm Springs earthquake]], which registered at a magnitude of 6.0, injuring 29 people and destroying 51 homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1986_07_08.php |title=Historic Earthquakes |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=2011-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522173135/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1986_07_08.php |archivedate=2009-05-22 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.data.scec.org/chrono_index/npalmspr.html |title=SCEDC &#124; North Palm Springs Earthquake (1986) |publisher=Data.scec.org |date=1986-07-08 |access-date=2011-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716131213/http://www.data.scec.org/chrono_index/npalmspr.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref>

According to an interview with former Palm Springs mayor [[Ron Oden]], perhaps at the time the United States' only openly gay African-American mayor,<ref name="The Body" /> a large number of HIV/AIDS-infected individuals have moved to the Palm Springs area to take advantage of the extensive health-support systems that have been developed in recent years (such as the Desert AIDS Project). For this reason, the area has one of the highest per capita rates of HIV/AIDS in the nation.

The area has a large percentage of [[Mexican American]] political figures, plus the state assembly representative [[Bonnie Garcia]] of La Quinta is of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] parentage.

According to the Riverside County board of voter registration, the majority of moved-in (younger) registered voters are affiliated with the Democratic party, while large portions of the Coachella Valley (except Palm Springs) tend to affiliate with the Republican political party. In recent years, new suburban residents (mostly retired transplants) are usually Republican, while longtime residents (mostly Hispanic) tend to be Democrat.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The racial makeup was 44.7% Non-Hispanic White, 49.9% Hispanic, 1.8% Black/African American, 2.1% Asian/Pacific Islander, 0.4% American Indian and Inuit, 0.1% from other races, and 1.1% from two or more races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cvepblueprint.com/pdf/CV_Competitive_Assessment_Final.pdf |title=cvepblueprint.com |website=cvepblueprint.com |accessdate=6 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215072538/http://cvepblueprint.com/pdf/CV_Competitive_Assessment_Final.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2017 }}</ref>

===Early history===
In the early 20th century, less than 1,000 full-time residents lived in the "village" of Palm Springs, surrounding farms and ranches, and on the Indian reservation. The [[United States Census, 1930|1930 U.S. census]] found less than half the Coachella Valley's population was "white", the rest were [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] especially in the eastern ends when [[traquero]]s arrived to maintain the area's railroads, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of local tribes in what were then impoverished reservations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coachellaunincorporated.org/2012/08/30/doctoral-student-explores-eastern-coachella-valley-history-with-youth/|title=Doctoral Student Explores Eastern Coachella Valley History with Youth – Coachella Unincorporated|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/yuma/environmental_docs/Coachella/coachella-chap5-5.pdf|format=PDF|title=Coachella Canal Area Resource Management Plan / Environmental Assessment : 148 : Cultural Resources|website=Usbr.gov|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>

Starting in the 1890s, there was a large [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] presence in the region, after Palm Springs was an established agricultural colony called "Palm Valley" cofounded by Welwood Murray, a Scottish immigrant and John Guthrie McCallum, an American from the U.S. East coast. The two men widely advertised the colony to settlers with an interest in a warm climate and the ideal winter residence.<ref>Facts and Legends: The Village of Palm Springs, Sally Presley, (1986, fourth printing 2002)</ref>

===Hispanic community===
[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] are long established in Palm Springs' central and eastern sections, and have constituted the majority of the populations of [[Indio, California|Indio]] and [[Coachella, California|Coachella]] for many decades. In the 2000 U.S. census, about 35 percent of Coachella Valley residents were Latino. But according to the [[United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce]], an estimated half (50–60 percent) of the residents are Latino.<ref>[https://www.ushcc.com/index.cfm USHCC – United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017081404/https://www.ushcc.com/index.cfm |date=2012-10-17 }}</ref> A large portion of Latinos moving into the area are from the Los Angeles-Orange County and San Diego metro areas. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Most of the valley's Hispanics are [[Mexican American|Mexican]] from a multi-generational community (see [[Chicano]]), but [[Central America]]n immigrants (especially in Indio and Cathedral City), [[Cuban American]]s, [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]], and South Americans are also numerous (esp. in Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert). Since the late 1980s, the large wave of immigration from neighboring Mexico has culturally impacted the Coachella Valley in many more ways than the rest of California or the country, but the national trend slowed down due to the late 2000s recession.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/for-first-time-since-depression-more-mexicans-leave-us-than-enter/2012/04/23/gIQApyiDdT_story.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Tara | last=Bahrampour | title=For first time since Depression, more Mexicans leave U.S. than enter | date=2012-04-24}}</ref>

Most Hispanic immigrants came to obtain work in the area's year-round agriculture, but today many find employment in construction and home remodeling, the resort hospitality industry, landscaping firms, and in the retail sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicchamber.imagemarketingnetwork.com/|title=Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Coachella Valley|website=Hispanicchamber.imagemarketingnetwork.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>

===Other racial/ethnic groups===
The prominence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Cahuilla]] tribe is represented in local life; because of casino gambling and land ownership, the majority of local tribal members (Cahuilla pertaining to the Agua Caliente band and the Cabazon/Twentynine Palms bands) are in upper-income brackets. According to the Southern California [[National Congress of American Indians]], less than 5 percent of the area's residents are Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

[[African American]]s are concentrated in Palm Springs' northern and eastern ends, as well as in small sections of Indio and Desert Hot Springs, but local African Americans live everywhere in middle-class and wealthy areas and comprise less than 5 percent of the local population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/african-americans-shaping-the-california-desert-coachella-valley.html|title=African-Americans Shaping the California Desert: Coachella Valley|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> The area is home to 10,000 [[Indian American]]s (mostly from [[Sri Lanka]]), descendants of agricultural workers in the 1930s and 1940s .{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Additionally, Palm Desert is the home of 1,000 [[Tahiti]]ans, a [[Pacific Islander]] people from [[French Polynesia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Other ethnic groups in the area like [[Asian Americans]] (i.e. [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Filipino American|Filipinos]]), followed by a small wave of [[Armenians]] and [[Arab people|Arabs]] (esp. [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian people|Syrians]]) from the Middle East were involved in the area's agriculture in the early 1900s. In recent years, the area (especially Palm Desert and Palm Springs) became popular for [[Persian people|Iranian]], [[Israeli people|Israeli]], [[East Indians|East Indian]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav (Former)]] and [[Koreans|Korean]] home buyers, with most purchasing increasingly high-valued properties for investment purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tripcart.com/usa-regions/California-Desert,Society-Culture.aspx#Guide%7C%7C%7C%7C%7C%7CTop|title=Society and Culture in Palm Springs, Death Valley and the California Desert|website=TripCart|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018094416/http://www.tripcart.com/usa-regions/California-Desert,Society-Culture.aspx#Guide&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;Top&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;&#124;|archive-date=18 October 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>

===Local emphasis of tolerance===
In mid-2000, Palm Springs city officials and business leaders discussed making an unofficial declaration of Palm Springs as a "hate-free zone" as a sign of local pride to celebrate the city's tolerance (Palm Springs, especially in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine that caters to gay and lesbian readership, has voted it as one of the top five most popular world places for the gay/lesbian community) and multicultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] of the city's relaxed attitude regarding many races living close together.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} According to the [[Palm Springs Pride]] [[LGBT]] association poll and census data in 2010, an estimated 40–45 percent of Palm Springs' residents are thought to be LGBT and nearby Cathedral City is about one-quarter, each having above averages of LGBT people for a U.S. city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mydesert.com/article/20110913/NEWS01/109130304/How-gay-straight-Palm-Springs|title=The Desert Sun - Palm Springs and Coachella Valley news|website=Desert Sun|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref>

===Religious life===

The Coachella Valley had a population of approximately 346,000 at the 2010 Census. State projections estimate that the valley's population will pass 500,000 by the year 2020 and 1 million by 2066.<ref>[http://www.cvep.com/pop_trends.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520194502/http://www.cvep.com/pop_trends.shtml |date=May 20, 2006 }}</ref> Demographers believe the total population already surpassed the 500,000 mark, plus 100,000 temporary seasonal residents known as "snowbirds" arriving to stay during the winter months (from the end of October to the end of April).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The city of [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] sits at the northwest end of the valley. Unincorporated areas and towns include [[Cabazon, California|Cabazon]] in the San Gorgonio Pass, and [[Bermuda Dunes, California|Bermuda Dunes]] and [[Thousand Palms, California|Thousand Palms]] in the east end of the valley with [[Indio Hills, California|Indio Hills]], [[Sky Valley, California|Sky Valley]], [[North Palm Springs, California|North Palm Springs]] and [[Garnet, California|Garnet]] along the northern rim along with [[Thermal, California|Thermal]], [[Vista Santa Rosa, California|Vista Santa Rosa]], [[Oasis, Riverside County, California|Oasis]] and [[Mecca, California|Mecca]] to the southeast. The native [[Cahuilla]] tribe represented in the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]], [[Twentynine Palms Band of Mission Indians]], [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] and the [[Torres-Martinez Band of Cahuilla Indians]], the [[Mission Creek Band]] in unincorporated [[Painted Hills, California|Painted Hills]], and the [[Santa Rosa Indian Reservation]] south of Palm Desert, each have reservations in the area.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
As of 2010 the valley produced agricultural products worth about $600 million.<ref name=cvwdPlan>{{cite web|author1=Coachella Valley Regional Water Management Group In collaboration with the Planning Partners|title=Coachella Valley Integrated Regional Water Management Plan|url=http://www.cvwd.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/1150|website=cvwd.org|accessdate=June 22, 2015|page=29|date=December 2010}}</ref>

The valley is the primary [[date (fruit)|date]]-growing region in the United States, responsible for nearly 95 percent of the nation's crop and is celebrated each year in Indio during the Riverside [[county fair|County Fair]] and National Date Festival. The earliest attempt at growing dates came about in 1890 when the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) imported date palm shoots from Iraq and Egypt. Sixty-eight shoots were distributed across the Southwest U.S. in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], [[Yuma, Arizona]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and several California cites: Indio, [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] near Los Angeles, [[Tulare, California|Tulare]] and [[National City, California|National City]] near San Diego. The imports were almost all male seedlings and produced poor fruit. The Coachella Valley showed promise, so USDA horticulturist Bernard Johnson planted a number of shoots that he brought back from Algeria in September 1903. On his own initiative, Johnson imported more shoots from Algeria in 1908 and again in 1912. The area's entire date industry can be traced back to those original USDA experiments near present-day [[Mecca, California|Mecca]]. Date palms were grown from present-day [[Cathedral City, California|Cathedral City]] to the Salton Sea, but most date groves were overtaken by development by the 1990s. Today, nearly all of the date groves are in the "East Valley" area south of Indio, near Coachella and east of La Quinta.

Other agricultural products cultivated in the Coachella Valley include fruits and vegetables, especially table grapes, citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit; onions and leeks; and peppers. The valley floor served to grow bounties of alfalfa, artichokes, avocados, beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, corn, cotton, cucumbers, dandelions (salad greens), eggplant, figs, grains (i.e. barley, oats, rye and wheat; plus rice fields kept wet or moist in the Salton Sea area), hops, kohlrabi, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines and peaches, persimmons, plums and prunes, pomegranate, potatoes, radishes, spinach, strawberries, sugar cane, tomatoes, a variety of herbs and spices, and other vegetable crops. The Coachella grapefruit originated in the region. The city of [[Coachella, California|Coachella]] is the primary shipping point for agricultural goods. Domesticated grasses, flowers and trees are widely grown for warm-weather or desert climates, and sold for use in golf courses and landscape.

Only 10 percent of the Coachella Valley residents were born/raised in the area, according to the 2000 census, a much lower percentage than found in most parts of the U.S. Agriculture is a founding block of the majority of the "oldtimer" residents, whose parents and grandparents came to the area as farmers and laborers transformed the eastern parts of the valley from a hot sandy desert into a green fertile place with a year-round growing season. The Coachella Valley's agricultural development is due to irrigation: water was drawn from an underground aquifer created when the valley was under a fresh water lake in the last [[ice age]] (over 10,000 years ago); and from the All-American Canal, completed in the late 1940s, which brought large supplies of water from the [[Colorado River]]. Recent growth of fish farming or "[[aquaculture]]" in Mecca near the Salton Sea brings new promise to the local economy, especially to efforts to restore the ailing ecology of the large saltwater lake.

===Wind power===
{{wide image|San gorgonio pass wind farm california pano.jpg|800px|The [[San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm]] as viewed from the top of the [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]] in the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the south.}}
The valley's northwest entrance from the [[San Bernardino]]-[[Riverside, California|Riverside]] along [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] is known as the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] and is the second windiest place in the country. Cool coastal air is forced through the pass and mixes with the hot desert air, making the San Gorgonio Pass one of only three ideal places in California for steady, wind-generated electricity. At the [[San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm]], thousands of huge wind turbines spread across the desert and hills on either side of the highway greet visitors as they approach the crest of the pass and have become somewhat of a symbol of the area. The state's other wind farms are in the [[Tehachapi Pass]] between [[Mojave, California|Mojave]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and in the [[Altamont Pass]] near [[Livermore, California|Livermore]].

===Businesses===

==Recreation and annual activities==
{{more sources needed|date=June 2020}}
With warm winters and more than 350 days of sunshine per year, recreational hiking and horseback riding are popular in the many canyons in the mountains that surround the valley. One of the most visited outdoor sports areas is Thousand Palms Canyon.

The Coachella Valley was once a safe haven for hay fever allergy sufferers before the surge of golf courses and year-round lawns, and people with bronchitis, emphysema and asthma chose to relocate for health reasons in the early half of the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In the early 20th century, Palm Springs was an ideal farming town and had some space converted to a minor agricultural economy. After that failed, all the fields and groves were replaced by homes and golf courses. Agriculture succeeded in the lower Coachella Valley near the communities of Thermal, Mecca, Oasis and Vista Santa Rosa that had a large underground aquifer to sustain a year-round green environment.

Roughly 125 golf courses blanket the area, making it one of the world's premier golf destinations and the most popular golf vacation destination in California. The [[Merrill Lynch Skins Game]] was held in La Quinta each [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and drew some of the biggest names in golf. The [[Professional Golfers Association|PGA]] has a major presence in La Quinta as well with the PGA WEST golf and residential complex. One of the host courses of the aforementioned Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a PGA WEST fairway represents the area in [[Soarin' Over California]], an [[IMAX]]-based attraction at [[Disney California Adventure Park]] theme park.

The area is also dotted with casinos run by local Indian tribes as well as resort hotels and spas with natural [[mineral water]] wells, making it a vacation destination as well. The [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]] takes visitors from the valley floor to the [[San Jacinto Peak]] mountain station {{convert|8516|ft|m}} above sea level.

Palm Springs is home to one of the country's largest collections of mid-century architecture. Thousands of homes, apartments, hotels, businesses and other buildings were designed in this fashion across the city. International mid-century enthusiasts come to Palm Springs to admire the design.

===Events, activities and attractions===

The first television station in the Coachella Valley is KMIR channel 6 by [[John Conte (actor)|John Conte]] and [[Bob Hope]], the NBC affiliate premiered in 1968 remains on the air as the desert's longest running TV station. KPLM (which later became KESQ, the Coachella Valley's current ABC affiliate) went on the air later with a party that made national headlines; it was founded by Robert E. Leonard. The station later made national news and garnered late night jokes from [[Johnny Carson]] and [[Bob Newhart]] when the station manager accidentally ran on air a pornographic movie.<ref>The Desert Sun, "KPLM Founder Leonard Dies", 12/14/2008</ref> [[Gun TV]], the gun [[shopping channel]], is headquartered in the Valley.<ref name=Noble>{{cite news|last1=Noble|first1=Andrea|title=Gun sales head to home shopping channel|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/7/guntv-home-shopping-channel-for-firearms-could-boo/?page=all|accessdate=10 January 2016|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|date=7 January 2016}}</ref>

[[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]] runs along the northeastern rim of the valley while [[California State Route 111|State Route 111]] runs for about 30 miles along the southwestern rim of the valley and serves as the main arterial highway between almost all Coachella Valley cities. A four-lane expressway now known as [[California State Route 86|State Highway 86]] opened in the early 1990s as a "special" bypass (hence, it was known as [[California State Route 86S|State Highway 86S]] until the "S" suffix was dropped) of the former two-lane portion of [[California State Route 86|Highway 86]]. Historic signs designating the original route of [[U.S. Route 99]] through the area may be found along present-day Indio Boulevard through Indio and Harrison Street through Coachella.

Public transportation in the valley is provided by the [[SunLine Transit Agency]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunline.org|title=Sunline Transit Agency|website=Sunline.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> based in Thousand Palms, which was among the country's first transit agencies to totally convert to [[alternate fuel]] vehicles, including full-sized buses powered by [[fuel cell]]s.

==Notable people==
{{See also|List of people from Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs Walk of Stars}}
The area has been a magnet for [[Hollywood]] stars since the 1930s when [[Charles Farrell]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] founded the [[Racquet Club of Palm Springs]]. [[Bing Crosby]] would later found the Blue Skies Trailer Park in Rancho Mirage, unique for its expensive trailer homes each with its own individual theme. In the mid-century  celebrities known to stop by Palm Springs included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Jack Benny]], who did numerous broadcasts of his radio show from Palm Springs.

Farrell, after whom a street in Palm Springs is named, would later be elected mayor. Farrell Drive is built on the path of the [[Palmdale Railroad]], a narrow-gauge horse-drawn railroad right-of-way originally built to serve the proposed town of Palmdale. The town was never built and the railroad was abandoned after a few years of operation. The ties were used to build one of the area's earliest residences and the [[Cornelia White House]] still stands today in downtown Palm Springs.

[[Medal of Honor]] recipient Captain [[William McGonagle]] was a graduate of Coachella High School and made the valley his home after his retirement. [[Mitchell Paige]] was another Medal of Honor veteran who lived in Palm Desert and has a middle school in La Quinta named after him. [[Jacqueline Cochran]], founder and director of the Women Airforce Service Pilots lived her last years in Indio. In 2005, Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] reportedly bought and owns a home in The Vintage Club Country Club in Indian Wells.

[[Elvis Presley]] honeymooned in Palm Springs in 1967 and was a frequent visitor as well since he owned a home here from 1970 his death in 1977. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Bob Hope]] and [[Dinah Shore]] were residents of the valley and were instrumental in the creation of three major golf tournaments, the [[Frank Sinatra Celebrity Golf Tournament]], [[Bob Hope Chrysler Classic]] (now hosted by comedian and golf aficionado [[George Lopez]]) and the [[Nabisco LPGA]] respectively. All three have streets named in their honor as does President [[Gerald Ford]], a longtime Rancho Mirage resident and benefactor of the [[substance abuse]] center that bears his wife's name, the [[Betty Ford Center]] on the campus of the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]], named for general, U.S. president and part-time resident [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. The medical center expanded in size by the new [[Walter Annenberg]] building named for the valley resident, billionaire, friend of celebrities and philanthropist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sinatra and his friends, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Perry Como]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Rosemary Clooney]] and [[Connie Francis]] were frequent visitors in the close-knit celebrity community of the Coachella Valley in the 1950s and 1960s.

The main road into [[Palm Springs International Airport]], named simply "Airport Road", was renamed [[Kirk Douglas|Kirk Douglas Way]] on October 17, 2004. Douglas, a major area benefactor, lived in the valley for more than fifty years and currently resides in [[Montecito, California]]. He is credited with spearheading the drive to modernize the area over those ensuing five decades. His son, actor [[Michael Douglas]], is said to own a residence in Palm Springs with his wife, actress [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]].

[[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] were instrumental in forming the exclusive Thunderbird Heights tract in Rancho Mirage, once the home of President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty. According to ''Palm Springs Life'' magazine, that same tract inspired the name in late 1954 for the [[Ford Thunderbird]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The magazine incorrectly cites that a favorite vacation spot for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] executives, Palm Desert's Eldorado Country Club, inspired the name for [[Cadillac Eldorado|Cadillac's]] top model the year before — though Cadillac had chosen the name five years before the club's founding in an internal competition.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Local automotive history indicates that designer [[Raymond Loewy]] penned the [[Studebaker Avanti]] in his Palm Springs home.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Especially since the 1950s, Palm Springs and nearby golf clubs are hailed as the "playground of celebrities". However it is said that celebrities travel or reside in the Palm Springs area inlesser numbers as compared to yesteryear, but the area's "star power" made a comeback in the 2000s.

Ball and Arnaz helped finance construction of the Indian Wells Country Club. Founded in 1956 with their winter residence on ''DesiLu Court'', Indian Wells became a major factor in "down valley" growth in the 1970s and 1980s. A mostly gated community, Indian Wells has one of the highest ''per capita'' income of any small town in the United States, while nearby Coachella, a short distance southeast on [[California State Route 111|State Route 111]] is the third poorest city of the 10,000–50,000 population range in the nation, though that is rapidly changing as the area develops. A memorial to Eisenhower can be found on the front lawn of Indian Wells City Hall, also features the local veterans memorial plaque to represent the community's 800 veterans, a high number of war veterans per ratio of its predominantly senior citizen population. Coachella has the Vietnam War veterans' memorial to represent their community's high representation of armed forces volunteers, a large percentage had Spanish surnames since the city's population are over 90 percent Latino.

Many other celebrities, past and present, have called the area home such as actor [[Paul Burke (actor)|Paul Burke]]. Among those who grew up in the area:
* [[Vanessa Marcil]] is a La Quinta native and attended [[Indio High School]].
* [[Suzanne Somers]] spent a part of her childhood in Cathedral City and attended [[Palm Springs High School]].
* [[Billy Steinberg]] grew up in Palm Springs and worked at the Dave Freedman Grape Farm in Thermal.
* [[Alison Lohman]] is a native of Palm Springs and grew up in Palm Desert.
* [[Tyler Hilton]] is also a native of Palm Springs and graduated from La Quinta High School. Hilton performed a concert in the school theatre in 2006.
* [[Cameron Crowe]] grew up in a rural home near Indio.
* [[Rich Newey]] grew up in Bermuda Dunes.
* [[Alan O'Day]] grew up in Coachella.
* [[Aubrey O'Day]] was a 2001 graduate of [[La Quinta High School (La Quinta, California)|La Quinta High School]].
* [[Josh Homme]] attended [[Palm Desert High School]].
* [[Tony Reagins]], General Manager of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], is an Indio native and attended Indio High school.
* [[Ed White (American football)|Edward White]], football player of the [[San Diego Chargers]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] is an Indio native and attended Indio High school.
* [[Jenna Ortega]] is a native of Indio.

U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] was a frequent guest of Frank Sinatra, and a plaque in one of the pews of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Palm Desert marks the spot where Kennedy would usually sit during Mass.

That same area in Palm Desert once served as a training ground for General [[George Patton|George Patton's]] [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] troops and tank battalions; today, the site is home to the El Paseo shopping district. Patton also trained in a huge plot of desert stretching from [[Chiriaco Summit, California|Chiriaco Summit]] just off the eastern end of the valley northward almost to [[Amboy, California|Amboy]] along [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. Tank tracks from those maneuvers are still visible today in the open desert and a museum dedicated to Patton is located in Chiriaco Summit. Patton was also a frequent guest at the Whittier Ranch House in Indio, a grand adobe structure which had faced the possibility of demolition as the ranch lands surrounding it were being developed. A grass roots organization had petitioned the city to preserve the structure for use as a [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]] post; it has instead been restored and retained as the clubhouse for the new Whittier Ranch housing development. It is also now a California state historic site.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

[[Sonny Bono]] ran a restaurant in downtown Palm Springs. Frustrated by the lack of cooperation he faced from the city council over a new sign for the restaurant, the entertainer took matters into his own hands and ran for mayor. He retained local conservative talk radio host [[Marshall Gilbert]] (heard regularly on [[KNWQ]]) as his campaign manager in a successful bid that not only put Bono back in the public eye, but fueled his later campaign for a seat on the United States Congress, a position he held until his death in a skiing accident in 1998. His widow, [[Mary Bono|Mary]] (now Mary Bono Mack), filled the vacancy left by her husband and later campaigned successfully on her own. She was defeated by Democrat Raul Ruiz in the 2012 election, and moved to Florida. Both Sonny Bono and Frank Sinatra are buried at [[Desert Memorial Park]] in Cathedral City.

The [[La Quinta Resort and Club]], a series of bungalows built in 1926 in what was then known as Marshall's Cove is the oldest resort in the valley. [[Frank Capra]] wrote the script for [[1937 in film|1937]] ''[[Lost Horizon (1937)|Lost Horizon]]'' poolside there, in the La Quinta Cove where the resort is located. Capra died in La Quinta and is buried in the nearby [[Coachella Valley Public Cemetery]].

So fond was [[Walt Disney]] of his property at the Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs that he often wore a tie tac which was in the shape of the Smoke Tree Ranch logo. Disney reluctantly sold the property to help finance the construction of [[Disneyland]]. ''[[Partners (statue)|Partners]]'', bronze sculptures of Disney standing next to [[Mickey Mouse]] in each of the Disney theme parks clearly show the brand on Disney's tie tac.

[[Clint Eastwood]] formerly owned a restaurant called the Hog's Breath Inn in Old Town La Quinta. The restaurant is currently owned by the Kaiser Restaurant Group, but maintains the Clint Eastwood inspired motif.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.restaurantsofpalmsprings.com/hogs.php |title=Kaiser Restaurant Group |publisher=Restaurantsofpalmsprings.com |accessdate=2011-08-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819002038/http://www.restaurantsofpalmsprings.com/hogs.php |archivedate=2011-08-19 }}</ref>

TV producer and media mogul [[Merv Griffin]] owned a home and ranch which is now part of the PGA West community. It was known as the "Griffin Ranch", but the land was sold and became an equestrian ranch housing tract and was annexed by the city of La Quinta.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Palm Springs in popular culture}}
{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}
Noteworthy and memorable references in popular culture include the animated [[Looney Tunes]] short ''[[Bully for Bugs]]'' in which [[Bugs Bunny]] requests directions to the Coachella Valley "and the big carrot festival therein." An annual carrot festival is in fact held just outside the area in the [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]] town of [[Holtville, California|Holtville]], approximately 70 miles to the southeast.

The generation defining novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture]]'', by Canadian novelist [[Douglas Coupland]], describes the angst of those born between roughly 1960 and 1965 ([[Generation X-ers]] refers to those born from 1960 to 1982) and is set in the Palm Springs of the late 1980s.

A second classic 1980s novel, [[Less Than Zero (novel)|''Less Than Zero'']], a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles, has its climactic scenes of excess and despair set in Palm Springs. The film [[Less Than Zero (film)|''Less Than Zero'']] was made in 1987, directed by [[Marek Kanievska]] and starring [[Andrew McCarthy]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]] and [[Jami Gertz]].

Another famous movie filmed in the Coachella Valley (as well as [[Yucca Valley]] and [[Twentynine Palms]], to the north) is arguably ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. It even includes the former Desert Air airport, now the site of the Rancho Las Palmas Resort and Spa in Rancho Mirage. The airfield escape scene in ''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' was filmed at present-day Palm Springs International Airport; Mount San Jacinto is clearly seen in the background.

[[Tex Avery]] made a brief reference to Palm Springs via a [[Visual gag|sight gag]] in his 1948 animated short for [[MGM]], ''[[The Cat That Hated People]]''.
