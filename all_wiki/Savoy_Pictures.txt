'''Savoy Pictures Entertainment, Inc.''' was an American independent motion picture company in operation from 1992 to 1997. Among Savoy Pictures' noteworthy feature films were ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', ''[[No Escape (1994 film)|No Escape]]'', ''[[Last of the Dogmen]]'' and ''[[Serial Mom]]''.

== History ==
Former [[Sony Pictures|Columbia Pictures Entertainment]] chairman and [[TriStar Pictures]] founder Victor A. Kaufman became chairman and chief executive officer of Savoy Pictures in 1992 along with vice chairman executive, Lewis J. Korman. Kaufman has claimed that the name came from the Savoy Special bat [[Robert Redford]]'s character used in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/41496752|title=Victor Kaufman – Savoy Pictures and Home Shopping Network|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref> Savoy intended to finance and distribute films in the $12–25 million range, investing in up to $15 million per film.<ref name="ser" /> In June of that year, Savoy entered into a deal with [[HBO]] for the home video, pay-TV, and pay-per-view rights to its films.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lippman |first1=John |title=Savoy Pictures and HBO Cut a Film Deal |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-16/business/fi-654_1_savoy-pictures |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 16, 1992}}</ref>

Budgets for their films grew. However, with rather poor marketing, Savoy faced a major financial slump, only three years after being formed. For three years, Savoy then released box office failures including ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]'' and ''[[Getting Away with Murder (1996 film)|Getting Away with Murder]]''. It also didn't help that two of its competitors in the independent film field, [[Miramax]] and [[New Line Cinema]], were bought out by majors ([[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Turner Broadcasting]], respectively), giving them stability. As a result, Savoy focused on low-budget films and the occasional blockbuster, costing up to $80 million.<ref name="ser">Fabrikant, Geraldine. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/30/business/savoy-pictures-high-and-low-roads.html?src=pm ''Savoy Pictures' High and Low Roads''.] [[The New York Times]] (January 18, 1995)</ref> Executives hoped to lure [[Sylvester Stallone]] with a then-hefty $20 million paycheck to star in a studio project that was ultimately never made.<ref name="ser" />

In the meantime, Savoy expanded into broadcasting to help the investment of films. In March 1994, Savoy created [[SF Broadcasting]] as a venture with [[Fox Television Stations]], with Kaufman and Korman owning [[controlling interest]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/business/the-media-business-savoy-and-fox-tv-venture.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fF%2fFinances ''THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Savoy and Fox TV Venture''.] [[The New York Times]] (March 18, 1994)</ref> As a result of purchasing these stations, all of them would become affiliates of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]. Stations owned by SF Broadcasting were [[WALA-TV]] in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]], [[WLUK-TV]] in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Wisconsin]], [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]] in [[New Orleans]], and [[KHON-TV]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Savoy also launched a television production division.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-09/business/fi-63942_1_television-production-division ''COMPANY TOWN : Savoy Pictures Names Stanley Brooks to Head Its Television Production Division''.] ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' (May 9, 1995)</ref>

In January 1995, Kaufman announced that he was hiring [[Robert N. Fried]] to run the motion picture studio. Fried brought in executives [[Alan Sokol]], [[Bob Levin]], [[Cathy Schulman]], [[Stanley Brooks|Stan Brooks]], [[Stan Wlodkowski]] and filmmakers [[Sam Raimi]], and [[George Tillman Jr.|George Tillman]], [[Rob Weiss]] and [[Peter Chelsom]]. In September 1995, Kaufman announced that he was cutting back on his interest in the motion picture business and was re-positioning the company as a television station [[holding company]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/18/business/savoy-pictures-to-focus-on-tv.html ''Savoy Pictures To Focus on TV''.] ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' (September 18, 1995)</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Savoy announced the sale of 14 films in its roster, in varying stages of production, to potential buyers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1995/11/10/savoy-leaves-spotlight|title=Savoy leaves the spotlight|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref> [[New Line Cinema]] picked up [[Martin Lawrence]]'s directorial debut ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'', ''[[American History X]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', ''[[Heaven's Prisoners]]'', ''[[Faithful (1996 film)|Faithful]]'', and ''[[The Stupids (film)|The Stupids]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/09/movies/lost-without-a-screen-the-fate-of-orphan-films.html|title=Lost Without a Screen: the Fate of 'Orphan' Films|last=Abramovitch|first=Ingrid|date=1997-03-09|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/13/entertainment/ca-22149/2|title=Courting Trouble|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|date=1998-09-13|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-21/business/fi-5665_1_domestic-distribution|title=COMPANY TOWN :  New Line Gains Domestic Rights to 4 Savoy Films|last=BATES|first=JAMES|date=1995-11-21|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref> [[Paramount Pictures]] picked up the rights to produce ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ILL-FATED+%2560SIMPLE+PLAN'+OFF+AGAIN.-a083853335|title=ILL-FATED `SIMPLE PLAN' OFF AGAIN. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2016-09-08}}</ref>

Savoy Pictures announced in November 1995 that [[Barry Diller]]'s [[IAC/Interactive Corporation|Silver King Communications]] was going to acquire Savoy for $210 million.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Daily Variety]]|date=November 28, 1995|page=1|title=Diller deal bails out Savoy stock|last=Peers|first=Martin}}</ref> The deal was finalized in 1997. Victor Kaufman is now{{When|date=March 2020}} vice chairman and sits on the board of directors of IAC. The SF stations were sold to Diller's [[Silver King Broadcasting]] in 1997.

[[Cineplex Odeon Films]] was the Canadian distributor for Savoy films, then [[Alliance Films]] became the Canadian distributor after [[New Line Cinema]] picked up the later films from 1996.

In 2006, the Savoy library was purchased by [[Universal Studios]] through [[Focus Features]].
