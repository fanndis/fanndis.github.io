'''Solar energy''' is [[Solar irradiance|radiant light and heat from the Sun]] that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal energy]], [[solar architecture]], molten salt power plants and [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref name=ie11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Policy/Documents/solar-fuels.asp|title=Energy|work=rsc.org|date=2014-04-02}}</ref>

It is an essential source of [[renewable energy]], and its technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into [[solar power]]. Active solar techniques include the use of [[photovoltaic system]]s, [[concentrated solar power]], and [[solar water heating]] to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]].

The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 [[Joule#Multiples|exajoules]] (EJ). This is several times larger than the total [[world energy consumption]], which was 559.8&nbsp;EJ in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2014.pdf |title=2014 Key World Energy Statistics |publisher=IEA |website=iea.org |pages=6, 24, 28 |date=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405035039/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/keyworld2014.pdf |archive-date=5 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="World Energy Assessment">{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/aplaws/publication/en/publications/environment-energy/www-ee-library/sustainable-energy/world-energy-assessment-energy-and-the-challenge-of-sustainability/World%20Energy%20Assessment-2000.pdf|title=Energy and the challenge of sustainability|work=United Nations Development Programme and [[World Energy Council]]|date=September 2000|access-date=17 January 2017}}</ref>

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' [[energy security]] through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[global warming]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".<ref name=ie11>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |publisher=International Energy Agency |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113032718/http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archive-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere. Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing [[atmospheric circulation]] or [[convection]]. When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the [[water cycle]]. The [[latent heat]] of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, [[cyclone]]s and [[anti-cyclone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radiation Budget|date=17 October 2006|publisher=NASA Langley Research Center|url=http://marine.rutgers.edu/mrs/education/class/yuri/erb.html|access-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web|author=Somerville, Richard|title=Historical Overview of Climate Change Science|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|access-date=29 September 2007}}</ref> By [[photosynthesis]], green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the [[biomass]] from which fossil fuels are derived.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vermass, Wim|title=An Introduction to Photosynthesis and Its Applications|publisher=Arizona State University|url=http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/education/photointro.html|access-date=29 September 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203020943/http://photoscience.la.asu.edu/photosyn/education/photointro.html|archive-date=3 December 1998}}</ref>

The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover, and the land available to humans limit the amount of solar energy that we can acquire.

Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the [[equator]] have a higher amount of solar radiation. However, the use of [[photovoltaics]] that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.<ref name= "World Energy Assessment"/> Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime, there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for [[solar panels]] to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. [[Cloud cover]] can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the Sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.

Besides, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs are a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.<ref name="World Energy Assessment"/>

Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on the distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than [[Geothermal power]] and [[Tidal power]], derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.

Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, [[concentrated solar power]], [[solar thermal collector]]s, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered [[supply side]] technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies.<ref name=" IEA Solar Thermal"/>

In 2000, the [[United Nations Development Programme]], UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and [[World Energy Council]] published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of {{convert|1600|to|49800|EJ|kWh|sigfig=2}} per year ''(see table below)''.<ref name="World Energy Assessment"/>

===Early commercial adaptation===
In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, [[Augustin Mouchot]] successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine, but couldn't continue development because of cheap coal and other factors.
[[File: US Patent 1240890.pdf|thumb|upright=0.80|1917 Patent drawing of Shuman's solar collector]]
In 1897, [[Frank Shuman]], a US inventor, engineer and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir [[C. V. Boys|Charles Vernon Boys]],{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.

Shuman built the world's first [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal power station]] in [[Maadi]], [[Egypt]], between 1912 and 1913. His plant used [[parabolic trough]]s to power a {{convert|45|–|52|kW|hp|lk=out}} engine that pumped more than {{convert|22000|litres}} of water per minute from the [[Nile River]] to adjacent cotton fields. Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of [[Petroleum industry|cheap oil]] in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision, and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Zachary Alden|author2=Taylor, Katrina D.|title=Renewable And Alternative Energy Resources: A Reference Handbook|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_z1v3|url-access=registration|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_z1v3/page/174 174]|isbn=978-1-59884-089-6}}</ref> In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying:

===Heating, cooling and ventilation===
{{Main|Solar heating|Thermal mass|Solar chimney|Solar air conditioning}}

[[File:Flipped MIT Solar One house.png|thumb|left|[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] 's Solar House #1, built-in 1939 in the US, used [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] for year-round heating.]]
Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement, and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When duly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.<ref>Mazria (1979), pp. 29–35</ref>

A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated, causing an [[updraft]] that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials<ref>{{cite news|last=Bright|first=David|date=18 February 1977|title=Passive solar heating simpler for the average owner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=beAzAAAAIBAJ&pg=1418,1115815&dq=improved+by+using+glazing+and+thermal+mass&hl=en|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|access-date=3 July 2011}}</ref> in a way that mimics greenhouses.

[[Deciduous]] trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.<ref>Mazria (1979), p. 255</ref> Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating.<ref>Balcomb (1992), p. 56</ref> In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter [[solar gain]].<ref>Balcomb (1992), p. 57</ref>

===Cooking===
{{Main|Solar cooker}}
[[File:Auroville Solar Bowl.JPG|thumb|Parabolic dish produces steam for cooking, in [[Auroville]], India]]
Solar cookers use sunlight for cooking, drying, and [[pasteurization]]. They can be grouped into three broad categories: box cookers, panel cookers, and reflector cookers.<ref>Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xi</ref> The simplest solar cooker is the box cooker first built by [[Horace de Saussure]] in 1767.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 54–59</ref> A basic box cooker consists of an insulated container with a transparent lid. It can be used effectively with partially overcast skies and will typically reach temperatures of {{convert|90-150|C}}.<ref>, Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xii</ref> Panel cookers use a reflective panel to direct sunlight onto an insulated container and reach temperatures comparable to box cookers. Reflector cookers use various concentrating geometries (dish, trough, Fresnel mirrors) to focus light on a cooking container. These cookers reach temperatures of {{convert|315|C}} and above but require direct light to function properly and must be repositioned to track the Sun.<ref>Anderson and Palkovic (1994), p. xiii</ref>

===Process heat===
{{Main|Solar pond|Salt evaporation pond|Solar furnace}}
Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the [[Solar Total Energy Project]] (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, US where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400&nbsp;kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401&nbsp;kW steam and 468&nbsp;kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Shenandoah Solar Total Energy Project|journal=NASA Sti/Recon Technical Report N |volume=83 |pages=25168 |author1=Stine, W.B.  |author2=Harrigan, R.W. |name-list-style=amp |publisher=John Wiley|url=http://www.powerfromthesun.net/Book/chapter16/chapter16.html|access-date=20 July 2008|bibcode=1982STIN...8325168L |year=1982 }}</ref> Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through [[evaporation]].

===Molten salt technology===

Molten salt can be employed as a [[thermal energy storage]] method to retain thermal energy collected by a [[Solar power tower|solar tower]] or [[solar trough]] of a [[concentrated solar power plant]] so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the [[Solar Two]] project from 1995 to 1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt |access-date=2011-07-14 |last=Mancini |first=Tom |date=10 January 2006 |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605094349/http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977htec.proc...39J Molten salt energy storage system – A feasibility study] Jones, B.G.; Roy, R.P.; Bohl, R.W.

The most extended mixture contains [[sodium nitrate]], [[potassium nitrate]] and [[calcium nitrate]]. It is non-flammable and non-toxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid. Hence, experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.

The salt melts at {{convert|131|°C|°F}}. It is kept liquid at {{convert|288|°C|°F}} in an insulated "cold" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused irradiance heats it to {{convert|566|°C|°F}}. It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.<ref>Ehrlich, Robert, 2013, "Renewable Energy: A First Course," CRC Press, Chap. 13.1.22 ''Thermal storage'' p. 375 {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6115-8}}</ref>

When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce [[superheated steam]] for a turbine/generator as used in any conventional coal, oil, or nuclear power plant. A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank about {{convert|9.1|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|24|m|ft}} in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.

Solar power is the conversion of sunlight into [[electricity]], either directly using [[photovoltaics]] (PV), or indirectly using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP). CSP systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. PV converts light into electric current using the [[photoelectric effect]].

Solar power is anticipated to become the world's largest source of electricity by 2050, with solar photovoltaics and concentrated solar power contributing 16 and 11 percent to the global overall consumption, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|author=International Energy Agency |website=iea.org |title=Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy |url=http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |publisher=IEA |access-date=7 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001012612/http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/TechnologyRoadmapSolarPhotovoltaicEnergy_2014edition.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2014 |date=2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2016, after another year of rapid growth, solar generated 1.3% of global power.<ref>http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/renewable-energy/solar-energy.html</ref>

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW [[Ivanpah Solar Power Facility]], in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large concentrated solar power plants include the 150 MW [[Solnova Solar Power Station]] and the 100 MW [[Andasol solar power station]], both in Spain. The 250 MW<!-- AC, approximately 250/.83=300 MW DC--> [[Agua Caliente Solar Project]], in the United States, and the 221 MW<!--DC--> [[Gujarat Solar Park|Charanka Solar Park]] in India, are the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] [[photovoltaic plant]]s. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5&nbsp;kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering or a feed-in tariff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energytoolbox.org/gcre/mod_5/gcre_solar.pdf|title=Grid Connected Renewable Energy: Solar Electric Technologies|publisher=energytoolbox.org}}</ref>

In the last two decades, [[photovoltaics]] (PV), also known as solar PV, has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source. A [[solar cell]] is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect. The first solar cell was constructed by [[Charles Fritts]] in the 1880s.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 147</ref> In 1931 a German engineer, Dr Bruno Lange, developed a photo cell using [[silver selenide]] in place of [[copper oxide]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CcDAAAAMBAJ&q=Popular+Science+1931+plane&pg=PA41|title="Magic Plates, Tap Sun For Power", June 1931, Popular Science|access-date=19 April 2011|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|date=June 1931}}</ref> Although the prototype [[selenium]] cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity, both [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] recognized the importance of this discovery.<ref>Perlin (1999), pp. 18–20</ref> Following the work of [[Russell Ohl]] in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, [[Calvin Fuller]] and Daryl Chapin created the [[crystalline silicon]] solar cell in 1954.<ref>Perlin (1999), p. 29</ref> These early solar cells cost US$286/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.<ref>Perlin (1999), pp. 29–30, 38</ref> By 2012 available efficiencies exceeded 20%, and the maximum efficiency of research photovoltaics was in excess of 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v110/i3/p031301_s1?isAuthorized=no|title=Will we exceed 50% efficiency in photovoltaics?|author=Antonio Luque|work=aip.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515051251/http://jap.aip.org/resource/1/japiau/v110/i3/p031301_s1?isAuthorized=no|archive-date=2016-05-15}}</ref>

===Concentrated solar power===
{{See also|Concentrated solar power}}
Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish, and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a [[working fluid]] is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.<ref>Martin and Goswami (2005), p. 45</ref>  Designs need to account for the risk of a [[dust storm]], [[hail]], or another extreme weather event that can damage the fine glass surfaces of solar power plants.  Metal grills would allow a high percentage of sunlight to enter the mirrors and solar panels while also preventing most damage.

==Architecture and urban planning==

Sunlight has influenced building design since the beginning of architectural history.<ref name= "Schittich 2003">Schittich (2003), p. 14</ref> Advanced solar architecture and urban planning methods were first employed by the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Feng shui#Archaeology|Chinese]], who oriented their buildings toward the south to provide light and warmth.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 4, 159</ref>

The common features of [[passive solar]] architecture are orientation relative to the Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and [[Thermal mass (Building)|thermal mass]].<ref name= "Schittich 2003"/> When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment, they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. [[Socrates]]' Megaron House is a classic example of passive solar design.<ref name="Schittich 2003"/> The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together [[daylighting|solar lighting]], [[solar heating|heating]] and [[solar air conditioning|ventilation]] systems in an integrated [[solar design]] package.<ref>Balcomb (1992)</ref> [[Active solar]] equipment such as pumps, fans, and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.

Urban heat islands (UHI) are metropolitan areas with higher temperatures than that of the surrounding environment. The higher temperatures result from increased absorption of solar energy by urban materials such as asphalt and concrete, which have lower [[albedo]]s and higher [[heat capacity|heat capacities]] than those in the natural environment. A straightforward method of counteracting the UHI effect is to paint buildings and roads white and to plant trees in the area. Using these methods, a hypothetical "cool communities" program in Los Angeles has projected that urban temperatures could be reduced by approximately 3&nbsp;°C at an estimated cost of US$1&nbsp; billion, giving estimated total annual benefits of US$530&nbsp; million from reduced air-conditioning costs and healthcare savings.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rosenfeld, Arthur |display-authors=etal |title=Painting the Town White – and Green |publisher=Heat Island Group |url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |access-date=29 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714173907/http://eetd.lbl.gov/HeatIsland/PUBS/PAINTING/ |archive-date=14 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Agriculture and horticulture==
[[File:Westland kassen.jpg|thumb|[[Greenhouses]] like these in the Westland municipality of the Netherlands grow vegetables, fruits and flowers.]]
[[Agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] seek to optimize the capture of solar energy to optimize the productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields.<ref>{{cite web|title=Row Spacing, Plant Population, and Yield Relationships|author=Jeffrey C. Silvertooth|publisher=University of Arizona|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/crop/cotton/comments/april1999cc.html|access-date=24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>Kaul (2005), pp. 169–74</ref> While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the [[Little Ice Age]], French and [[Solar power in the United Kingdom|English]] farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular to the ground and facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] even suggested using a [[Solar tracker|tracking mechanism]] which could pivot to follow the Sun.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 42–46</ref> Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure.<ref name="Leon 2006">Leon (2006), p. 62</ref><ref>Bénard (1981), p. 347</ref> More recently the technology has been embraced by [[Winemakers|vintners]], who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novusvinum.com/news/latest_news.html#gonzales|title=A Powerhouse Winery|access-date=5 November 2008|work=News Update|publisher=Novus Vinum|date=27 October 2008}}</ref>

[[Greenhouse]]s convert solar light to heat, enabling year-round production and the growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce [[cucumbers]] year-round for the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 19</ref> The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 41</ref> Greenhouses remain an important part of horticulture today. Plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in [[polytunnel]]s and [[row cover]]s.

In 1974, the unmanned [[AstroFlight Sunrise]] airplane made the first solar flight. On 29 April 1979, the ''[[Solar Riser]]'' made the first flight in a solar-powered, fully controlled, man-carrying flying machine, reaching an altitude of {{convert|40|ft|abbr=on}}. In 1980, the ''[[Gossamer Albatross#Solar-powered variants|Gossamer Penguin]]'' made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics. This was quickly followed by the ''[[Solar Challenger]]'' which crossed the English Channel in July 1981.

A [[solar balloon]] is a black balloon that is filled with ordinary air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands, causing an upward [[buoyancy]] force, much like an artificially heated [[hot air balloon]]. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phenomena which affect a solar balloon|publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr|url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ballonsolaire/en-theorie1.htm|access-date=19 August 2008}}</ref>

==Fuel production==
[[File:Photo of the Week- Boosting Solar Technology (8722948189).jpg|thumb|Concentrated solar panels are getting a power boost. [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL) will be testing a new concentrated solar power system – one that can help natural gas power plants reduce their fuel usage by up to 20 percent.]]
{{Main|Solar chemical|Solar fuel|Artificial photosynthesis}}
Solar chemical processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy that would otherwise come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions can be divided into thermochemical or [[photochemical]].<ref>Bolton (1977), p. 1</ref> A variety of fuels can be produced by [[artificial photosynthesis]].<ref>Wasielewski MR Photoinduced electron transfer in supramolecular systems for artificial photosynthesis. Chem. Rev. 1992; 92: 435–61.</ref> The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as [[methanol]]) from reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] is challenging; a feasible alternative is [[hydrogen]] production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen.<ref>Hammarstrom L. and Hammes-Schiffer S. Artificial Photosynthesis and Solar Fuels.

[[Hydrogen production]] technologies have been a significant area of solar chemical research since the 1970s. Aside from electrolysis driven by photovoltaic or photochemical cells, several thermochemical processes have also been explored. One such route uses concentrators to split water into oxygen and hydrogen at high temperatures ({{convert|2300|-|2600|C|disp=or|sigfig=2}}).<ref>Agrafiotis (2005), p. 409</ref> Another approach uses the heat from solar concentrators to drive the [[steam reforming|steam reformation]] of natural gas thereby increasing the overall hydrogen yield compared to conventional reforming methods.<ref>Zedtwitz (2006), p. 1333</ref> Thermochemical cycles characterized by the decomposition and regeneration of reactants present another avenue for hydrogen production. The Solzinc process under development at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] uses a 1&nbsp;MW solar furnace to decompose [[zinc oxide]] (ZnO) at temperatures above {{convert|1200|C|sigfig=2}}. This initial reaction produces pure zinc, which can subsequently be reacted with water to produce hydrogen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solar Energy Project at the Weizmann Institute Promises to Advance the use of Hydrogen Fuel|publisher=Weizmann Institute of Science|url=http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&doc_id=4210|access-date=25 June 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124059/http://wis-wander.weizmann.ac.il/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&doc_id=4210|archive-date=6 April 2008}}</ref>

==Energy storage methods==
{{Main|Energy storage|Seasonal thermal energy storage|Phase change material|Grid energy storage|V2G}}
[[File:12-05-08 AS1.JPG|thumb|[[Thermal energy storage]]. The [[Andasol solar power station|Andasol]] CSP plant uses tanks of molten salt to store solar energy.]]
[[Thermal mass]] systems can store solar energy in the form of heat at domestically useful temperatures for daily or [[seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal durations]]. Thermal storage systems generally use readily available materials with high [[specific heat]] capacities such as water, earth and stone. Well-designed systems can lower [[peak demand]], shift time-of-use to [[wikt:off-peak|off-peak]] hours and reduce overall heating and cooling requirements.<ref>Balcomb(1992), p. 6</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Request for Participation Summer 2005 Demand Shifting with Thermal Mass|publisher=Demand Response Research Center|url=http://www.drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|access-date=26 November 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214724/http://drrc.lbl.gov/pubs/RFP_071405.pdf|archive-date=7 September 2008}}</ref>

Phase change materials such as [[paraffin wax]] and [[Sodium sulfate#Thermal storage|Glauber's salt]] are another thermal storage medium. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately {{convert|64|C|disp=or}}). The "Dover House" (in [[Dover, Massachusetts]]) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 212–14</ref> Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using [[molten salt]]s. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store {{convert|1.44|TJ|lk=in}} in its 68 m³ storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advantages of Using Molten Salt|publisher=Sandia National Laboratory|url=http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/solarthermal/NSTTF/salt.htm|access-date=29 September 2007}}</ref>

Off-grid [[Photovoltaics|PV systems]] have traditionally used [[rechargeable batteries]] to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity can be sent to the transmission [[Grid-tied electrical system|grid]], while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. [[Net metering]] programs give household systems credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt-hour credit to the next month.<ref>{{cite web|title=PV Systems and Net Metering |publisher=Department of Energy |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |access-date=31 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704062311/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/net_metering.html |archive-date=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores energy in the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pumped Hydro Storage |publisher=Electricity Storage Association |url=http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |access-date=31 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621052054/http://www.electricitystorage.org/tech/technologies_technologies_pumpedhydro.htm |archive-date=21 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Development, deployment and economics==
[[File:03242012Taller sostenibilidad lore060.jpg|thumb|Participants in a workshop on sustainable development inspect solar panels at [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]] on top of a building on campus.]]
{{Further|Deployment of solar power to energy grids}}{{See also|Cost of electricity by source|Renewable energy by country}}
Beginning with the surge in [[coal]] use, which accompanied the [[Industrial Revolution]], energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to [[fossil fuel]]s. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20th&nbsp; century in the face of the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and [[petroleum]].<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), pp. 63, 77, 101</ref>

The [[1973 oil crisis|1973 oil embargo]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world. It brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 249</ref><ref>Yergin (1991), pp. 634, 653–73</ref> Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the US (SERI, now [[NREL]]), Japan ([[New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization|NEDO]]), and [[Solar power in Germany|Germany]] ([[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronicle of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|publisher=Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft|url=http://www.fraunhofer.de/EN/company/profile/chronicle/1972-1982.jsp|access-date=4 November 2007}}</ref>

Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s.<ref>Butti, and Perlin (1981), p. 117</ref> These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels.<ref>Butti and Perlin (1981), p. 139</ref> As with photovoltaics, [[solar water heating]] attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s, but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s, and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.<ref name=" SWH 2008">{{cite web|title=Solar Heat Worldwide – Markets and Contribution to the Energy Supply 2006|author=Weiss, Werner|author2=Bergmann, Irene|author3=Faninger, Gerhard|publisher=International Energy Agency|url=http://www.iea-shc.org/data/sites/1/publications/IEA-SHC_Solar_Heat_Worldwide-2008.pdf|access-date=9 June 2008}}</ref> Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154&nbsp; GW as of 2007.<ref name="SWH 2008"/>

The [[International Energy Agency]] has said that solar energy can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:<ref name=ie11/>
<blockquote>
The development of affordable, inexhaustible, and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible, and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.<ref name=ie11/>
</blockquote>

In 2011, a report by the [[International Energy Agency]] found that solar energy technologies such as photovoltaics, solar hot water, and concentrated solar power could provide a third of the world's energy by 2060 if politicians commit to limiting [[climate change]] and [[Renewable energy transition|transitioning to renewable energy]]. The energy from the Sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing the global economy alongside improvements in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and imposing costs on [[greenhouse gas]] emitters. "The strength of solar is the incredible variety and flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-01/iea-says-solar-may-provide-a-third-of-global-energy-by-2060.html|title=IEA Says Solar May Provide a Third of Global Energy by 2060|date=1 December 2011|work=Bloomberg Businessweek}}</ref>

==ISO standards==
The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has established several standards relating to solar energy equipment. For example, ISO 9050 relates to glass in the building, while ISO 10217 relates to the materials used in solar water heaters.
