It is part of [[Maine Township High School District 207]], which also includes [[Maine East High School]] and [[Maine West High School]].

Maine South is well known for its academic, athletic, and fine arts success. Since at least 1992 it has also received mention in national media as the alma mater of [[Hillary Clinton]], a member of the school's first graduating class.

==History==
Bids on the construction of Maine South opened on March 18, 1963.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maine Board Eliminates 8 from Coaching |pages=NW–A4 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=3 March 1963 |id={{ProQuest|182629908}} }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Maine South was built in 1964 on the grounds of a former landfill to meet the growing educational needs of the area, mainly the city of Park Ridge, but also some of [[Niles, Illinois|Niles]], [[Harwood Heights, Illinois|Harwood Heights]], [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and unincorporated [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park Township]].

The first principal, Clyde Watson, was appointed in December 1963, in order to give him time to begin forming the first parents and music booster clubs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Watson Gets Maine South Principal Job |pages=NW2 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=29 December 1963 |id={{ProQuest|179335185}} }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Until 1969, students were under a dress code that included a requirement for men to be clean shaven, and that hair had to be cut above the collar.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maine High Schools get new Dress Code |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=11 January 1970 |id= {{ProQuest|169000672}}}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> 1969 also saw the first expansion of the school with the addition of the student cafeteria, and some physical education and classroom areas.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thornton |first=Jeannye |title=Maine District School Ready for New Year |pages=N A7 |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=30 August 1970 |id={{ProQuest|169839619}} }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 1986 and 1987, officials from Maine South were instrumental in pushing the [[Illinois High School Association]] to recognize girls [[soccer]].<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/290991700  Lepitch, John, ''A Soccer Proposal is Studied'', 19 January 1987, ''Chicago Tribune'', p. 8 (Sports); accessed 23 August 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In 1996, after several decades of existing in the shadow of nearby [[O'Hare International Airport]], the school received federal funds which allowed for the installation of soundproof windows, air conditioning, and sound dampening ceilings. The project began in 1997 and took three years to complete.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/291093762 Van Duch, Margaret, ''District 207 seeks funds to curb noise'', 15 January 1996, ''Chicago Tribune'', p.3; accessed 23 August 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

1998 saw the completion of the last major addition to the building: a sixteen classroom, four laboratory extension on the east end of the academic wing.<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/418460532 &RQT=309&VName=PQD Wion, Rick, ''Classroom wing to be added to Maine South'', 11 November 1997, ''Chicago Tribune'', p. 2 (Northwest Edition); accessed 23 August 2008]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
