The '''Identity Cards Act 2006''' (c. 15) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that was repealed in 2011. It created national identity cards, a personal identification document and European Union travel document, linked to a [[database management system|database]] known as the '''National Identity Register''' ('''NIR'''), which has since been destroyed.

The introduction of the scheme was much debated, and various [[Identity Cards Act 2006#Objections to the scheme|concerns about the scheme]] were expressed by human rights lawyers, activists, security professionals and IT experts, as well as politicians. Many of the concerns focused on the databases underlying the identity cards rather than the cards themselves. The Act specified fifty categories of information that the National Identity Register could hold on each citizen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/60015--b.htm#sch1 |title=Identity Cards Act 2006 (c. 15) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> including up to 10 fingerprints, digitised facial scan and iris scan, current and past UK and overseas places of residence of all [[residency (domicile)|residents]] of the UK throughout their lives and indexes to other Government databases (including National Insurance Number<ref>{{cite web|author=Kable | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/07/id_register_includes_ni_numbers/ |title=Johnson reveals ID register linked to NI numbers |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=7 January 2010 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>)&nbsp;– which would allow them to be connected. The legislation on this [[resident register]] also said that any further information could be added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/60015--a.htm#3 |title=Identity Cards Act 2006 (c. 15) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

The legislation further said that those renewing or applying for [[British passport|passports]] must be entered on to the NIR. It was expected that this would happen soon after the [[Identity and Passport Service]] (IPS), which was formerly the UK Passport Service, started interviewing passport applicants to verify their identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stornowaytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=2629&ArticleID=1819772 |title=Webcam interview essential for new passports |publisher=Stornoway Today |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324204435/http://www.stornowaytoday.co.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=2629&ArticleID=1819772 |archive-date=24 March 2007 }}</ref>

Only workers in certain high-security professions, such as airport workers, were required to have an identity card in 2009, and this general lack of compulsory ID remains the case today. Therefore, driving licences, particularly the photocard driving licence introduced in 1998, along with [[passport]]s, are now the most widely used ID documents in the United Kingdom. Nobody in the UK is required to carry any form of ID. In everyday situations most authorities, such as the police, do not make spot checks of identification for individuals, although they may do so in instances of [[arrest]]. Some banks will accept a provisional driving licence only from young people, the upper age limit for which varies from bank to bank, while others will accept it from all ages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/customer-support/banking-made-easy/help-us-identify-you|title=HSBC Customer Support - Proof of Identity - HSBC Bank UK}}</ref><ref>https://www.halifax.co.uk/SecurityandPrivacy/pdf/personal-information-and-identity.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/g2/id-required.ashx|title=Page Not Found}}</ref>

==Development==
===Reasons given for the need for introduction===
[[File:UK National Identity Card.png|thumb|A promotional image of a UK National Identity Card released by the [[Home Office]].]]
Initial attempts to introduce a voluntary identity card were made under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[John Major]], under then-Home Secretary [[Michael Howard]]. At the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference in 1995, [[Tony Blair]] demanded that "instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands more police officers on the beat in our local communities."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050519/debtext/50519-18.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 19 May 2005 (pt 18)|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> It was included in the Conservative election manifesto for the 1997 general election, but Labour won that election.

A proposal for ID cards, to be called "entitlement cards", was initially revived by the Home Secretary at the time, [[David Blunkett]], following the [[11 September 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1562427.stm BBC News: A question of identity], 25 September 2001</ref> but was reportedly opposed by [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] colleagues. However, rising concerns about identity theft and the misuse of public services led to a proposal in February 2002 for the introduction of entitlement cards to be used to obtain [[social security]] services, and a consultation paper, ''Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud'', was published by the Home Office on 3 July 2002.<ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/entitlement-cards Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud – A Consultation Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120801124450/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/entitlement-cards |date=1 August 2012 }}, 3 July 2003</ref> A public consultation process followed, which resulted in a majority of submissions by organisations being in favour of a scheme to verify a person's identity accurately. However, it was clear that the ability to properly identify a person to their true identity was central to the proposal's operation, with wider implications for operations against crime and terrorism.

In 2003, Blunkett announced that the Government intended to introduce a "British national [[identity document|identity card]]" linked to a national identity database, the National Identity Register. The proposals were included in the November 2003 Queen's Speech, despite doubts over the ability of the scheme to prevent [[terrorism]]. Feedback from the consultation exercise indicated that the term "entitlement card" was superficially softer and warmer, but less familiar and "weaselly", and consequently the euphemism was dropped in favour of "identity card".<ref>[http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm60/6019/6019.pdf A Summary of Findings from the Consultation Exercise on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127135857/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm60/6019/6019.pdf |date=27 November 2007 }}, page 45, November 2002</ref>

During a private seminar for the [[Fabian Society]] in August 2005, [[Tony McNulty]], the minister in charge of the scheme, stated "perhaps in the past the government, in its enthusiasm, oversold the advantages of identity cards", and that they "did suggest, or at least implied, that they might well be a panacea for identity fraud, for benefit fraud, terrorism, entitlement and access to public services". He suggested that they should be seen as "a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] in proving your identity".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4744153.stm Labour admits ID card 'oversell'], 4 August 2005</ref> Documentation released by the Home Office demonstrated analysis conducted with the private and public sector showed the benefits of the proposed identity card scheme could be quantified at £650m to £1.1bn a year, with a number of other, less quantifiable, strategic benefits&nbsp;— such as disrupting the activities of organised crime and terrorist groups.<ref>http://www.identitycards.gov.uk   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040055/http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/ |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Legislative progress===
The Identity Cards Bill was included in the [[Queen's Speech]] on 23 November 2004, and introduced to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 29 November.

It was first voted on by [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] following the [[second reading]] of the bill on 20 December 2004, where it passed by 385 votes to 93. The bill was opposed by 19 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, 10 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], while a number of Labour and Conservative members abstained, in defiance of party policies. A separate vote on a proposal to reject the Bill was defeated by 306 votes to 93. [[Charles Clarke]], the new Home Secretary, had earlier rejected calls to postpone the reading of the Bill following his recent appointment.

The [[third reading]] of the bill in the Commons was approved on 11 February 2005 by 224 votes to 64; a majority of 160. Although being in favour in principle, the Conservatives officially abstained, but 11 of their MPs joined 19 Labour MPs in voting against the Government. The Bill then passed to the [[House of Lords]], but there was insufficient time to debate the matter, and Labour were unable to do a deal with the Conservatives in the short time available in the days before Parliament was dissolved on 11 April, following the announcement of the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,11026,1452940,00.html#article_continue |title=Casino and ID card bills hit in deal on legislation &#124; Special Reports &#124; Guardian Unlimited Politics |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date= 6 April 2005|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

Labour's [[manifesto]] for the 2005 general election stated that, if returned to power, they would "introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports". In public speeches and on the campaign trail, Labour made clear that they would bring the same Bill back to Parliament. In contrast, the Liberal Democrat manifesto opposed the idea because, they claimed, ID cards "don’t work",<ref>{{cite web |title=Liberal Democrat 2005 Manifesto |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/LD_uk_manifesto.pdf}}</ref> while the Conservatives made no mention of the issue.

====After the 2005 election====
Following their 2005 general election victory, the Labour Government introduced a new Identity Cards Bill, substantially the same as the previous Bill, into the Commons on 25 May. The Conservatives joined the Liberal Democrats in opposing the Bill, saying that it did not pass their "five tests". These tests included confidence that the scheme could be made to work, and its impact on civil liberties. In December 2005, the Conservative Party elected a new leader, future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], who opposed ID cards in principle.

The second reading of the Bill on 28 June was passed, 314 votes to 283, a majority of 31.

At its third reading in the Commons on 18 October, the majority in favour fell to 25, with 309 votes in favour to 284 against.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4354886.stm |title=Politics &#124; Labour survives ID card rebellion |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> In the report stage between the readings, the Bill was amended to prevent the National Identity Register database being linked to the [[Police National Computer]].

In early-2006, the Bill was passed through the [[House of Lords]] committee stage, where 279 amendments were considered. One outcome of this was a vote demanding that the Government instruct the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] to provide a full costing of the scheme over its first ten years, and another demanding that a "secure and reliable method" of recording and storing the data should be found. A third defeat limited the potential for ID cards to be required before people could access public services.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article339073.ece |title=ID Cards Bill in crisis after peers inflict defeat|publisher=News.Independent.co.uk |date=17 January 2006 |access-date=8 May 2010 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Russell |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704193921/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article339073.ece |archive-date=4 July 2008 }}</ref> On 23 January, the House of Lords defeated the government by backing a fully voluntary scheme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4640900.stm |title=Politics &#124; ID cards scheme in Lords defeats |work=BBC News |date=23 January 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

The committee stage ended on 30 January, and the third reading of the Bill took place on 6 February, after which it returned to the Commons. There, on 18 February, the legislation was carried by a majority of 25, with 25 Labour MPs joining those opposing it. Following the defeats in the House of Lords, the government changed the Bill in order to require separate legislation to make the cards compulsory; however, an amendment to make it possible to apply for a biometric passport without having to register on the National Identity Register database was defeated, overturning the Lords' changes to make the Bill fully voluntary. The Lords' amendment requiring a National Audit Office report was rejected.

The Bill returned to the Lords on 6 March, where the Commons amendments were reversed by a majority of 61.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,,1725491,00.html |title=Clarke vows to overturn ID cards defeat &#124; Special Reports &#124; Guardian Unlimited Politics |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date= 7 March 2006|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref> The defeat came despite ministers warning that the Lords should follow the [[Salisbury Convention]] by refraining from blocking a manifesto commitment. Both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats stated generally in 2005 that they no longer felt bound to abide by the convention, while in this specific case several Lords stated that it would not apply as the manifesto commitment was for implementation on a "voluntary basis" as passports are renewed, rather than being compulsory as passports are renewed.

The Government said that until 2010, people could choose not to be issued a card, though they would still have to pay for one, and still be placed on the database.

The Bill received [[Royal Assent]] on 30 March 2006.

===Timescale and implementation progress===
On 11 October 2006, the Labour government announced a timescale described as "highly ambitious" by computer experts.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|author=Sarah Arnott |url=http://www.vnunet.com/computing/news/2166159/cost-id-card-technology |title=Cost of ID card technology pencilled in at £800m |publisher=vnunet.com |accessdate=8 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200641/http://www.vnunet.com/computing/news/2166159/cost-id-card-technology|archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref> The [[Home Office]] announced that it would publish an ID management action plan in the months from November 2006, followed by agreements with departments on their uses for the system. There was to be a report on potential private sector uses for the scheme before 2007 Budget.

On 25 September 2006, Home Office Minister Liam Byrne said that "There are opportunities which give me optimism to think that actually there is a way of exploiting systems already in place in a way which brings down the costs quite substantially".<ref>{{cite news|last=Stone |first=Ollie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5377496.stm |title=Politics &#124; Identity card cost 'may be cut' |work=BBC News |date=25 September 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

Emails leaked in June 2006<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article684968.ece Emails from Whitehall officials in charge of ID cards – Sunday Times – Times Online] published 2006-06-09. Retrieved 3 February 2011</ref> indicated that the plan was already in difficulty, with plans for the early introduction of a limited register and ID card with reduced biometrics known as the "early variant" described as a "huge risk".

Due to the costs of developing a new system from scratch, in 2007 the Government approved an alternative plan to use the Department for Work and Pensions' Customer Information System to store the biographical information, linked to a new database to store biometrics, despite concerns over issues of inter-departmental governance, funding and accountability which were never resolved.<ref>[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2011/01/31/245147/Analysis-How-the-IT-behind-ID-cards-was-never-going-to.htm Analysis: How the IT behind ID cards was never going to work] Computer Weekly, published 2011-01-31. Retrieved 3 February 2011</ref>

The schedule for putting passport applicants' and renewers' details on the National Identity Register (NIR) was never announced. A nationwide network of 68 interview offices for first-time passport applicants started opening in June 2007 and is now complete. The interview consisted mainly of asking applicants to confirm facts about themselves, which someone attempting to steal their identity may not know. The government has stated that all personal information used in the interview not required for the application was destroyed shortly after the passport was issued.<ref>{{cite web|last=Churcher |first=Joe |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/identitycards/Passport-interviews-next-step-to.3347693.jp |title=Passport interviews 'next step to ID cards' – Scotland on Sunday |publisher=Scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> Fingerprints were not taken.

In March 2008, the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]] announced that people could choose to have an identity card, a passport, or both when they become available (although they could not opt out of having their details recorded on the NIR). On 25 November 2008, people making applications to remain in the United Kingdom as a student or based on marriage were required to have an identity card. Under those plans, it was estimated that by the end of 2014–15; about 90% of all foreign nationals would have been issued with one. On 22 January 2008, the Home Office confirmed that large volumes of cards would not be issued until 2012; however, ID cards were issued to workers in critical locations, starting with [[airside (airport)|airside]] workers in [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and [[London City Airport|London City]] airports in 2009, and young people were being offered cards in 2010.

A leaked document, published on 29 January 2008, suggested that "universal compulsion should not be used unless absolutely necessary... due the need for inevitably controversial and time-consuming primary legislation" but that "various forms of coercion, such as designation of the application process for identity documents issued by UK ministers (e.g. passports) were an option to stimulate applications in a manageable way".<ref>Francis Elliott, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3261968.ece ID cards may be issued by coercion, says leaked memo], The Times, 28 January 2008</ref>

[[Fujitsu Services]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]], [[IBM]], [[Steria]] and [[Thales Group]] were still negotiating framework agreements with the government.<ref name="FTJan2308">[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/05ec0a02-c9f5-11dc-b5dc-000077b07658.html Companies abandon ID card project], [[Financial Times]], 23 January 2008</ref>

===Ending of the scheme===
{{Main|Identity Documents Act 2010}}
In the [[Conservative&nbsp;– Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]] that followed the 2010 general election, the new government announced that they planned to scrap the ID card scheme, including the National Identity Register (as well as the next generation of biometric passports and the [[ContactPoint]] database), as part of their measures "to reverse the substantial erosion of civil liberties under the Labour Government and roll back state intrusion."<ref name="conservatives.com"/><ref name="libdems.org.uk"/>

In a document published in May 2010 at the time of the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]], the new Government announced that the scrapping of the scheme would save approximately £86,000,000 over the following 4 years, and avoid a further £800,000,000 in maintenance costs over the decade which were to have been recovered through fees.<ref name=speech-id-docs-bill>[http://www.number10.gov.uk/queens-speech/2010/05/queens-speech-identity-documents-bill-50641 Queen’s Speech&nbsp;– Identity Documents Bill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528110952/http://www.number10.gov.uk/queens-speech/2010/05/queens-speech-identity-documents-bill-50641 |date=28 May 2010 }}, Number10.gov.uk, published 25 May 2010.

==Historical and international comparisons==

===ID cards during the World Wars===
[[File:Id card.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A mid-20th century ID card]]
Compulsory identity cards were first issued in the United Kingdom during [[World War I]], and abandoned in 1919. Cards were re-introduced during [[World War II]] under the [[National Registration Act 1939]], but were abandoned seven years after the end of that war, in 1952,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} amid widespread public resentment. The National Register however, became the National Health Service Register and is maintained to this day.

The World War I identity card scheme was highly unpopular, though accepted in the light of the prevailing national emergency. It is possible to take a small measure of how the national identity scheme was received from remarks by the historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in his ''English History, 1914–1945'', where he describes the whole thing as an "indignity" and talks of the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] "harassing" people for their cards.<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'', pp. 563, 599.</ref>

After the Second World War the government of [[Clement Attlee]] decided to continue the scheme in the face of the [[Cold War]] and the perceived Soviet threat, though it grew ever less popular. In the mind of the public it was more and more associated with bureaucratic interference and regulation, reflected, most particularly, in the 1949 comedy film ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]''. Identity cards also became the subject of a celebrated civil liberties case in 1950. [[Harry Willcock]], a member of the Liberal Party, refused to produce his after being stopped by the police. During his subsequent trial he argued that identity cards had no place in peacetime, a defence rejected by the magistrate's court. In his subsequent appeal, ''[[Willcock v Muckle]]'', the judgment of the lower court was upheld.

Protest reached Parliament, where the Conservative and Liberal peers voiced their anger over what they saw as "Socialist card-indexing".  After the defeat of the Labour Government in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|general election of October 1951]] the incoming [[Conservative Government 1951–1957|Conservative administration]] of [[Winston Churchill]] was pledged to get rid of the scheme, "to set the people free", in the words of one minister. Cheers rang out when on 21 February 1952 the Minister for Health, [[Harry Crookshank]], announced in the House of Commons that national identity cards were to be scrapped. This was a popular move, adopted against the wishes of the police and the security services, though the decision to repeal the 1939 legislation was, in significant part, driven by the need for economies. By 1952 national registration was costing £500,000 per annum ({{Inflation|UK|500000|1952|fmt=eq|r=-5|cursign=£}}) and required 1500 civil servants to administer it.

===International comparisons===

====Identity cards====
During the UK Presidency of the EU in 2005 a decision was made to "agree common standards for security features and secure issuing procedures for ID cards (December 2005), with detailed standards agreed as soon as possible thereafter. In this respect, the UK Presidency has put forward a proposal for EU-wide use of biometrics in national ID cards."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=21269 |title=UK Presidency advances EU-wide ID card standards, data retention and intelligence sharing to fight terrorism, 14&nbsp;July 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Australia]] started work on a [[Health and social services access card (Australia)|health and social services access card]], but the government elected in the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]] cancelled it.

[[Belgium]] has introduced the [[Belgian national identity card|Electronic identity card]] or eID card from 2004 and by 2012 every citizen in Belgium must have an e-ID card for identity purposes. A variant exists for children, but that is not compulsory.

====Biometrics in identity and travel documents====
There has been an international move towards the introduction of biometrics into identity and travel documents. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] has recommended that all countries adopt [[biometric passport]]s, and the [[United States]] has made it a requirement for entering the US under the visa waiver programme. Biometric border control systems have been established in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, and the EU is introducing biometric visas. Internationally, the only requirement for biometric passports is a digital photograph.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==System==

===Legal requirements===

Under the NIS UK Residents who wanted or were required to apply for an ID card would have been required to fulfil certain functions:

*Attend in person to have their fingerprints recorded at one of the Identity & Passport Service's High Street partners.
*Promptly inform the police or Identity & Passport Service if a card is lost or damaged, and apply for a new card.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/06/id-cards-legislation-fines-tories |title=£1,000 fines to bolster ID cards as Tories pledge to scrap scheme|work=The Guardian|date= 6 July 2009|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>
*Promptly inform the Identity & Passport Service of any change of address.
*Promptly inform the Identity & Passport Service of any prescribed change of circumstances affecting the information recorded about them in the Register.

Failure to do so would have meant a penalty of up to £1,000 or a shortened permission to stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/while-in-uk/do-i-need-id-card/responsibilities/ |title=UK Border Agency &#124; Identity card holders' responsibilities |publisher=Ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805190105/http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/while-in-uk/do-i-need-id-card/responsibilities/ |archive-date=5 August 2012}}</ref>

===National Identity Register===
Key to the ID Card scheme was a centralised computer database, the National Identity Register (NIR). To identify someone it would not have been necessary to check their card, since identity could be determined by a taking a biometric scan and matching it against a database entry.

ID cards for foreign nationals were produced by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in Swansea on behalf of the Home Office.

===Identity Registration Number===
One entry on the NIR was the Identity Registration Number. The Home Office had recognised that a unique identifier was needed as a [[primary key]] for the database.

The Home Office's Identity Cards Benefits Overview document<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/ajwatson/no2id-other/2005-06-27%20Identity%20Cards%20Scheme%20-%20Benefits%20Overview.pdf Identity Cards Scheme – Benefits Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218203711/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/ajwatson/no2id-other/2005-06-27%20Identity%20Cards%20Scheme%20-%20Benefits%20Overview.pdf |date=18 February 2006 }}, [[Home Office]]</ref> described how the IRN would have enabled [[data sharing]] amongst police databases (including the Police DNA database), legal databases, and even corporate databases (including bank and travel operators).

===Types of cards===
Three types of identity cards were issued:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/hs.xsl/968.htm |title=Types of identity card |publisher=IPS |accessdate=8 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515164545/http://www.ips.gov.uk/cps/rde/xchg/ips_live/hs.xsl/968.htm |archive-date=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

* The ''National Identity Card'', which was lilac and salmon in colour, was issued to British citizens only.  It contained the text "British Citizen" and was a valid travel document for entry into any EEA state and Switzerland until its invalidation in 2010.
* The ''Identification Card'' was turquoise and green in colour and did not mention the holder's nationality. It was issued to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens living in the UK (including Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jul/30/identity-cards-union-flag-uk |title=No room for union flag as Alan Johnson unveils the British identity card|work=The Guardian|date= 30 July 2009|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>).

* The ''Identity Card for Foreign Nationals'' was blue and pink in colour<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/idcardsforforeignnationals/ |title=UK Border Agency &#124; Identity cards for foreign nationals |publisher=Ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318133446/http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/idcardsforforeignnationals/ |archive-date=18 March 2009 }}</ref> and was issued to certain categories of immigrants from non-EU/EEA countries.

==Use as travel document==
Until midnight on 21 January 2011, the National Identity Card was officially recognised as a valid travel document by the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and [[Switzerland]], following which the United Kingdom instructed immigration authorities therein to cease accepting it as a valid travel document. It also became accepted voluntarily by a number of other European countries but its current validity in these additional countries remains unclear, given that its acceptance and subsequent denial by these countries was never mandated by the United Kingdom through EU or EEA channels. It was the only travel document valid for use by UK nationals throughout the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] and [[Switzerland]], other than a valid British citizen passport or a pink [[Gibraltar identity card]].  The exception to this was for travel to the [[Republic of Ireland]].  All British citizens are entitled to enter the Republic of Ireland without the need to carry a valid travel document, on account of the [[Common Travel Area]] agreement.

==Reaction==

The announcement of the scheme had seen a mixed reaction from both the public and from figures connected to terrorism and law enforcement.

===Public reaction===
{{For|a detailed account of opinion polls concerning the National Identity Card|Opinion polls on the British national identity card}}

Over a period of time, public opinion, as measured by opinion polls, appears to have shifted away from support for the scheme towards opposition. This appeared to have become more of a concern since the disclosure of the [[2007 UK Child Benefit data scandal|loss of 25&nbsp;million records]] by [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]].

In 2003, the announcement of the scheme was followed by a public consultation exercise, particularly among 'stakeholder groups'. At March 2003 the government stated that the overall results were:

:in favour: 2606 responses (61%)
:against:   1587 responses (38%)
:neutral:     48 responses (1%)

By July 2006, an ICM poll<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/2006/No2ID%20July/ID%20Card%20Survey.asp |title=Media Centre&nbsp;— Polls |publisher=ICM Research |date=4 April 2010 |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211072009/http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/2006/No2ID%20July/ID%20Card%20Survey.asp |archive-date=11 February 2007 }}</ref> indicated that public support had fallen to 46%, with opposition at 51%.

A further poll by [[YouGov]]/Daily Telegraph, published on 4 December 2006, indicated support for the identity card element of the scheme at 50%, with 39% opposed. Support for the national database was weaker, with 22% happy and 78% unhappy with the prospect of having their data recorded. Only 11% trusted the government to keep the data confidential. 3.12% of the sample were prepared to undergo long prison sentences rather than have a card.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080227042751/http://www.yougov.com/archives/pdf/TEL060101024_4.pdf Survey Report].

===Terrorism and crime===
[[Eliza Manningham-Buller]], the former head of Britain's counter-intelligence and security agency [[MI5]] was on record as supporting the introduction of identity cards, as was [[Sir Ian Blair]], former Commissioner of the [[Metropolitan Police]] and his predecessor, Sir John [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|(now Lord) Stevens]]. The [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] was also supportive.

However, in November 2005 [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Stella Rimington]], who was [[Director-General of MI5|Director General]] of [[MI5]] before Eliza Manningham-Buller, questioned the usefulness of the proposed scheme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4444512.stm |title=Politics &#124; Ex-MI5 chief sparks ID card row |work=BBC News |date=17 November 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>
This intervention caused a good deal of controversy amongst supporters and opponents of the scheme, especially as Manningham-Buller stated that ID cards would in fact disrupt the activities of terrorists, noting that significant numbers of terrorists take advantage of the weaknesses of current identification methods to assist their activities.

[[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|Lord Carlile]] was appointed after 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 to independently review the working of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] and subsequent anti-terrorist laws.<ref>[http://www.lawreports.co.uk/Newsletter/OnlineArticles/JurisprudenceReviewLaunch2.html Jurisprudence Review Launch 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725040342/http://www.lawreports.co.uk/Newsletter/OnlineArticles/JurisprudenceReviewLaunch2.html |date=25 July 2008 }}, ICLR. Retrieved 15 October 2010</ref> Talking on [[GMTV]] on 29 January 2006, he expressed his views on the proposed legislation, saying<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4659228.stm |title=UK &#124; UK Politics &#124; ID cards are of 'limited value' |work=BBC News |date=29 January 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> that ID cards could be of limited value in the fight against terrorism but that Parliament had to judge that value against the curtailment of civil liberties. Speaking on the same programme, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, former Met Police Commissioner, argued in favour for the need for identity cards, saying they had benefits in tackling serious crimes, such as money laundering and identity theft.

==Objections to the scheme==

===Costs===
Independent studies including one by the [[London School of Economics]] had suggested that costs could be as much as £12&nbsp;billion to £18&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives/2005/IDCard_FinalReport.htm |title=ID Cards&nbsp;— UK's high tech scheme is high risk |publisher=LSE |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129113359/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/collections/pressAndInformationOffice/newsAndEvents/archives/2005/IDCard_FinalReport.htm |archive-date=29 January 2009 }}</ref> The reliability of this study was challenged by the Labour Government which disputed some of the assumptions used in the calculations, such as the need to retake biometric information every 5 years. The government argued that this assumption had not been supported by any research in the London School of Economics report, and that biometric experts quoted in the LSE reports had sought to distance themselves from its findings. The Government also claimed that the authors of these estimates were established opponents to the scheme and could not be considered unbiased academic sources.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[Tony McNulty]], [[Home Office]] minister who was responsible for the scheme, responded by saying a "ceiling" on costs would be announced in October 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4744153.stm |title=(BBC) |work=BBC News |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> There were indications that the Labour Government was looking at ways of subsidising the scheme by charging other Government Departments, with the implication that this would result in increased charges for other Government services to individuals or businesses.<ref>[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/05/id_laundry_analysis Clarke's ID card cost laundry starts to break surface]. The Register. 5 July 2005</ref>

After the 2005 general election the Home Office stated that it would cost £584&nbsp;million a year to run the scheme. In October 2006, the Government declared it would cost £5.4bn to run the ID cards scheme for the next 10 years.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6033687.stm |title=Politics &#124; ID card scheme cost put at £5.4bn |work=BBC News |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> In May 2007 the Home Office forecast a cost rise of £400m to £5.3&nbsp;billion,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6642339.stm |title=ID card cost rises above £5bn |work=BBC News |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> a figure revised in November 2007 to £5.612bn.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7084560.stm |title=ID card scheme 'to cost £5.6bn' |work=BBC News |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

===Effectiveness===
The then Home Secretary David Blunkett stated in 2004 said the cards would stop people using multiple identities and boost the fight against terrorism and organised crime. However, human rights group Liberty disputed this, pointing out that the existence of another form of ID cards in Spain did not prevent the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid train bombings]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3655497.stm |title=UK &#124; Politics &#124; ID cards 'cannot stop terrorism' |work=BBC News |date=24 April 2004 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

However, Blunkett subsequently made a significant U-turn. At his opening speech for Infosecurity Europe on 27 April 2009, he stepped back from the concept of a full National Identity Database for every citizen, saying it would be sufficient to improve the verification of passports.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wakefield |first=Jane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8022791.stm |title=Technology &#124; Blunkett seeks 'end to ID cards' |work=BBC News |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/apr/28/blunkett-id-cards |title=Scrap ID cards plan, says David Blunkett &#124; Politics &#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian|date= 28 April 2009|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yada-yada.co.uk/ReedExhibitions/InfosecurityEurope/DavidBlunkett/ |title=Infosecurity Europe: Opening Address presented by the RT Hon David Blunkett MP, Member of Parliament for Sheffield, Brightside |publisher=Yada-yada.co.uk |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127210423/http://www.yada-yada.co.uk/ReedExhibitions/InfosecurityEurope/DavidBlunkett/ |archive-date=27 November 2009 }}</ref>

His successor, Charles Clarke, said that ID cards "cannot stop attacks", in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and added that he doubted it would have prevented the atrocities. However, he felt that on the balance between protecting civil liberties and preventing crime, ID cards would help rather than hinder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4663155.stm |title=Politics &#124; ID cards 'wouldn't stop attacks' |work=BBC News |date=8 July 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

===Ethnic minorities===
The Government's Race Equality Impact Assessment<ref>http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/downloads/Identity_cards_Bil_Race_Equality.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040023/http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/downloads/Identity_cards_Bil_Race_Equality.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> indicated significant concern among ethnic groups over how the police would use their powers under an Identity Cards Act 2006, with 64% of [[British Afro-Caribbean community|black]] and 53% of Indian respondents having expressed concern, particularly about the potential for abuse and [[racial discrimination|discrimination]]. In their January 2005 report<ref>http://83.137.212.42/sitearchive/cre/downloads/id_cards.doc  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911071213/http://83.137.212.42/sitearchive/cre/downloads/id_cards.doc |date=11 September 2008 }}</ref> on the Bill, the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] stated that the fear of discrimination is neither misconceived nor exaggerated, and note that this is also an ongoing issue in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]].

The CRE were also concerned that disproportionate requirements by employers and the authorities for ethnic minorities to identify themselves may lead to a two-tiered structure amongst racial groups, with foreign nationals and British ethnic minorities feeling compelled to register while British white people do not.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3809373.stm |title=Politics &#124; Race watchdog warns on ID cards |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2004 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://83.137.212.42/sitearchive/cre/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew09w.RefLocID-0hg00900f006.Lang-EN.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126150754/http://83.137.212.42/sitearchive/cre/Default.aspx.LocID-0hgnew09w.RefLocID-0hg00900f006.Lang-EN.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 January 2009|title=Identity Cards Bill, House of Lords report stage|date=26 January 2009}}</ref>

According to the CRE, certain groups who move location frequently and who tend to live on low incomes (such as [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Romanichal|travellers]], [[asylum-seeker]]s and [[refugee]]s) would risk being criminalised under the legislation through failing to update their registration each time they moved due to lack of funds to pay the fee that may be charged.

===Concerns raised by the Information Commissioner===

In a press release on 30 July 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/cms/DocumentUploads/ICO%20publishes%20concerns%20on%20identity%20cards%20-%2030.07.04.doc |title=(.doc file) |publisher=Informationcommissioner.gov.uk |date=30 April 2010 |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325232909/http://www.informationcommissioner.gov.uk/cms/DocumentUploads/ICO%20publishes%20concerns%20on%20identity%20cards%20-%2030.07.04.doc |archive-date=25 March 2006 }}</ref> [[Richard Thomas (lawyer)|Richard Thomas]] the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] stated that
a NIR raised substantial data protection and personal privacy concerns. He sought clarification of why so much personal information needed to be kept as part of establishing an individual's identity and indicated concern about the wide range of bodies who would view the records of services individuals have used. The Commissioner also pointed out that those who renew or apply for a [[Driver's license|driving licence]] or [[passport]] were to be automatically added to the National Identity Register, and so would lose the option of not registering. He subsequently stated: "My anxiety is that we don't sleepwalk into a [[surveillance society]]."<ref>{{cite news|author=Rachel Sylvester |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1218615_1,00.html |title=Beware rise of Big Brother state, warns data watchdog&nbsp;— Britain |publisher=Times Online |accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>
In February 2003, on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today programme|''Today'' programme]], he warned that ID cards could become a target for identity theft by [[organized crime|organised crime]].

===Human rights===
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
On 2 February 2005, the UK Parliament's [[List of Committees of the United Kingdom Parliament|Joint Committee on Human Rights]] questioned the compatibility of the Bill with [[Echr article 8|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (the right to respect for private life) and Article 14 (the right to non-discrimination),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/3861/194 |title=IDABC&nbsp;— UK: UK's ID Cards Bill wins parliamentary vote despite Human |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |accessdate=8 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> both of which are encapsulated in the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].

===Feature creep===
Even without new primary legislation, the Identity Cards Act 2006 allowed the potential scope of the scheme to be much greater than that usually publicised by the Government.

For example, Gordon Brown was reported to be "planning a massive expansion of the ID cards project that would widen surveillance of everyday life by allowing high-street businesses to share confidential information with police databases."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hinsliff|first=Gaby|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/06/idcards.immigrationpolicy|title=Brown to let shops share ID card data|work=The Observer|date= 6 August 2006|accessdate=8 May 2010|location=London}}</ref>
Francis Elliott reporting on the development for ''The Independent'' noted that "police could be alerted as soon as a wanted person used a biometric-enabled cash card or even entered a building via an iris-scan door".<ref>{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Francis|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/id-plans-powers-set-to-widen-6232092.html|title=ID plans: powers set to widen|work=The Independent|date=5 August 2006|accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref>

The wartime National Registration ID card expanded from 3 functions to 39 by the time it was abolished.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wakefield |first=Jane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3731465.stm |title=Technology &#124; Opponents take on ID card plans |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2004 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

Concerns had also been raised following Tony Blair's response to an ID card petition stating that the fingerprint register would be used to compare the fingerprints of the population at large against the records of 900,000 unsolved crimes. Opposition MPs claimed that the use of the [[biometric]] data in this way would directly breach promises given during the Commons debate that there would be adequate safeguards preventing the use of ID card data for "fishing expeditions".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones |first=George |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/20/nidcards20.xml |title=ID cards 'will allow crime fingerprint checks' |work=The Telegraph|date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/homeaffairs/story/0,,2017401,00.html |title=Blair under fire over police access to ID card database &#124; Special Reports &#124; Guardian Unlimited Politics |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date= 20 February 2007|accessdate=8 May 2010 | location=London}}</ref>

===Database extent and access===
Home Office forecasts envisaged that "265 government departments and as many as 48,000 accredited [[private sector]] organisations" would have had access to the database, and that 163&nbsp;million identity verifications or more would take place each year.<ref>http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/library/procurement_strategy_market_soundings.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212005139/http://www.identitycards.gov.uk/library/procurement_strategy_market_soundings.pdf |date=12 December 2006 }}</ref>
However, the IPS had stated that only the data needed for the passport would have been kept<ref>[http://www.ips.gov.uk/identity/downloads/Doc_D_%20IPS_delivery_report_8.pdf Identity and Passport Service | Home Office] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618221505/http://www.ips.gov.uk/identity/downloads/Doc_D_%20IPS_delivery_report_8.pdf |date=18 June 2009 }}. Ips.gov.uk. Retrieved on 13 June 2011.</ref> and that organisations that have permission to access the data held on the Register could only have done so with the individual's permission, unless to prevent or investigate a crime.

===Vulnerable individuals===
The CRE had also recommended that more work was required to protect the interests of vulnerable individuals. For example, people escaping from [[domestic violence]] or a [[forced marriage]] may have been at risk if their previous names or addresses were disclosed. Minister Meg Hillier, in a letter to ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine, claimed that as the ID card would not have someone's address on it, it would protect such a person's privacy in a way currently unavailable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/letters/3212856/letters-10/ | work=The Spectator|date=7 January 2009 |title=ID cards are attractive | first=Meg | last=Hillier}}</ref>

===Identity theft===
In May 2005 [[Tony Blair]] said "ID cards are needed to stop the soaring costs of [[identity theft]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4577087.stm |title=Politics &#124; Blair defends identity card plan |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2005 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> However, security experts claimed that placing trust in a single document may make identity theft easier, since only this document needs to be targeted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000102&sid=a7DltmImQUYE |title=Bloomberg.com: U.K |publisher=Quote.bloomberg.com |date=26 April 2004 |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930070550/http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000102&sid=a7DltmImQUYE |archive-date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Technology===
Elsewhere, doubts remained concerning the practicability of the scheme. Existing government systems were not appropriate for the issuing to [[United Kingdom|UK]] citizens from 2009.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Tests of [[facial recognition system|facial recognition software]] dating from 2006 showed error rates of up to 52 per cent for the disabled.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=David |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/14/biometric_id_delusion/page2.html |title=The biometric delusion |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

==Opposition campaigns==
In May 2006, [[NO2ID]] launched the "Renew for Freedom" campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewforfreedom.org |title=renew your passport |publisher=renew for freedom |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> urging passport holders to renew their passports in the summer of 2006 to delay being entered on the [[National Identity Register]]. This followed the comment made by [[Charles Clarke]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that "anyone who feels strongly enough about the linkage [between passports and the ID scheme] not to want to be issued with an ID card in the initial phase will be free to surrender their existing passport and apply for a new passport before the designation order takes effect".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2006-03-21a.181.2 |title=I beg to move, That this House does...: 21 Mar 2006: House of Commons debates |publisher=TheyWorkForYou.com |date=20 December 2004 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

In response, the Home Office said that it was "hard to see what would be achieved, other than incurring unnecessary expense" by renewing passports early.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5016490.stm |title=Politics &#124; Home Office questions ID protest |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> However, the [[British passport#Fees|cost of a passport]] was £51 at the time, then increased in 2006 and 2007 to £72 and was due to rise to £93 after the introduction of ID cards.

===Scotland===
Although policy on passports and the National Identity Scheme was not an area devolved to the [[Scottish Government]], on 19 November 2008 the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7736588.stm Holyrood rejects identity cards], BBC News, 19 November 2008</ref> to reject the ID card scheme, with no votes against the [[Scottish Government|government]] [[Parliamentary motion|motion]], and only the [[Scottish Labour]] MSPs [[abstaining]].

The introduction of compulsory ID cards to Northern Ireland would likely have provoked serious opposition given the large [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]] community who regard themselves as Irish and not British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nihrc.org/dms/data/NIHRC/attachments/dd/files/104/More_than_just_a_card_FINAL.pdf |title=Microsoft Word&nbsp;— More than just a card FINAL.doc |access-date=8 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220110608/http://www.nihrc.org/dms/data/NIHRC/attachments/dd/files/104/More_than_just_a_card_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2010 }}</ref> In an effort to counter this, the British Government decided not to include the [[Union Flag]] on the card, and had stated that a separate card will be issued to Northern Irish people who identify their nationality as [[Ireland|Irish]].  The separate card would not have included any statement of nationality, and as such, could not have been used as a travel document as only the [[Irish Government]] may issue travel documents for Irish citizens.  Home Secretary Alan Johnson had also stated that the inclusion of Northern Irish people on the National Identity Register of British citizens would not have prevented such people from claiming full Irish citizenship rights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8176699.stm |title=UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; ID card 'recognises Irish rights' |work=BBC News |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>
