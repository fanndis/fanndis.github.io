Their settlement was initially limited to the [[Shawmut Peninsula]], at that time surrounded by the [[Massachusetts Bay]] and [[Charles River]] and connected to the mainland by a narrow [[isthmus]]. The [[peninsula]] is thought to have been inhabited as early as 4000 BC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/mhc/mhcexh/exhidx.htm |title=Archaeology of the Central Artery Project: Highway to the Past |year=2007 |publisher=Commonwealth Museum – Massachusetts Historical Commission |access-date=April 6, 2007}}</ref>

In 1629, the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s first governor [[John Winthrop]] led the signing of the [[Cambridge Agreement]], a key founding document of the city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history;{{sfn|Christopher|2006|p=46}} America's first public school, [[Boston Latin School]], was founded in Boston in 1635.<ref name="BPS" />

[[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]] and [[the pine tree shilling]] played a central role in the establishment of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the [[Old South Church]] in the 1600s. In 1652 the [[Massachusetts legislature]] authorized [[John Hull (merchant)|John Hull]] to [[Moneyer|produce]] coinage . "The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including the pine tree shilling, for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical." <ref>https://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMDJHN_The_Hull_Mint_Boston_MA</ref>[[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] for reasons which were mostly political deemed the "Hull Mint" [[high treason]] which had a punishment of being [[Hanging, drawing and quartering|hung, drawn and quartered]].

Many of the crucial events of the [[American Revolution]]{{sfn|Morris|2005|p=7}} occurred in or near Boston. Boston's penchant for mob action along with the colonists' growing lack of faith in either [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] or [[Parliament of Great Britain|its Parliament]] fostered a revolutionary spirit in the city.<ref name="newamernation" /> When the British parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of [[Andrew Oliver]], the official tasked with enforcing the Act, and [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.<ref name="newamernation" /><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Edmund S. |date=1946 |title=Thomas Hutchinson and the Stamp Act |journal=The New England Quarterly |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=459–492 |doi=10.2307/361566 |jstor=361566}}</ref> The British sent two regiments to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the colonists. In 1770, during the [[Boston Massacre]], British troops shot into a crowd that had started to violently harass them. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.<ref name="empireontheedge" />
[[File:Dorchester Heights Monument - DSC00770.JPG|thumb|left|The Dorchester Heights Monument was erected on the spot where Putnam's fortifications were placed.  American forces held the city for the remainder of the war.]]

In 1773, Parliament passed the [[Tea Act]]. Many of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the [[Townshend Acts]]. The act prompted the [[Boston Tea Party]], where a group of angered Bostonian citizens threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the [[East India Company]] into [[Boston Harbor]]. The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution, as the British government responded furiously with the [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]], demanding compensation for the destroyed tea from the Bostonians.<ref name="newamernation" /> This angered the colonists further and led to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The war began in the area surrounding Boston with the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name="newamernation" /><ref name="frothingham">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cu9BAAAAIAAJ |title=History of the Siege of Boston and of the Battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill |last=Frothingham, Jr |first=Richard |publisher=Little and Brown |year=1851}}</ref>

Boston itself was besieged for almost a year during the [[Siege of Boston]], which began on April 19, 1775. The New England militia impeded the movement of the [[British Army]]. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]], then the commander-in-chief of the British forces in North America, led the British army in the siege. On June 17, the British captured the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown peninsula]] in Boston, during the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there, but it was a [[pyrrhic victory]] for the British because their army suffered irreplaceable casualties. It was also a testament to the skill and training of the militia, as their stubborn defence made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering further irreplaceable casualties.<ref name="allemn">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PqZcY9z3Vn4C |title=The Siege of Boston |last=French |first=Allen |publisher=Macmillan |year=1911 |ref=French |author-link=Allen French}}</ref><ref name="1776book">{{Cite book |title=1776 |title-link=1776 (book) |last=McCullough |first=David |date=2005 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-2671-4 |location=New York, NY}}</ref>

Several weeks later, [[George Washington]] took over the militia after the [[Continental Congress]] established the [[Continental Army]] to unify the revolutionary effort. Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. The narrow Boston Neck, which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, and a long stalemate ensued.  A young officer, [[Rufus Putnam]], came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness.  Putnam supervised this effort, which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannon on Dorchester Heights that [[Henry Knox]] had laboriously brought through the snow from Fort Ticonderoga.  The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them.  General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months.  The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shot could not reach the colonists' cannons at such a height.  The British gave up, boarded their ships and sailed away.  Boston still celebrates "Evacuation Day" each year.  Washington was so impressed, he made [[Rufus Putnam]] his chief engineer.<ref name="frothingham" /><ref name="allemn" /><ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=46}}

In the 1820s, Boston's population grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]].

During the mid-to-late 19th century, workers filled almost {{convert|600|acres|km2|abbr=on}} of brackish Charles River marshlands west of [[Boston Common]] with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. The city annexed the adjacent towns of [[South Boston]] (1804), [[East Boston]] (1836), [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] (1868), [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] (including present-day [[Mattapan]] and a portion of [[South Boston]]) (1870), [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] (including present-day [[Allston]]) (1874), [[West Roxbury]] (including present-day [[Jamaica Plain]] and [[Roslindale]]) (1874), [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] (1874), and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] (1912).<ref>{{Cite book |title=Historical Atlas of Massachusetts |publisher=University of Massachusetts |year=1991 |page=37}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=j_L08ikdUrkC |title=Boston's Changeful Times: Origins of Preservation and Planning in America |last=Holleran |first=Michael |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8018-6644-9 |page=41 |chapter=Problems with Change |access-date=August 22, 2010 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j_L08ikdUrkC&lpg=PA41&pg=PA39}}</ref> Other proposals were unsuccessful for the annexation of [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873|Brookline]], Cambridge,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1892/03/27/archives/bostons-annexation-schemes-proposal-to-absorb-cambridge-and-other.html |title=Boston's Annexation Schemes.; Proposal To Absorb Cambridge And Other Near-By Towns |date=March 26, 1892 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1892/03/27/104093600.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 1892 |page=11}}</ref> and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59275776.html?FMT=ABS&date=Oct%2013,%201991 |title=Has the time for Chelsea's annexation to Boston come?

===Early 20th century===
[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], opened in 1912.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Fenway-Park</ref> 	

Many architecturally significant buildings were built during these early years of the 20th century: [[Horticultural Hall, Boston, Massachusetts|Horticultural Hall]],<ref>https://lostnewengland.com/2016/01/horticultural-hall-boston/</ref> the [[Tennis and Racquet Club]],<ref>http://tandr.org/</ref> [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]],<ref>https://www.gardnermuseum.org/</ref> [[Fenway Studios]],<ref>https://fenwaystudios.org/</ref> [[Jordan Hall]],<ref>https://necmusic.edu/jordan-hall</ref> and the [[Boston Opera House (1909)|Boston Opera House]].  The [[Longfellow Bridge]],<ref>https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/longfellow-bridge-got-name/</ref> built in 1906, was mentioned by [[Robert McCloskey]] in ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]]'', describing its "salt and pepper shakers" feature.<ref>https://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/make-way-for-ducklings.html</ref>

[[Logan International Airport]] opened on September 8, 1923.<ref>http://web.mit.edu/rama/www/logan_history.htm</ref> The [[Boston Bruins]] were founded in 1924 and played their first game at [[Boston Garden]] in November 1928.<ref>https://www.nhl.com/bruins/team/history</ref>
 
Boston went into decline by the early to mid-20th century, as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere.{{sfn|Bluestone|Stevenson|2002|p=13}} Boston responded by initiating various [[urban renewal]] projects, under the direction of the [[Boston Planning and Development Agency|Boston Redevelopment Authority]] (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition, and thousands of families were displaced.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2005/08/07/born_again/ |title=Born Again |last=Collins, Monica |date=August 7, 2005 |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=May 8, 2007}}</ref>

The BRA continued implementing [[eminent domain]] projects, including the clearance of the vibrant [[Scollay Square]] area for construction of the modernist style [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]]. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] neighborhood, the first [[Community health centers in the United States|Community Health Center]] in the United States. It mostly served the massive [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]] public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953.

By the 1970s, the city's economy had begun to recover after 30 years of economic downturn. A large number of high-rises were constructed in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] and in Boston's [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] during this period.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=195}} This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Schools such as the [[Boston Architectural College]], [[Boston College]], [[Boston University]], the [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Tufts University School of Medicine]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], [[Wentworth Institute of Technology]], [[Berklee College of Music]], the [[Boston Conservatory]], and many others attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over [[desegregation busing]], which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|pp=194–195}}

Like many major American cities, Boston has seen a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s. Boston's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs, as well as involvement from the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney and District Attorney]]'s offices. This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the "Boston Miracle". Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 (for a murder rate of 26.5 per 100,000 people) to just 31—not one of them a juvenile—in 1999 (for a murder rate of 5.26 per 100,000).<ref name="End of a Miracle">{{Cite web |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |title=End of a Miracle? |last=Winship, Christopher |date=March 2002 |publisher=Harvard University |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522063733/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/winship/End_of_a_Miracle.pdf |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |access-date=February 19, 2007}}</ref>

==Environment==
===Pollution control===
[[Air quality]] in Boston is generally very good. Between 2004 and 2013, there were only four days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public, according to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].<ref name="EPA AirCompare">{{Cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=aircomp&_debug=0&_program=dataprog.wcj_byyearhealth.sas&geocode=25025&condition=none&citycounty=county |title=EPA AirCompare Historical Profile |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |access-date=December 26, 2014}}</ref>

Some of the cleaner energy facilities in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.allaccessboston.com/Green-District-Allston |title=The Green District Allston |website=Encore Realty}}</ref> Boston is also breaking ground on multiple [[green affordable housing]] facilities to help reduce the carbon impact of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and to partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.<ref name="scorecard.goodguide.com">{{Cite web |url=http://scorecard.goodguide.com/community/index.tcl?zip_code=02108&set_community_zipcode_cookie_p=t&x=16&y=7 |title=About Your Community |website=goodguide.com}}</ref>

Mayor Thomas Menino introduced the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient. This gives people an opportunity to find housing in neighborhoods that support the environment. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free, in-home energy assessment.<ref name="scorecard.goodguide.com" />

===Water purity and availability===
Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area's fill; these piles remain sound if submerged in water, but are subject to [[dry rot]] if exposed to air for long periods.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bsces.org/index.cfm/page/Where-Has-All-the-Water-Gone-Left-Piles-Rotting.../cdid/10778/pid/10371 |title=Where Has All the Water Gone?

Ground water levels have been dropping in many areas of the city, due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. The Boston Groundwater Trust coordinates monitoring ground water levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/eeos/groundwater.asp Groundwater], CityofBoston.gov</ref> However, Boston's drinking water supply from the [[Quabbin Reservoir|Quabbin]] and [[Wachusett Reservoir]]s<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Your Drinking Water: Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, 2006 Drinking Water Report |date=June 19, 2007 |publisher=Massachusetts Water Resources Authority}}</ref> is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy the Federal [[Clean Water Act]] without filtration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/07/22/pure_water_right_on_tap/ |title=Pure water, right on Tap |last=Abraham, Yvonne |date=July 22, 2007 |work=The Boston Globe |access-date=June 7, 2011}}</ref>

As a coastal city built largely on [[Land reclamation|fill]], [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]] is of major concern to the city government. The latest version of the climate action plan anticipates between two and seven feet of sea-level rise in Boston by the end of the century. A separate initiative, Resilient Boston Harbor, lays out neighborhood-specific recommendations for coastal resilience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.gov/environment-and-energy/resilient-boston-harbor|title=Resilient Boston Harbor|date=2018-09-24|website=Boston.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>
