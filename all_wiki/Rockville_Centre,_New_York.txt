'''Rockville Centre''', commonly abbreviated as '''RVC''', is an incorporated [[Village (New York)|village]] located in [[Nassau County, New York]], in the United States. At the time of the [[United States 2010 Census|2010 census]], the village had a total population of 24,023. It is in the southwestern section of the [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Town of Hempstead]].

== History ==
Rockville Centre has been occupied by humans for thousands of years. Generally speaking, the people of the prehistoric Woodlands period East River culture are believed to have been the [[Algonquian languages|Algonkian-speaking]] ancestors of the historical Indian tribes of western Long Island.<ref>[http://www.garviespointmuseum.com/indian-archaeology-long-island.php ''The Indian Archaeology of Long Island''], Garvies Point Museum and Reserve, accessed February 2018.</ref>  The historical territory of their [[Lenape]] descendants, the Canarsie, Recouwacky (Rockaway),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jHcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA179&dq=Reckonhacky&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqt73A_pXZAhUGjlkKHTwQAN4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&q=Reckonhacky&f=false ''Aboriginal Place Names of New York'', Bulletin of the New York State Museum, 1907; page 179; accessed 8 February 2018.]</ref> Matinecock and Massapequa, included present-day western Long Island's Queens and Nassau Counties.

By the year 1643, there were roughly thirteen Algonquin bands (then referred to as tribes) living east of the Dutch-English settlements: the four or so [[Lenape]] chieftaincies in western Long Island, and [[Metoac]] descendants of the prehistoric Woodlands period Windsor culture living on eastern Long Island, considered by some to be branches of the [[Pequot]]: Merrick, Nissequoge, Secatoag, Seatauket, Patchoag, Poosepatuck (also called Uncachogee), Corchaug, Shinnecock, Manhasset and Montaukett.

Imported diseases had decimated the natives in 16th century. While disease was still a major factor during the decades of the 17th century, native mortality in western Long Island due to disease was similar to that of the settlers. Most [[Lenape]] were pushed out of their homeland by expanding European colonies; the colonies received many emigrants while the [[Munsee]]-speaking Indian communities did not. Their dire situation was exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.

The Reckouakie tribe (the Reckonhacky chieftaincy) had left their original land in present-day [[Rockaway, Queens|Rockaway]] and its surroundings in [[Queens County, New York|Queens County]] to Dutch Governor Kieft in 1640 because he wanted it for better defense of New Netherlands.<ref>[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/indianwars/articles/kieftswar.aspx ''Governor Kieft's Personal War''], by Walter Giersbach; accessed February 2018.</ref> Most settled to the east in what was to become Rockville Centre on the traditional land of the Matinecock (or of the Massapequa), with whom they had ties of kinship. Dutch and English settlers declared the 1639 treaty meant no Indians would remain in western Long Island (so they could sell it to emigrants), in contrast to the exact terms of the treaty which meant the Native Americans were willing to share the [[usufruct]] of unoccupied land, with the Dutch leadership having [[eminent domain]] superior to their [[sachem]]'s eminent domain. This led to many conflicts then four years of open warfare. The Reckonhacky / Rockaway were party to a peace treaty dated May 24, 1645 following the devastation of Indian communities by Dutch soldiers.<ref>[http://www.matinecock.org/portal/desktopdefault.aspx?tabindex=2&tabid=23&item=9 Matinecock Masonic Historical Society: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206010852/http://www.matinecock.org/portal/desktopdefault.aspx?tabindex=2&tabid=23&item=9 |date=February 6, 2012 }}, accessed February 8, 2018</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U9pZQLEDiZYC&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=Reckonhacky&source=bl&ots=P1SWIPmhya&sig=UTCiTdaGxpjh5f7e8gcR0y9mj60&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjnrIT995XZAhWPrFkKHRmYDdEQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Reckonhacky&f=false Encyclopedia of Massachusetts Indians], by Donald Ricky, Somerset Publishers, Inc., January 1, 1998; page 158; accessed February 8, 2018.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SnkCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=Reckonhacky&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvvOzk_5XZAhVCq1kKHZ9GBZQ4ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&q=Reckonhacky&f=false The Munsee Indians: A History], by Robert S.
