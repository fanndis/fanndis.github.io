The '''Dangerously in Love Tour''' was the debut [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Beyoncé]]. Although the tour was intended to showcase songs from her debut solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'', (2003) the [[set list]] also contained a special segment dedicated to Beyoncé's [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]] and featured songs from her 2003 film ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]''. The stage was simple and featured a large [[LED]] screen in the back that displayed video images of Beyoncé and her dancers, as well as some images from her [[music video]]s and some prerecorded images. The tour was reviewed negatively by Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' who graded it with two stars out of five. The Dangerously in Love Tour only reached Europe and Beyoncé's performance, at the [[Wembley Arena]] in London, was filmed and later released on the [[Compact Disc|CD]]/[[DVD]] ''[[Live at Wembley (Beyoncé album)|Live at Wembley]]'' (2004).

==Background and development==
The Dangerously In Love Tour was the debut solo [[concert tour]] by American recording artist [[Beyoncé]].<ref name="PR" /> The tour was intended to showcase songs from Beyoncé's debut solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' released in 2003.<ref name="PR" /> However, the [[set list]] also contained a special segment of her show dedicated to her [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]] and songs from Beyoncé's 2003 film ''[[The Fighting Temptations]]'' ("[[Fever (Little Willie John song)#Beyoncé version|Fever]]" and "[[Summertime (Beyoncé song)|Summertime]]").<ref name="book" /><ref name="Above">{{cite AV media notes |title=Live at Wembley |others=[[Beyoncé]] |year=2004 |type=DVD|publisher=[[Columbia Records]]/[[Sony Urban Music]]}}</ref> The stage was simple and featured a large [[LED]] screen in the back that moved up and down throughout the entire show and displayed video images of Beyoncé and her dancers, as well as some images from her [[music video]]s and some prerecorded images with special effects.<ref name="book">[[Beyoncé Knowles|Knowles, Beyoncé]].

==Synopsis and reception==
Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the opening of the show during his review: "Some while after Beyoncé is due on stage, a voice announces that the support act won't be appearing and that Beyoncé will be with us 'in a moment'. Like everything else – hits, boots, hair and sponsorship deals – moments are very big in Beyoncé world. An age later, cheers erupt for the raising of a curtain which revealed, er, a roadie fiddling with a [[drum kit]]. An hour later, the piped music is getting gradually louder to drown boos and the cries of small children whose parents are moaning it's getting past their bedtime."<ref name="guardian" /> The show opens with "[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)|Baby Boy]]" which Beyoncé sang while being lowered onto the stage upside down.<ref name="guardian" /> A highlight for many fans was her performance of "[[Dangerously in Love 2]]". During the tour, a special 8-minutes rendition of the song was performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/International/Arch/SR/Beyonce/SICP-605/index.html |script-title=ja:ビヨンセ : ライヴ・アット・ウェンブリー（初回仕様限定盤） |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]] |date=July 22, 2004 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref>

Simpson of ''The Guardian'' reviewed the opening show of the tour negatively, grading it with two out of five stars.<ref name="guardian" /> He was negative about Beyoncé's clothing during the show, saying: "The delays may well be down to Beyoncé's wardrobe, which could trouble [[Imelda Marcos]]. There are skimpy skirts, tails (for a note perfect if pointless version of [[Peggy Lee]]'s '[[Fever (Little Willie John song)|Fever]]') and a general theme of low material, high glitz. But often, the main sparkle is on Beyoncé's outfit."<ref name="guardian" /> He also added that "The dancers' 'naked suits' make the former church girl a raunchy rival to [[Kylie Minogue|Kylie [Minogue]]]. But there's an interminable section where they pretend to be homies, and when Beyoncé disappears for long periods it feels like an expensive night with [[Legs & Co.|Legs and Co]]."<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/nov/04/popandrock3|title=Beyoncé, Manchester Arena|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Dave|last=Simpson|date=November 4, 2003|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> He concluded his review by saying, 
<blockquote>
"Clearly, the armies of industry professionals that put Beyoncé together aren't sure of her core audience. A vague Saturday night TV, family entertainment feel gradually gives way to a more intriguing cross between [[Liza Minnelli]] showbiz and thumping R&B. However, a ticker tape festooned '[[Crazy in Love]]' and a belting '[[Work It Out (Beyoncé song)|Work It Out]]' suggest Beyoncé is best sticking to her roots. Bizarrely, if implausibly, she puts the carnage down to her tour manager falling off stage, but at least she's grasped one showbiz adage: the show must go on."<ref name="guardian" />
