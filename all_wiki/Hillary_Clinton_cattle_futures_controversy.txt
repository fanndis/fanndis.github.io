{{Hillary Clinton series}}
In 1978 and 1979, [[lawyer]] and First Lady of Arkansas [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]] engaged in a series of trades of [[cattle]] [[futures contract]]s. Her initial $1,000 investment had generated nearly $100,000 ({{Inflation|US|100000|1979|r=2|fmt=eq}}),{{Inflation/fn|US}} when she stopped trading after ten months. In 1994, after Clinton had become [[First Lady of the United States]], the trading became the subject of considerable controversy regarding the likelihood of such a spectacular rate of return, possible [[conflict of interest]], and allegations of disguised [[bribery]].<ref name="wsj102600">[[Claudia Rosett]], [http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/cRosett/?id=65000476 "Hillary's Bull Market"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', October 26, 2000.

==Media scrutiny==

The profits made during the cattle trading first came to public light in a March 18, 1994 report by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which had been reviewing the Clintons' financial records for two months.<ref name="nyt031894">[[Jeff Gerth]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/us/top-arkansas-lawyer-helped-hillary-clinton-turn-big-profit.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm " Top Arkansas Lawyer Helped Hillary Clinton Turn Big Profit"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 18, 1994. On March 28, 1994, Securities Week, a McGraw-Hill Companies publication, published an article outlining the repeated regulatory violations committed by her broker, Red Bone, which resulted in greater scrutiny and questions not only about how much money she had made in the markets, but how she had made it. Accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> It coincided with the beginning of congressional hearings over the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] controversy.<ref name="nyt032094">[[Bob Herbert]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DC143CF933A15750C0A962958260 "The Circus That Is Whitewater"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 20, 1994. Accessed April 6, 2008.</ref> Clinton initially told aides that she had made the futures gains by studying the financial news and placing trades herself, but later acknowledged the help of Blair. Media pressure continued to build, and on April 22, 1994, she gave an unusual [[press conference]] under a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[State Dining Room]] of the White House, to address questions on both matters; it was broadcast live by [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[CNN]].<ref name="nyt042394">[[Gwen Ifill]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E1DB1131F930A15757C0A962958260 "Hillary Clinton Takes Questions on Whitewater"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 23, 1994.

[Blair] and the people he was talking with knew what they were doing."<ref name="gerth-vannatta-book"/>

==Likelihood of results==
Various publications sought to analyze the likelihood of Clinton's successful results. Clinton made her money by betting mostly on a market downturn at a time when cattle prices actually doubled.<ref name="devil">{{cite book |first1=Edward |last1=Chancellor |title=Devil Take The Hindmost: A History Of Financial Speculation |url=https://archive.org/details/deviltakehindmos00chan |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Farrar Straus & Giroux]] |year=1999 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/deviltakehindmos00chan/page/251 251–252]}}</ref> The editor of the ''[[Journal of Futures Markets]]'' said in April 1994, "This is like buying ice skates one day and entering the Olympics a day later.

==Merc and Melamed investigations==
[[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] records indicated that $40,000 of her profits came from larger trades initiated by James Blair. According to exchange records, "Red" Bone, the [[commodity broker|commodities broker]] that facilitated the trades on behalf of Refco, reportedly because Blair was a good client, allowed Clinton to maintain her positions even though she did not have enough money in her account to cover her activity. For example, she was allowed to order 10 cattle futures contracts, normally a $12,000 investment, in her first commodity trade in 1978 although she had only $1,000 in her account at the time.<ref name="wapo-c">Charles R. Babcock, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/whitewater/stories/wwtr940527.htm "Hillary Clinton Futures Trades Detailed"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', May 27, 1994. Accessed July 14, 2007.</ref> Bone denied any wrongdoing in conjunction with Clinton's trading and said he did not recall ever dealing with Clinton personally.<ref name="nw-mhrtec"/><ref name="usa-mj"/>

As it happened, during the period of Clinton's trading, Refco was under investigation by the Mercantile Exchange for systematic violations of its [[margin (finance)|margin]] trading rules and reporting requirements regarding cattle trading.<ref name="nw-mhrtec"/><ref name="usa-mj"/> In December 1979, the exchange issued a three-year suspension to Bone and a $250,000 fine of Refco (at the time, the largest such penalty imposed by the exchange).<ref name="nw-mhrtec"/><ref name="usa-mj"/>

After the Clinton trading matter became public, [[Leo Melamed]], a former chairman of the Mercantile Exchange, was brought in by request of the White House to review the trading records. On April 11, 1994, he said that the whole matter was "a tempest in a teapot" and that while her brokers had not required her to provide typical margin cushions, she had not knowingly benefited.<ref name="nyt041294">[[Gwen Ifill]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DD133EF931A25757C0A962958260 " Hillary Clinton Didn't Report $6,498 Profit In Commodities Account, White House Says"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 12, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007.</ref> On May 26, 1994, after the new records concerning the larger Blair trades came to light, he said "I have no reason to change my original assessment. Mrs. Clinton violated no rules in the course of her transactions."<ref name="wapo-c"/> But as to the question of whether she had been allocated profits from larger block trades, he said of the new accounting, "It doesn't suggest that there was allocation, and it doesn't prove there wasn't,"<ref name="nyt052794">Stephen Engelberg, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E2D8173BF934A15756C0A962958260 "New Records Outline Favor for Hillary Clinton on Trades"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 1994.

==Clinton responses==
Hillary Clinton's defenders, including [[White House Counsel]] [[Lloyd Cutler]], maintained throughout that she had made her own decisions, that her own money was constantly at risk, and that she made both winning and losing trades throughout the ten months.<ref name="nyt060394">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E0D71E3BF930A35755C0A962958260 " No One Bribed Anyone in Clinton Trading"], [[Lloyd Cutler]] (letter to the editor), ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 3, 1994. Accessed July 15, 2007.</ref> Regarding suggestions that Blair had favored Clinton so that [[Tyson Foods]] could gain influence with Governor Clinton, they pointed out that CEO [[Don Tyson]], who had in 1978 endorsed Clinton, in 1980 endorsed [[Frank D. White]], Clinton's opponent in his reelection bid. Tyson denied any knowledge of Blair's trading partnership with Clinton. The ''New York Times'' noted, however, that notwithstanding Hillary Clinton's "artful explanation", the commodities trading had ended over a year before the 1980 election and that Tyson had switched sides after Bill Clinton did not lobby the state legislature to increase the weight limit on trucks, although Tyson believed that he had received such a promise from him at the time of the 1978 election.<ref name="nyt042394"/><ref name="nyt060394"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Michael|title=The President's Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/31/magazine/the-president-s-past.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=September 30, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 31, 1994}}</ref>

Clinton's defenders also stressed that Blair and others stayed in the market longer than Clinton and lost much of what they had previously earned, showing that the risk was real.<ref name="lh"/> Indeed, some reports had Blair losing $15 million<ref name="morris">[[Roger Morris (American writer)|Roger Morris]], ''Partners in Power: The Clintons and Their America''.
