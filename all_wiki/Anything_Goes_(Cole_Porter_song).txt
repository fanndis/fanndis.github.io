===Background and composition===
[[Tony Bennett]] and [[Lady Gaga]] first collaborated when they sang "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]" for Bennett's [[Grammy Award]]-winning album, ''[[Duets II (Tony Bennett album)|Duets II]]'', then on the album ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' (2014).<ref name="press"/> The recording took place over a year in New York City. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones, and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. With Marion Evans, jazz trumpeter [[Brian Newman]], a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album. Tenor saxophonist [[Joe Lovano]] and flautist [[Paul Horn (musician)|Paul Horn]] performed. The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the [[Great American Songbook]], including "Anything Goes".<ref name="press">{{cite press release|url=http://www.universalmusic.ca/press-releases/tony-bennett-lady-gaga-cheek-to-cheek-album-of-classic-jazz-standards-to-be-released-september-23/|title=Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga: ''Cheek to Cheek'' Album of Classic Jazz Standards To Be Released September 23|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2014|publisher=[[Universal Music Canada]]|location=Toronto}}</ref>

Bennett sang "Anything Goes" on his album ''[[Strike Up the Band (Tony Bennett and Count Basie album)|Strike Up the Band]]'' (1959), which Gaga heard when she was 13 years old.
