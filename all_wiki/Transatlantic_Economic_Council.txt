The '''Transatlantic Economic Council''' ('''TEC''') is a body set up between the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] to direct economic cooperation between the two economies. 

==Establishment and chairmanship==
It was established by an agreement signed on 30 April 2007 at the [[White House]] by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], [[President of the European Council]] [[Angela Merkel]] (also [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|German Chancellor]]) and [[President of the European Commission|EU Commission President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]].

The Council is co-chaired by an EU and a U.S. official. Currently, they are: [[Caroline Atkinson]], Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs; and [[Cecilia Malmström]], [[European Commissioner for Trade]]. It meets at least once a year, called by the chairs.

==Work==
The Council is tasked with helping to meet economic partnership objectives and harmonize [[regulation]]s. Other priorities include: [[Road-traffic safety|road safety]], and petrol conservation, [[Testing cosmetics on animals|cosmetics testing]] (finding alternatives to [[animal testing]]), technologies, and more cooperation. However the Council has been criticised as getting bogged down in minor details and failing to produce results.<ref>[http://www.ecipe.org/blog/a-transatlantic-free-trade-area A Transatlantic Free Trade Area?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116094133/http://www.ecipe.org/blog/a-transatlantic-free-trade-area |date=2010-01-16 }} ECIPE</ref>
