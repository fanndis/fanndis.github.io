'''Liveringa''' or '''Liveringa Station''', often referred to as '''Upper Liveringa Station''', is a pastoral lease in [[Western Australia]] that once operated as a [[sheep station]] but presently operates as a [[cattle station]].

==Description==
Situated about {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} south east of the [[Looma Community]] and about {{convert|100|km|mi|0}} south east of [[Derby, Western Australia|Derby]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region, the property has a {{convert|100|km|mi|0|adj=on}} frontage on the [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]], which forms its southern boundary.

Comprising an area of {{convert|2650|km2|sqmi|0}}, it has a carrying capacity of over 22,000 head of cattle. The livestock manager since 2010 has been Peter "Jed" O'Brien, but the property also grows fodder for livestock using three centre-pivot irrigators and is experimenting with tropical grain crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centralstation.net.au/liveringa-station/|title=Liveringa Station|year=2013|accessdate=17 November 2013|publisher=Central Station|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112143037/http://centralstation.net.au/liveringa-station/|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The station contains large areas of river flats that are quite fertile and grow a variety of herbage suitable for fodder, including [[Mitchell grass]], [[Iseilema|Flinders grass]], rice grass, ribbon grass and bundle bundle. The growth is so prolific that the areas have been cut and baled as a reserve for the dry season.<ref name=R2/>

The [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]] group consists of the main house, workers' kitchen and dining Room, meat house, shearers' quarters, workshop and the garden. The main house has stone walls with cement mortar and corrugated iron roofing. The surrounding verandah has steel supports and unlined timber purloins. It was built in the 1880s and 1890s and was classified by the [[National Trust]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://traces.duit.uwa.edu.au/list_property?id=258|title=Liveringa Homestead Group|accessdate=16 September 2015|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105202/http://traces.duit.uwa.edu.au/list_property?id=258|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The Kimberley Pastoral Company was formed in 1881 and won the lottery to acquire the leasehold for the area of land. The syndicate consisted of [[William Marmion]], [[M. C. Davies]], brothers George and [[William Silas Pearse]], and [[Robert Frederick Sholl]], with brothers William and [[John McLarty]] as minor shareholders.<ref name=R4>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.wa.gov.au/register/PDF_Files/K-L%20-%20A-D/Liveringa%20Hstd%20Group%20%28P-AD%29.pdf |title=Register of Heritage places – Assessment Documentation |date=11 December 1998 |accessdate=18 November 2013 |publisher=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]] |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/34313/20060325-0000/www.heritage.wa.gov.au/register/PDF_Files/K-L%20-%20A-D/Liveringa%20Hstd%20Group%20(P-AD).pdf |archivedate=25 March 2006 }}</ref> The vessel ''Amur'' was chartered to take A. Cornish and the McLarty brothers along with sheep, horses, cattle and provisions from [[Fremantle]] to [[King Sound]]. Upon landing, the stock were driven to [[Yeeda Station|Yeeda Creek]] for fresh water before continuing inland to set up camp at Liveringa.<ref name=R2/> The first [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]], [[shearing shed]], [[woolshed]] and storeroom were constructed between 1886 and 1888.<ref name=R1>{{cite web|url=http://www.kimberleysociety.org/oldfiles/1996/LIVERINGA%20Apr.pdf|title=Liveringa's heritage – A window into the past|year=1996|accessdate=17 November 2013|publisher=Kimberley Society}}</ref> The homestead and outbuildings were constructed under the supervision of John McLarty the inaugural manager of the property. The buildings were situated on a knoll with a view over a [[billabong]] and the Fitzroy River. The original homestead was made of bush timbers and corrugated iron and was demolished in 1908 by the third manager of Liveringa, Percy Rose, who was building a new one. The new homestead was constructed of local [[sandstone]].<ref name=R1/>

In 1911 the station was carrying a flock of 98,000 sheep and yielded a clip of 1419 [[wool bale|bales of wool]].<ref name=R2/>

The property and surrounding areas were severely flooded in 1914, and again in 1938 resulting in the death of a former jockey, William Skinner, who drowned in the flooded Nerrima River.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17445939 |title=Former jockey drowned |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=4 March 1938 |accessdate=17 November 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Kim Rose was appointed manager at Liveringa in 1930; Rose was a director of the Kimberley Pastoral company that owned the property. Later the same year a freak deluge of rain left {{convert|210000|acre|km2|0}} of land underwater and drowned 30,000 sheep.<ref name=R2>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39097601 |title=Large-scale fodder conservation, kangaroos,and crocodiles were among the highlights of a recent visit to A West Kimberley Sheep Station. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=27 October 1949 |accessdate=17 November 2013 |page=4 Supplement: Countryman's Magazine |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In 1949 the property occupied {{convert|700000|acre|km2|0}}<ref name=R2/> and the station recorded over {{convert|14|in|mm|0}} of rain in a week, resulting in more stock losses. It had {{convert|800|mi|km|0}} of fencing dividing the property into 60 paddocks. For the previous few years an average of 57,000 sheep had been shorn each year.<ref name=R2/>

The area was struck by [[drought]] between 1951 and 1953 with the number of cattle being reduced by half. This was the first drought suffered by pastoralists in 70 years, with many hurriedly sinking bores and buying feed to keep their stock alive. Other nearby properties that were affected were [[Noonkanbah]], [[Cherrabun]], Quandan, [[Gogo Station|Gogo]], [[Glenroy Station|Glenroy]], [[Fossil Downs Station|Fossil Downs]], Luilugui, Christmas Creek and Bohemia Downs Station.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49227202 |title=Drought Inflicts Big Cattle Loss In Kimberley. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=17 August 1953 |accessdate=15 November 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The Australian Land and Cattle Company was incorporated in 1969 in Western Australia by Jack Miller Fletcher and Corey Crutcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/pdf/mn/mn2501_3000/mn2816.pdf|title=Australian Land and Cattle company|year=2011|accessdate=18 November 2013|publisher=[[State Library of Western Australia]]}}</ref> At its height, the company owned seven prime Kimberley stations covering nearly {{convert|20000|km2|sqmi|0}} and carrying 100,000 head of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/site-archive/rural/content/2009/s2715428.htm|title=Why the Kimberley can't remain a park: An interview with Jack Fletcher|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=18 November 2013|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> Among the properties acquired were Camballin and Liveringa stations.

In 1973, a {{convert|6000|ha|acre|0}} portion of the property to the west of the homestead was excised and reserved for the [[Looma Community]].<ref name=R4/>

In 2002 the property commenced the process of gradually changing the genetic base of the herd by introducing a crossbreeding program to produce red lines suitable for live export or sale into southern markets. Red [[Australian Brangus|brangus]] bulls were introduced over the [[Brahman (cattle)|brahman]]-based herd at another property, Nerrima, and the heifers produced taken to Liveringa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmweekly.com.au/news/agriculture/livestock/cattle-beef/a-diverse-approach/2597660.aspx?storypage=2|title=A diverse approach|author=Clare King|date=25 June 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|work=Farm Weekly|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}</ref>

[[Gina Rinehart]] acquired a 50% stake in both Liveringa and neighbouring Nerrima Station in 2014. Rinehart teamed up with agribusiness group Milne Agrigroup who already owned the properties. Liveringa was stocked with approximately 22,000 head of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-02/rinehart-secures-stake-in-major-cattle-investment/5566694|title=Gina Rinehart invests in Kimberley cattle stations|author=Olivia Garnett and Tyne McConnan|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> The half share was acquired for {{AUD}}40 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-02/gina-rinehart-buys-kimberley-cattle-liveringa-station-beef/5567098|title=Gina Rinehart pays $40m for half share in two massive Kimberley cattle stations|date=2 July 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>
