"'''Formation'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her sixth studio album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' (2016). It was written by [[Rae Sremmurd]], Beyoncé, Asheton Hogan, and [[Mike Will Made It]] and produced by the latter three. It served as the album's [[lead single]], released on February 6, 2016 through [[Parkwood Entertainment]] to critical acclaim. In order to promote the song, Beyoncé performed it during her guest appearance at the [[Super Bowl 50 halftime show]] the day after its premiere.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]], premiered on the same day as the song itself through Beyoncé's official [[YouTube]] account. Critics praised its depiction of African-Americans, one which they noted was not frequently seen in mainstream media.

The song was placed at number one on several critics' year-end lists, and in 2019 was named the greatest song of the decade (2010s) by several publications. "Formation" was also [[Google]]'s most searched song of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7624371/beyonce-tops-google-year-end-list-of-artist-song-searches|title=Beyonce Tops Google's Year-End List of Top Searches}}</ref> "Formation" won all six of its nominations at the [[2016 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], and was nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]], of which it won the latter award.<!--"Most awarded song" claim, as it isn't citing a reliable source, will be deleted if added-->

==Composition and lyrical interpretation==

"Formation" contains strong political criticism in its lyrics, being described by ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'''s Mikael Wood as "a statement of radical [[black people|black]] positivity." It also was noted by Joseph Lamour who commented during a review for [[MTV]] that "Formation" is "a song whose lyrics are teeming with notions of empowerment and pride in her heritage as a [[black American]] with roots in [[Alabama]] and [[Louisiana]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2736753/beyonce-formation-single/|title= Beyonce Just Released A New Song And Video -- This Is Not A Drill|publisher= MTV|date= February 6, 2016|access-date= April 3, 2017}}</ref> The song opens with rumbling [[Siren (alarm)|siren]]s, in the opening lines, "Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess," the song addresses rumors about the singer's connection to [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|popular conspiracy theories]] about the [[Illuminati]].<ref name="tnyt"/> This [[synth]] effect appears as Beyoncé repeats the first verse "My daddy Alabama/ Momma Louisiana", [[NPR]]'s Mandalit del Barco noted during the verse, Beyoncé represents her family roots, she said, "Her mother is from Louisiana, as she let us know in the song. This has always been a big part of her identity; it's not one that the mainstream focus is on. People talk about her not centering it." She also described the lines as an "unapologetic blackness."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/08/466036710/beyonces-formation-is-a-visual-anthem|title=Beyonce's 'Formation' Is A Visual Anthem|publisher= NPR|date= February 8, 2016|access-date= April 3, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} Alex Macpherson wrote the song "musically transpires '[[7/11 (song)|7/11]]'".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macpherson|first1=Alex|title=Beyoncé's Formation review – a rallying cry that couldn't be more timely|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-review-super-bowl-rallying-cry-black-consciousness|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 10, 2016|date=February 8, 2016}}</ref> The song is written in the key of [[F minor]] in [[Time signature|common time]] with a [[tempo]] of 123 beats per minute.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Key and BPM of Beyoncé - Formation {{!}} AudioKeychain|url = https://www.audiokeychain.com/track/Fqni/beyonce-formation|website = AudioKeychain|access-date = 2016-02-17}}</ref> Beyoncé's vocals span from D<sub>3</sub> to A{{Flat}}<sub>4</sub> in the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0164140|title=Beyoncé "Formation" Sheet Music in F Minor (transposable) - Download & Print|last=Knowles|first=Beyoncé|website=Musicnotes.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref>  It has a minimalistic beats which transforms into a marching band stomp during the last lines of the chorus.<ref name="tnyt" />

==Critical response==
''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' named the song "Best New Track", with Britt Julious comparing it to "[[Flawless (Beyoncé song)|Flawless]]" and writing that "for Beyoncé (and for her listeners, too), the unapologetic embracing of one's blackness and the power one can harness when making a name, livelihood, and legacy can't ever be ignored or taken for granted."<ref name="pitch">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17969-beyonce-formation/|title="Formation" by Beyoncé - Tracks - Pitchfork}}</ref> Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley, a professor of African Studies at [[University of Texas at Austin]], writes for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that the song, which many called "political" because of its references, "differs radically from other post-Ferguson protests songs like [[Trip Lee]]'s "Coulda Been Me" or [[Rihanna]]'s "[[American Oxygen]]" video, which focuses on black men's deaths," calling African American women to stand side by side ("in formation").<ref>{{Cite web|title = Beyonce's 'Formation' Is Activism for African Americans, Women and LGBTQ People|url = http://time.com/4211888/beyonce-formation-activism/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2016-02-09|first = Omise'eke Natasha|last = Tinsley|first2 = Caitlin|last2 = O'Neill}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' calls the song "a fiery black power anthem and call to arms".<ref name="fiery" /> A ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist wrote that "in the era of #[[Black Lives Matter|BlackLivesMatter]], 'Formation' felt downright necessary" and further deemed it "a powerful statement of black Southern resilience".<ref name="rs1">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/our-favorite-songs-and-videos-right-now-beyonce-kanye-west-and-more-20160302/beyonce-formation-20160302|title=Our Favorite Songs and Videos Right Now: Beyonce, Kanye West and More|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=May 14, 2016}}</ref> "Formation" was later placed at number one on the same magazine's "50 Best Songs of 2016" list by Rob Sheffield, with him commenting: ""Formation" was a song that kept hope alive in a bleak year – and it will be essential ammo for the struggles to come in the next."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-songs-of-2016-w452313/beyonc-formation-w452794|title=50 Best Songs of 2016|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> Melissa Harris-perry of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' wrote that, with ''Lemonade'', “Beyoncé publicly embraced explicitly feminist blackness at a politically risky moment”.

As Matsoukas develops an idea for a video, she spends hours browsing online and through art books and magazines, looking for images that resonate. She said: "I treat each video like a thesis project. Stacks of old sources are piled behind her couch: books by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[C. L. R. James]]; back issues of ''Wallpaper''; math and science textbooks from college". For the "Formation" video, she found ideas in the work of [[Toni Morrison]], [[Maya Angelou]], and [[Octavia Butler]]. Matsoukas began to conceive scenes of black history, from slavery through Mardi Gras parades and the Rodney King protests, explaining: "I wanted to show — this is black people. We triumph, we suffer, we're drowning, we're being beaten, we're dancing, we're eating, and we’re still here". She wrote out a treatment and sent it to Beyoncé in the middle of the night.

===Reception and controversy===
Syreeta McFadden for ''[[The Guardian]]'' notes that the video depicts archetypal southern black women "in ways that we haven't seen frequently represented in popular art or culture".<ref name="guard">{{Cite news|title = Beyoncé's Formation reclaims black America's narrative from the margins|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/beyonce-formation-black-american-narrative-the-margins|newspaper=The Guardian|date = February 8, 2016|access-date = February 9, 2016|first=Sureeta|last=McFadden|language = en-GB}}</ref> Following its online release, filmmakers Abteen Bagheri and Chris Black used their [[Twitter]] accounts to clarify that "Formation" used footage from ''That B.E.A.T.,'' their 2013 documentary about [[Hurricane Katrina|the Katrina disaster]] of New Orleans [[bounce music|bounce]].<ref name="fiery">{{cite web|title = Beyonce's 'Formation': A Fiery Black Power Anthem and Call to Arms|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/06/beyonce-s-formation-a-fiery-black-power-anthem-and-call-to-arms.html|website = The Daily Beast|date =February 6, 2016|access-date = February 9, 2016|first = Kevin|last = Fallon}}</ref> Bagheri said he was asked for approval to use the footage, but the request was denied.<ref name="tnyt"/> In a series of tweets, Black and Bagheri claimed they did not give permission to Beyoncé or the music video's director Melina Matsoukas for using their documentary footage. In a statement to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', a representative of the singer said: "The documentary footage was used with permission and licensed from the owner of the footage. They were given proper compensation. The footage was provided to us by the filmmaker's production company. The filmmaker is listed in the credits for additional photography direction."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/06/beyonce-formation-music-video-that-beat | title=Beyoncé used New Orleans documentary footage 'with permission' in new 'Formation' video: rep | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=February 7, 2016 | accessdate=February 7, 2016}}</ref> Soon after, Bagheri issued a statement to ''The Washington Post'': "Anyone who works in the industry knows that putting out a work is a miracle. There needs to be a unity amongst directors. We need to preserve the sanctity of the craft and champion individual voices. Our work isn't just [[b-roll]] for someone else. It just shouldn't be considered, whether or not it's legal.

In 2019, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named ''Formation'' the best music video of the 2010s, stating that the music video "served as an active reminder that black people could not be silenced".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8544596/best-music-videos-2010s-top-100/|title=The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 2010s: Staff Picks|website=Billboard|date=November 26, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>

==Impact==
The mention of the American restaurant chain [[Red Lobster]] in the song's bridge increased sales at the restaurants by 33%, and upon the song's release, the chain was tweeted about over 42,000 times during the first hour and trended for the first time in its history according to Red Lobster spokesperson Erica Ettori.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/09/investing/red-lobster-beyonce-formation/index.html|title=Red Lobster: Sales spike 33% after Beyoncé endorsement|first=Charles|last=Riley}}</ref>

Quite simply, she is one of those stars of color who -- until now -- has been beyond race for the mainstream audience. That was the basis of a recent "Saturday Night Live" skit that portrayed white fans freaking out about her "blackness," as conveyed by her new "Formation" music video and a Super Bowl halftime performance in which her backup dancers dressed in Black Panther-esque outfits. The halftime show has prompted a number of discussions both pro- and anti-Beyoncé."<ref name="cnn">{{cite web|author=France Respers, Lisa|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/23/entertainment/beyonce-controversy-feat/|title=Why the Beyoncé controversy is bigger than you think|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 23, 2016|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref>
