'''''Stereogum''''' is a daily [[Internet]] publication that focuses on music news, reviews, interviews, and irreverent commentary. The site was created in January 2002 by Scott Lapatine.

''Stereogum'' was one of the first [[MP3 blog]]s and has received several awards and citations, including the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards|PLUG Award]] for Music Blog of the Year, ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s Powergeek 25, and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Best Music Websites. The site was named an Official Honoree of the [[Webby Awards]] in the music category and won the OMMA Award for Web Site Excellence in the Entertainment/Music category. In 2011, ''Stereogum'' won ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s Music Blog of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stabile |first1=Francesca |title=The Winners Of The 2011 Village Voice Web Awards |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/12/07/the-winners-of-the-2011-village-voice-web-awards/ |website=[[The Village Voice]] |accessdate=4 April 2019 |date=December 7, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
The site was named after a lyric from the song "Radio #1" by the French electronic duo [[Air (French band)|Air]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1823047/qa-airs-jean-benoit-dunckel-on-the-future-of-the-band-working-with-sofia-coppola-and-inspiring-the-name-stereogum/franchises/interview/|title=Q&A: Air’s Jean-Benoît Dunckel On The Future Of The Band, Working With Sofia Coppola, And Inspiring The Name "Stereogum"|website=Stereogum|date=14 August 2015|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref>

In late 2006, ''Stereogum'' received an influx of capital through [[Robert Pittman (media executive)|Bob Pittman]]'s private investment entity The Pilot Group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lauria |first1=Peter |title=Pittman Flips Stake |url=https://nypost.com/2007/12/07/pittman-flips-stake/ |website=New York Post |publisher=New York Post |accessdate=5 May 2020}}</ref> In November 2007, it was purchased by [[SpinMedia]] (formerly known as Buzz Media). April 2008 saw the launch of ''[[Videogum]]'', a sister site focused on television, movies, and Web videos. ''Videogum'' later closed.

In December 2016, [[Eldridge Industries]] acquired SpinMedia via the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="adweek-spinbuy">{{cite web|title=Billboard Buys Spin and Vibe in a Quest to ‘Own the Topic of Music Online’|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/billboard-buys-spin-and-vibe-quest-own-topic-music-online-175229/|website=Adweek|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref>

''Stereogum''{{'}}s first [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] event in 2006 was hosted by then-emerging comedian [[Aziz Ansari]] and featured a headline performance from [[Ted Leo]]. In the years since, Stereogum's events have included sets from [[Ben Gibbard]] <ref>{{cite web |last1=Duffy |first1=Robert |title=SXSW Updates Stereogum Brings Ben Gibbard |url=http://www.donewaiting.com/2010/02/24/sxsw-updates-stereogum-brings-ben-gibbard-pure-volume-house-music-for-listeners-more-and-more/ |website=Done Waiting |publisher=Done Waiting}}</ref>, [[Sky Ferreira]], [[Mitski]], [[Beach House]], [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], [[Deerhunter]], [[Japanese Breakfast]], [[Rico Nasty]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Superlatives from SXSW Music |url=https://www.austinmonthly.com/superlatives-from-sxsw-music/ |website=Austin Monthly |publisher=Austin Monthly |accessdate=5 May 2020}}</ref> and other popular acts.

''Stereogum'' was the first major publication to write about future superstar acts like [[Arcade Fire]], [[Vampire Weekend]], and [[Billie Eilish]].

Popular musicians have been known to participate in ''Stereogum''{{'}}s active comments section, such as [[Father John Misty]], [[Weezer]]'s [[Rivers Cuomo]], and [[Fleet Foxes]]' [[Robin Pecknold]].

In July 2017, Arcade Fire created the parody site Stereoyum featuring a "Premature Premature Evaluation" of their forthcoming album ''[[Everything Now]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/arcade-fire-spoof-music-website-premature-premature-evaluation-review-album-2114007|title=Arcade Fire spoof music website with ‘Premature Premature Evaluation’ review of own album|publisher=NME|date=July 22, 2016|accessdate=May 9, 2018}}</ref>

On January 16, 2019 it was announced that Scott Lapatine, the site’s founder and editor-and-chief, had reached an agreement to purchase Stereogum from the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group, making it once again an independent publication. <ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8548204/billboard-hollywood-reporter-media-group-spin-stereogum-sale|title= Billboard-The Hollywood Reporter Media Group Sells Spin, Agreement in Place for Sale of Stereogum|publisher=Billboard|date=January 16, 2019|accessdate=January 16, 2019}}</ref>
