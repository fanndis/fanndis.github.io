{{short description|Concept developed by Joseph Nye}}
{{Politics}}
In [[politics]] (and particularly in [[international politics]]), '''soft power''' is the ability to attract and [[co-option|co-opt]], rather than [[coerce]] (contrast [[hard power]]). In other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction. A defining feature of soft power is that it is non-coercive; the currency of soft power includes [[culture]], political [[Value (ethics)|value]]s, and [[foreign policies]]. In 2012 [[Joseph Nye]] of [[Harvard University]] explained that with soft power, "the best [[propaganda]] is not propaganda", further explaining that during the [[Information Age]], "credibility is the scarcest resource".<ref name=WSJmay2012>{{cite news |last1= Nye |first1= Joseph |title= China's Soft Power Deficit To catch up, its politics must unleash the many talents of its civil society |url= https://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304451104577389923098678842 |accessdate= 6 December 2014 |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= 8 May 2012}}</ref>

Nye popularised the term in his 1990 book, ''Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power''.<ref>

Analysts and statesmen brought the term into wide use in international affairs. For example, [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] (in office 2006-2011) spoke in 2007 of the need to enhance American soft power by "a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of [[national security]] – [[diplomacy]], [[strategic communications]], foreign assistance, civic action and [[economic reconstruction]] and development".<ref>{{cite speech |author= Robert M.

The Soft Power 30, an annual index published by [[Portland Communications]] and the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] for 2018, ranked the [[United Kingdom]] as the leading sovereign state in soft power. Other leading countries in soft power include [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[Japan]], [[Canada]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Australia]] and [[Denmark]].<ref>{{cite web|last= McClory|first= Jonathan|title= ''The Soft Power 30: A Global Ranking of Soft Power, 2018''|url= https://softpower30.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-Soft-Power-30-Report-2018.pdf|date= 12 July 2018|publisher= Portland|accessdate= 18 April 2019}}</ref> The 2016/17 [[Monocle (UK magazine)|''Monocle'']] Soft Power Survey ranked the United States as the leading country in soft power.

== Description ==
[[File:Soft Power (2004) by Joseph Nye.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph Nye's 2004 book describing the concept of "soft power"]]

[[Joseph Nye]] introduced the concept of "soft power" in the late 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 978-1586482251|title = Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics|last1 = Joseph s. Nye|first1 = Jr|date = 2004-03-16}}</ref> For Nye, power is the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want. There are several ways one can achieve this: you can coerce them with threats; you can induce them with payments; or you can attract and co-opt them to want what you want. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them.<ref name="Nye, Joseph 1990"/>

It can be contrasted with '[[hard power]]', which is the use of coercion and payment. Soft power can be wielded not just by states but also by all actors in international politics, such as [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or international institutions.<ref>Joseph Nye, ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics''</ref> It is also considered the "second face of power" that indirectly allows you to obtain the outcomes you want. A country's soft power, according to Nye, rests on three resources: "its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when others see them as legitimate and having moral authority)."<ref>{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH08y1Bi1Y0C}}</ref>

{{quote|"A country may obtain the outcomes it wants in world politics because other countries – admiring its values, emulating its example, aspiring to its level of prosperity and openness – want to follow it. In this sense, it is also important to set the agenda and attract others in world politics, and not only to force them to change by threatening military force or economic sanctions. This soft power – getting others to want the outcomes that you want – co-opts people rather than coerces them."<ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004">Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).</ref>
}}

Soft power resources are the assets that produce attraction which often leads to acquiescence.<ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004"/> Nye asserts that, "Seduction is always more effective than coercion, and many values like democracy, human rights, and individual opportunities are deeply seductive."<ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X">Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004) p. x.</ref> [[Angelo Codevilla]] observed that an often overlooked essential aspect of soft power is that different parts of populations are attracted or repelled by different things, ideas, images, or prospects.<ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008">Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008).</ref> Soft power is hampered when policies, culture, or values repel others instead of attracting them.

In his book, Nye argues that soft power is a more difficult instrument for governments to wield than hard power for two reasons: many of its critical resources are outside the control of governments, and soft power tends to "work indirectly by shaping the environment for policy, and sometimes takes years to produce the desired outcomes."<ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X"/><ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71">Lord, Carnes, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power,"in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008.) pp. 59–71.</ref> The book identifies three broad categories of soft power: "culture", "political values", and "policies."

In ''The Future of Power'' (2011), Nye reiterates that soft power is a descriptive, rather than a normative, concept.<ref name="The Future of Power 81">{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}</ref> Therefore, soft power can be wielded for nefarious purposes. "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Josef Stalin|Stalin]], and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] all possessed a great deal of soft power in the eyes of their acolytes, but that did not make it good. It is not necessarily better to twist minds than to twist arms."<ref name="The Future of Power 81" /> Nye also claims that soft power does not contradict the international relations theory of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]]. "Soft power is not a form of idealism or liberalism. It is simply a form of power, one way of getting desired outcomes."<ref name="The Future of Power 82">{{cite book|last=Nye|first=Joseph S.|title=The Future of Power|year=2011|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9781586488925|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jThyCT8d3mYC}}</ref>

== Limitations of the concept ==
{{+rs|date=March 2016}}
Soft power has been criticized as being ineffective by authors such as [[Niall Ferguson]] in the preface to ''Colossus''. [[Neorealism (international relations)|Neorealist]] and other rationalist and neorationalist authors (with the exception of [[Stephen Walt]]) dismiss soft power out of hand as they assert that actors in international relations respond to only two types of incentives: economic incentives and force.

As a concept, it can be difficult to distinguish between soft power from hard power. For example, Janice Bially Mattern argues that [[George W. Bush]]'s use of the phrase "you are either with us or with the terrorists" was in fact an exercise of hard power. Though military and economic force was not used to pressure other states to join its coalition, a kind of force – representational force – was used. This kind of force threatens the identity of its partners, forcing them to comply or risk being labeled as evil. This being the case, soft power is therefore not so soft.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/03058298050330031601|title = Why 'Soft Power' Isn't So Soft: Representational Force and the Sociolinguistic Construction of Attraction in World Politics|year = 2005|last1 = Mattern|first1 = Janice Bially|journal = Millennium: Journal of International Studies|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 583–612|s2cid = 144848371|url=https://www.academia.edu/1141856}} Page 586.</ref>

In cultural studies, the concept, soft power is often used for culture. However, Parc and Moon argue that soft power cannot replace culture; it is only a subset of "accumulable culture", which is an opposite concept of "accumulated culture".<ref name=ParcMoon2019>{{Cite journal | doi=10.13185/KK2019.03206 | title=Accumulated and Accumulable Cultures: The Case of Public and Private Initiatives toward K-Pop| year=2019| last1=Parc| first1=Jimmyn| last2=Moon| first2=Hwy-Chang| journal=Kritika Kultura| issue=32|pages= 429–452 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

There are also recent articles about the concept's neglect of its defensive use. Since Nye's approach "mainly focuses on how to get others to do your biding", some researchers argued that rising powers, such as China, are creating new approaches to soft power, thus using it defensively.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/pafo.12153|title = China's Charm Defensive: Image Protection by Acquiring Mass Entertainment|year = 2020|last1 = Eliküçük Yıldırım|first1 = Nilgün|last2 = Aslan|first2 = Mesut|journal = Pacific Focus|volume = 35|issue=1|pages = 141–171|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Additionally, others have argued that more attention needs to be paid towards locating and understanding how actors' attempts at soft power can backfire, leading to reputational damage or loss, or what has been termed 'soft disempowerment'.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/ia/iiy125| title=The soft power–soft disempowerment nexus: The case of Qatar| year=2018| last1=Brannagan| first1=Paul Michael| last2=Giulianotti| first2=Richard| journal=International Affairs| volume=94| issue=5| pages=1139–1157|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Measurement ==
The first attempt to measure soft power through a composite index was created and published by the [[Institute for Government]] and the media company ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=McClory|title=The new persuaders: an international ranking of soft power|date=2010-12-07|publisher=Institute for Government|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|work=Institute for Government website|page=13|accessdate=2011-05-06|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053803/http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications_download.php?id=20|archive-date=2011-07-24}}</ref> The IfG-Monocle Soft Power Index combined a range of statistical metrics and subjective panel scores to measure the soft power resources of 26 countries. The metrics were organized according to a framework of five sub-indices including culture, diplomacy, education, business/innovation, and government. The index is said to measure the soft power resources of countries, and does not translate directly into ability influence. ''Monocle'' has published an annual ''Soft Power Survey'' since then. As of 2016/17, the list is calculated using around 50 factors that indicate the use of soft power, including the number of cultural missions (primarily language schools), [[Olympic medals]], the quality of a country's [[architecture]] and business brands.<ref name="monocle.com">{{cite web|url=https://monocle.com/film/affairs/soft-power-survey-2018-19/|title=Soft Power Survey 2018/19|date=2018|publisher=Monocle|accessdate=2018-12-21}}</ref>

''The Soft Power 30'', which includes a foreword by Joseph Nye, is a ranking of countries' soft power produced and published by the media company ''Portland'' in 2015. The ranking is based on "the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Soft Power 30 - A Global Ranking of Soft Power|url=http://softpower30.portland-communications.com/pdfs/the_soft_power_30.pdf|publisher=Portland|accessdate=17 July 2015|date=July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Softly does it|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21657655-oxbridge-one-direction-and-premier-league-bolster-britains-power-persuade-softly-does-it|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=The Economist|date=18 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=In 'soft power' terms, Japan ranks eighth out of 30 countries in U.K. consultancy report|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/soft-power-terms-japan-ranks-eighth-30-u-k-consultancy-gauge/#.Value4u-ra4|accessdate=17 July 2015|work=Japan Times|date=15 July 2015}}</ref>

The ''Elcano Global Presence Report'' scores the EU first for soft presence.<ref name=ElcanoEU /> Soft power, then, represents the third behavioral way of getting the outcomes you want. Soft power is contrasted with hard power, which has historically been the predominant realist measure of national power, through [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] such as [[population]] size, concrete [[military]] assets, or a nation's [[gross domestic product]]. But having such resources does not always produce the desired outcomes, as the United States discovered in the Vietnam War.

The success of soft power heavily depends on the actor's [[reputation]] within the [[international community]], as well as the flow of information between actors. Thus, soft power is often associated with the rise of [[globalization]] and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberal international relations theory]]. [[Popular culture]] and [[mass media]] are regularly identified as a source of soft power,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|title=Economic warfare on the silver screen|publisher=FRANCE 24|date=28 June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119013813/http://www.france24.com/en/20110625-economic-warfare-on-the-silver-screen-cinema-cannes-festival-2011-hollywood-france|archive-date=19 January 2012}}</ref> as is the spread of a national language or a particular set of [[norm (sociology)|normative]] structures. More particularly, [[World news|international news]] was found crucial in shaping the image and reputation of foreign countries. The high prominence of the US in international news, for example, has been linked to its soft power.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blondheim|first1=Menahem|last2=Segev|first2=Elad|s2cid=146592424|title=Just Spell US Right: America's News Prominence and Soft Power|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1128–1147|date=2015|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1114899}}</ref> Positive news coverage was associated with positive international views, while negative news coverage with negative views.<ref>{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Elad|title=International News Online: Global Views with Local Perspectives|year=2016|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=9781433129841|pages=139–153|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=85473&concordeid=312985|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611205324/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=85473&concordeid=312985|archive-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>

== Research ==

Academics have engaged in several debates around soft power. These have included:
* Its usefulness (Giulio Gallarotti, Niall Ferguson, Josef Joffe, Robert Kagan, Ken Waltz, Mearsheimer vs Nye, Katzenstein, Janice Bially Mattern, Jacques Hymans, Alexander Vuving, Jan Mellisen)
* How soft power and hard power interact (Giulio Gallarotti, Joseph Nye)
* Whether soft power can be coercive or [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]], (Janice BIally Mattern, Katzenstein, Duvall & Barnet vs Nye, Vuving)
* How the relationship between [[structure and agency]] work (Hymans vs Nye)
* Whether soft balancing is occurring (Wohlforth & Brooks vs Walt ''et al''.)
* Soft power and normative power in Europe (Ian Manners, A Ciambra, Thomas Diez, A Hyde Pryce, Richard Whitman)
* How [[civil resistance]] (i.e., non-violent forms of resistance) can often involve certain uses of soft power, but remains a distinct concept (Adam Roberts, Timothy Garton Ash)
* "Accumulated culture" vs. "accumulable culture"; soft power is only a subset of accumulable culture (Parc and Moon)<ref name=ParcMoon2019 />
One study finds that a state's soft power has a measurable effect on its exports. Countries that are admired for their positive global influence export more, holding other things constant.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Soft power raises exports|url = http://www.voxeu.org/article/soft-power-raises-exports|website = VoxEU.org|accessdate = 2015-10-11|last1 = Rose|first1 = Andrew|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/ecpo.12077|title = Like Me, Buy Me: The Effect of Soft Power on Exports|year = 2016|last1 = Rose|first1 = Andrew K.|s2cid = 153655114|journal = Economics & Politics|volume = 28|issue = 2|pages = 216–232|url = https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/ef/doc/GRU/WPS/GRU%232016-015_Andrew%20K_%20Rose(1).pdf}}</ref>

== Examples ==

=== Worldwide ===
The Soviet Union competed with the U.S. for influence throughout the [[Cold War]]. The Soviets were engaged in a broad campaign to convince the world of the attractiveness of its Communist system. In 1945, the Soviet Union was very effective in attracting many in Europe from its resistance to Hitler, and in colonized areas around the world because of its opposition to European imperialism.<ref name="ReferenceA">Nye, Joseph. ''Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2004).

After [[Pope John Paul II]] visited [[Poland]] in 1979, some political commentators said his visit influenced events against Poland's communist government, the [[Soviet Union]], and ultimately [[communism]], which promoted [[atheism]].<ref name="Angelo M. Codevilla 2008" />

{{quote|"The Pope won that struggle by transcending politics. His was what Joseph Nye calls "soft power" – the power of attraction and repulsion. He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated. He was a Pole, but beyond the regime’s reach. By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime. And so they came to him by the millions. They listened. He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct. "Be not afraid," he said. Millions shouted in response, "We want God! We want God! We want God!" The regime cowered. Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood. Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another. The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer. But as political leaders, they were finished." <ref>Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)</ref>

Besides the Pope's visit, American-government broadcasting and propaganda into Soviet-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, contributed to the rise of the [[Solidarity]] movement and to the collapse of the Soviet-backed governments there and in the rest of the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance.<ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71"/>

A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub-Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable).<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-2-chinas-image/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref>  China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a [[global superpower]] seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to [[Economy of China|China's economy]].

Through the use of GONGOs (otherwise known as a [[Government-organized non-governmental organization]]), China exerts soft power through foreign aid and development in Africa. China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. 

Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power.
In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million renminbi for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools.

Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.<ref>Jennifer G. Cooke.

=== France ===

[[France]] has long exerted a great amount of soft power. The country and [[French culture|its culture]] have for centuries been admired in many parts of the world; so much so that [[Thomas Jefferson]] is famously quoted as saying "Every man has two countries, his own and France."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|title=Americans in France|publisher=[[U.S. Embassy Paris]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418070413/http://france.usembassy.gov/us-france-americans.html|archive-date=2015-04-18}}</ref>  In 2017, France had the third largest diplomatic network in the world.<ref name=":0" />

France was a focal point of the [[Age of Enlightenment]];<ref>"Enlightenment thought culminates historically in the political upheaval of the French Revolution, in which the traditional hierarchical political and social orders (the French monarchy, the privileges of the French nobility, the political power and authority of the Catholic Church) were violently destroyed and replaced by a political and social order informed by the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality for all, founded, ostensibly, upon principles of human reason." [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/enlightenment/ Enlightenment], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> its attachment to the ideals of [[liberty]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[Toleration|tolerance]] and [[reason]] was notably embodied in the writing and publishing of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The [[French Revolution]] was one of the most significant events in European and world history. France has since then been instrumental in spreading [[Republicanism in France|Republican ideals]]. The [[Napoleonic Code]], which influenced much of the rest of Europe and beyond, is regarded as one of the most important law document of the [[modern era]].<ref name="Robert B. Holtman 1981">Robert B. Holtman, ''The Napoleonic Revolution'' (Baton Rouge: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1981)</ref>

The [[French language]] has for centuries been an important diplomatic language. For example, French has to be used  &ndash; on par with English &ndash; for all documents issued by the [[United Nations Treaty Series]], ensuring that all UN treaties are equally valid in their English and French versions.<ref>"Treaties registered with the United Nations Treaty Series are always translated into French and English. Documents are always provided in French and English. This city’s Geneva Conventions, written in equally authentic French and English versions, laid part of the groundwork for the international system." [https://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy Languages of diplomacy - Towards a fairer distribution], [[The Economist]]</ref>

France has also followed for decades a very active diplomatic and cultural policy. The ''[[Alliance Française]]'', whose aim is to promote the French language and French culture, was created as early as [[1883]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |title=Who are we? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120094935/http://www.alliancefr.org/en/who-are-we |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Alliance Française]]}}</ref> In ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'''s 2015 "Soft Power 30" report, France was ranked first in the "engagement" criteria, which is intended to measure "the reach of states’ diplomatic network and their commitment to major challenges like development and the environment." ''Monocle'' further noted that "In terms of influential reach, France is the best networked state in the world and is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country." Overall, France ranked fourth in that study.<ref name="francemonocle">{{cite web |url=http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |title=The Soft Power 30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120204008/http://www.comres.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Report_Final-published.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-20 |publisher=[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]}}</ref>

The annual soft power rankings by ''Monocle'' magazine and the Institute for Government ranks 30 countries which “best attract favor from other nations through culture, sport, cuisine, design, diplomacy and beyond.” ''Monocle'' magazine said: “[[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] may be painted as a stern taskmaster but it seems she has a softer side, or the country she leads does.” It said Germany's rise as a soft power should not come as a surprise. “The country is traditionally excellent at pursuing its ideas, values and aims using diplomatic, cultural and economic tools," it said. “By quietly doing the simple things well it is a country that has become a global power and the rest of us can feel comfortable with that.” Germans had been understandably wary about depicting a dominant image abroad, the magazine added, but it said that the country's rise should not make everyone else feel uncomfortable.<ref>Germany tops world 'soft power' rankings; http://www.thelocal.de/20131121/germany-number-one-for-soft-power</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gerhard Schröder: 'Germany Can Only Lead Europe the Way Porcupines Mate'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/interview-former-german-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-on-foreign-policy-a-891839.html|publisher=Spiegel Online International|accessdate=30 July 2015|date=1 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Obama sets off on farewell trip to Europe in shadow of president-elect|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/barack-obama-faces-awkward-task-on-sad-farewell-visit-to-europe|accessdate=14 November 2016|agency=Reuters|date=14 November 2016|quote=As the Americans see it, Merkel – and certainly not the vainglorious European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker – runs the EU.

Popular tastes in drama in Italy have long favored comedy; the improvisational style known as the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'' began in Italy in the mid-16th century<ref>{{cite web |language=it |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/commedia-dell-arte/ |title=Commedia dell'arte |work=Treccani, il portale del sapere |access-date=24 Jul 2012}}</ref> and is still performed today. Before being exported to France, the famous [[Ballet]] dance genre also originated in Italy.
The country boasts several world-famous cities. [[Rome]] was the ancient capital of the Roman Empire and seat of the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. [[Florence]] was the heart of the [[Renaissance]], a period of great achievements in [[the arts]] that ended the Dark Ages.<ref>Zirpolo, Lilian H.

=== United States ===
The [[foreign relations of the United States]] has long had a great deal of soft power.<ref>Joseph S. Nye, "The future of soft power in US foreign policy." in ''Soft Power and US Foreign Policy'' (Routledge, 2010). 16-23.</ref> Examples of the impact include Franklin D. Roosevelt's [[four freedoms]] in Europe to motivate the Allies in World War II; people behind the [[Iron Curtain]] listening to the government's foreign propaganda arm [[Radio Free Europe]]; newly liberated Afghans in 2001 asking for a copy of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and young Iranians today surreptitiously watching banned American videos and satellite television broadcasts in the privacy of their homes.<ref name="Nye, Joseph 2004 p X" /> America's early commitment to [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]], for example, was a powerful element of its overall appeal to potential immigrants; and American aid in the reconstruction of Europe after World War II was a propaganda victory to show off the prosperity and the generosity of the people of the United States.

Studies of American broadcasting into the [[Soviet bloc]], and testimonials from Czech President [[Václav Havel]], Polish President [[Lech Wałęsa]], and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] support that soft power efforts of the United States and its allies during the Cold War were ultimately successful in creating the favorable conditions that led to the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Carnes Lord, "Public Diplomacy and Soft Power," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008)</ref>{{quote|"Satellite TV is actively promoting American soft power in the Arab world in ways that the United States has been incapable of doing. The launch of the Arabic-language [[Alhurra]] satellite channel in early 2004 to provide news and entertainment in ways more beneficial to the U.S., marked an important turning point in U.S. public diplomacy development. Though it calls itself the largest Arabic-language news organization in the world, the Virginia-based Alhurra lacks the cachet and brand recognition of Al Jazeera, but its balanced presentation of news has earned it a small but significant viewership. Controversial innovations in radio broadcasting that target young mass audiences through a mix of light news and mild American popular music – [[Radio Sawa]] in [[Arabic]] and [[Radio Farda]] in [[Persian language|Persian]] – have captured a substantial market share in their target regions."<ref name="Lord, Carnes 2008. p 59-71" />
