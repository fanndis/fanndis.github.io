'''Chappaqua''' ({{IPAc-en|'|tʃ|æ|p|ə|k|w|ɑː}} {{respell|CHAP|ə|kwah}}) is a [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] and [[census-designated place]] in the [[administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]], in [[Northern Westchester|northern]] [[Westchester County, New York]]. It is on {{convert|0.45|sqmi|km2}} of land on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], about {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1}} north of [[New York City]]. The hamlet is served by the [[Chappaqua (Metro-North station)|Chappaqua station]] of the [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Harlem Line (Metro-North)|Harlem Line]]. In the [[New York State Legislature]] it is within the [[New York State Assembly]]'s 93rd district and the [[New York Senate]]'s 40th district. In [[United States Congress|Congress]] the village is in New York's [[New York's 17th congressional district|17th District]].

Chappaqua was founded by a group of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] in the 1730s and was the home of [[Horace Greeley]], ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' editor and U.S. congressman. Since the late 1990s, former President [[Bill Clinton]] and former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] have lived there.

==History==
In the early 1730s a group of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] moved north from [[Purchase, New York]], to settle in present-day Chappaqua. They built their homes on Quaker Road (more recently, Quaker Street) and held their meetings at the home of Abel Weeks. Their [[Friends meeting house|meeting house]] was built in 1753 and still holds weekly meetings each Sunday. The area around the meeting house, known as [[Old Chappaqua Historic District]], was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>  [[Horace Greeley]]'s home, known as [[Rehoboth (Chappaqua, New York)|Rehoboth]] and built by Greeley himself, still stands in Chappaqua.  It is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with [[Chappaqua Railroad Depot and Depot Plaza]], [[Church of Saint Mary the Virgin and Greeley Grove]], and the [[Greeley House (Chappaqua, New York)|Greeley House]].<ref name="nris"/>

Various spellings were used for the name they heard Native Americans use for their valley and hillside. It was an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word, ''shah-pah-ka'', and it meant "the rustling land" or "the rattling land," or a place where nothing is heard but the rustling of the wind in the leaves. The Quakers spelled it Shapiqua, Shapaqua, Shapequa, Shappaqua, and, finally, Chappaqua. Their meeting was often referred to as the Shapequa Meeting as early as 1745.<ref>{{cite book| last = Warde| first = Robert| title = Chappaqua: Our Connections to Its Past| year = 1982| publisher = Chappaqua Central School District (CCSD) }}</ref>

On March 18, 1791, the government of New York decided to split the overly large town of North Castle (jokingly called "the two saddlebags") into two smaller towns, one of which was named [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]].  The border was drawn from the southwest corner of [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]] to the northeast edge of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]].  New Castle's borders have remained the same since 1791, except for a small piece of land received from [[Somers, New York|Somers]] in 1846 and the secession of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]] in 1978.

Chappaqua had great streams such as the [[Saw Mill River]] and Roaring Brook. These bodies of water powered [[water mill|mill]]s to crush corn and press oil from beans. The eastern half of Chappaqua was very suitable for farming. The majority of the Quaker settlers of Chappaqua were farmers. The popular farming industry also helped give way to Chappaqua's high milk production. Other popular industries from Chappaqua included shoes, hardware, vinegar, pickles, eyeglasses, and furniture. Many early homes and businesses were demolished in the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]].

In 1846 when the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] extended through Chappaqua, business became centered on the [[Chappaqua (Metro-North station)|new train station]]. These businesses included a hotel, livery stables, a public library, and various stores and small factories. The railroad enabled [[commuter]]s to travel to [[New York City]] and back each day.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Geography==
According to the [[2010 United States Census]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|0.45|sqmi}}, all of it land.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov |title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Chappaqua CDP, New York |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=November 18, 2011 }}</ref>  As delineated for the 2000 census, the CDP of Chappaqua covered a much greater area: {{convert|9.44|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|9.38|sqmi}} was land and {{convert|0.06|sqmi}}, or 0.64%, was water.

Parts of the Chappaqua [[ZIP code]] area are located in the towns of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]], [[New Castle, New York|New Castle]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], [[Yorktown, New York|Yorktown]], and [[Bedford (town), New York|Bedford]], as well as the hamlet of [[Millwood, New York|Millwood]]. Parts of the Chappaqua Central School District include homes in other zip codes, such as 10570, the [[Pleasantville, New York|Pleasantville]] zip code.

Nationwide, Chappaqua ranks 42nd among the 100 highest-income places in the United States (with at least 1,000 households).

===Crime===
Although Chappaqua's [[crime rate]] is far below the national average,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relohomesearch.com/NorthAmericaCity/NY/Chappaqua.aspx|title=Chappaqua, NY Real Estate Homes for Sale|first=Leading Real Estate Companies of the|last=World|publisher=}}</ref> the area has had several high-profile murders. In 1996, a battle between a lottery winner and his former lover over custody of their 5-year-old child resulted in a gun battle; the winner was acquitted of the murder of his former lover on the basis of self-defense, and convicted of the shooting of the woman's father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/21/nyregion/lotto-winner-guilty-in-a-killing-cleared-in-2d.html "Lotto Winner Guilty in a Killing, Cleared in 2d"], ''The New York Times'', March 21, 1998.</ref> In November 2006 a disbarred attorney drove the body of his severely injured wife to Northern Westchester Hospital, claiming that the couple had been ambushed and shot in nearby Millwood. She died soon after. For over a year, police expressed skepticism about the husband's account and did not rule him out as a suspect. In December 2007 the man was charged with his wife's murder after trying to collect on [[life insurance]] policies.<ref>Fitzgerald, Jim.

==Education==
{{main|Chappaqua Central School District}}

Parent expectations in the school district are high, and the educational environment has been described as highly competitive and somewhat stressful.<ref>Richardson, Lydia. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/17/nyregion/new-uncertainty-about-life-after-high-school-students-horace-greeley-wonder-if.html "A New Uncertainty About Life After High School; Students at Horace Greeley Wonder if the Best Years of Their Lives Are Ahead or Behind"], ''The New York Times'', June 17, 1992.</ref> In addition, [[Horace Greeley High School]] has Chappaqua Summer Scholarship Program, which brings motivated and aspiring students from [[The Bronx]] to Chappaqua for four weeks over three summers to take classes while living with host families in Chappaqua.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chappaquasummerscholarship.org/cssp/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=9&Itemid=41|title=PowWeb|website=chappaquasummerscholarship.org}}</ref> Around 1981, the magazine ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' rated the school among the top twelve in the United States.<ref>Williams, Lena. [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/27/nyregion/greeley-high-called-one-of-best-in-us.html "Greeley High Called One Of Best In U.S."], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 27, 1981.</ref>

Schools in Chappaqua were not always so high-performing. Small, one-room schoolhouses devoid of windows were prevalent in the 1800s. In the Chappaqua region, there were eight such schoolhouses.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}  These small schools prevailed until around 1870, when the Quakers built a large school called the [[Chappaqua Mountain Institute]] on Quaker Street.  In the year 1885 the school caught fire,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1885/02/22/archives/driven-out-by-the-fire-the-quaker-schoolhouse-at-chappaqua-burned.html "Driven Out By The Fire; The Quaker Schoolhouse At Chappaqua Burned. The Teachers And Children In The Bitter Cold In Their Night Clothes--Cool Young Farragut"], ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1885.</ref> and much refurbishing was done, with the addition of two new wings.  It was sold in 1908 and the school's property is now owned by [[Children's Aid]].

Around 1928, Robert E. Bell Middle School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsd.ws/bs/|title=Robert E. Bell Middle School|access-date=2008-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314235808/http://www.ccsd.ws/bs/|archive-date=2008-03-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> known at the time as Horace Greeley School, was built. The present day Horace Greeley High School was built in 1957. Robert E. Bell Middle School has the bulldog as its mascot while Horace Greeley High School has the quaker as its mascot. The three elementary schools in Chappaqua were completed over a twenty-year period: Roaring Brook School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/rb/|title=Roaring Brook School|access-date=2006-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214012130/http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/rb/|archive-date=2006-12-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 1951, Douglas G. Grafflin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/dg/|title=Douglas G. Grafflin|access-date=2006-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214011848/http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/dg/|archive-date=2006-12-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 1962, and Westorchard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/wo/index.htm|title=Westorchard|access-date=2006-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061223123014/http://www.chappaqua.k12.ny.us/wo/index.htm|archive-date=2006-12-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 1971.

The district's modern commitment to education was exemplified in the 1950s when Horace Greeley High School principal, Donald Miles, began hiring teachers based primarily on their subject knowledge, eschewing the "professional teacher".  One of the most notable hires was Edwin Barlow, a math teacher whose controversial classroom methods and enigmatic life are chronicled in the 2009 memoir, ''Teacher of the Year: The Mystery and Legacy of Edwin Barlow''.<ref>Meyers, Lawrence. ''Teacher of the Year: The Mystery and Legacy of Edwin Barlow'', H.H. & Sons, 2009</ref>

In 2003, after the opening of the new middle school, Seven Bridges, and the moving of the fifth grade from Chappaqua's elementary schools to the middle schools, the district added a full day kindergarten.<ref>Rosenberg, Merri. [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/23/nyregion/in-the-schools-the-half-day-stress-of-kindergarten.html "IN THE SCHOOLS; The Half-Day Stress Of Kindergarten"], ''The New York Times'', February 23, 2003.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccsd.ws/ccsd/boardofeducation/m040525.htm|title=Minutes, Chappaqua Central School District Board of Education, May 25, 2004.|access-date=2007-06-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220112534/http://ccsd.ws/ccsd/boardofeducation/m040525.htm|archive-date=2008-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Emergency services===
[[Emergency Medical Service]] and fire protection are provided by volunteer agencies.
