Today, Dundee is promoted as "One City, Many Discoveries" in honour of Dundee's history of scientific activities and of the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']], [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s Antarctic exploration vessel, which was built in Dundee and is now berthed at Discovery Point. Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s, and the city now accounts for 10% of the United Kingdom's [[digital entertainment]] industry, including mobile app development and gaming. Dundee has two universities – the [[University of Dundee]] and the [[Abertay University]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Dundee}}

The name "Dundee" is made up of two parts: the common [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] place-name element ''dun'', meaning fort; and a second part that may derive from a Celtic element, cognate with the Gaelic ''dè'', meaning 'fire'.<ref>{{harvnb|Watson|1926|p=220}}; Dundee is also recorded as ''Dun-Tay'', e.g. {{harvnb|Pont c1583-96}}</ref>
[[File:Dundee1693 JohnSlezer2.jpg|thumb|360px|left|Dundee in 1693 by [[John Slezer]].]]
While earlier evidence for human occupation is abundant,<ref>The earliest evidence for human occupation of the area dates from the [[Mesolithic]]: {{harvnb|Mathewson|1879}}; {{harvnb|RCAHMS Canmore database: Dundee, Stannergate}}</ref> Dundee's success and growth as a seaport town arguably came as a result of [[William the Lion]]'s charter, granting Dundee to his younger brother, [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David]] (later [[Earl of Huntingdon]]) in the late 12th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2003|p=266}}</ref> The situation of the town and its promotion by Earl David as a trading centre led to a period of prosperity and growth.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|1990|pp=20–21}}; {{harvnb|Turnock|1982|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Mackie|1836|pp=23–24}}</ref> The earldom was passed down to David's descendants, amongst whom was [[John Balliol]]. The town became a [[Royal Burgh]] on John's coronation as king in 1292.<ref name="Barrow 1990 24">{{harvnb|Barrow|1990|p=24}}</ref> The town and its castle were occupied by English forces for several years during the [[First War of Scottish Independence|First War of Independence]] and recaptured by [[Robert the Bruce]] in early 1312.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|1965|p=272}}; p. 374</ref> The original Burghal charters were lost during the occupation and subsequently renewed by Bruce in 1327.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1836|pp=30–32}}; pp. 207–208</ref>

The burgh suffered considerably during the conflict known as the [[Rough Wooing]] of 1543 to 1550, and was occupied by the English forces of [[Andrew Dudley]] from 1547. In 1548, unable to defend the town against an advancing Scottish force, Dudley ordered that the town be burnt to the ground.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|2009|pp=9–10}}; {{harvnb|Merriman|2000}} pp. 263, 292, 304, 360–361</ref> In 1645, during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], Dundee was again besieged, this time by the Royalist [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lythe|1958|pp=27–28}}; {{harvnb|Reid|1990|pp=97–99}}; {{harvnb|Cowan|1995|pp=195–198}}; {{harvnb|Cullen|Whatley|Young|2009|pp=61–63}}</ref> The town was finally destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]] in 1651.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackie|1836|pp=32–38}}; {{harvnb|Lythe|1958|pp=28–30}}; {{harvnb|Cullen|Whatley|Young|2009|pp=63–64}}</ref> The town played a pivotal role in the establishment of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause when [[John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee]] raised the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] standard on the [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] in 1689.<ref>{{harvnb|Lenman|1980|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Patrick|2009|pp=85–88}}</ref> The town was held by the Jacobites in the 1715–16 rising, and on 6 January 1716 the Jacobite claimant to the throne, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James VIII and III]] (the Old Pretender), made a public entry into the town. Many in Scotland, including many in Dundee, regarded him as the rightful king.<ref>J. Baynes, ''The Jacobite Rising of 1715'' (1970), p.166</ref>

A notable resident of Dundee was Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, [[Barony of Lundie|Baron of Lundie]] (1 July 1731 to 4 August 1804). He was born in Dundee on 1 July 1731, the son of Alexander Duncan of Lundie, Provost of Dundee. Adam was educated in Dundee and later joined the Royal Navy on board the sloop Trial. He rose to be admiral and in October 1797 defeated the Dutch fleet off Camperdown (north of Haarlem). This was seen as one of the most significant actions in naval history.<ref>Laughton, John Knox (1888). "Duncan, Adam". In Stephen, Leslie. Dictionary of National Biography. 16.

The economy of mediaeval Dundee centred on the export of raw wool, with the production of finished textiles being a reaction to recession in the 15th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Whatley|Swinfen|Smith|1993|pp=28–30}}</ref> Two government Acts in the mid 18th century had a profound effect on Dundee's industrial success: the textile industry was revolutionised by the introduction of large four-storey mills, stimulated in part by the 1742 Bounty Act which provided a government-funded subsidy on [[Osnaburg]] linen produced for export.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|Swan|Archibald|2009|p=274}}; {{harvnb|Whatley|1992|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Checkland|Checkland|1989|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Durie|1979}} p. 27; p. 52; pp. 146–147;</ref> Expansion of the [[whaling]] industry was triggered by the second Bounty Act, introduced in 1750 to increase Britain's maritime and naval skill base.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|Swan|Archibald|2009|p=275}}</ref> Dundee, and Scotland more generally, saw rapid population increase at end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the city's population increasing from 12,400 in 1751 to 30,500 in 1821.<ref name="Smout 1998 240–248">{{harvnb|Smout|1998|pp=240–248}}</ref>

The rise of the textile industries brought with it an expansion of supporting industries, notably of the whaling, maritime and shipbuilding industries,<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|Kinnear|1990|pp=16–22}}</ref> and extensive development of the waterfront area started in 1815 to cope with increased demand for port capacity.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2007|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Kenefick|2000|pp=38–50}}</ref> At its height, 200 ships per year were built there, including [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s Antarctic research vessel, the {{ship|RRS|Discovery}}.

While the city's economy was dominated by the jute industry, it also became known for smaller industries. Most notable among these were [[Keiller's marmalade|James Keiller's and Sons]], established in 1795, which pioneered commercial [[marmalade]] production,<ref>{{harvnb|Mathew|1998|p=12}}</ref> and the publishing firm [[DC Thomson]], which was founded in the city in 1905. Dundee was said to be built on the 'three Js': Jute, Jam and Journalism.

The town was also the location of one of the worst rail disasters in British history, the [[Tay Bridge disaster]]. The first [[Tay Rail Bridge]] was opened in 1878. It collapsed some 18 months later during a storm, as a passenger train passed over it, resulting in the loss of 75 lives.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2004|p=69}}</ref> The [[1906 Dundee fire|most destructive fire in the city's history]] came in 1906, reportedly sending "rivers of burning whisky" through the street.

The jute industry fell into decline in the early 20th century, partly due to reduced demand for jute products and partly due to an inability to compete with the emerging industry in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roul|2009|p=103}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|1998|pp=16–17}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2011|p=37}}</ref> This gave rise to unemployment levels far in excess of the national average, peaking in the inter-war period,<ref>{{harvnb|Whatley|1990|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Devine|Lee|Peden|2005|p=166}}</ref> but major recovery was seen in the post-war period, thanks to the arrival first of American light engineering companies like [[Timex Group|Timex]] and [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], and subsequent expansion into microelectronics.<ref>{{harvnb|Devine|Lee|Peden|2005|p=169}}; {{harvnb|Cortada|1993|p=237}}; {{harvnb|Knox|McKinlay|2011|p=266}}</ref>

A new [[V&A Dundee|Victoria and Albert Museum]] opened on 15 September 2018.

== Governance ==
{{main|Politics of Dundee}}
[[File:City of Dundee Coat of Arms.png|thumb|City of Dundee Coat of Arms]]

Dundee was granted [[Royal Burgh]] status on the coronation of [[John of Scotland|John Balliol]] as King of Scotland in 1292.<ref name="Barrow 1990 24"/> The city has two mottos—{{lang-la|Dei Donum}} (''Gift of God'') and ''Prudentia et Candore'' (With Thought and Purity) although usually only the latter is used for civic purposes.<ref>{{harvnb|Chronicle of The City's Office Bearers, Chambers, Regalia, Castles & Twin Cities}}; the apocryphal toponym ''Dei Donum'' was applied by [[Hector Boece]] in the sixteenth century: {{harvnb|Ferguson|1998|pp=60–61}}</ref>

Prior to 1996, Dundee was governed by the City of Dundee District Council. This was formed in 1975, implementing boundaries imposed in the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]]. Under these boundaries, the Angus burgh and district of Monifieth, and the Perth electoral division of [[Longforgan]] (which included [[Invergowrie]]) were annexed to the county of the city of Dundee. In 1996, the Dundee City unitary authority was created following implementation of the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]].<ref name="localgovact">{{harvnb|Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994}}</ref> This placed [[Monifieth]] and [[Invergowrie]] in the unitary authorities of [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] and [[Perth and Kinross]], largely reinstating the pre-1975 [[County council|county]] boundaries. Some controversy has ensued as a result of these boundary changes, with Dundee city councillors arguing for the return of Monifieth and Invergowrie.<ref>{{harvnb|Councils plot revolt over re-draw plan|2005}}</ref>

=== Local government ===
[[File:City Chambers, Dundee, Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|Dundee City Chambers, where the city council meets]]

Dundee is one of 32 [[council areas of Scotland]],<ref name="localgovact" /> and is represented by the Dundee City Council – a local council composed of 29 elected [[councillor]]s. Previously the city was a [[Counties of Scotland|county of a city]] and later a [[Regions and districts of Scotland|district]] of the [[Tayside]] [[Regions and districts of Scotland|region]]. Council meetings take place in the [[Dundee City Chambers|City Chambers]], which opened in 1933 in City Square. The civic head and chair of the council is known as the [[Lord Provost]], a position similar to that of mayor in other cities. The political head of the council is known as the Leader of the Council or Leader of the Administration. The Leader chairs the Policy & Resources Committee. [[Dundee House]], the new headquarters for the city council on North Lindsay Street, opened in August 2011.<ref name=DDHouse>{{harvnb|Dundee House}}</ref> This has replaced [[Tayside House]] which was demolished in 2013 as part of the Dundee Waterfront improvements.<ref name=DDHouse/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/bye-bye-tayside-house-muncher-completes-its-work-1.111722|title=Bye-bye Tayside House — 'Muncher' completes its work|date=12 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2014|work=The Courier|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170309/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/dundee/bye-bye-tayside-house-muncher-completes-its-work-1.111722|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref>

Elections to the council are normally on a four-year cycle. The most recent election took place on [[2017 Dundee City Council election|4 May 2017]]. Since 2007, the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]] has meant that there are eight multi-member wards which elect three or four councillors by [[single transferable vote]], to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{harvnb|Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004}}</ref> The [[2012 Dundee City Council election|2012 elections]] gave the SNP overall control of the council with 16 seats. However the 2017 contest saw the SNP lose their majority, although they remained the largest party with 14 councillors.<ref name="2017election">{{cite news|last1=Lord|first1=Dave|title=Council elections: SNP lose majority in Dundee|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/420153/council-elections-snp-lose-majority-dundee/|accessdate=5 May 2017|work=The Courier|publisher=D C Thomson Co Ltd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508194216/https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/420153/council-elections-snp-lose-majority-dundee/|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Scotland's longest-serving councillor, [[Ian Borthwick]], sits on the council.

=== Westminster and Holyrood ===
For elections to the [[British House of Commons]] at [[Westminster Palace|Westminster]], the city area and portions of the [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] council area are divided in two [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]].<ref name="borders">{{harvnb|Fifth Periodical Review of Constituencies}}</ref> The constituencies of [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] and [[Dundee West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee West]] are represented by [[Stewart Hosie]] ([[Scottish National Party]])<ref>{{harvnb|Stewart Hosie, MP for Dundee East}}</ref> and [[Chris Law]] (Scottish National Party), respectively, both of whom were re-elected at the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]]. For elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]] at [[Scottish Parliament Building|Holyrood]], the city area is divided between three constituencies. The [[Dundee City East (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee City East constituency]] and the [[Dundee City West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Dundee City West constituency]] are entirely within the city area. The [[Angus South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus South (Holyrood) constituency]] includes north-eastern and north-western portions of the city area.<ref name="borders" /> All three constituencies are within the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|North East Scotland electoral region]]: [[Shona Robison]] (SNP) is the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the Dundee East constituency;<ref>{{harvnb|Shona Robison, MSP for Dundee East}}</ref> [[Joe Fitzpatrick]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Dundee West constituency<ref>{{harvnb|Joe Fitzpatrick, MSP for Dundee West}}</ref> and [[Graeme Dey]] (SNP) is the current MSP for the Angus South constituency.<ref>{{harvnb|Graeme Dey, MSP for Angus South}}</ref>

Dundee was also part of the pan-Scotland [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|European Parliament constituency]] until the 31st January 2020 when the U.K. left the EU. Seven [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEP)s were elected using the [[d'Hondt method]] of [[party-list proportional representation]].<ref name="list of MEPs in Scotland">{{harvnb|List of MEPs in Scotland}}</ref> In the last European Election Scotland voted, it returned three [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] MEPs, one Liberal Democrat MEP, one [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist]] MEP and one Brexit Party MEP, to the [[European Parliament]].<ref name="list of MEPs in Scotland" />

[[Sir Winston Churchill#Political career to the Second World War|Winston Churchill served as one of two MPs]] for Dundee from 1908 to 1922.

==== 2014 Scottish independence referendum ====
On 18 September 2014, Dundee was one of four council areas to vote "Yes" in the [[Scottish independence referendum]], with 57.3% voting "Yes" on a 78.8% turnout. With the highest Yes vote for any local authority in Scotland, some in the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign nicknamed Dundee the 'Yes City', including former First Minister [[Alex Salmond]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scotland Decides|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/live|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609121516/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/live|archive-date=9 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Scottish Independence|work=The Scotsman|url=http://www.scotsman.com/scottish-independence/alex-salmond-dundee-is-scotlands-yes-city/|access-date=19 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231234703/http://www.scotsman.com/scottish-independence/alex-salmond-dundee-is-scotlands-yes-city/|archive-date=31 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:The Dundee Law - geograph.org.uk - 63200 (lighter ground).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Dundee Law]]]]
Dundee sits on the north bank of the [[Firth of Tay]] on the eastern, [[North Sea]] Coast of Scotland. The city lies {{convert| 36.1|mi|km|0}} [[Boxing the compass|NNE]] of [[Edinburgh]]<ref name="postcode">{{harvnb|UK Postcode to Postcode Calculator}}</ref> and {{convert|360.6|mi|km|0}} [[Boxing the compass|NNW]] of London.<ref name="postcode"/> The built-up area occupies a roughly rectangular shape {{convert|8.3|mi|km|0}} long by {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} wide, aligned in an east to west direction and occupies an area of {{convert|60|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name=OSmap/><ref name=popdens>{{harvnb|Population density: Scotland: by unitary authority}}</ref> The town is bisected by a line of hills stretching from Balgay Hill (elevation of 143 m) in the west end of the city, through the [[Dundee Law]] (174 m) which occupies the centre of the built up area, to Gallow Hill (83 m), between [[Baxter Park]] and the Eastern Cemetery. North of this ridge lies a valley through which cuts the Dighty Water [[burn (topography)|burn]], the elevation falling to around 45 m. North of the Dighty valley lie the [[Sidlaw Hills]], the most prominent hill being [[Craigowl Hill]] (455 m).<ref name=OSmap>{{harvnb|Ordnance Survey Landranger Map|2007}}</ref>

The western and eastern boundaries of the city are marked by two [[burn (topography)|burns]] that are tributaries of the [[River Tay]]. On the western-most boundary of the city, the Lochee burn meets the Fowlis burn, forming the [[Invergowrie]] burn, which meets the Tay at Invergowrie basin.<ref name=OSmap/> The Dighty Water enters Dundee from the village of [[Strathmartine]] and marks the boundaries of a number of northern districts of the city, joining the Tay between [[Barnhill, Dundee|Barnhill]] and [[Monifieth]].<ref name=OSmap/> The Scouring burn in the west end of the city and Dens Burn in the east, both of which played important roles in the industrial development of the city, have now been [[culvert]]ed over.

=== Geology ===
The city lies within the Sidlaw-Ochil [[anticline]], and the predominant bedrock type is [[Old Red Sandstone]] of the Arbuthnott-Garvock group.<ref name=geo>{{harvnb|Bluck|2000|p=422}}; {{harvnb|GeoIndex Onshore}}</ref> [[Differential weathering]] of a series of [[igneous intrusion]]s has yielded a number of prominent hills in the landscape, most notably the [[Law, Dundee|Dundee Law]] (a late [[Silurian]]/early [[Devonian]] [[Mafic]] rock intrusion) and Balgay hill (a [[Felsic]] rock intrusion of similar age).<ref name=geo/> In the east of the city, in [[Craigiebank, Dundee|Craigie]] and [[Broughty Ferry]], the bedrock geology is of [[extrusive rock]]s, including mafic [[lava]] and [[tuff]].<ref name=geo/>

The land surrounding Dundee, particularly that in the lower lying areas to the west and east of the city, bears high quality soil that is particularly suitable for arable farming. It is predominantly of a [[brown forest soil]] type with some [[Gley soil|gleying]], the lower parts being formed from raised beach sands and gravels derived from Old Red Sandstone and lavas.<ref>{{harvnb|Soil Survey of Scotland|1982}}</ref>

[[File:Midsummer night^ - geograph.org.uk - 9752.jpg|View from The Law, overlooking Dundee City Centre and the Tay Road Bridge|thumb|left]]
Very little of pre-[[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] Dundee remains, the destruction suffered in the [[War of the Rough Wooing]] being almost total, with only scattered, roofless shells remaining.<ref>{{harvnb|Merriman|2000|pp=360–361}}</ref> The area occupied by the medieval burgh of Dundee extends between East Port and West Port, which formerly held the gates to the walled city. The shoreline has been altered considerably since the early 19th century through development of the harbour area and land reclamation.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|2007|p=80}}; The progress of waterfront development can be seen in the maps of {{harvnb|Wood|1821}}, {{harvnb|Edward|1846}} and {{harvnb|Bartholomew|1912}}</ref> Several areas on the periphery of the burgh saw industrial development with the building of textile mills from the end of the 18th century. Their placement was dictated by the need for a water supply for the modern steam powered machinery, and areas around the Lochee Burn ([[Lochee]]), Scouring Burn ([[Blackness, Dundee|Blackness]]) and Dens Burn (Dens Road area) saw particular concentrations of mills.<ref>{{harvnb|Lenman|Lythe|Gauldie|1969|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland 1992}} p. 25; {{harvnb|Watson|1990|p=8}}</ref> The post war period saw expansion of industry to estates along the Kingsway.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|1968|p=296}}</ref>

Working class housing spread rapidly and without control throughout the Victorian era, particularly in the Hawkhill, Blackness Road, Dens Road and Hilltown areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland 1992}} p. 26</ref> Despite the comparative wealth of Victorian Dundee as a whole, living standards for the working classes were very poor. A general lack of town planning coupled with the influx of labour during the expansion of the jute industry resulted in insanitary, squalid and cramped housing for much of the population.<ref>{{harvnb|McKean|2011|pp=72–76}}</ref> While gradual improvements and [[Slum clearance in the United Kingdom|slum clearance]] began in the late 19th century, the building of the groundbreaking [[Logie, Dundee|Logie]] housing estate marked the beginning of Dundee's expansion through the building of planned housing estates, under the vision of city architect [[James Thomson (architect)|James Thomson]], whose legacy also includes the housing estate of [[Craigiebank, Dundee|Craigiebank]] and the beginnings of an improved transport infrastructure by planning the Kingsway bypass.<ref>{{harvnb|Logie Conservation Area}}; {{harvnb|Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland 1992}} pp. 51–52; {{harvnb|McKean|2011|p=81}}</ref>

Modernisation of the city centre continued in the post-war period.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Fog in the Tay estuary - geograph.org.uk - 9750.jpg|[[Haar (fog)]] travelling up the [[River Tay]] by [[advection]]|thumb|right]]
The climate, like the rest of lowland Scotland, is [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger]] classification Cfb).<ref>{{harvnb|Peel|Finlayson|McMahon|2007}}</ref> Mean temperature and rainfall are typical for the east coast of Scotland, and with the city's sheltered estuarine position, mean daily maxima are slightly higher than coastal areas to the North, particularly in spring and summer.<ref>{{harvnb|Regional mapped climate averages}}</ref> The summers are still chilly when compared with similar latitudes in continental Europe, something compensated for by the mild winters, similar to the rest of the British Isles. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is Mylnefield, [[Invergowrie]] which is about {{convert|4|mi|km}} west of the City Centre.

A record high of {{convert|29.3|C|F}} was recorded in July 2013.<ref>{{harvnb|Jul 2013 Maximum}}</ref> The warmest month was July 2006,<ref>{{harvnb|Jul 2006 Mean}}</ref> with an average temperature of {{convert|17.4|C|F}} (average high {{convert|22.5|C|F}}, average low {{convert|12.3|C|F}}).

Dundee's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census.

According to the 2001 census, the City of Dundee had a population of 154,674.<ref name="Dundee Population" /> A more recent population estimate of the City of Dundee has been recorded at 156,561 in 2012. The demographic make-up of the population is much in line with the rest of Scotland. The age group from 30 to 44 forms the largest portion of the population (20%).<ref name="Dundee Population" /> The median age of males and females living in Dundee was 37 and 40 years, respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years for those in the whole of Scotland.<ref name="Dundee Population" />

The place of birth of the town's residents was 94.16% United Kingdom (including 87.85% from Scotland), 0.42% [[Republic of Ireland]], 1.33% from other [[European Union]] (EU) countries, and 3.09% from elsewhere in the world. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 35.92% in full-time employment, 10.42% in part-time employment, 4.25% self-employed, 5.18% unemployed, 7.82% students with jobs, 4.73% students without jobs, 15.15% retired, 4.54% looking after home or family, 7.92% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.00% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared with the average demography of Scotland, Dundee has both low proportions of people born outside the United Kingdom and for people over 75&nbsp;years old.

Natives of Dundee are called Dundonians and are often recognisable by their distinctive dialect of [[Scots language|Scots]] as well as their [[Accent (dialect)|accent]], which most noticeably substitutes the [[monophthong]] /ɛ/ (pronounced "eh") in place of the [[diphthong]] /aj/ (pronounced "ai").<ref>{{harvnb|McCluskey|1991}}; {{harvnb|Dundee Scots}}</ref> Dundee, and Scotland more generally, saw rapid population increase at end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the city's population increasing from 12,400 in 1751 to 30,500 in 1821.<ref name="Smout 1998 240–248"/> Of particular significance was an influx of Irish workers in the early to mid-19th century, attracted by the prospect of employment in the textiles industries. In 1851, 18.9% of people living in Dundee were of Irish birth.<ref>{{harvnb|Swift|Gilley|1989|p=117}}; {{harvnb|Little Tipperary: The Irish in Lochee}}</ref>

The city has also attracted immigrants from Italy, fleeing poverty and famine, in the 19th century Jews, fleeing from the Russia controlled portions of partitioned [[Poland]] and from German occupation in the 20th. Today, Dundee has a sizeable [[ethnic minority]] population, and has around 4,000 Asian residents which is the fourth-largest Asian community in Scotland. The city also has 1.0% of residents from a Black/African/Caribbean background.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/rel2asbfigure4.pdf |title=Figure 4: Minority ethnic groups by council area, Scotland, 2011 |access-date=30 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022230302/http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/documents/censusresults/release2a/rel2asbfigure4.pdf |archive-date=22 October 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Dundee has a higher proportion of university students – one in seven of the population – than any other town in Europe, except [[Heidelberg]].<ref name="Dundee Student Population">{{cite web|title=History of Dundee|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/central-scotland/dundee/history|website=Lonely Planet|accessdate=28 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205082656/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/central-scotland/dundee/history|archive-date=5 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The 14.2% come from all around the world to attend the local universities and colleges. Dundee is a major attraction for Northern Irish students who make up 5% of the total student population. The city's universities are believed to hold the highest percentage of Northern Irish students outside of [[Northern Ireland]] and have a big impact on the local economy and culture. However, this has declined in recent years due to the increase of tuition fees for students elsewhere in the UK. Dundee also has a lot of students from abroad, mostly from the [[Republic of Ireland]] and other [[EU countries]] but with an increasing number from countries from the Far East and [[Nigeria]].<ref name="population">{{harvnb|Population Matters}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Cox's stack 02SEP05.jpg|Right|thumb|upright|Cox's Stack, a chimney from the former [[Camperdown Works]] jute mill. The chimney takes its name from jute baron James Cox who later became [[List of Lord Provosts of Dundee|Provost]] of the city]]

The period following World War II was notable for the transformation of the city's economy. While jute still employed one-fifth of the working population, new industries were attracted and encouraged. [[NCR Corporation]] selected Dundee as the base of operations for the UK in late 1945,<ref name="ncr">{{harvnb|NCR Cash Advance}}</ref> primarily because of the lack of damage the city had sustained in the war, good transport links and high productivity from long hours of sunshine. Production started in the year before the official opening of the plant on 11 June 1947. A fortnight after the 10th anniversary of the plant the 250,000th cash register was produced.

By the 1960s, NCR had become the principal employer of the city producing [[cash register]]s, and later [[Automatic Teller Machine|ATMs]], at several of its Dundee plants. The firm developed magnetic-strip readers for cash registers and produced early computers.<ref>{{harvnb|First Dundee computer next year}}</ref> Astral, a Dundee-based firm that manufactured and sold [[refrigerators]] and [[Clothes dryer|spin dryers]] was merged into [[Morphy Richards]] and rapidly expanded to employ over 1,000 people. The development in Dundee of a [[Michelin]] [[tire|tyre]]-production facility helped to absorb the unemployment caused by the decline of the jute industry, particularly with the abolition of the jute control by the [[Board of Trade]] on 30 April 1969.<ref>{{harvnb|General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade 1969}}</ref>

Employment in Dundee changed dramatically during the 1980s with the loss of nearly 10,000 manufacturing jobs due to closure of the shipyards, cessation of carpet manufacturing and the disappearance of the jute trade. To combat growing unemployment and declining economic conditions, Dundee was declared an [[Enterprise Zone]] in January 1984. In 1983, the first [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] [[home computers]] were produced in Dundee by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]]. In the same year the company broke production records, despite a [[sit-in]] by workers protesting against job cuts and plans to demolish one of the factory buildings to make way for a supermarket. Timex closed its Dundee plant in 1993 following an acrimonious six-month [[industrial dispute]].<ref>{{harvnb|Timex pulls the plug on Dundee plant}}; {{harvnb|Scott|2002|pp=163–165}}</ref> The Michelin Tyre factory closed in June 2020, with the loss of 850 jobs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michelin's Dundee factory closes gates for final time |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-53234736 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 October 2020}}</ref>

Between 2009 and 2014 the hardest-hit sectors, in terms of jobs, were Information and Communication, Construction and Manufacturing which each lost around 500 full-time jobs. By contrast, the Professional, Scientific and Technical sector saw an upsurge in jobs in addition to the Business Administration and Support Service sector which increased by approximately 1,000 full-time and 300 part-time jobs in the same six-year period.<ref name="Dundee Economic Profile" /> Gross median weekly earnings of full-time employees in Dundee in 2015 was £523.50; men received £563.40 and women £451.80.<ref name="Dundee Economic Profile" /> Gross weekly pay for all employees in Dundee has increased from £325.00 in 2000 to £380.00 in 2015.<ref name="Dundee Economic Profile" />

[[File:St. Mary's Tower, Dundee - geograph.org.uk - 1204975.jpg|thumb|left|180px|St Mary's Tower, oldest building in Dundee, dating to late 15th century]]

The city and its landscape are dominated by [[Law, Dundee|The Law]] and the [[Firth of Tay]]. The Law, a large hill to the north of the [[City Centre, Dundee|City Centre]] was the site of an [[Iron Age]] [[Hill Fort]], upon which the Law War Memorial, designed by Thomas Braddock, was erected in 1921 to commemorate the fallen of [[World War I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Law Hill War Memorial, Category B listing}}</ref> The waterfront, much altered by [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] in the 19th century, retains several of the docks that once were the hub of the jute and whaling industries, including the Camperdown and Victoria Docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Camperdown Dock, Category A listing}}<br />{{harvnb|Victoria Dock with Pedestrian and Vehicular Swing Bridges, Category A listing}}</ref> The Victoria Dock is the home of the frigate [[HMS Unicorn (1824)|HMS ''Unicorn'']] and the [[North Carr Lightship]], while [[Robert Falcon Scott|Captain Scott]]'s [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']] occupies Craig Pier, from where the ferries to [[Fife]] once sailed.

The oldest building in the city is St Mary's Tower, which dates from the late 15th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Nethergate, City Churches, St Mary's Tower or the Steeple, Category A Listing}}<br />{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=52–54}}</ref> This forms part of the City Churches, which consist of St Clement's Church, dating to 1787–8 and built by Samuel Bell, Old St Paul's and St David's Church, built in 1841–42 by [[William Burn]], and St Mary's Church, rebuilt in 1843–44, also by Burn, following a fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Nethergate, City Churches, St Clement's, or Steeple Church, Category A Listing}}<br />{{harvnb|Nethergate, City Churches, Old St Paul's and St David's, or South Church, Category A Listing}}<br />{{harvnb|Nethergate, City Churches, St Mary's East, or Dundee Parish Church, Category A Listing}}<br />{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=52–54}}</ref> Other significant churches in the city include the Gothic Revival Episcopal Cathedral of St Paul's, built by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]] in 1853 on the former site of Dundee Castle in the High Street,<ref>{{harvnb|150 Nethergate, St Andrew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Including Presbytery and Former Sea Wall to South, Category A Listing}}<br />{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=57}}</ref> and the Catholic [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Dundee|St. Andrew's Cathedral]], built in 1835 by George Mathewson in Nethergate.<ref>

As a result of the destruction suffered during the [[Rough Wooing]], little of the mediaeval city (aside from St Mary's Tower) remains and the earliest surviving domestic structures date from the [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]]. A notable example is the Wishart Arch (or East Port) in Cowgate. It is the last surviving portion of the city walls. Dating from prior to 1548, it owes its continued existence to its association with the Protestant [[martyr]] [[George Wishart]], who is said to have preached to plague victims from the East Port in 1544.<ref>{{harvnb|HES: Wishart Arch (SM164)}}<br />{{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=32–33}}</ref> Another is the building complex on the High Street known as [[Gardyne's Land, Dundee|Gardyne's Land]], parts of which date from around 1560.<ref>{{harvnb|70–73 (Inclusive Nos) High Street, Including Gardyne's Land, Gray's Close and Clock with Model of the Town House}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Dragging a building into the 21st century}}; {{harvnb|Gardyne's Land wins multiple awards}}</ref> [[The Howff]] burial ground in the northern part of the City Centre also dates from this time; it was given to the city by Mary Queen of Scots in 1564, having previously served as the grounds of a [[Franciscan]] abbey.<ref>{{harvnb|Meadowside and Barrack Street, The Howff, Category A listing}}; ; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=50–51}}</ref>

[[File:Claypotts castle 01.jpg|thumb|right|Claypotts Castle, dating from the late 16th century]]

Several castles can be found in Dundee, mostly from the Early Modern Era. The earliest parts of [[Mains Castle]] in Caird Park were built by David Graham in 1562 on the site of a hunting lodge of 1460.<ref>{{harvnb|Caird Park Mains Castle, Category A listing}}, {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=120}}</ref> [[Dudhope Castle]], originally the seat of the Scrymgeour family, dates to the late 16th century and was built on the site of a keep of 1460.<ref>{{harvnb|Dudhope Castle, Category A listing}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|pp=74–75}}</ref> [[Claypotts Castle]], a striking Z plan castle in West Ferry, was built by John Strachan and dates from 1569 to 1588.<ref>{{harvnb|Claypotts Castle, Category A listing}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=103}}</ref> In 1495 [[Broughty Castle]] was built and remained in use as a major defensive structure until 1932, playing a role in the [[Anglo-Scottish Wars]] and the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. The castle stands on a shallow tip projecting into the Firth, alongside two beaches, one of sand, the other of pebbles. The ruins of [[Powrie Castle]], north of Fintry, date from the 16th-century castle north.{{clarify|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{harvnb|Powrie, Old Powrie Castle, Including Adjoining Boundary Wall}}</ref>

North of the City Churches, at the end of Reform Street, lies the [[High School of Dundee]], built in 1829–34 by George Angus in a Greek Revival style.<ref>{{harvnb|Euclid Crescent High School, including Lodge, Gatepiers, Boundary wall and railings, Category A listing}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=47}}</ref> Another school building of note is [[Morgan Academy]] on Forfar Road, built in 1863, designed by [[John Dick Peddie]] in a Dutch Gothic style.<ref>{{harvnb|Forfar Road, Morgan Academy, Main Block and Janitor's House with Terrace, Boundary Walls and Gatepiers, Category A listing}}; {{harvnb|McKean|Walker|1985|p=97}}</ref>

Dundee's industrial history as a centre for textile production is apparent throughout the city. Numerous former jute mills remain standing and while some lay derelict, many have been converted for other uses.

'''Road'''

Dundee is served by the [[A90 road]] which connects the city to the [[M90 motorway|M90]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in the west, and [[Forfar]] and [[Aberdeen]] in the north. The part of the road that is in the city is a [[dual carriageway]] and forms the city's main bypass on its north side, known as the Kingsway.
