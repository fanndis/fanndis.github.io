'''Congressional staff''' are employees of the [[United States Congress]] or individual [[member of Congress|members of Congress]].

==History==
Before the [[American Civil War]], members of Congress did not have staff assistance or even offices, and "most members worked at their desks on the floor."<ref>"Careers, congressional" in ''Encyclopedia of the United States Congress'' (2007), eds. Robert E. Dewhirst & John David Rausch, p. 83.</ref>

In 1891, Congress had a total of 146 staff members: 37 Senate personal staff, 39 Senate committee staff, and 62 House committee staff (37 of whom only worked during congressional sessions).<ref name="Hammond">Susan Webb Hammond, "Life and Work on the Hill: Careers, Norms, Staff, and Informal Caucuses" in Congress Responds to the Twentieth Century'' (Ohio State University Press, 2003: eds. Sunil Ahuja & Robert E. Dewhirst), pp. 73-96.</ref> The House first approved personal staff for Representatives in 1893.<ref name="Hammond"/> By the beginning of the 20th century, congressional staff had become a well-accepted feature of congressional operations.<ref name="Hammond"/> 
 
In 1943, House committees employed 114 staff members, while Senate committees employed 190 staff members.<ref name="Hammond"/> The size of individual members' personal staffs were still relatively small, with the average senator having six staffers and representatives limited to having five staffers.<ref name="Hammond"/> In the [[Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946]], which reformed Congress and greatly reduced the number of [[congressional committee]]s,<ref name="LRA">"Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946" in ''Encyclopedia of the United States Congress'' (2007), eds. Robert E. Dewhirst & John David Rausch, p. 319.</ref> Congress expressly authorized permanent, professional committee staff for the first time.<ref name="Hammond"/> The act provided for a much-needed increase in committee staff, allowing for up to four professional and six clerical staff members for each standing committee, except for the appropriations committees (which had no limitation on the number of staff members).<ref name="Hammond"/><ref name="LRA"/>  The 1946 act also reorganized the [[Library of Congress]] and created the Legislative Reference Service (which later became the [[Congressional Research Service]]) as a distinct entity.<ref name="LRA"/> The size of both personal and committee staff increased considerably after the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act.<ref name="Hammond"/> Following the significant increase in 1947, there was gradual growth in the number of both kinds of staff for about twenty years.<ref name="Hammond"/> Increased staff specialization also occurred during this period of slow growth (i.e., staffers began to be divided into press, legislative, and casework roles).<ref name="Hammond"/>

In the 1970s, there was again a sharp jump in the number of staff.<ref name="Hammond"/> This was a response "in part to increased workloads and in part to confrontation with the executive branch on various issues, including the president's [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment of funds]] and the [[Watergate affair|Watergate crisis]]."<ref name="Hammond"/> The political scientist [[Morris P. Fiorina]], in his book ''Congress: Keystone of the Washington Establishment'', found that the number of congressional staff more than doubled between 1960 and 1974. The increase was mostly in district or state offices; the percentage of congressional staff who worked in a district office went from 14% in 1960 to 34% in 1974.<ref>"Offices, district" in ''Encyclopedia of the United States Congress'' (2007), eds. Robert E. Dewhirst & John David Rausch.</ref>

In the 1970s and 1990s, "staff numbers generally held level and increases were held down. After 1995, staff numbers actually decreased slightly."<ref name="Hammond"/>

==Types of staff members==
[[C-SPAN]] classifies staff members into five categories:<ref name="C-SPAN">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150617104805/https://legacy.c-span.org/questions/weekly35.asp C-SPAN's Capitol Questions], November 15, 2000.</ref>

*''Personal staff'', who work for individual members of Congress
*''Committee staff'', who serve either the majority or minority on [[congressional committees]]
*''Leadership staff,'' who work for the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|speaker]], [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|majority and minority leaders]], and [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|majority and minority whips]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority and minority leaders]] and [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|assistant majority and minority leaders]] (whips) in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]
*''Institutional staff'', including majority or minority party floor staff and non-partisan staff such as the [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]], [[Architect of the Capitol]] (facilities and maintenance employees), and legislative clerks.
*''Support agency staff'', non-partisan employees of the [[Congressional Research Service]] (CRS), [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO), and [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).

In the year 2000, there were approximately 11,692 personal staff, 2,492 committee staff, 274 leadership staff, 5,034 institutional staff, and 3,500 GAO employees, 747 CRS employees, and 232 CBO employees.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>

==Personal staff==
In 2000, the average Representative hired 14 staff members, while the average Senator hired 34. In 2000, Representatives had a limit of 18 [[Full-time job|full-time]] and four [[Part-time job|part-time]] staffers; Senators had no limit on staff.<ref name="C-SPAN"/> Budgets for staff were determined by the population of the state; Senators from [[California]], the most populous state, get more money for staff than Senators from [[Wyoming]], the least populous state. Members can choose how to distribute staff between their [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] office and their United States congressional district home office or offices.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>

The Congressional Management Foundation (CMF), a Washington-based research and management nonprofit organization, conducted surveys on congressional salaries. The table below gives average annual salaries in the year 2000.<ref name="C-SPAN"/> Also below is a list of annual House salaries and the number of staffers with particular titles in 2009 as calculated by [[Daniel Schuman]] of the [[Sunlight Foundation]]. The numbers are drawn from the House of Representative's Statement of Disbursements of the House, July 1, 2009 through September 30, 2009.

Quarterly earnings were multiplied by four to obtain annual salaries, so the data omits [[Performance-related pay|bonuses]] and does not account for staffers who did not work the entire quarter; staffers who carried different titles for the same job, or staffers changing jobs during the quarter. The chart also omits committee staff and a number of job titles that could not easily be classified or had less than 50 people.<ref>Daniel Schuman, "[http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2009/12/02/whats-the-average-salary-of-house-staff/ What's The Average Salary of House Staff?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606191239/http://www.theopenhouseproject.com/2009/12/02/whats-the-average-salary-of-house-staff/ |date=2010-06-06 }}" (December 2, 2009).

Not all offices have the same [[Organizational chart|type of organization]], and different titles may be used for substantially similar jobs. Common jobs are:

* ''[[Chief of staff]]'': Highest-ranking and usually highest-paid legislative staffer in the office of a [[member of Congress]], usually the [[chief operating officer]] of the office, reporting directly to the member. Oversees a dozen or more other employees. Some chiefs of staffs are charged with personnel decisions and policy initiatives. From time to time a chief of staff may be based out of a [[List of United States congressional districts|district]] office, but they are almost always found at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] ("on the "[[Capitol Hill|Hill]]"). Chiefs of staff are usually very experienced political staffers, often with years of prior work on the Hill, or are personal friends of Members. Some chiefs of staff were previously [[campaign manager]]s.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>
* ''Deputy chief of staff'': Reports to the chief of staff.
* ''[[Legislative assistant|Legislative director]]'' (LD), ''senior legislative assistant'' (SLA), or ''legislative coordinator'' (LC) is a person who oversees legislative staff, including all legislative assistants and correspondents. There is usually one in each office.<ref name="Dirksen"/>
* ''[[Legislative assistant|Legislative correspondent]]'' (LC): Responsible for drafting letters in response to constituents' comments and questions and also generally responsible for a few legislative issues. According to the Dirksen Congressional Center, most House offices have one or two, while senators have three to five, depending on their state's population.<ref name=Dirksen>"[http://www.dirksencenter.org/print_expert_communicating.htm How to Communicate Effectively with Congress]," Dirksen Congressional Center.</ref>
* ''[[Press secretary]]'' or ''[[Director of communications|communications director]]'': Responsible for Member's relationship with media; is the liaison for the local and national press; issues [[press release]]s.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>
* ''[[Caseworker (politics)|Caseworkers]]'' or ''constituent services representatives'': Responsible for helping [[Electoral district|constituents]] deal with problems relating to [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]]. For example, caseworkers help individuals secure [[veterans' benefits]], aid with [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and resolve [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] issues.<ref name="Dirksen"/> Caseworkers may also provide [[mediation]] services to constituents and obtain government information and publications.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>

==Committee staff==
Each congressional committee has a staff, of varying sizes. Appropriations for committee staff are made in annual legislative appropriations bills. Majority and minority members hire their own staff except on two [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committees]] in each house - the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]] and [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] in the House and the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Select Committee on Ethics]] and [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] in the Senate. These committees have a single staff.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>

In 2000, House committees had an average of 68 staff and Senate committees an average of 46. Committee staff includes both staff directors, committee [[counsel]], committee [[detective|investigator]]s, press secretaries, chief clerks and office managers, schedules, documents clerks, and assistant.<ref name="C-SPAN"/>

==Safety and security==
Like members of Congress, congressional staff have occasionally been the targets of violence or threats of violence.<ref name="2011CRS">R. Eric Petersen, Jennifer E. Manning & Erin Hemlin, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41609.pdf Violence Against Members of Congress and Their Staff: Selected Examples and Congressional Responses] (January 25, 2011).</ref><ref>Emily Goodin, [http://thehill.com/capital-living/cover-stories/295415-lawmaker-security Members have 24-hour protection at Capitol but home is a different story], ''The Hill'' (April 23, 2013).</ref><ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/georgia/articles/2017-03-06/man-accused-of-threats-to-congressmans-staff-due-in-court Man Accused of Threats to Congressman's Staff Denied Bond], Associated Press (March 6, 2017).</ref> Between 1789 and 2011, there were five incidents affecting some congressional staff alongside members of Congress.<ref name="2011CRS"/> The following recorded incidents of violence against congressional staff have taken place:

* In 1905, "Doc" Thompkins, private secretary to Representative [[John M. Pinckney]] of Texas, was wounded in a riot in which the congressman was slain.<ref name="2011CRS"/>
* In 1935, Earle Christenberry, secretary to Senator [[Huey Long|Huey Pierce Long]] of Louisiana, opened a [[parcel bomb]] (which did not detonate).<ref name="2011CRS"/>
* In 1978, [[Jackie Speier]], then a staffer for Representative [[Leo Ryan|Leo Joseph Ryan]] of California, was seriously injured by a gunshot wound in an attack in [[Guyana]], in which [[Jonestown|Ryan was assassinated]].<ref name="2011CRS"/>
* [[1998 United States Capitol shooting incident]]: In 1998, two Capitol Police officers were killed by a gunman.<ref name="2011CRS"/>
* [[2011 Tucson shooting]]: In 2011, a gunman [[Jared Lee Loughner]] attacked a public event being held by Representative Gabrielle Giffords of [[Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. Six people were killed, including Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman, a member of Gifford's staff. Thirteen others were injured, including Giffords and two of her staff members, [[Ron Barber]] and Pamela Simon.<ref name="2011CRS"/>
* [[2017 Congressional baseball shooting]]: In 2017, a gunman attacked Republican congressmen and others who were practicing in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] for the [[Congressional Baseball Game]]. House Majority Whip [[Steve Scalise]] and several others were wounded, including two Capitol Police officers; a staff member for Representative Roger Williams; and a former congressional staff member and lobbyist.<ref>Michael D.
