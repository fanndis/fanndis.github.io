{{PoliticsGermany}}

The '''president of the Bundestag''' ({{lang-de|Präsident des Deutschen Bundestages}} or {{lang|de|Bundestagspräsident}}) presides over the sessions of the [[Bundestag]], the federal parliament of [[Germany]], with functions similar to that of a [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] in other countries. In the [[German order of precedence]], the office is ranked second after the [[President of Germany|president]] and before the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|chancellor]]. 

The current office-holder is [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], who was elected during the first session of the 19th Bundestag on 24 October 2017.

== Election and customs ==
The president of the Bundestag is elected during the constituent session of each election period after the [[Elections in Germany|federal elections]] or in a later session, if the office has fallen vacant, by all members of the Bundestag. The president has to be a member of the Bundestag. Until the election of the president, the session is chaired by the [[father of the House]], the so-called ''Alterspräsident''. Since 2017, this has been the longest serving member of the Bundestag; in 1949-2017, it was the oldest member of the Bundestag by age.<ref name="bt_cons">Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/02electbg/04constmet.html The Bundestag's constituent sitting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206133723/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/02electbg/04constmet.html |date=2006-12-06 }}</ref>

Usually, the president of the Bundestag is a member of the largest parliamentary group. This custom had emerged already in times of the [[Weimar Republic]], but this is not required by law. The term ends with the election period, and there is no provision for an early removal. The term of the president can only end prematurely if they resign the position, leaves the Bundestag or dies. They can be reelected in the next election period provided they become a member of the Bundestag again.

Traditionally, the president of the Bundestag is elected uncontested. The only exception so far has been in 1954 after the unexpected death of [[Hermann Ehlers]]. [[Ernst Lemmer]] competed with the "official" [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] candidate, [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]], and lost after three ballots with a difference of 14 votes (204 for Gerstenmaier, 190 for Lemmer, 15 abstentions).

== Presidium of the Bundestag ==
{{anchor|Vice Presidents}}{{main|Presidium of the Bundestag}}
The president of the Bundestag has several deputies, the vice presidents of the Bundestag ({{lang|de|Vizepräsident des Deutschen Bundestages}} or {{lang|de|Bundestagsvizepräsident}}), who are supplied by the other parliamentary groups. The number of vice presidents was not fixed in the Bundestag's ''Geschäftsordnung'' ([[rules of order]]) until 1994, when it was decided that each parliamentary group<!--"Fraktion", nicht "Gruppe"--> should be represented by at least one vice president.<ref name="bt_cons" /> However, no [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] candidate for Vice President has been elected for the [[List of members of the 19th Bundestag|19th Bundestag]]. Together, the president and the vice presidents make up the [[Presidium of the Bundestag]].

As of September 2019, the current vice presidents of the Bundestag are:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bundestag.de/en/parliament/presidium |title=German Bundestag - The Presidium |website=German Bundestag |language=en |access-date=2019-09-04}}</ref>

* [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]] (CDU/CSU)
* [[Thomas Oppermann]] (SPD)
* [[Wolfgang Kubicki]] (FDP)
* [[Petra Pau]] ([[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]])
* [[Claudia Roth]] ([[Alliance '90/The Greens|Bündnis 90/Die Grünen]])

==Legal background==
The legal foundation for the office is [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#GGengl_000P40 Article 40] of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] which states that the Bundestag elects a president and vice presidents and is to give itself rules of order. Due to a 1952 [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decision, the ''Geschäftsordnung'' has to be enacted afresh in every election period, but usually the old rules are reenacted without change.<ref name="bt go">{{in lang|de}} Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/parlament/funktion/gesetze/go_erl/gescho02.html Erläuterungen zur Geschäftsordnung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527132539/http://www.bundestag.de/parlament/funktion/gesetze/go_erl/gescho02.html |date=2007-05-27 }}</ref> The ''Geschäftsordnung'' specifies the duties of the president of the Bundestag and his vice presidents as well as their number.

==Duties==
The president's most important duty is to chair the sessions of the Bundestag. The president determines the order of speakers and opens and closes the debates, and ensures that debates take place in an orderly fashion.<ref name="bt debates">Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/04plenar/01debates.html Debates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206132748/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/04plenar/01debates.html |date=2006-12-06 }}</ref> In the case of grave disruption, they may exclude a member of parliament for up to 30 session days.<ref name="bt pr">Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/03organs/01presid.html President and Vice-Presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003131531/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/03organs/01presid.html |date=2006-10-03 }}</ref> All draft legislation initiated by the Federal Government, the Bundestag or the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] is addressed to the president, as well as all submissions and petitions from within or addressed to the Bundestag. The president of the Bundestag also chairs the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]], which manages the internal affairs of the Bundestag.<ref name="bt ce">Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/03organs/03elders/01elderinf.html Council of Elders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505004552/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/03organs/03elders/01elderinf.html |date=2005-05-05 }}</ref> For the election of a new [[President of Germany|Federal president]], the president of the Bundestag convenes and chairs the [[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]].<ref name="bt fc">Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/05mixinst/mixinst1.html The Federal Convention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827222808/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/orga/05mixinst/mixinst1.html |date=2006-08-27 }}</ref>

Additionally, the president receives the statements of account of the political parties, monitors party financing and regulates campaign cost reimbursement. The president also has police power over the premises of the parliament and oversees its police force, can veto any [[search and seizure]] there to protect the independence of the parliament,<ref name="bt polizei">{{in lang|de}} Deutscher Bundestag, [http://www.bundestag.de/parlament/verwalt/polizei/ges_grundlage.html Gesetzliche Grundlage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527132517/http://www.bundestag.de/parlament/verwalt/polizei/ges_grundlage.html |date=2007-05-27 }} für die Polizei beim Bundestag</ref> and acts as the employer of the Bundestag's public servants.
