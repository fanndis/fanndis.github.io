'''Kezia Alexandra Ross Dugdale''' (born 28 August 1981) is a Scottish politician who served as [[Scottish Labour#Leader of the Scottish Labour Party|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] from [[2015 Scottish Labour leadership election|2015]] to [[2017 Scottish Labour leadership election|2017]]. A former member of the [[Scottish Labour|Scottish Labour Party]] and [[Co-operative Party]], she was a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the [[Lothian (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothian]] region from [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]] to 2019.

Born in [[Aberdeen]] and raised in [[Dundee]], Dugdale studied Law at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and Policy Studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where she was a campaigns and welfare adviser. After leaving university, she worked as an election agent, political researcher and parliamentary officer. She was elected at the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]] on the [[Lothian (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothian]] regional list and became [[Scottish Labour#Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party|Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] in [[2014 Scottish Labour leadership election|2014]].

Dugdale was elected [[Scottish Labour#Leader of the Scottish Labour Party|Leader of the Scottish Labour Party]] in the [[2015 Scottish Labour leadership election|2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership election]]. She led Scottish Labour into the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], where the party finished third behind the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) and [[Scottish Conservatives]] and Dugdale failed to be elected to the [[Edinburgh Eastern (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Eastern]] constituency, once again being elected on the Lothian regional list. During the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], the party held their previously sole seat and gained a further six seats from the SNP. She resigned as leader in August 2017 to "pass on the baton" to a successor who would lead the party into the [[2021 Scottish Parliament election]].

After leaving frontbench politics, Dugdale worked as a columnist and appeared as a contestant on the seventeenth series of ITV reality show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (British TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in November 2017.

[[File:Kezia Dugdale 2016.png|left|thumb|Dugdale back in the Scottish Parliament following her defeat in the 2016 election]]
Dugdale led Scottish Labour into the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]]. Dugdale wanted to re-affirm Scottish Labour's core beliefs and convey to the electorate what the party stood for. She focused her campaign on a proposal to increase income tax to tackle underfunding of services by the [[Scottish National Party]] government, particularly in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/27/scottish-labour-50p-top-tax-rate-heart-election-campaign-kezia-dugdale|title=Scottish Labour puts 50p top tax rate at heart of election campaign|last=editor|first=Severin Carrell Scotland|date=2016-04-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Scottish Conservatives]]' ambitions were to oppose Scottish independence and push [[Ruth Davidson]] as an effective leader opposed to the SNP's governmental agenda.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-scotland-36037531|title=At-a-glance: Scottish Conservative manifesto|date=2016-04-13|access-date=2019-10-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> The results put Scottish Labour behind both the SNP and Scottish Conservatives, with the party falling into third place from second.

Dugdale was once again returned as an additional member for the Lothian region, having failed to win the [[Edinburgh Eastern (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Eastern]] constituency from the SNP by 5,087 votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2016/scotland/results|title=Scottish Parliament election 2016 results|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://planetradio.co.uk/mfr/uk/news/kezia-dugdale-backed-remain-labour-leader-despite-vote-collapse/|title=Kezia Dugdale backed to remain Labour leader despite vote collapse|date=2016-05-06|website=MFR|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

On 29 June 2016, Dugdale called for Jeremy Corbyn to resign from his position as Leader of the Labour Party, after 174-to-40 Labour MPs voted no-confidence in his leadership.

Dugdale was Leader of the Scottish Labour Party during the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. In the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|previous general election in 2015]], the party lost 40 of its 41 seats in what was a [[2015 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|landslide victory for the SNP]], who won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland.

On 29 August 2017, Dugdale resigned as leader of [[Scottish Labour]] with immediate effect, commenting that it was time to "pass on the baton" to someone else.
