'''The City of Fairfield''' is a suburban community located in both [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]] and [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Ohio]].  Fairfield is located approximately 25 miles north of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] and is situated on the east bank of the [[Great Miami River]].  The population was 42,510 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].  Incorporated in 1955 from portions of [[Fairfield Township, Butler County, Ohio|Fairfield Township]] it includes the former hamlets of Symmes Corner (named for Celadon Symmes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Butler County Towns and How They Obtained Their Names|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/903978/name_origins_in_butler_co_ohio/|newspaper=The Journal News|date=January 27, 1923|page=11|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|access-date = August 23, 2014 }} {{Open access}}</ref>), Fair Play, Furmandale and Stockton. The Fairfield City School District is one of the largest in Ohio and serves both the City of Fairfield and Fairfield Township.

==History==
{{prose|section|date=April 2015}}
{{recentism|date=February 2016}}

===Early Fairfield===
Prior to European settlement the Fairfield area was home to several Indian tribes, most prominently the [[Shawnee (tribe)|Shawnee]] and the [[Miami tribe|Miami]].  The prehistoric [[Hopewell culture|Hopewell]] and [[Adena culture|Adena]] peoples constructed numerous [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] around the city, though most were unwittingly removed by early settlers in order to accommodate farm fields.

The area that is now Fairfield was part of the original [[Symmes Purchase]].  Also known as the [[Miami Purchase]], the region was acquired by Judge [[John Cleves Symmes]] from the [[Continental Congress]] in 1788 and included much of the land between the [[Little Miami River|Little Miami]] and [[Great Miami River|Great Miami]] rivers that became the present day counties of [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton]], [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]], and [[Warren County, Ohio|Warren]].

As the area was settled [[hamlets]] developed to serve the surrounding countryside.  Judge Symmes' great-nephew, Celadon Symmes,<ref>[http://www.usbiographies.org/biographies/read.php?1327,17246 Celadon Symmes]{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> was the founder and first settler of Symmes Corner.  Located at the intersection of Pleasant Avenue and Nilles Road it now serves as Fairfield's town center.  
The [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of Fair Play was located on the east bank of the [[Great Miami River]].  It was known for its mills, including Ohio's first paper mill.   The community was destroyed by a flood in the late 1800s.  Today the Miami Chapel Cemetery and the Fair Play School are some of the few remaining vestiges of the village.

In the 1850s, the [[Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1846â€“1917)|Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railway]] (today [[CSX]]) was extended through Fairfield, fostering the development of several communities.  The villages of Schencks Station and Stockton were established along the rail line.  Schencks Station was located near the present-day intersection of Symmes Road and State Route 4 and was named for local landowner Aaron Schenck.  Stockton could be found at the crossroads of State Route 4 and Seward Road.  Originally known as Jones Station, the village provided area farms with necessities including a smithy, a general store, churches, and a school.  In between the two communities was the village of Furmandale; also known as Schnapstown or Snaptown.  Located at the current intersection of Winton and Nilles roads, the community took its name from Nathaniel Furman who operated a private school for girls within the community. A few miles to the east of these communities was the [[Miami-Erie Canal]] which, prior to the arrival of the railroad, enabled early settlers to move their commodities to market.<ref>''Fairfield, Ohio'' by Esther R. Benzing, Porter Printing</ref>

===Growth & Incorporation===
Fairfield remained a quiet, primarily agricultural community until the mid-20th century.  As the [[Hamilton, Ohio|City of Hamilton]] grew its industry expanded south into present day Fairfield.  [[Fisher Body]], a manufacturing division of General Motors, established a plant at the northeast corner of State Route 4 and Symmes Road near the location of what was Schencks Station.  During the same timeframe Fairfield started to experience residential growth, initially as a southern [[suburb]] of Hamilton.  In 1954 a group of citizens wishing to avoid [[Municipal annexation|annexation]] into Hamilton organized an incorporation campaign.  The initial petition was to create a [[municipal corporation]] from [[Fairfield Township, Butler County, Ohio|Fairfield Township]] in its entirety. A [[referendum]] was held in April 1954 with incorporation failing by a vote of 1,219 to 831.  A renewed effort focused on those [[electoral precinct|precincts]] that voted affirmatively.  A second referendum was held in July 1954 with incorporation winning by a vote of 738 to 216.  Fairfield was established as a [[statutory]] [[Village (United States)|village]] in 1955 with a [[mayor-council]] form of government.<ref>''Fairfield at Creation'' Robert F. Wessel, Writer's Club Press</ref>

The next 30 years represented a period of rapid growth for the community.  By 1960 the village had exceeded a population of 5,000 and was reclassified as a statutory [[City (United States)|city]].  The Interstate 275 beltway was constructed around [[Cincinnati]] in the late 1970s.  The new road provided easy access to Fairfield from the northern Cincinnati suburbs, thus providing an additional high quality transportation route.  This, in turn, drove substantial commercial and residential investment in the community.

===Form of Government===
The city's form-of-government was a subject of debate almost from its inception.  In 1961 a charter commission was formed to study the issue.  After due consideration the commission recommended adoption of a [[charter]] with the [[Council manager|council-administrator]] form of government, but the initiative was rejected by the voters.   The question resurfaced in 1971, but did not progress beyond council conversations.  In 1976 the issue gained momentum with form-of-government becoming an issue in council campaigns.  In 1978 a charter commission was established and charged with framing a charter that would establish a council-administrator form-of-government.  The city's second charter commission spent eight months researching the charters of various Ohio communities.  A referendum was held on June 5, 1979 in which the issue was approved by a vote of 1,423 to 1,265.  The council-administrator (later [[council-manager]]) form went into effect on January 1, 1980.<ref>''Fairfield, Ohio From the Pioneers to Our Golden Years'' Kinder, Crouch, Kursman & Morsch</ref>

===Growing Pains & Stabilization===
After the unprecedented residential growth of the 1970s, the need for balanced growth became evident.

General Motors announced that the Hamilton-Fairfield [[Chevrolet]] [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] Canada Group, known as the [[Fisher Body]] plant, would be phased out in the first quarter of 1989. The effect of the plant closing was a loss of 2,500 jobs and 28 percent of the city's income tax revenue, amounting to $1.7 million.

In addition to that challenge, the city also dealt with needs for flood control, road improvement and essential services.

The City regained economic balance in the 1990s and experienced wide, diverse business development. With a population of 39,729 at the beginning of 1990, the city's explosive population growth had begun to slow, allowing it to focus on quality development of remaining residential and commercial areas. During this time, Fairfield updated and expanded its [[sanitary sewers]], established [[detention basins]] for better [[stormwater]] control, continued to address road improvements, and began planning for a community Town Center.

===Contemporary Fairfield===
Fairfield today is a complete community offering a broad range of housing options and a diverse economy.  The city provides dynamic municipal services including water and wastewater utilities, a [[Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies|CALEA]] accredited police department, [[NRPA]] accredited parks & recreation department and [[American Public Works Association|APWA]] accredited public works and public utilities departments.  It holds an Aa1 [[Bond rating|municipal bond rating]] due to the city's sound financial forecast. Fairfield is strategically positioned to build on its strong foundation, sustain its neighborhoods and business community, and offer quality of life facilities, services and programs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fairfield-city.org/533/History-of-Fairfield |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216150118/https://www.fairfield-city.org/533/History-of-Fairfield |archive-date=2019-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|21.06|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|20.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.12|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=2012-01-25 }}</ref>  The Butler County line serves as Fairfield's southern corporate boundary with a small portion of the City extending into Hamilton County.  This portion contains no population.  The city is bounded on the north by the City of Hamilton and the eponymously named Fairfield Township; the east by West Chester and Fairfield townships; the south by the cities of Springdale and Forest Park as well as Springfield and Colerain townships; and on the west by Fairfield and Ross townships. 
The city is bisected by a major rail line and is served by several interstate, federal and state highways which provide for excellent access.  This transportation infrastructure has contributed greatly to Fairfield's economic success.

Most of Fairfield sits on top of the Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer; one of the largest underground [[reservoirs]] in the [[Midwest]].  The [[aquifer]] provides a clean and safe source of drinking water for communities up and down the course of the Great Miami River.  The cities of Fairfield, Hamilton and [[Cincinnati]] operate water production facilities within Fairfield corporate boundaries; all of which draw from the aquifer.<ref>Hamilton to New Baltimore Groundwater Consortium; dayton daily news</ref>

==Government==
The City of Fairfield is a [[charter]] municipality and operates under the [[council-manager]] form of government, combining the strong political leadership of elected officials with the professional expertise of an appointed [[city manager]].  Legislative authority under this form of government is vested in [[City Council]], the body that is chosen by the electorate. Council hires the manager to serve as the city's full-time [[chief executive officer]]. Fairfield City Council consists of seven members, three of who are elected [[at-large]] with the remainder elected by ward. Council members serve staggered, four-year terms with the ward members running together followed two years later by the at-large members and the [[Mayor]].  The Mayor, who is directly elected and also serves a four-year term, acts as the official and ceremonial head of the government and presides over all meetings of Council. Mayoral duties include the right to introduce legislation and to take part in discussion of all matters before Council with the right to vote in the event of a tie.  The Mayor appoints the chairs of the various council committees and issues official [[proclamations]].  Council, in addition to appointing the city manager and passing legislation, approves the annual operating, capital and tax [[budgets]], contracts in the city's name, levies taxes, appoints board and commission members, and appoints the law director and the clerk of council.

The city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city, implements Council action, hires and oversees the staff, prepares and implements the annual operating and capital budgets and keeps the elected officials advised of the city's financial sustainability.

The Fairfield Municipal Court is part of the city from a budgetary perspective, but otherwise operates as a completely autonomous agency.  Municipal court judges in Ohio are elected to six-year terms on a nonpartisan judicial ballot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/JudSystem/|title=Judicial System Structure|website=www.supremecourt.ohio.gov|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>

==Economy==
Fairfield has a highly diversified economy without a dominant industry, though the city's top two employers are insurance companies.  The corporate headquarters of insurance company [[Cincinnati Financial]] is located in Fairfield.<ref name="fairfield-city.org">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fairfield-city.org/devservices/top10.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304040845/http://www.fairfield-city.org/devservices/top10.cfm |archive-date=2017-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[Jungle Jim's International Market]] is a regional tourism destination featuring food and beverage items from all over the world.  Jim Boniminio started the market in 1974 as a fruit stand.  A reluctant planning commission approved his request on the condition that he would ultimately construct a permanent storefront. Today Jungle Jim's International Market has 50,000 weekly shoppers and annual sales of nearly $100 million.

==Recreation==
Fairfield operates an extensive parks and recreation system with over 500 acres of parkland.  Harbin Park is the city's largest at 230 acres.  It offers shelter rentals, a large playground, mountain bike trails, a paved trail for walking and biking, basketball and pickleball courts and a soccer field.  It annually hosts the Cincinnati Cyclocross; a cycling competition spread over three days and three Greater Cincinnati communities.  Harbin also plays host to the city's Red White & Kaboom fireworks show held annually on July 3 in celebration of Independence Day.  Marsh Lake Park was recently acquired from the Martinâ€“Marietta company.  The city had, since the early 1990s, leased the eastern portion of the property from [[Martinâ€“Marietta]].  Per the terms of an agreement between the city and the company the property was deeded to Fairfield upon the cessation of mining operations in 2017.  The park is one of the system's crown jewels with a 60-acre quarry lake that is regularly stocked with fish.  Kayaks and other non-motorized watercraft will make their debut on the lake in the summer of 2019.  Marsh Lake Park totals 220 acres, though much of it remains passive and undeveloped.  Huffman Park is one of the city's newest recreational facilities.  It was donated, developed and dedicated in 2012 in memory of Fairfield residents Anna and Harold Huffman who owned and lived on the property for more than 50 years.
