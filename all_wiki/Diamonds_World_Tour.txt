''[[The Globe and Mail]]'''s Brad Wheeler in a review of one of the [[Toronto]] shows wrote, "Rihanna's star is hot and still on the rise&nbsp;– Beyoncé's [[I Am... Sasha Fierce|Sasha Fierce]] is now Sasha Fears."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/rihanna-rocks-without-apology-at-toronto-concert/article9939953/|title=Rihanna rocks without apology at Toronto concert|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|last=Wheeler|first=Brad|date=March 19, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Natasha Paolini of HipHopCanada stated, "Since the last time I saw Rihanna live in concert, it was obvious that she has grown and matured as an artist and as an individual. I love the way she performed on this tour, she was sexy, charming and even vulnerable at times. With the exception of minor vocal slip-ups, Rihanna put on a stellar show that was tasteful, raw and fun."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2013/03/rihanna-slays-the-stage-on-diamonds-tour-at-the-acc-in-toronto-review/|title=Rihanna Slays the Stage on Diamonds Tour at The ACC in Toronto Review|publisher=HipHopCanada|last=Paolini|first=Natasha|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213071016/http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2013/03/rihanna-slays-the-stage-on-diamonds-tour-at-the-acc-in-toronto-review/|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Mikael Wood of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, that "the singer inhabited each of her characters with total conviction, portraying a lifelike complexity often lost on A-list pop peers such as [[Katy Perry]] and Beyoncé."<ref name="la times"/> Wood praised the performance particular the rendition of "Stay" stating that the halter-top pantsuit she wore accompanied with the minimal arrangement of the song remind him of [[Diana Ross]] in her middle career.<ref name="la times">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-rihanna-20130410|title=Rihanna's many personalities take center stage for Diamonds tour|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Wood|first=Mikael|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> Rick Florino of [[Artistdirect]] also praised the show in Los Angeles and wrote, "In fact, she's one of the last real rockstars left, and she's owning the title like a true champ. Every tour Rihanna launches, she still manages to step up her game and best the last one. Of course, that's tradition for any rockstar worth his or her salt, but she's keeping live music exciting with mind-blowing production and tight performances."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/live-review-rihanna-the-staples-center-los-angeles/10446822|title=Live Review: Rihanna&nbsp;— Staples Center, Los Angeles|publisher=[[Artistdirect]]|last=Florino|first=Rick|date=April 9, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref>

Brenna Rushing of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' similarly as other reviewers wrote, "Rihanna took full control of the surprisingly simple stage, dripping in sex appeal and belting knockout notes."<ref name="dallas show review">{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/entertainment/music/headlines/20131112-rihanna-drips-sex-appeal-delivers-powerful-energy-in-dallas-concert.ece|title=Rihanna drips sex appeal, delivers powerful energy in Dallas concert|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|last=Rushing|first=Brenna|date=November 12, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref> She further stated that, "Rihanna treated the audience to rump-shaking sways and dance moves only a few pop stars can manage. But make no mistake, this sensual style wasn’t a mask for her performance; it was just an enhancement."<ref name="dallas show review"/> Rushing noted that if the fast club songs didn't catch the audience, then the ballad must did and praised their rendition. In a review of the [[Houston]] show, Joey Guerra of ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'' stated "Rihanna sometimes emits a cold energy in videos and on record. But she comes alive onstage. There was energy and intent in every vocal lick, every hip swivel, every kick in thigh-high white boots. And that was before she even got to the big hits."<ref name="Houston review">{{cite news|url=http://blog.chron.com/rantandrave/2013/11/rihanna-sparkles-at-toyota-center/#18021101=0|title=Rihanna sparkles at Toyota Center|work=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|last=Guerra|first=Joey|date=November 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref> Notably, Guerra praised the performances of "What Now" and the ballad set noting that nothing felt over choreographed as one moment led to another.<ref name="Houston review"/> Despite all the positive reviews during the North American leg, James Reed of [[Boston.com]] criticized Rihanna's tardiness to the Boston and the overtly use of backing tracks. However, he concluded with other critics that the ballads were her strongest moments of the night.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/culturedesk/2013/05/07/rihanna-gives-boston-fans-too-little-too-late/UWi5uepftUY45B3H1zSuwM/story.html|title=Rihanna gives Boston fans too little too late|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|last=Reed|first=James|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>

=== Europe and Oceania ===

Hannah Britt of British ''[[Daily Express]]'' reviewed Rihanna's concert at Twickenham Stadium in London stating, "Her vocals during the beautiful 'Stay' were bang on and, as a performer, she is simply captivating to watch. Whether thrusting her crotch towards the crowd, or simply standing smiling down at them, when Rihanna is in front of you, you can’t take your eyes off her. Whether you agree with her morals or not, one cannot deny that the woman knows how to own a stage."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/408910/Rihanna-review-Twickenham-stadium|title=Rihanna review, Twickenham stadium|work=[[Daily Express]]|last=Britt|first=Hannah|date=June 20, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref> Robert Copsey of [[Digital Spy]] gave the concert three out of five stars and concluded that although the concert was a "nonetheless a well-honed show that had its moments" including a 70,000 crowd singing "We Found Love" and "Only Girl (In the World)", it lacked shocking moments and spontaneity that "let her down".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a490504/rihanna-and-david-guetta-live-at-londons-twickenham-stadium-review.html|title=Rihanna and David Guetta live at London's Twickenham Stadium&nbsp;— review|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Copsey|first=Robert|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'''s gave the first show in [[Manchester Arena]] four out of five stars and wrote, "Not only is Rihanna a rockstar, and a showbiz veteran at the tender age of 25, but a legend in her own right."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music/review-rihanna-at-manchester-arena-4307497|title=Review: Rihanna at Manchester Arena|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Katie|date=June 12, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref> In a review of the show in Cardiff, Wales, Elena Cresci of ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' wrote that Rihanna commands the performance as well as her multi-platinum selling colleagues and also knows what her fans want and gives it to them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/music/rihanna-cardiff-review-rihannas-concert-4291070|title=Rihanna Cardiff: Review of Rihanna's concert at the Millennium Stadium|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|last=Cresci|first=Elena|date=June 10, 2013|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>
