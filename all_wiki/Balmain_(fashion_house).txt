==History==
Balmain was born in 1914 in France. His father owned a [[drapery]] business and his mother and sister owned a fashion boutique where he often worked after his father's death in 1921. He attended the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1933–1934, with intent to study architecture but instead ended up spending the majority of his time designing dresses.  After working for [[atelier]] Robert Piquet as a freelance artist and spending time with [[Edward Molyneux]], he left school to work for Molyneux. In the late 1930s, he served in the French air force and the army pioneer corps. After peace was declared, he worked at [[Lucien Lelong]] and opened his own fashion house under his name<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malloftheemirates.com/shopping/fashion-men/balmain|title=Shopping's never been better, Mall of the Emirates|first=Mall of the|last=Emirates|access-date=2016-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505002016/http://www.malloftheemirates.com/Shopping/fashion-men/balmain|archive-date=2019-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> at 44, rue François 1<sup>er</sup> in Paris. He released his first collection in October 1945 and his first fragrance, Jolie Madame in 1949.<ref>[http://www.vogue.fr/thevoguelist/balmain-1/318 “Balmain.” Vogue English.

In the period following [[World War II]], Pierre Balmain was "a king of French fashion" and outfitted stars including [[Ava Gardner]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]], the Nicaraguan first lady [[Hope Portocarrero]],<ref name="vogue">[[Yaeger, Lynn]]. "Balmain Nouveau." ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' (October 2007), p. 254–256.</ref> and [[Queen Sirikit of Thailand]].  Marlene Dietrich wore Balmain clothes that she selected in "No Highway in the Sky" (1951).

==Successors==
After Balmain's death in 1982, the house was led by Erik Mortensen, described by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' as "Pierre Balmain's right hand".<ref name="vogue" /> Mortensen had joined the house to work as Balmain's assistant in 1951. After succeeding Balmain, Eric Mortensen worked to maintain the brand aesthetic in the ever-living world of couture while still maintaining the progressive spirit of creativity in the fashion industry. The Balmain house recruits Peggy Huynh Kinh in 1982 to provide artistic direction for women's ready-to-wear and women's and home accessories license studios.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=27 December 1986|title=Isabelle Adjani wearing a Peggy Huynh Kinh for Balmain dress|journal=Jour de France|issn=0022-5681}}</ref> Eric Mortensen won two Golden Thimble awards for his haute couture collections, one for the Autumn/Winter 83/84 and one for the Autumn/Winter 87/88.  He left the house in 1990. After his departure, designer [[Hervé Pierre]] took over until 1992 working as director of ready-to-wear and haute couture.

Possibly the most influential designer to take over at Balmain was [[Oscar de la Renta]], who led the house between 1993 and 2002.<ref name="vogue" />  Already a fashion veteran before joining Balmain, De la Renta brought a famous face to the brand Balmain. He lived in New York City most of his life, although he was born in the [[Dominican Republic]] and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1971. He fit into the Balmain design aesthetic, with an eye for detail and classic silhouettes. He, like Balmain, preferred modest and simple design rather than extremely ornamental and flashy styles. Couture had been suffering at the time since it was an extremely impractical business, so Oscar joined the brand in order to challenge himself and to help it through the beginning of the decline of couture.<ref>Duffy, Martha. "Mais Oui, Oscar!" Time 141, no. 6 (February 8, 1993): 68.</ref>

After Oscar de la Renta's departure [[Christophe Decarnin]] joined the house in 2005. Contrary to all the designers before him, Decarnin insisted on bringing the brand into the 21st century. He favored expensive prices and flashy pieces that sharply contrasted with the label's reputation for its classic and luxurious designs. He was considered a "star designer", and the brand became more about his star status than about its clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/business/07fashion.html|title=Star Designer Leaves Balmain Fashion House|date=7 April 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In April 2011, Balmain announced that Decarnin was to be replaced by [[Olivier Rousteing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/balmain-taps-an-inside-man|title=Balmain Taps an Inside Man|first=Cathy|last=Horyn}}</ref>

Rousteing had joined the company in 2009, after attending a prestigious French fashion school and working under [[Roberto Cavalli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/olivier-rousteing-named-new-designer-at-balmain/|title=Olivier Rousteing Named New Designer at Balmain|first=Rebecca|last=Voight}}</ref> While he liked Decarnin's aesthetic, he wanted to orient the label towards the finer aspects of French couture. At the time of his appointment, Rousteing was a relatively unknown designer, and has brought a fresh take on the brand's aesthetic that remains to this day. He was credited with adding an Asian influence to the clothing, as Asia comprises a huge part of the brand's buyers.<ref>[http://www.the-dvine.com/2012/11/exclusive-interview-with-balmains-olivier-rousteing/admin. “Exclusive Interview with Balmain’s Olivier Rousteing.” The D’Vine.
