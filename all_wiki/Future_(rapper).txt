'''Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn''' (born November 20, 1983), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Future''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born and raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], he first became involved in music as part of the [[Dungeon Family]] collective, where he was nicknamed "the Future". After amassing a series of [[mixtape]]s between 2010 and 2011, Future signed a [[major record label]] deal with [[Epic Records]] and [[Rocko (rapper)|Rocko]]'s [[A1 Recordings]], which helped launch Future's own label imprint, [[Freebandz]]. He subsequently released his debut album, ''[[Pluto (Future album)|Pluto]]'', in April 2012 to positive reviews. Future's second album, ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'', was released in April 2014, surpassing his debut on the album charts.

Between late 2014 and early 2015, he released a trio of mixtapes to critical praise: ''[[Monster (Future album)|Monster]]'' (2014), ''[[Beast Mode (Future album)|Beast Mode]]'' (2015), and ''[[56 Nights]]'' (2015). His next releases, ''[[DS2 (album)|DS2]]'' (2015), ''[[What a Time to Be Alive]]'' (2015, in collaboration with [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]), ''[[Evol (Future album)|Evol]]'' (2016), ''[[Future (Future album)|Future]]'' (2017), ''[[Hndrxx]]'' (2017), ''[[The Wizrd]]'' (2019), and ''[[High Off Life]]'' (2020) all debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''[[Future (Future album)|Future]]'' and ''[[Hndrxx]]'' made him the first artist since 2014 to debut two albums in consecutive weeks atop of that chart. Future has also released several singles [[RIAA certification|certified gold]] or higher by the [[RIAA]], including "[[Turn On the Lights (song)|Turn On the Lights]]", "[[Move That Dope]]", "[[Fuck Up Some Commas]]", "[[Where Ya At]]", "[[Jumpman (song)|Jumpman]]", "[[Low Life (song)|Low Life]]", "[[Mask Off]]", and "[[Life Is Good (song)|Life Is Good]]", with the latter becoming his highest-charting single, and included on his eighth studio album, ''[[High Off Life]]''.

Future makes prevalent use of [[Auto-Tune]] in his songs, both rapping and singing with the effect. ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' wrote that Future "miraculously shows that it's still possible for Auto-Tune to be an interesting artistic tool", stating that he "finds a multitude of ways for the software to accentuate and color emotion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/|title=Future: Pluto Album Review – Pitchfork|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117020118/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16554-pluto/|archive-date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''[[LA Times]]'' wrote that "Future’s highly processed vocals suggest a man driven to bleary desperation by drugs or love or technology", stating that his music "comes closest to conjuring the numbing overstimulation of our time".<ref name="Latimes">{{cite web|last1=Wood|first1=Mickael|title=Future reflects the overstimulation of our time -- or he's just busy|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-future-hollywood-palladium-review-20160319-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828145559/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-future-hollywood-palladium-review-20160319-story.html|archive-date=August 28, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[GQ]]'' stated that he "has managed to reboot the tired auto-tune sound and mash it into something entirely new", writing that he "combines it with a bizarro croon to synthesize how he feels, then [...] stretches and deteriorates his words until they’re less like words, more like raw energy and reactive emotions".<ref name="gq">{{cite web|last1=Serrano|first1=Shea|title=Future's Reign: How the 30-Year-Old Rules Rap's New Sound|url=https://www.gq.com/story/future-rap-album-honest|website=[[GQ]]|accessdate=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921061525/http://www.gq.com/story/future-rap-album-honest|archive-date=September 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] wrote that "he's reinvented [[blues]] for the 21st century."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=How Auto-Tune Revolutionized the Sound of Popular Music |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/ |website=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=September 17, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927224800/https://pitchfork.com/features/article/how-auto-tune-revolutionized-the-sound-of-popular-music/ |archive-date=September 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rapper [[T-Pain]], who also uses that audio processor, criticized Future's unconventional use of it in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reagans|first=Dan|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/02/14/t-pain-future-is-not-using-auto-tune-correctly.html|title=T-Pain: Future Is Not Using Auto-Tune Correctly|publisher=BET|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=April 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707114544/http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/02/14/t-pain-future-is-not-using-auto-tune-correctly.html|archive-date=July 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In response, Future stated in an interview that "when I first used Auto-Tune, I never used it to sing.
