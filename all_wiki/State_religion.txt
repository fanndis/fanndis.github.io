{{Discrimination sidebar|state=collapsed}}
A '''state religion''' (also called an '''established religion''' or '''official religion''') is a [[religion|religious]] body or [[creed]] officially endorsed by the [[Sovereign state|state]]. A state with an official religion, while not [[secular state|secular]], is not necessarily a [[theocracy]], a country whose rulers have both secular and spiritual authority. State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but the state does not need be under the control of the religion (as in a theocracy) nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the state.

Official religions have been known throughout [[History of the world|human history]] in almost all types of cultures, reaching into the [[Ancient Near East]] and prehistory. The relation of [[Cult|religious cult]] and the state was discussed by [[Varro]], under the term of ''[[theologia civilis]]'' ("civic theology"). The first state-sponsored [[Christian church]] was the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], established in 301 CE.<ref>''The Journal of Ecclesiastical History''. p. 268 by Cambridge University Press, Gale Group, C.W. Dugmore</ref> In [[Christianity]], as the term ''church'' is typically applied to a Christian place of worship or organisations incorporating such ones, the term ''state church'' is associated with Christianity as sanctioned by the government, historically the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in the last centuries of the Empire's existence, and is sometimes used to denote a specific modern national branch of Christianity. Closely related to state churches are [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesiae]], which are similar but carry a more minor connotation.

In the [[Middle East]], many states with primarily Islamic population have [[Islam]] as their state religion, though the degree of religious restrictions on the citizen's everyday life varies by country. [[Kings of Saudi Arabia|Rulers]] of Saudi Arabia use both secular and religious power, while Iran's secular [[President of Iran|presidents]] are supposed to follow the decisions of [[Supreme leader of Iran|religious authorities]] since the [[Iranian Revolution|revolution of 1979]]. Turkey, which also has a primarily Muslim population, became a secular country after [[Atatürk's Reforms]], although unlike the [[Russian Revolution]] of the same time period, it did not result in the adoption of [[state atheism]].

The degree to which an official national religion is imposed upon citizens by the state in contemporary society varies considerably; from high as in [[Religion in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] to minimal or none at all as in [[Religion in Denmark|Denmark]], [[Religion in England|England]], [[Religion in Iceland|Iceland]], and [[Religion in Greece|Greece]].

==Types==
The degree and nature of state backing for denomination or creed designated as a state religion can vary. It can range from mere endorsement (with or without financial support) with freedom for other faiths to practice, to prohibiting any competing religious body from operating and to persecuting the followers of other sects. In Europe, competition between [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations for state sponsorship in the 16th century evolved the principle ''[[Cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (states follow the religion of the ruler) embodied in the text of the treaty that marked the [[Peace of Augsburg]], 1555. In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with Rome in 1534, being declared the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]],<ref>The headship was administrative and jurisdictional but did not include the ''potestas ordinis'' (the right to preach, ordain, administer the sacraments and rites of the Church which were reserved to the clergy). Bray, Gerald. ''Documents of the English Reformation'' James Clarke & Cº (1994), p. 114</ref> the official religion of England continued to be "Catholicism without the Pope" until after his death in 1547,<ref>Neill, Stephen. ''Anglicanism'' Penguin (1960), p. 61</ref> while in [[Scotland]] the [[Church of Scotland]] opposed the religion of the ruler.

In some cases, an administrative region may sponsor and fund a set of religious denominations; such is the case in [[Alsace-Moselle]] in [[France]] under its [[Local law in Alsace-Moselle|local law]], following the pre-1905 French concordatory legal system and patterns in [[Germany]].<ref>The concerned religious communities are the [[Diocese of Metz|dioceses of Metz]] and [[Archdiocese of Strasbourg|of Strasbourg]], the Lutheran [[EPCAAL]] and the Reformed [[EPRAL]] and the three [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite consistories]] in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg.</ref>

In some [[communist state]]s, notably in [[Religion in North Korea|North Korea]] and [[Religion in Cuba|Cuba]], the state sponsors religious organizations, and activities outside those state-sponsored religious organizations are met with various degrees of official disapproval. In these cases, state religions are widely seen as efforts by the state to prevent alternate sources of authority.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State churches===
There is also a difference between a "state church" and the broader term of "state religion".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} A "state church" is a state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}{{clarify|Please give an example of a "state religion created by a state for use exclusively by that state" or otherwise make it much clearer|date=March 2016}} An example of a "state religion" that is not also a "state church" is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in Costa Rica, which was accepted as the state religion in the 1949 Constitution, despite the lack of a [[national church]]. In the case of a "state church", the state has absolute control over the church,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} but in the case of a "state religion", the church is ruled by an exterior body; in the case of Catholicism, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] has control over the church. In either case, the official state religion has some influence over the ruling of the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As of 2012, there are only five state churches left,{{clarify|Whiche ones?|date=November 2016}} as most countries that once featured state churches have [[Separation of church and State|separated the church from their government]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Disestablishment===
<!--This section is linked from [[Liberal Party (UK)]]-->
{{further|Secular state}}
Disestablishment is the process of repealing a church's status as an organ of the state. In a state where an established church is in place, those opposed to such a move may be described as [[Antidisestablishmentarianism|antidisestablishmentarians]]. This word is, however, most usually associated with the debate on the position of the Anglican churches in the [[British Isles]]: the [[Church of Ireland]] (disestablished in [[Irish Church Act 1869|1871]]), the [[Church of England]] in [[Wales]] (disestablished in [[Welsh Church Act 1914|1920]]), and the Church of England itself (which remains established in England).

==Current state religions==

===Buddhism===
Governments where [[Buddhism]], either a specific form of it, or Buddhism as a whole, has been established as an official religion:
* {{Flag|Bhutan}} The [[Constitution of Bhutan|Constitution]] defines Buddhism as the "spiritual heritage of Bhutan" and it also mandates that the [[Druk Gyalpo]] (King) should appoint the [[Je Khenpo]] and [[Dratshang Lhentshog]] (The Commission for Monastic Affairs).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/draft_constitution_3rd_en.pdf |title=Draft of Tsa Thrim Chhenmo |date=1 August 2007 |publisher=constitution.bt |accessdate=2007-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127125443/http://www.constitution.bt/draft_constitution_3rd_en.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007}}

:Article 3, Spiritual Heritage

:#The ''[[Druk Gyalpo]]'' is the protector of all religions in Bhutan.
:#It shall be the responsibility of religious institutions and personalities to promote the spiritual heritage of the country while also ensuring that religion remains separate from politics in Bhutan. Religious institutions and personalities shall remain above politics.
:#The ''Druk Gyalpo'' shall, on the recommendation of the Five ''Lopon''s, appoint a learned and respected monk ordained in accordance with the ''Druk-lu'', blessed with the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ''ked-dzog'', as the ''[[Je Khenpo]]''.
:#His Holiness the ''Je Khenpo'' shall, on the recommendation of the ''[[Dratshang Lhentshog]]'', appoint monks blessed with the nine qualities of a spiritual master and accomplished in ''ked-dzog'' as the Five ''Lopon''s.

* {{Flag|Cambodia}} The [[Constitution of Cambodia|Constitution]] declared Buddhism as the official religion of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambodia.org/facts/?government=The+Constitution+of+Cambodia |title=Constitution of Cambodia |publisher=cambodia.org |accessdate=2011-04-13 }} (Article 43).</ref> About 98% of the Cambodia's population is Buddhist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html|title=East Asia/Southeast Asia :: Cambodia — The World Factbook – Central Intelligence Agency|website=cia.gov}}</ref>

In some countries, Buddhism is not recognized as a state religion, but holds special status:
* {{Flag|Laos}} According to the Lao Constitution, Buddhism is given special privilege in the country. The state respects and protects all the lawful activities of Buddhism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lao People's Democratic Republic's Constitution of 1991 with Amendments through 2003|url=https://constituteproject.org/constitution/Laos_2003.pdf?lang=en|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=29 October 2017|quote=Article 9: The State respects and protects all lawful activities of Buddhists and of followers of other religions, [and] mobilises and encourages Buddhist monks and novices as well as the priests of other religions to participate in activities that are beneficial to the country and people.}}</ref>
* {{Flag|Myanmar}} Section 361 of the [[Constitution of Myanmar|Constitution]] states that "The Union recognizes the special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union."<ref>{{cite web|title=Myanmar's Constitution of 2008|url=https://constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008.pdf?lang=en|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>
* {{Flag|Sri Lanka}} The constitution of Sri Lanka states under Chapter II, Article 9, "The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the high place in hierarchy and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana. It is regarded by the Supreme Court as being a secular country.<ref>https://www.lawnet.gov.lk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/018-SLLR-SLLR-2007-V-1-ASHIK-v.-BANDULA-AND-OTHERSNoise-Pollution-Case.pdf</ref>
* {{Flag|Thailand}} According to the [[Thai constitution]] the country is secular and [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed but some important privileges are also given to Buddhism, since the government supports and protects Buddhism as the majority religion practised by local Thais, in addition to providing financial support for the building Buddhist temples.<ref>Article 67:<br />"The State should support and protect Buddhism and other religions.
In supporting and protecting Buddhism, [...] the State should promote and support education and dissemination of dharmic principles of Theravada Buddhism [...], and shall have measures and mechanisms to prevent Buddhism from being undermined in any form. The State should also encourage Buddhists to participate in implementing such measures or mechanisms."{{cite web|title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand|url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/sites/default/files/2017-05/CONSTITUTION%2BOF%2BTHE%2BKINGDOM%2BOF%2BTHAILAND%2B%28B.E.%2B2560%2B%282017%29%29.pdf|website=constitutionnet.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref>

====Protestantism====
The following states recognize some form of [[Protestantism]] as their state or official religion:

=====Anglicanism=====
The Anglican [[Church of England]] is the established church in England as well as all three of the [[Crown dependencies]].

['''Countries in UK which have state religion]'''
* {{flag|England}} The [[Church of England]] is the established church in England, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history/ |title=The History of the Church of England |publisher=The Archbishops' Council of the Church of England|accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref> It is the only established Anglican church worldwide. The Anglican [[Church in Wales]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and the [[Church of Ireland]] are not established churches and they are independent of the Church of England. The [[British monarchy|British monarch]] is the titular [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The 26 most senior bishops in the Church of England are [[Lords Spiritual]] and have seats in the [[House of Lords]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].
* {{flag|Guernsey}} The [[Church of England]] is the established church in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]], and the leader of the Church of England in the territory is the [[Dean of Guernsey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.churchofengland.org.gg/about|website=Guernsey Deanery|publisher=Church of England}}</ref>

* {{flag|Jersey}} The [[Church of England]] is the established church in [[Bailiwick of Jersey|Jersey]], and the leader of the church on the island is the [[Dean of Jersey]], a non-voting member of the [[States of Jersey]].

=====Calvinism=====
*
* {{flag|Tuvalu}} The [[Church of Tuvalu]] is the state religion, although in practice this merely entitles it to "the privilege of performing special services on major national events".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4cf2d05cc.html|title=Refworld – 2010 Report on International Religious Freedom – Tuvalu|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> The [[Constitution of Tuvalu]] guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to "take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief".<ref>Constitution of Tuvalu, article 23.</ref>

=====Lutheranism=====
Jurisdictions where a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has been established as a state religion include the [[Nordic countries]].
* {{flag|Denmark}} Section 4 of the [[Constitution of Denmark]] confirms the [[Church of Denmark]] as the established church.<ref name="DenmarkConstitution">[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html Denmark – Constitution]: Section 4 State Church, [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/ International Constitutional Law].</ref>
** {{flag|Faroe Islands}} The [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] is the state church of the [[Faroe Islands]], an [[autonomous administrative division]] within the [[The unity of the Realm|Danish Realm]].<ref>Referenced at the Encyclopedia of Global Religion, edited by Mark Juergensmeyer, published 2012 by Sage publications, {{ISBN|978-0-7619-2729-7}}, page 390.

** {{flag|Greenland}} The Church of Denmark is the state church of [[Greenland]], an autonomous administrative division within the Danish Realm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/library/sahmanadrutyunner/dania.pdf|title=Constitution of Denmark – Section IV|quote=The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark, and, as such, it shall be supported by the State.|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301205429/http://www.parliament.am/library/sahmanadrutyunner/dania.pdf|archive-date=1 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
* {{flag|Finland}} The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]] has a special relationship with the Finnish state, its internal structure being described in a special law, the Church Act.<ref name="FinlandConstitution"/> The Church Act can be amended only by a decision of the synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and subsequent ratification by the [[Parliament of Finland]]. The Church Act is protected by the [[Constitution of Finland]] and the state cannot change the Church Act without changing the constitution. The church has the power to tax its members. The state collects these taxes for the church, for a fee. On the other hand, the church is required to give a burial place for everyone in its graveyards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/english/status_of_the_finnish_state_church_in_2007.html#privileges |title=Status of the Finnish State Church in 2007 – Privileges of the State Church |date=7 October 2007 |publisher=eroakirkosta.fi |accessdate=2007-10-23 }}</ref> The [[President of Finland]] also decides the themes for intercession days. The church does not consider itself a state church, as the Finnish state does not have the power to influence its internal workings or its theology, although it has a veto in those changes of the internal structure which require changing the Church Act. Neither does the Finnish state accord any precedence to Lutherans or the Lutheran faith in its own acts. 
* {{flag|Iceland}} The [[Constitution of Iceland]] confirms the [[Church of Iceland]] as the state church of Iceland.<ref name="IcelandConstitution">[http://www.government.is/constitution/ Constitution of the Republic of Iceland]: Article 62, [http://www.government.is/ Government of Iceland].</ref>

====Other/Mixed====
* {{flag|Armenia}} The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] has a constitutional agreement with the [[Armenia|State]]: "The Republic of Armenia shall recognise the exclusive mission of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church, as a national church, in the spiritual life of the Armenian people, in the development of their national culture and preservation of their national identity."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/parliament.php?id=constitution&lang=eng|title=National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia|website=parliament.am}}</ref>
* {{flag|Dominican Republic}} The constitution of the Dominican Republic specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties.<ref>United States Department of State, 2011 Report on International Religious Freedom—Dominican Republic, 30 July 2012, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/502105c67d.html</ref>
* {{flag|France}} The [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]] accords official status to four religions in this specific region of France: [[Judaism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]]. The law is a remnant of the Napoleonic [[Concordat of 1801]], which was abrogated in the rest of France by the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law of 1905]] on the [[separation of church and state]]. However, at the time, Alsace-Moselle had been [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexed by Germany]]. The Concordat, therefore, remained in force in these areas, and it was not abrogated when France regained control of the region in 1918. Therefore, the separation of church and state, part of the French concept of [[Laïcité]], does not apply in this region.<ref>{{cite news|title= Church-state tie opens door for mosque

* {{flag|Haiti}} While Catholicism has not been the state religion since 1987, a 19th-century [[concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] continues to confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church, in the form of stipends for clergy and financial support to churches and religious schools. The Catholic Church also retains the right to appoint certain amounts of clergy in Haiti without the government's consent.<ref name="Haiti">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90257.htm |title=Haiti |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref><ref name=":usirf17">''[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2017&dlid=281080 International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Haiti]'', US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref>
* {{flag|Hungary}} The preamble to the [[Constitution of Hungary|Hungarian Constitution of 2011]] describes Hungary as "part of Christian Europe" and acknowledges "the role of Christianity in preserving nationhood", while Article VII provides that "the State shall cooperate with the Churches for community goals." However, the constitution also guarantees freedom of religion and separation of church and state.<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011].

* {{flag|Samoa}} In June 2017, Parliament voted to amend the wording of Article{{nbsp}}1 of the constitution, thereby making Christianity the state religion. The status of the religion had previously only been mentioned in the preamble, which Prime Minister [[Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi]] considered legally inadequate.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wyeth|first1=Grant|title=Samoa Officially Becomes a Christian State|url=http://thediplomat.com/2017/06/samoa-officially-becomes-a-christian-state/|work=The Diplomat|date=16 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Feagaimaali’i-Luamanu|first1=Joyetter|title=Constitutional Amendment Passes; Samoa Officially Becomes 'Christian State'|url=http://www.pireport.org/articles/2017/06/08/constitutional-amendment-passes-samoa-officially-becomes-christian-state|publisher=Pacific Islands Report|date=8 June 2017}}</ref>

===Hinduism===
Countries where [[Hinduism]] is favoured religion by the state/government:

* {{Flag|Nepal}}: While there are no countries where Hinduism is officially declared state religion after the fall of the Nepalese monarchy in 2006, the constitution of Nepal affords some special rights to Hindu practice. In the constitution, the republic of Nepal is officially defined as a secular nation but secularism is defined as "protection of age old religion and culture" which in Nepali translates to Sanātana Dharma or Hinduism. Further pro-Hindu laws exist such as national ban on cow slaughter and laws prohibiting proselytization.<ref>http://scroll.in/article/756609/nepals-new-constitution-comes-into-force-on-sunday-but-minorities-say-it-privileges-hindus}}</ref>

===Status of religion in Israel===
{{See also|Jewish state}}
[[Israel]] is defined in several of its laws as a "[[Jewish and democratic state]]" (''medina yehudit ve-demokratit''). However, the term "[[Jew]]ish" is a [[Polysemy|polyseme]] that can describe the Jewish people [[Who is a Jew?|as either an ethnic or a religious group]]. The debate about the meaning of the term "Jewish" and its legal and social applications is one of the most profound issues with which Israeli society deals. The problem of the status of religion in Israel, even though it is relevant to all religions, usually refers to the status of [[Judaism]] in Israeli society. Thus, even though from a constitutional point of view Judaism is not the state religion in Israel, its status nevertheless determines relations between religion and state and the extent to which religion influences the political centre.<ref>''Trouble in Utopia: The Overburdened Polity of Israel'', by Dan Horowitz and Moshe Lissak, pp. 51–52</ref>

The State of Israel supports religious institutions, particularly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] ones, and recognizes the "religious communities" as carried over from those recognized under the British Mandate—in turn derived from the pre-1917 Ottoman system of ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]''. These are Jewish and Christian (Eastern Orthodox, Latin [Catholic], Gregorian-Armenian, Armenian-Catholic, Syrian [Catholic], Chaldean [Uniate], Greek Catholic Melkite, Maronite, and Syrian Orthodox). The fact that the Muslim population was not defined as a religious community does not affect the rights of the Muslim community to practice their faith. At the end of the period covered by the 2009 U.S. International Religious Freedom Report, several of these denominations were pending official government recognition; however, the Government has allowed adherents of not officially recognized groups the freedom to practice. In 1961, legislation gave Muslim Shari'a courts exclusive jurisdiction in matters of personal status. Three additional religious communities have subsequently been recognized by Israeli law: the [[Druze]] (prior under Islamic jurisdiction), the Evangelical Episcopal Church, and followers of the [[Baháʼí Faith]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091029164133/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127349.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009: Israel and the occupied territories], U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref> These groups have their own religious courts as official state courts for personal status matters (see [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]).

The structure and goals of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]] are governed by Israeli law, but the law does not say explicitly that it is a state Rabbinate. However, outspoken Israeli secularists such as [[Shulamit Aloni]] and [[Uri Avnery]] have long maintained that it is that in practice. Non-recognition of other streams of Judaism such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] is the cause of some controversy; rabbis belonging to these currents are not recognized as such by state institutions and marriages performed by them are not recognized as valid. As pointed out by Avnery and Aloni, the essential problem is that Israel carries on the top-down Ottoman ''millet'' system, under which the government reserves the complete discretion of recognizing some religious groups and not recognizing others. {{As of|2015}} [[marriage in Israel]] provides no provision for [[civil marriage]], marriage between people of different religions, marriages by people who do not belong to one of nine recognised religious communities, or [[same-sex marriage]]s, although there is recognition of marriages performed abroad.

===Political religions===
In some countries, there is a [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] sponsored by the government that may be called [[political religion]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gentile |first=Emilio |year=2006 |origyear=2001 |title=Le religioni della politica.

* {{Flag|North Korea}} has promulgated ''[[Juche]]'' as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and it is fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]], the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. ''Juche'' theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology. According to government figures, ''Juche'' is the largest political religion in [[North Korea]]. The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.

==Former state religions==

===Pre-modern era===

====Egypt and Sumer====
{{see also|History of religion}}
The concept of state religions was known as long ago as the empires of Egypt and [[Sumer]], when every city state or people had its own god or gods. Many of the early Sumerian rulers were priests of their patron city god. Some of the earliest semi-mythological kings may have passed into the pantheon, like [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], and some later kings came to be viewed as divine soon after their reigns, like [[Sargon the Great]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. One of the first rulers to be proclaimed a god during his actual reign was [[Gudea]] of [[Lagash]], followed by some later kings of [[Ur]], such as [[Shulgi]]. Often, the state religion was integral to the power base of the reigning government, such as in Egypt, where Pharaohs were often thought of as embodiments of the god Horus.

====Sassanid Empire====
[[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion of the [[Sassanid dynasty]] which lasted until 651, when Persia was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. However, it persisted as the state religion of the independent state of [[Hyrcania]] until the 15th century.

The tiny kingdom of [[Adiabene]] in [[northern Mesopotamia]] converted to [[Judaism]] around 34&nbsp;CE.

====Greek city-states====
Many of the Greek city-states also had a god or goddess associated with that city. This would not be its only god or goddess, but the one that received special honors. In ancient Greece, the city of Athens had [[Athena]], [[Sparta]] had [[Ares]], [[Delphi]] had [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] had [[Zeus]], [[Corinth]] had [[Poseidon]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] had [[Demeter]].

====Roman religion and Christianity====
In Rome, the office of ''[[Pontifex Maximus]]'' came to be reserved for the Emperor, who was often [[Apotheosis|declared a god]] posthumously, or sometimes during his reign. Failure to worship the Emperor as a god was at times punishable by death, as the Roman government sought to link emperor worship with loyalty to the Empire. Many Christians and Jews were subject to persecution, torture and death in the Roman Empire because it was against their beliefs to worship the Emperor.

In 311, Emperor [[Galerius]], on his deathbed, declared a religious indulgence to Christians throughout the Roman Empire, focusing on the ending of anti-Christian persecution. [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]], the two ''[[Augustus (title)|Augusti]]'', by the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, enacted a law allowing religious freedom to everyone within the Roman Empire. Furthermore, the Edict of Milan cited that Christians may openly practice their religion unmolested and unrestricted, and provided that properties taken from Christians be returned to them unconditionally. Although the Edict of Milan allowed religious freedom throughout the Empire, it did not abolish nor disestablish the Roman state cult (Roman polytheistic paganism). The Edict of Milan was written in such a way as to implore the blessings of the deity.

Constantine called up the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, although he was not a baptised Christian until years later. Despite enjoying considerable popular support, Christianity was still not the official state religion in Rome, although it was in some neighbouring states such as [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]], and [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]].

[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman Religion]] ([[Neoplatonic]] [[Religion in ancient Greece|Hellenism]]) was restored for a time by the Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] from 361 to 363. Julian does not appear to have reinstated the persecutions of the earlier [[Roman emperors]].

[[Catholic]] Christianity, as opposed to Arianism and other ideologies deemed [[heresy|heretical]], was declared to be the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] on 27 February 380<ref>{{cite web |title=The Theodosian Code |url=http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/latinlibrary/theod.html |work=The Latin Library at Ad Fontes Academy|publisher=Ad Fontes Academy |accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> by the decree ''[[Edict of Thessalonica|De fide catolica]]'' of Emperor [[Theodosius I]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Theodosian Code XVI.i.2 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/theodcodeXVI.html |work=Medieval Sourcebook: Banning of Other Religions |first=Paul |last=Halsall |date=June 1997 |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref>

====Han dynasty Confucianism====
In China, the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE – 220 CE) advocated [[Confucianism]] as the ''de facto'' state religion, establishing tests based on Confucian texts as an entrance requirement into government service—although, in fact, the "Confucianism" advocated by the Han emperors may be more properly termed a sort of Confucian [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] or "State Confucianism". This sort of Confucianism continued to be regarded by the emperors, with a few notable exceptions, as a form of state religion from this time until the overthrow of the imperial system of government in 1911. Note, however, there is a debate over whether Confucianism (including Neo-Confucianism) is a religion or purely a philosophical system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln471/Confucian%20religiosity%20bib.htm|title=Sources on Confucian religiosity}}</ref>

====Yuan dynasty Buddhism====
During the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368 CE), [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was established as the ''de facto'' state religion by the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]], the founder of the Yuan dynasty. The top-level department and government agency known as the [[Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs]] (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in [[Khanbaliq]] (modern [[Beijing]]) to supervise [[Buddhist monk]]s throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the [[Sakya]] sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of [[Imperial Preceptor]] (Dishi), thereby enjoy special power.<ref>''History of civilizations of Central Asia.: A.D. 750 to the end of the fifteenth century''. Part two: The achievements, p. 59</ref>

====Golden Horde and Ilkhanate====
[[Shamanism]] and [[Buddhism]] were once the dominant religions among the ruling class of the Mongol khanates of [[Golden Horde]] and [[Ilkhanate]], the two western khanates of the [[Mongol Empire]]. In the early days, the rulers of both khanates increasingly adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], similar to the Yuan dynasty at that time. However, the Mongol rulers [[Ghazan]] of Ilkhanate and [[Öz Beg Khan|Uzbeg]] of Golden Horde converted to [[Islam]] in 1295 CE because of the Muslim Mongol emir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]] and in 1313 CE because of [[Sufi]] [[Bukhara]]n [[sayyid]] and [[sheikh]] [[Ibn Abdul Hamid]] respectively. Their official favoring of Islam as the state religion coincided with a marked attempt to bring the regime closer to the non-Mongol majority of the regions they ruled. In Ilkhanate, [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Jewish]] subjects lost their equal status with Muslims and again had to pay the poll tax; [[Buddhists]] had the starker choice of conversion or expulsion.<ref>''Medieval Persia 1040–1797'', [[David Morgan (historian)|David Morgan]] p. 72</ref> In Golden Horde, Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols were proscribed, and by 1315, Uzbeg had successfully Islamicized the Horde, killing Jochid princes and Buddhist [[lama]]s who opposed his religious policy and succession of the throne.

====Former state churches in British North America====

=====Protestant colonies=====
* The colonies of [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay]], [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] were founded by [[Puritan]] Calvinist Protestants, and had [[Congregational church|Congregational]] established churches.
* The colonies of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Province of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]], and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] maintained the [[Church of England]] as the established church.
* The [[Colony of Maryland]] was founded by a charter granted in 1632 to George Calvert, secretary of state to Charles I, and his son Cecil, both recent converts to Roman Catholicism. Under their leadership, many English Catholic gentry families settled in Maryland. However, the colonial government was officially neutral in religious affairs, granting toleration to all Christian groups and enjoining them to avoid actions which antagonized the others. On several occasions, low-church dissenters led insurrections which temporarily overthrew the Calvert rule. In 1689, when William and Mary [[Glorious Revolution|came to the English throne]], they acceded to demands to revoke the original royal charter. In 1701, the Church of England was proclaimed, and in the course of the 18th century Maryland Catholics were first barred from public office, then disenfranchised, although not all of the laws passed against them (notably laws restricting property rights and imposing penalties for sending children to be educated in foreign Catholic institutions) were enforced, and some Catholics even continued to hold public office.
* When [[Spanish Florida]] was ceded to Great Britain in 1763, the British divided Florida into two colonies, East and West Florida, which both continued a policy of toleration for the Catholic residents, but established the [[Church of England]] as the state church.
* When [[New France]] was transferred to Great Britain in 1763, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] remained under toleration, but [[Huguenot]]s were allowed entrance where they had formerly been banned from settlement by Parisian authorities.

=====Colonies with no established church=====
* The [[Province of Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], but the colony never had an established church.
* The [[Province of New Jersey]], without official religion, had a significant [[Quaker]] lobby, but Calvinists of all types also had a presence.
* [[Delaware Colony]] had no established church, but was contested between Catholics and Quakers.
* The [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], founded by religious dissenters forced to flee the Massachusetts Bay colony, is widely regarded as the first polity to grant religious freedom to all its citizens, although Catholics were barred intermittently. Baptists, Seekers/Quakers and Jews made this colony their home. The [[Rhode Island Royal Charter|King Charles Charter]] of 1663 guaranteed "full liberty in religious concernments".

====Non-British colonies====
These areas were disestablished and dissolved, yet their presences were tolerated by the English and later British colonial governments, as [[Foreign Protestants]], whose communities were expected to observe their own ways without causing controversy or conflict for the prevalent colonists. After the Revolution, their ethno-religious backgrounds were chiefly sought as the most compatible non-British Isles immigrants.
* [[New Netherland]] was founded by [[Dutch Reformed]] Calvinists.
* [[New Sweden]] was founded by [[Church of Sweden]] Lutherans.

====State of Deseret====
The [[State of Deseret]] was a provisional [[U.S. state|state]] of the United States, proposed in 1849, by [[Mormon]] settlers in [[Salt Lake City]]. The provisional state existed for slightly over two years, but attempts to gain recognition by the United States government floundered for various reasons. The [[Utah Territory]] which was then founded was under Mormon control, and repeated attempts to gain statehood met resistance, in part due to concerns that the principle of separation of church and state conflicted with the practice of members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] placing their highest value on "following counsel" in virtually all matters relating to their church-centered lives. The state of [[Utah]] was eventually admitted to the union on 4{{nbsp}}January 1896, after the various issues had been resolved.<ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/statehood_and_the_progressive_era/struggleforstatehood.html Struggle For Statehood] [[Edward Leo Lyman]], ''Utah History Encyclopedia''</ref>

Brazil had [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion from the country's [[Independence of Brazil|independence]], in 1822, until the fall of the [[Brazilian Empire]]. The [[República Velha|new Republican government]] passed, in 1890, Decree 119-A {{cite web|title=Decreto 119-A|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/1851-1899/d119-a.htm|quote=Prohibits federal and state authorities to intervene on religion, granting freedom of religion.}} (still in force), instituting the separation of church and state for the first time in Brazilian law. [[Positivist]] thinker [[Demétrio Nunes Ribeiro]] urged the new government to adopt this stance. The 1891 Constitution, the first under the Republican system of government, abolished privileges for any specific religion, reaffirming the separation of church and state. This has been the case ever since the 1988 [[Constitution of Brazil]], currently in force, does so in its Nineteenth Article.

| United States{{#tag:ref|The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] explicitly forbids the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] from enacting any law respecting a religious establishment, and thus forbids either designating an official church for the United States, or interfering with [[U.S. state|State]] and local official churches—which were common when the First Amendment was enacted. It did not prevent [[state government]]s from establishing official churches. [[Connecticut]] continued to do so until it replaced its colonial [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Charter]] with the [[History of Connecticut#The 1818 Constitution (1818–1890)|Connecticut Constitution of 1818]]; Massachusetts retained an establishment of religion in general until 1833.<ref>{{Cite book|author=James H.

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], ratified in 1868, makes no mention of religious establishment, but forbids the states to "abridge the privileges or immunities" of U.S. citizens, or to "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". In the 1947 case of [[Everson v. Board of Education]], the United States Supreme Court held that this later provision [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporates]] the First Amendment's Establishment Clause as applying to the States, and thereby prohibits state and local religious establishments. The exact boundaries of this prohibition are still disputed, and are a frequent source of cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]—especially as the Court must now balance, on a state level, the First Amendment prohibitions on government establishment of official religions with the First Amendment prohibitions on government interference with the free exercise of religion. See [[school prayer]] for such a controversy in contemporary American politics.

All current State constitutions do mention a Creator, but include guarantees of religious liberty parallel to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. The constitutions of eight states ([[Arkansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Texas]]) also contain clauses that prohibit atheists from holding public office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/StateConstitutions.htm |title=State Constitutions that Discriminate Against Atheists |publisher=godlessgeeks.com |accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/texas.htm
|title=Religious laws and religious bigotry – Religious discrimination in U.S. state constitutions |publisher=religioustolerance.com |accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> However, these clauses were held by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] to be unenforceable in the 1961 case of ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]'', where the court ruled unanimously that such clauses constituted a religious test incompatible with the religious test prohibition in [[no religious test clause|Article{{nbsp}}6 Section{{nbsp}}3]] of the United States Constitution.
