'''Skype''' ({{IPAc-en|s|k|aɪ|p}}) is a telecommunications application that specializes in providing [[Videotelephony|video chat]] and voice calls between computers, tablets, mobile devices, the [[Xbox One]] console, and smartwatches over the [[Internet]]. Skype also provides [[Instant messaging client|instant messaging]] services.  Users may transmit [[instant messaging|text]], [[video messaging|video]], audio and images. Skype allows [[videoconferencing|video conference calls]].

At the end of 2010, there were over 660 million worldwide users, with over 300 million estimated active each month as of August 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Global social networks by users 2015 {{!}} Statistic|url = http://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/|website = Statista |accessdate = 4 November 2015}}</ref> At one point in February 2012, there were 34 million users concurrently online on Skype.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.skype.com/stories/2012/02/27/34-million-people-concurrently/ |title=34 Million People Concurrently Online on Skype |work=Skype Blogs |date=27 February 2012}}</ref>

First released in August 2003, Skype was created by the [[Swedes|Swede]] [[Niklas Zennström]] and the [[Danes|Dane]] [[Janus Friis]], in cooperation with [[Ahti Heinla]], [[Priit Kasesalu]], [[Jaan Tallinn]], and Toivo Annus, [[Estonians]] who developed the [[peer-to-peer]] backend that was also used in the music-sharing application [[Kazaa]]. In September 2005, [[eBay]] acquired Skype for $2.6&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=EBay to buy Skype in $2.6bn deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4237338.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2014|date=12 September 2005}}</ref> In September 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2009/09/02/canada_pension_plan_buys_skype_stake.html |title=Canada Pension plan buys Skype stake &#124; Toronto Star |work=Thestar|date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> [[Silver Lake Partners|Silver Lake]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]], and the [[Canada Pension Plan Investment Board]] announced the acquisition of 65% of Skype for $1.9&nbsp;billion from [[eBay]], which attributed to the enterprise a market value of $2.92&nbsp;billion.

Skype allows users to communicate over the Internet by voice, using a [[microphone]], by video using a [[webcam]], and by [[instant messaging]]. Skype implements a [[freemium]] business model with Skype-to-Skype calls being free of charge, while calls to [[landlines|landline telephones]] and mobile phones (over [[Public switched telephone network|traditional telephone networks]]) are charged via a [[debits and credits|debit]]-based user account system called Skype Credit.

Throughout 2016 and 2017, Microsoft redesigned its Skype clients in a way that transitioned Skype from [[peer-to-peer]] service to a centralized [[Microsoft Azure|Azure]] service and adjusted the user interfaces of apps to make text-based messaging more prominent than voice calling.

The name for the software is derived from "Sky [[peer-to-peer]]", which was then abbreviated to "Skyper".

* Shortly after its acquisition, Microsoft began integrating the Skype service with its own products. Along with taking over the development of existing Skype desktop and [[mobile app]]s, the company developed a dedicated client app for its then-newly released, touch-focused [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows RT]] operating systems. They were made available from [[Windows Store]] when the then-new OS launched on 26 October 2012. The following year, it became the default messaging app for [[Windows 8.1]], replacing the Windows 8 Messaging app at the time, and became pre-installed software on every device that came with or upgraded to 8.1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/314824/skype-to-come-pre-installed-on-windows-8-1|title=Skype to Come Pre-Installed on Windows 8.1|last=Albanesius|first=By Chloe|last2=August 15|first2=2013 2:50PM EST|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05|last3=August 15|first3=2013}}</ref>

Voice chat allows [[telephone call]]s between pairs of users and conference calling and uses proprietary audio [[codec]]. Skype's text chat client allows group chats, [[emoticon]]s, storing chat history, and editing of previous messages. Offline messages were implemented in a beta build of version 5 but removed after a few weeks without notification. The usual features familiar to instant messaging users—user profiles, online status indicators, and so on—are also included.

The ''Online Number'', a.k.a. SkypeIn, service allows Skype users to receive calls on their computers dialed by conventional phone subscribers to a local Skype phone number; local numbers are available for Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name="skypeincountries">{{cite web

[[File:Skype 4.0 screenshot.png|thumb|Skype 4.0 (released 2009)]]
Multiple different versions of Skype have been released for Windows since its conception. The original line of Skype applications continued from versions 1.0 through 4.0. It has offered a desktop-only app since 2003. Later, a mobile version was created for Windows Phones.

In 2012, Skype introduced a new version for Windows 8 similar to the [[Windows Phone]] version.<ref>{{cite web

The latest version of Skype for Windows is Skype 11, which is based on the Universal Windows Platform and runs on various Windows 10-related systems, including [[Xbox One]], Windows phones, and [[Microsoft Hololens]]. Microsoft still offers the older Skype 8, which is Win32-based and runs on all systems from [[Windows XP]] (which is otherwise unsupported by Microsoft) to the most recent release of Windows 10.<ref name="system-requirements">{{cite web|title=What are the system requirements for Skype?|url=https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype|website=Skype Support|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>

In late 2017, this version was upgraded to Skype 12.9 in which several features were both removed and added.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Skype for Desktop Version 12 |url=https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34685/what-s-new-in-skype-for-windows-10/|website=Skype|publisher=Microsoft}}</ref>

Skype was previously available on selected [[Symbian]], [[BlackBerry OS]] and [[BlackBerry 10]] devices.

Skype also offers a Skype Wi-Fi Phone, which is a wireless mobile phone that allows users to make Skype calls, using a wireless Internet connection. The Skype Wi-Fi Phone has an on-screen menu that lets Skype users see who is online and available to talk, similar to what is seen on a PC. It can also be used to talk with non-Skype users. SkypeOut minutes can be used to call any phone for a low price and no monthly fee. The Skype Wi-Fi Phone does not contain a web browser and so cannot access hotspots that require web-based login or authentication.<ref>{{cite web

==== Third-party licensing ====
Third-party developers, such as [[Truphone]], [[Nimbuzz]], and [[Fring (VoIP)|Fring]], previously allowed Skype to run in parallel with several other competing VoIP/IM networks (Truphone and Nimbuzz provide TruphoneOut and NimbuzzOut as a competing paid service) in any Symbian or Java environment. Nimbuzz made Skype available to [[BlackBerry]] users and Fring provided mobile video calling over Skype as well as support for the Android platform. Skype disabled Fring users from accessing Skype in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/07/fring.html|title=Skype&nbsp;– The Big Blog&nbsp;– Fring's misuse of Skype software was damaging to our brand and reputation|accessdate=3 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715075745/http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/07/fring.html|archivedate=15 July 2010}}</ref> Nimbuzz discontinued support on request of Skype in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nimbuzz.com/2010/10/25/what-the-skypenimbuzz-breakup-means-to-you/|title=What the Skype/Nimbuzz Breakup Means To You|accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref>

Before and during the Microsoft acquisition, Skype withdrew licensing from several third parties producing software and hardware compatible with Skype. The Skype for [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] product from [[Digium]] was withdrawn as "no longer available for sale".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digium.com/en/docs/SFA/sfa_faq.php|title=Phone Systems to Power Your Business – Sfa_faq – Digium The Asterisk Company|publisher=Digium.com|accessdate=4 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206160048/http://www.digium.com/en/docs/SFA/sfa_faq.php|archivedate=6 December 2011}}</ref> The [[Senao Networks|Senao]] SN358+ long-range (10–15&nbsp;km) cordless phone was discontinued due to loss of licenses to participate in the Skype network as peers. In combination, these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with a robust handoff.

== Technology ==
=== Protocol ===
{{Main|Skype protocol}}

Skype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype, and official applications using the protocol are [[Proprietary software|closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the Global Index P2P protocol belonging to the Joltid Ltd. corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref>), rather than the more usual [[client–server model]] (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).

On 20 June 2014, Microsoft announced the deprecation of the old Skype protocol. Within several months from this date, in order to continue using Skype services, Skype users will have to update to Skype applications released in 2014. The new Skype protocol—[[Microsoft Notification Protocol#MSNP24|Microsoft Notification Protocol 24]] was released. The deprecation became effective in the second week of August 2014. Transferred files are now saved on central servers.

As far as networking stack support is concerned, Skype only supports the [[IPv4]] protocol. It lacks support for the next-generation Internet protocol, [[IPv6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SkypeTalks/status/264057558262747136|title=Skype does not support IPv6.|publisher=Skype official Twitter account|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> [[Skype for Business]], however, includes support for IPv6 addresses, along with continued support of IPv4.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/plan-your-deployment/network-requirements/ipv6 |title=Plan for IPv6 in Skype for Business |date=21 February 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-13 |work=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>

=== Protocol detection and control ===
Many networking and security companies have claimed to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications. While the specific detection methods used by these companies are often private, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]] and [[Naive Bayes classifier|naive Bayes classification]] are two approaches that were published in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpacket.org/articles/revealing-skype-traffic-when-randomness-plays-you |title=Dario Bonfiglio et al.

=== Audio codecs ===
Skype 2.x used [[G.729]], Skype 3.2 introduced [[SVOPC]], and Skype 4.0 added a Skype-created codec called [[:SILK]], intended to be "lightweight and embeddable".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wirevolution.com/2009/01/13/skypes-new-super-wideband-codec/ |title=Skype's new super wideband codec |publisher=Wirevolution.com |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> Additionally, Skype has released [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] as an open-source codec, which integrates the SILK codec principles for voice transmission with the [[CELT]] codec principles for higher-quality audio transmissions, such as live music performances. Opus was submitted to the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.skype.com/2012/09/12/skype-and-a-new-audio-codec/ |title=Skype and a New Audio Codec |publisher=Skype |date=12 September 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Since then, it has been standardized as RFC 6716.<ref name="xiph.org">{{cite web |url=https://wiki.xiph.org/OpusFAQ |title=OpusFAQ |publisher=Xiph.org Foundation |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

=== Skype Qik ===
{{main|Skype Qik}}Skype acquired the video service Qik in 2011. After shutting down Qik in April 2014, Skype relaunched the service as [[Skype Qik]] on 14 October 2014. Although Qik offered video conferencing and Internet streaming, the new service focuses on mobile video messaging between individuals and groups.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/10/14/skype-relaunches-qik-as-social-video-messaging-app/|title = Skype Relaunches Qik as Social Video Messaging App|last = Olivarez-Giles|first = Nathan|date = 14 October 2014|work = [[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate = 14 October 2014}}</ref>

== Security and privacy ==
{{Main|Skype security}}
Skype was claimed initially to be a [[secure communication]], with one of its early web pages stating "highly secure with end-to-end encryption".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skype.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040701004241/http://skype.com/|archivedate=1 July 2004|title=Skype (Wayback Machine Archive) |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}</ref> Security services were invisible to the user, and encryption cannot be disabled. Skype claims to use publicly documented, widely trusted encryption techniques for Skype-to-Skype communication: [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] for key negotiation and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] to encrypt conversations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA31/does-skype-use-encryption?q=security |title=Does Skype use encryption? |website=Skype |date=<!--not stated, copyright 2020-->  |author=<!--not stated--> |accessdate= 25 July 2020}}</ref> However, it is impossible to verify that these algorithms are used correctly, completely, and at all times, as there is no public review possible without a protocol specification and/or the app source code. Skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users with no proof of identity. Instead, a free choice of nicknames permits users to use the system without revealing their identities to other users. It is trivial to set up an account using any name; the displayed caller's name is no guarantee of authenticity. A third-party paper analyzing the security and methodology of Skype was presented at [[Black Hat Briefings|Black Hat]] Europe 2006. It analyzed Skype and found a number of security issues with the then-current security model.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf|title=Silver Needle in the Skype |author=Philippe Biondi and Fabrice Desclaux |publisher=blackhat |accessdate=2 March 2006 }}</ref>

Skype incorporates some features which tend to hide its traffic, but it is not specifically designed to thwart [[traffic analysis]] and therefore does not provide [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous communication]]. Some researchers have been able to [[Digital watermarking|watermark]] the traffic so that it is identifiable even after passing through an [[Tor (anonymity network)|anonymizing network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.gmu.edu/~xwangc/Publications/CCS05-VoIPTracking.pdf |title=George Mason University|accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref>

In an interview, Kurt Sauer, the Chief Security Officer of Skype, said, "We provide a safe communication option.

Skype's client uses an undocumented and proprietary protocol. The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) is concerned about user privacy issues arising from using proprietary software and protocols and has made a replacement for Skype one of their high-priority projects.<ref>"[http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html#skypereplacement FSF High Priority Projects]", [[Free Software Foundation]]. Retrieved 26 January 2009.</ref> Security researchers Biondi and Desclaux have speculated that Skype may have a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]], since Skype sends traffic even when it is turned off and because Skype has taken extreme measures to obfuscate their traffic and functioning of their app.<ref>{{cite web |author=Biondi P., Desclaux F |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf |title=Silver Needle in the Skype |publisher=EADS Corporate Research Center |date=2–3 March 2006 |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref> Several media sources reported that at a meeting about the "Lawful interception of IP based services" held on 25 June 2008, high-ranking unnamed officials at the Austrian interior ministry said that they could listen in on Skype conversations without problems.

The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has interpreted the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) as requiring digital phone networks to allow [[wiretapping]] if authorized by an FBI warrant, in the same way as other phone services. In February 2009, Skype said that, not being a telephone company owning phone lines, it is exempt from CALEA and similar laws, which regulate US phone companies, and in fact, it is not clear whether Skype could support wiretapping even if it wanted to.<ref name=voipnews>{{cite web|url=http://www.voip-news.com/feature/skype-secrecy-attack-022409 |title=Skype Secrecy Under Attack Again |publisher=VoIP News |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], the Act is inconsistent with the original intent of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]];<ref name="ACLU 1999">{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/spying/15440pub19980301.html|title=Big Brother in the Wires: Wiretapping in the Digital Age|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]|accessdate=23 March 2009}}</ref> more recently, the ACLU has expressed the concern that the FCC interpretation of the Act is incorrect.<ref name="ACLU/FCC">{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/20223res20050912.html|title=CALEA feature page|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] |accessdate=23 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="techdirt1">{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080918/0208152302.shtml |title=German Authorities Raiding Homes To Find Skype Tapping Whistleblower |publisher=Techdirt |date=18 September 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}</ref> It has been suggested that Microsoft made changes to Skype's infrastructure to ease various wiretapping requirements;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/cloud-computing/286482/was-skype-reworked-microsoft-make-it-easier-wiretap|title=Was Skype reworked by Microsoft to make it easier to wiretap?|author=Gaskin, James E. |date=18 July 2012|work=ITworld}}</ref> however, Skype denies the claims.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.skype.com/2012/07/26/what-does-skypes-architecture-do/ |title=What Does Skype's Architecture Do?|date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

The Microsoft query used the full URL supplied in the IM conversation and was generated by a previously undocumented security service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Skype-with-care-Microsoft-is-reading-everything-you-write-1862870.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226140249/http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Skype-with-care-Microsoft-is-reading-everything-you-write-1862870.html |archivedate=26 December 2013 |title=Skype with Care – Microsoft is Reading Everything You Write |publisher=Heise Security |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> Security experts speculate the action was triggered by a technology similar to Microsoft's SmartScreen Filter used in its browsers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lists.randombit.net/pipermail/cryptography/2013-May/004224.html |title=[Cryptography] Skype backdoor confirmation |author=Adam Back|date=16 May 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2013 }}</ref>

On 10 November 2014, Skype scored 1 out of 7 points on the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s secure messaging scorecard. Skype received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesn't have access to (i.e. the communications are not [[End-to-end encryption|end-to-end encrypted]]), users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e. the service does not provide [[forward secrecy]]), the code is not open to independent review (i.e. the code is not [[Open-source software|open-source]]), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit.<ref name="secure-messaging-scorecard">{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |title=Secure Messaging Scorecard.

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2012}}

Since September 2007, users in China trying to download the Skype software client have been redirected to the site of [[TOM Online]], a joint venture between a Chinese wireless operator and Skype, from which a modified Chinese version can be downloaded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2007/09/24/2962449.htm |title=Dynamic Internet Technology Inc.

Those are the regulations." He also stated, "One thing that's certain is that those things are in no way jeopardising the privacy or the security of any of the users."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/875630d4-cef9-11da-925d-0000779e2340.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207002929/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/875630d4-cef9-11da-925d-0000779e2340.html |archivedate=7 February 2011 |title=Skype says texts are censored by China |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=18 April 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In October 2008, it was reported that TOM had been saving the full message contents of some Skype text conversations on its servers, apparently focusing on conversations containing political issues such as [[Tibet]], [[Falun Gong]], [[Taiwan independence]], and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]]. The saved messages contain [[personally identifiable information]] about the message senders and recipients, including IP addresses, usernames, landline phone numbers, and the entire content of the text messages, including the time and date of each message. Information about Skype users outside China who were communicating with a TOM-Skype user was also saved. A server misconfiguration made these log files accessible to the public for a time.<ref name=claburn /><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122291621892397279 |title=Skype's China Practices Draw Ire: Joint Venture's Tracking of Text Messages Adds Impetus to Web Code of Conduct |first=Geoffrey A. |last=Fowler |author2=Jason Dean |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=3 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/technology/internet/02skype.html |title=Huge System for Web Surveillance Discovered in China |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=John |last=Markoff |date=1 October 2008}}</ref>

Research on the TOM-Skype venture has revealed information about blacklisted keyword checks, allowing censorship and surveillance of its users. The partnership has received much criticism for the latter.

== Localization ==
Skype comes bundled with the following locales and languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Nepali, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian and European), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

As the Windows desktop app offers users the option of creating new language files, at least 80 other (full or partial) localizations are also available for many languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/skypeinyourlang|title=SkypeInYourLanguage|author=akerbeltzalba|work=SourceForge}}</ref>

== Customer service ==
In January 2010, Skype rescinded its policy of seizing funds in Skype accounts that have been inactive (no paid call) for 180 days. This was in settlement of a class-action lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/01/14/skype-lawsuit-to-yield-credit-for-customers/|title=WSJ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sarmad | last=Ali | date=14 January 2010}}</ref> Skype also paid up to US$4 to persons who opted into the action.

As of February 2012, Skype provides support through their web support portal, support community, @skypesupport on Twitter, and Skype Facebook page. Direct contact via email and live chat is available through their web support portal. Chat Support is a premium feature available to Skype Premium and some other paid users.

Skype's refund policy states that they will provide refunds in full if customers have used less than 1 euro of their Skype Credit. "Upon a duly submitted request, Skype will refund you on a pro-rata basis for the unused period of a Product".

Skype has come under some criticism from users for the inability to completely close accounts. Users not wanting to continue using Skype can make their account inactive by deleting all personal information, except for the username.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techwhoop.com/delete-your-skype-account/|title=How to delete Your Skype account?|work=TechWhoop}}</ref>

Due to an outage on 21 September 2015 that affected several users in New Zealand, Australia, and other countries, Skype decided to compensate their customers with 20 minutes of free calls to over 60 landline and 8 mobile phone numbers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Skype to compensate users for September outage|url=http://www.itnews.com.au/news/skype-to-compensate-users-for-september-outage-410250 | work=itNews | first=Juha | last=Saarinen | date=8 October 2015}}</ref>

== Educational use ==
Although Skype is a commercial product, its free version is used with increasing frequency among teachers, schools, and charities interested in global education projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ763085&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ763085 |title=Talk Is Cheap: Skype Can Make VoIP a Very Real Communication Option for Your School |publisher=Technology & Learning, v27 n8 p36 | first=Jeffrey | last=Branzburg | date=March 2007|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> A popular use case is to facilitate language learning through conversations that alternate between each participant's native language.<ref>Language Magazine [http://languagemagazine.com/?page_id=2565 article]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linguaelive.ca/|title=LinguaeLive – Connect students who want to learn each other's languages|author=Han Sha|work=linguaelive.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languageforexchange.com//|title=Practice a new language with native speakers via Skype|work=languageforexchange.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505000814/http://www.languageforexchange.com/|archivedate=5 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.language-exchanges.org/|title=The Mixxer – a free educational website for language exchanges via Skype|work=language-exchanges.org}}</ref>

Skype in the classroom is another free tool that Skype has set up on its website, designed to encourage teachers to make their classrooms more interactive, and collaborate with other teachers around the world. There are various Skype lessons, in which students can participate. Teachers can also use a search tool and find experts in a particular field.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://education.skype.com/|title=Skype in the Classroom|work=Skype in the Classroom|access-date=30 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201222656/https://education.skype.com/|archive-date=1 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The educational program [[Skype a Scientist]], set up by biologist [[Sarah McAnulty]] in 2017, had in two years connected 14,312 classrooms with over 7000 volunteer scientists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2019/02/27/how-the-skype-a-scientist-program-combats-fake-news-through-public-education/#13ba6f3025d7|title=How The 'Skype A Scientist' Program Combats Fake News Through Public Education|last=Killgrove|first=Kristina|date=27 February 2019|website=Forbes|url-status=live|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>

However, Skype is not adopted universally, with many educational institutions in the United States and Europe blocking the application from their networks.
