Farr worked for the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) in [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, in southern Africa and the Middle East.<ref name="sundaytimes"/><ref name=GuardApr14/> Farr was MI6's director of security and public affairs at the time of his appointment to the OSCT by [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], then [[Home Secretary]], in the wake of the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]].<ref name=GuardApr14/> This role made him the senior government official responsible for counter terrorist and organised crime strategy.<ref name="farr-statement1" />

In 2010 Farr was the recipient of a strategic briefing paper from the [[Quilliam (think tank)|Quilliam]] [[think tank]], the paper being a confidential review of the British government's anti-terrorism [[Prevent strategy]]. The paper was "particularly critical of the view that government partnerships with non-violent yet otherwise extreme Islamists were the best way to fend off Jihadism."<ref name=Nawaz348>Nawaz (2012): p. 348</ref> The report provoked protests from various groups which had been identified in the Quilliam briefing as sympathetic or supportive of Islamist extremism, and was described as "McCarthyite" by [[Inayat Bunglawala]], chairman of Muslims4Uk and Fatima Khan, vice-chair of the Muslim Safety Forum.<ref name=guardian1>{{cite news |title=List sent to terror chief aligns peaceful Muslim groups with terrorist ideology |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/04/quilliam-foundation-list-alleged-extremism|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=telegraph1>{{cite news |title=Mainstream Islamic organisations 'share al-Qaeda ideology'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7928377/Mainstream-Islamic-organisations-share-al-Qaeda-ideology.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=5 August 2010|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref> Bunglawala added: "In effect, Quilliam – a body funded very generously by the government through Prevent – are attempting to set themselves up as arbiters of who is and is not an acceptable Muslim."<ref name=telegraph1/> A [[Home Office]] spokesman told the press that the report had not been solicited but added: "We believe the Prevent programme isn't working as effectively as it could and want a strategy that is effective and properly focused – that is why we are reviewing it."<ref name=guardian1/><ref name=telegraph1/> Farr has been described as a "key figure" behind the operation of [[control order]]s and '[[Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011|TPIM notices]]', their successors.<ref name=GuardApr14/>

Farr was passed over for the role of head of MI6, he also failed to be appointed Permanent Secretary at the Home Office. ''The Guardian'' reported that several officials at the Home Office threatened to resign if Farr were promoted to the top job.<ref name=GuardApr14/>

Farr was responsible for the Prevent anti-terrorism strategy, the [[Interception Modernisation Programme]] under Labour and the current [[Communications Capabilities Development Programme]], both being projects to enable to the government to surveil the traffic data of ordinary Internet communications of UK citizens.<ref name="sundaytimes"/> The programme has resulted in the draft [[Communications Data Bill 2012]].<ref name=GuardApr14/> During the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, Farr was in charge of security, where he was behind the siting of missiles on the roofs of residential buildings in East London.<ref name=GuardApr14/>

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported in April 2014 that Farr was one of three people shortlisted for the role of [[Director of the Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ).<ref name=GuardApr14/>

In May 2014, Farr made a witness statement on behalf of the government and the three main intelligence agencies for the [[Investigatory Powers Tribunal]], in a legal case brought by advocacy groups including [[Privacy International]], [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] and [[Amnesty International]], explaining the legal basis for the interception of electronic communications under the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]].<ref name=farr-statement1>{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/privacyinternational.org/files/downloads/press-releases/witness_st_of_charles_blandford_farr.pdf |title=Witness: Charles Farr, Statement number 1 (to Investigatory Powers Tribunal) |author=Charles Balndford Farr |publisher=Privacy International |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618070805/https://www.privacyinternational.org/sites/privacyinternational.org/files/downloads/press-releases/witness_st_of_charles_blandford_farr.pdf# |archive-date=18 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=ft-20140617>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ee25c112-f628-11e3-a038-00144feabdc0.html |title=UK has power to monitor citizens on social media, says counter-terrorism chief |author1=Sam Jones |author2=Robert Cookson |newspaper=Financial Times |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> This was characterised in the media as an explanation of how the security services can legally monitor "Facebook, Google and Twitter" usage by UK citizens.<ref name=bbc-20140617>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27887639 |title=Google and Facebook can be legally intercepted, says UK spy boss |publisher=BBC |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20140617>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet-security/10905014/GCHQ-sanctions-spying-on-every-Facebook-Google-and-Twitter-user.html |title=GCHQ sanctions spying on every Facebook, Google and Twitter user |author=Rhiannon Williams |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20140617>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/17/mass-surveillance-social-media-permitted-uk-law-charles-farr |title=Social media mass surveillance is permitted by law, says top UK official |author=Owen Bowcott |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 June 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>

==Personality==
In a profile of Farr, ''The Guardian'' newspaper said that:
{{quote|The problem for some is that Farr is not a politician, answerable to parliament, and is certainly not a conventional civil servant. Instead, critics say, he has never stopped acting like a spy. The man who should be assessing recommendations from the security services and offering advice to policymakers, they say, behaves instead like MI6's man in government, driving forward policies that suit his hawkish agenda.<ref name=GuardApr14/>}}

The director of national security and resilience at the [[Royal United Services Institute]], Charlie Edwards, said that Farr is "...not just an effective operator in the field, he is one of the most committed civil servants you will come across... Yes, he is robust, but first and foremost he is fair and most importantly he gets the job done."<ref name=GuardApr14/> [[Shami Chakrabarti]], the director of the [[civil liberties]] [[advocacy organisation]] [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], described Farr as "...the only person ever to shout at me in the Home Office. I prefer awesome power to be wielded by humbler hands and officials to be both civil and servants."<ref name=GuardApr14/>

==Honours==
In the [[2003 New Year Honours]], Farr was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in recognition of his service as a First Secretary in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.<ref name="LG 31 December 2002">{{London Gazette |issue=56797 |date=31 December 2002 |page=24 |supp=y }}</ref> In the [[2010 New Year Honours]], he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in recognition of his service as a Counsellor in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.<ref name="LG 31 December 2009">{{London Gazette |issue=59282 |date=31 December 2009 |page=3 |supp=y }}</ref> Farr received a [[Knight Bachelor|Knighthood]] shortly before his death from cancer, aged 59.<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3214177</ref>
