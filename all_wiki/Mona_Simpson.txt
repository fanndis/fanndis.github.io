==Novels==
Simpson's novels are fictional and drawn from life experiences.<ref name="lisa" /><ref name="NYTimes_19970112">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/12/magazine/creating-jobs.html|title=Creating Jobs|first=Steve|last=Lohr|date=January 12, 1997|accessdate=October 27, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Her first novel, ''Anywhere But Here'' (1986), was a critical and popular success, winning a [[Whiting Awards|Whiting Award]]. In describing her intentions for the novel, Simpson stated: 
<blockquote>I wanted to write about American mythologies, American yearnings that might be responses, delayed or exaggerated but in some way typical, to the political and social truths of our part of the world in our century. But I wrote very personally about one family. I think it takes a long time before a crisis—like AIDS—enters the culture to a point where responses exist in a character, where personal gestures are both individual and resonant in a larger way.<ref>Meer, Ameena. [http://bombsite.com/issues/20/articles/947 "Mona Simpson Interview"], ''[[BOMB Magazine]],'' Summer 1987. Retrieved May 17, 2013.</ref></blockquote>It was adapted as the 1999 film ''[[Anywhere But Here (film)|Anywhere But Here]]'', starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Natalie Portman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/2010/01/09/author-spotlight-mona-simpson/|title=Author Spotlight: Mona Simpson|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref> Simpson published a sequel, [[The Lost Father (Novel)|''The Lost Father'']] (1992).

''A Regular Guy'' (1996) explores the strained relationship of a [[Silicon Valley]] tycoon with a daughter born out of wedlock, whom he did not acknowledge.<ref name="lisa">[http://www.lisabrennanjobs.net/2009/09/driving-jane.html Lisa Brennan-Jobs, "Driving Jane"], originally published in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]],'' Spring 1999], hosted at [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs]]' official website</ref><ref name="NYTimes_19970112" /> ''Off Keck Road'' (2000), portraying decades in the lives of three women in the Midwest, was a finalist for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]] and won the ''Chicago Tribune'' Heartland Prize. [[Stacey D'Erasmo]] said, "'Off Keck Road' marks the place where origin leaves off and improvisation begins".<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/reviews/001112.12deras.html?_r=1 Stacey D'Erasmo, "Life Is What Happens to Other People"], ''The New York Times'', 12 November 2000, accessed 24 October 2011</ref> ''My Hollywood'' was published in 2011. It explores the complex relationships, issues of class, and perspectives of two women, Claire, a European-American composer in her 30s and mother of one son, and Lola, her immigrant nanny from the [[Philippines]]. The nanny supports her own five children in the Philippines. The novel alternates between the voices of the two women, contrasting their worlds. Liesl Schillinger suggests that the novel is a "compassionate fictional exploration of this complicated global relationship, Simpson assesses the human cost that the child-care bargain exacts on the [[amah (mother)|amah]], on her employer and on the children of both."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/08/books/review/Schillinger-t.html Liesl Schillinger, Review: "For Love and Money"], ''The New York Times'', 8 August 2010, accessed 24 October 2011</ref>

[[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] says: 
<blockquote>What really invigorates this novel, though, is the way it alternates between Claire's chapters and chapters narrated by Lola, her 50-year-old Filipino nanny. I was worried early on that Lola would be a Southeast Asian version of the Magical Negro, who exists merely to help some self-absorbed white person reach enlightenment. But she's entirely her own wonderful, troubled character, and her relationship with Claire remains complex and unresolved.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/17/AR2010081705528.html "Book World: Mona Simpson's "My Hollywood," reviewed by Ron Charles"], ''The Washington Post'', 18 August 2010, accessed 24 October 2011</ref></blockquote>

== Education and teaching ==
Simpson was a good student as a child but was also "a clown" and "a smart aleck who used to make jokes in class. I did get in trouble a lot when I was older and then I didn't like school so much anymore."<ref name="conv" /> She attended [[Beverly Hills High School]]<ref name="Soderburg" /> and received a scholarship to attend [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied poetry:"I stuck with poetry as long as I could — as far as my talent would take me."<ref name="Soderburg" /> After she finished her B.A. at Berkeley, she worked at a job during the days and worked as a journalist during the nights and on the weekends. She enjoyed journalism and hoped for a position with the ''Richmond Independent Gazette'' but did not receive it. She then attended graduate school at [[Bard College]] and received her M.F.A from there. While a student at Bard College, she was an editor for ''[[Paris Review]].''<ref name="conv" /><ref name="bioms" />

In 1994, Simpson returned to Los Angeles area with her then-husband, Richard Appel.<ref name="Soderburg" /> In 2001, Simpson started teaching creative writing at [[UCLA]]; she also has an appointment at [[Bard College]] in New York state.<ref name="Soderburg" />

==Personal life==
[[File:Mona simpson 3401.JPG|thumb|Simpson at the National Book Festival in January 2014]]
Mona Jandali was born June 14, 1957 in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to an [[Arab]] father from [[Syria]] and a Swiss-German American mother. Her mother, Joanne Carole Schieble, was born August 1, 1932, and grew up [[Roman Catholic]] on a farm in Wisconsin.<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Her father, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, was born in [[Homs, Syria]] March 15, 1931.<ref name="sg" /> He is the son of a self-made millionaire who did not go to college and a mother who was a traditional housewife.<ref name="sg" /> Jandali was a student activist (and spent time in jail) while an undergraduate at the [[American University of Beirut]].<ref name="sg" /> Although he initially wanted to study law, he eventually decided to study economics and political science,<ref name="sg" /> and pursued a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]]. in [[Political science|Political Science]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin]]. It was there that he met Schieble<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="sg" /> (Jandali was Schieble's teacher although both were the same age).<ref name="conv" />

Simpson notes that Schieble's parents were not happy with the relationship: "it wasn't that he was Middle-Eastern so much as that he was a [[Muslim]]. But there are a lot of Arabs in Michigan and Wisconsin. So it's not that unusual."<ref name="conv" /> [[Walter Isaacson]], Steve Jobs' official biographer additionally states that Schieble's father "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.<ref name="JobsBio1">{{cite book|last = Isaacson|first = Walter|author-link = Walter Isaacson|title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|year = 2011|page = ebook|publisher = Simon & Schuster}}</ref> Regardless, while Jandali and Schieble were still unmarried students at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1954, she became pregnant after spending the summer with him and his family in [[Homs]], [[Syria]]. Given her parents' resistance to the relationship, Schieble decided to give the baby up for adoption. She traveled alone to San Francisco to work with a doctor who cared for unwed mothers and gave birth to a baby boy in 1955 (who was eventually adopted by a couple in San Francisco).<ref name="JobsBio1" /> He would grow up to be [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder, [[Steve Jobs]]. Six months after she gave the baby up for adoption, Schieble's father died. She then wed Jandali and gave birth to Mona.<ref name="JobsBio1" /><ref name="sg">{{cite web

Jandali states that after finishing his Ph.D., he returned to Syria to work and that it was during this period that Schieble left him.<ref name="sg" /> They divorced in 1962.<ref name="JobsBio1" /> He also states that after the divorce, he lost contact with his daughter for a period of time: "I also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact and I see her three times a year. I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida."<ref name="sg" /> A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name, thus becoming Mona Simpson. In 1970, after they divorced, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her on her own.<ref name="JobsBio1" />

After Jobs' adoptive mother, Clara, died of lung cancer in 1986, he met with Schieble (whom he had already found through an extensive search) for the first time. He then discovered that not only was Simpson his sister but that she also had no idea an older brother had been given up for adoption. Schieble then arranged for Jobs and Simpson to meet in New York where Simpson worked. She states that her first impression of Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy."<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk in order to get to know each other.<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Jobs later told his biographer that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me...as we got to know each other, we became really good friends and she is my family. I don't know what I'd do without her. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."<ref name="JobsBio1" />

Jobs told his official biographer that after meeting Simpson, he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs).<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and that "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper."<ref name="JobsBio1" /> After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands."<ref name="JobsBio1" /> However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me."<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve."<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.<ref name="JobsBio1" /> Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, ''[[The Lost Father]]''. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, ''A Regular Guy.''<ref name="JobsBio1" />

Simpson married the television writer and producer [[Richard Appel]] in 1993<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hofstrachronicle.com/news/author-mona-simpson-reads-from-newest-novel-on-campus-1.1264987| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712213527/http://www.hofstrachronicle.com/news/author-mona-simpson-reads-from-newest-novel-on-campus-1.1264987| url-status=dead| archive-date=2011-07-12| title=Author Mona Simpson reads from newest novel on campus| work=The Hofstra Chronicle| date=2010-03-11| accessdate=2010-03-12| author=Burciu, Andrea}}</ref> and had two children, Gabriel and Grace.<ref name="dad">{{cite news| url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/05/appelobit.html| title=Noted English Scholar, Author Alfred Appel Dies at Age 75| accessdate=2010-02-13| date=2009-05-05| publisher=[[Northwestern University]]| author=Charles R.
