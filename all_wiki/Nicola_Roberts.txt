'''Nicola Maria Roberts''' (born 5 October 1985) is an English singer and songwriter. She rose to prominence in late 2002 upon winning a place in [[Girls Aloud]], a [[girl group]] created through [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]''. The group's success helped them win the competition and they were later entered in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful reality television music-group. They enjoyed 20 consecutive top ten singles, spawning five albums and positive critical responses. 

In 2008, after releasing the pale skin make-up collection ''Dainty Doll'', Roberts advocated, in the documentary ''Nicola Roberts: The Truth About Tanning'', a ban on underage usage of tanning beds. Her public stance with a British MP led to a bill which banned under-18s from using tanning beds. In 2011, Roberts released her debut solo album, ''[[Cinderella's Eyes]],'' which peaked at number 17 on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and respectively produced the successful single "[[Beat of My Drum]]". Two follow-up singles, "[[Lucky Day (Nicola Roberts song)|Lucky Day]]" and "[[Yo-Yo (Nicola Roberts song)|Yo-Yo]]", both gained equally positive critical responses but failed commercially. In February 2020, Roberts won the first series of ITV's ''[[The Masked Singer (British TV series)|The Masked Singer UK]]'', masked as Queen Bee.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], when her mother was 17.<ref name="dtg1">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=218}}</ref> At the time of her birth, her father was working for the [[RAF]] and the resulting pay led to financial struggles which saw her father move to work for the [[Ford of Britain|Ford]] Motor Company whilst her mother became a photographer to help the family monetary problems.<ref name="dtg1"/> Roberts grew up in [[Runcorn, Cheshire]].<ref name="dtg1"/>

She attended [[St Chad's Catholic and Church of England High School|St Chad's High School]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/whats-on/film-tv/girls-aloud-star-nicola-roberts-5189983 |title=Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts, of Runcorn, to front Alder Hey charity appeal |last=Chronicle |first=Chester |date=17 August 2011 |work=chesterchronicle |access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref> In school Roberts found herself shying away, in contrast to her home life where she was outgoing, even gaining the nickname 'Cilla' (after singer [[Cilla Black]]) from her family.<ref name="dtg1"/> Academically, Roberts performed well, leaving with nine [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], but she declared her dislike of school and began discussing a musical career which led her to work with several girl groups recording demo tracks in several cases.<ref name="dtg2">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=220}}</ref> Roberts acknowledged she had always wanted to be a singer and had been entering competitions and auditions with her father accompanying her and gaining support from other family members also.<ref name="dtg3">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=217}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]]'' magazine, Roberts spoke about how she began her musical career at a local disco, as part of a girl band called The 5 Musketeers.<ref name="closer">{{cite web |url=http://www.closeronline.co.uk/RealLife/Reallifestories/nicola-ward-story-the-girl-who-turned-down-girls-aloud.aspx |title=Nicola Ward, Story of the girl who turned down Girls Aloud |last=Kadri |first=Anisa |date=23 August 2010 |work=[[Closer (magazine)|Closer]] |accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref>

==Music career==

=== Early career ===
Still a teenager, Roberts auditioned for the reality television series ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]''. Participants checked into a hotel in [[Kensington]], London, before performing to a panel of celebrity judges; Roberts found that, up to that point, she "didn't really have much life experience".<ref name="dtg4">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=21}}</ref> During the auditions she coincidentally sat next to [[Kimberley Walsh]], who was to complete the competition to become one of five in the final line-up of the girl group; the two spent time rehearsing before their solo audition.<ref name="dtg4"/> Roberts felt confident before the audition, but during the actual audition she was "terrified" and was unable to smile until celebrity judge [[Geri Halliwell]] complimented her performance stating "I think you're great, you're an individual, you really stand out".<ref name="dream4">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=22}}</ref> Roberts found her clothing and personality were different from those of the other participants in ''Popstars: The Rivals''; most were well-trained vocalists and were well-dressed, while her clothing was less fashionable, due to lack of funds, and she was not as vocally well-trained as the others.<ref name="dream4"/>

Having progressed in the competition, Roberts was left as one of 15 remaining participants but found that the reality show was becoming increasingly based on personality instead of vocals.<ref name="dream4"/> She found her personality to be more concealed than others', but was "confident" with her performances.<ref name="dtg6">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=23}}</ref> One notable incident during the competition was when a show-producer expressed to her mother that Roberts would not win, for she was not "outrageous" or as outgoing as others stating that vocals were secondary. This left her mother shocked by the politics of the show.<ref name="dtg6"/> After the final ten participants were selected Roberts was eliminated from the competition, but in the following weeks after participant Nicola Ward quit, she was enlisted as a wild-card to return to the show – despite reservations from judge [[Louis Walsh]], who did not back her return. However, he was overruled by judges Geri Halliwell and [[Pete Waterman]].<ref name="dtg7">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=28}}</ref><ref name="closer" /> Roberts then made it through to the final where she sang the track "[[I'm So Excited]]" by [[the Pointer Sisters]]. She was the second contestant to be selected for the group, after [[Cheryl Tweedy]].<ref name="dtg10">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=60}}</ref> That night the group was formed, and a party involving promotional photographs saw their introduction to manager John McMahon, who would become more of a personal friend for the group.<ref name="dtg11">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=63}}</ref>

Roberts described her time on the show ''Popstars: The Rivals'' and her successes within the show:<ref name="dtg9">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=59}}</ref> "Every week before I went on stage I used to go to the toilet, to the same cubicle, and pray, just ask God to please let me have this. Even though I was confident in my singing ability, and I knew I had a stronger voice than most at the time same time I still had a little bit of insecurity because I'd been told Louis didn't want me. I was never in the bottom two, though, and the producers told me I always came in the top two or three in terms of votes each week, which was great."

After their formation on ''Popstars: The Rivals'', the group [[Girls Aloud]] went on to record their debut single and music video. In addition to that, a large stint of publicity left the group exhausted, since McMahon continually pressured them to promote the single "[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]".<ref name="dtg12">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=65}}</ref> At this point, the competition with ''Popstars: The Rivals'' was still ongoing with the two groups; Girls Aloud and [[One True Voice]] competing to outsell each other with their debut single releases.<ref name="dtg13">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=70}}</ref> Girls Aloud ultimately won the competition with their single topping the [[UK Singles Chart]] and gaining a record deal from [[Polydor]] Records. In the following days, however, news broke that McMahon had died in a car accident, shortly after texting Roberts, who was too busy to respond.<ref name="dtg19">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=78}}</ref> The death of McMahon had a large impact on Roberts, who found herself increasingly emotionally unstable; it came at a time when she moved in with bandmate Cheryl Tweedy, this being the first time she had lived without her family.<ref name="dtg14">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=95}}</ref> Thus, at this time Roberts was under great stress; the biggest problem, though, was the constant media criticism of her image, in which critics labelled her "unattractive".<ref name="dtg15">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=100}}</ref>

Girls Aloud as a group enjoyed many successes, including two entries into the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for "Most Successful Reality Television Group" and "Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a female group".<ref name="dtgb">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=308}}</ref> In addition to this, the band gathered five [[BRIT Award]] nominations, winning Best British Single in 2009 for "[[The Promise (Girls Aloud song)|The Promise]]".<ref name="dtgc">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=312}}</ref> The group earned four UK number one singles, twenty consecutive UK top ten singles and critically they have been well-received with most albums, although Roberts found at times critical opinion was "less than desirable".<ref name="dtge">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=171}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Sound of the Underground (Girls Aloud album)|Sound of the Underground]]'', peaked at number two in the UK and was certified Platinum. Their second album, ''[[What Will the Neighbours Say?]]'', was certified double Platinum and peaked at number six. The third album, ''[[Chemistry (Girls Aloud album)|Chemistry]]'', saw a critical improvement, but failed to enter the UK top ten. The fourth album, ''[[Tangled Up (Girls Aloud album)|Tangled Up]]'', became another Platinum-certified album, peaking at number four. Finally, their fifth record, ''[[Out of Control (Girls Aloud album)|Out of Control]]'', became their first studio album to reach number one in the UK.<ref name="dtge"/><ref name="dtgd">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=173}}</ref> In 2009, Girls Aloud took a break after embarking on their 2009 [[Out of Control Tour]] in support of the ''Out of Control'' album – which became their most extensive tour – and following this, each member took time to work on solo projects.<ref name="dream2">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=250}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Despite a large amount of success as part of Girls Aloud, Roberts found time away from her family increasingly difficult; but, after her parents divorced and conflicts with her boyfriend, she found herself in a depressed state.<ref name="dtg15" /> Her hectic schedule led her to dissolve relations with family members and, after stating her frustration at her living situation, she started frequently returning to her home town of [[Runcorn, Cheshire]].<ref name="dtg16">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=101}}</ref> Her work life and home life saw her split into two different personalities; despite appreciating a career in the music industry, the conflicts with her personal life made her question her career.<ref name="dtg16" />

Throughout her music career Roberts was coping with [[hypoglycemia]] which restricted what foods she could eat; whilst spending time on the road touring, she found it difficult not to indulge in convenience food.<ref name="dtg20">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=138}}</ref> Her illness was diagnosed after extensive touring in which time Roberts complained of weakness and sickness which made it difficult to perform live concerts. Whilst she performed on Girls Aloud's [[Tangled Up Tour]], Roberts' dog Elvis died just months after he was given as a gift to her. She found his death troubling and struggled to cope as she was on tour at the time.

In 2007, Roberts started a limited production of a make-up range called Dainty Doll aimed at the pale-skinned market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/11081904/nicola-roberts-relaunches-dainty-doll-make-up-range |title=Nicola Roberts relaunches Dainty Doll make-up range |date=25 August 2010}}</ref>

==Activism==

===Anti-tanning===
At the start of her music career Roberts began to note that other girls were dressing more "glamorous" than she did, and at the age of 16 during her auditions for ''Popstars: The Rivals'', she wished to look like them.<ref name="dream4"/> At these times she would feel unattractive due to her pale complexion, and soon began using fake tan to darken her skin tone into what she later described as a "dirty mess" but at the time made her feel more attractive.<ref name="dtg15"/> Due to her pale skin tone Roberts found herself easily burning in the sun, which led to chronic pain; during the shoot of the Girls Aloud single "[[Love Machine (Girls Aloud song)|Love Machine]]" she had trouble filming due to severe burns which left her wanting to visit the hospital.<ref name="dream6">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=297}}</ref> During her time with Girls Aloud she filmed a television special titled ''Passions'' for which she travelled to [[Taiwan]] where she learnt about natural skin products, something she had been interested in due to her pale complexion and led her to develop the make-up line Dainty Doll.<ref name="dream5">{{harvnb|Roberts|2009|p=293}}</ref> Following this Roberts began a stance against tanning, which saw her produce and star in a [[BBC Three]] investigative documentary titled ''Nicola Roberts: The Truth About Tanning'' in which she revealed her own personal tanning issues and those of men and women throughout the UK who have excessively used [[tanning bed]]s.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qmvp9 |title=Nicola Roberts: The Truth About Tanning |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> She met with families of individuals who had died from [[melanoma]],<ref name="bbc"/> which encouraged Roberts to become an advocate for the banning of underage usage of tanning beds. With the help of [[Julie Morgan]], a member of the [[National Assembly for Wales]], she produced a bill in support of the ban.<ref name="bbc2">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/8455142.stm |title=Government and Girls Aloud star back under-18 tan ban |publisher=BBC News |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> At the launch of the bill Roberts said "Going into the streets of Liverpool and interviewing the young girls who are obsessed with having a tan and feeling like they had to be brown to be seen as attractive, that whole mentality that they had gathered was just a bigger problem than I ever thought it was."<ref name="bbc2"/>

===Anti-bullying===
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "The internet has really highlighted this issue. It shows us how easy it is for people to pass judgement on others and it also shows us that people now have a place for expression. Whether it be twitter or blog posts it gives people a place to offload. Whenever I have bought somebody's record I always flick through and search for the ones that I really relate to at that time, they become my favourites, I play that song to death and then the rest of the album gets its chance. Music is there to milk an emotion I think. Whether it be a party track when you want to feel sky high or an emotional song when you need something to draw out how you feel inside. That's my sticks+stones and it's so comforting to know that it's yours too. I'm going to try my best to speak to Michael Gove the educational secretary about how we can work out a better support system in schools for people finding themselves in unbearable situations every time they walk through the school gate… I'll keep you posted on that. Wish me luck!

After winning ''Popstars: The Rivals'', becoming one fifth of Girls Aloud, Roberts soon found herself subject to bullying.<ref name="mirror">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/09/27/nicola-roberts-i-was-bullied-for-four-years-over-the-way-i-looked-115875-23448643/|title=Nicola Roberts: I was bullied for four years over the way I looked|last=Moodie|first=Clemmie|date=27 September 2011|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> She was branded "the ugly one" of the group, and would often "cry herself to sleep" finding herself to be a victim of "faceless" bullying fuelled by celebrities such as [[Chris Moyles]] and [[Lily Allen]].<ref name="mirror"/> Soon after the comments had an effect on her mental stability after suffering from an "identity crisis" the taunts brought her close to a breakdown leaving her feeling "miserable and confused" and finding comfort in alcohol.<ref name="mirror"/> Prior to her fame Roberts never found flaws with her red hair calling it a "prized possession" but after critics picked on her image she saw it as a flaw with Roberts explaining "I hated it and I hated people judging me. I'd put on the telly and there'd be someone saying something cruel, or I'd open up a magazine and read it. Normal people don't have people telling them day to day they're ugly or miserable. [...] I'd think, "stop being so vain, you've got this amazing job" but it wasn't enough. It didn't stop me feeling bad".<ref name="dtg15"/> "People feel they can say nasty things and have anonymity behind the net – as they did with all the nasty comments about me – without fear of recrimination", Roberts said, and five years after the bullying she found herself in a "better place", with critics commenting on her image positively with writers such as Clemmie Moodie from British newspaper ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' saying "the 25-year-old radiates confidence and, with a string of fashion successes has blossomed."<ref name="mirror"/>

Roberts then wrote the track "[[Sticks and Stones (Nicola Roberts song)|Sticks + Stones]]" in response to these times, finding herself cautioned by the serious subject matter, she wanted to write a track that was not self-indulgent featuring a "universal" chorus" and lyrics such as "I was too young for so many things. Yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly".<ref name="mirror"/> After the release of her debut album ''Cinderella's Eyes'', which featured the track, Roberts appeared on the British television show ''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' to discuss bullying in relation to the track.<ref name="holymoly">{{cite web |url=http://www.holymoly.com/music/blog/guest-blog-nicola-roberts-lucky-day-sticks-and-stones59544 |title=Guest Blog: Nicola Roberts, Lucky Day, Sticks + Stones |last=Roberts |first=Nicola |work=Holy Moly |accessdate=8 October 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924234140/http://www.holymoly.com/music/blog/guest-blog-nicola-roberts-lucky-day-sticks-and-stones59544 |archive-date=24 September 2011}}</ref> Soon afterward she advocated the issue on [[BBC News]]; in an interview she discussed the lyrical themes of the track, and during the interview named social networking site Twitter as being a tool which highlights the severity of the issue of bullying, finding the problem to be "out of control" in a schooling environment.<ref name="bbcnews">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15124477 |title=Nicola Roberts: 'Twitter highlights bullying problem' |publisher=BBC News |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> Roberts continued to advocate on the issue of bullying; in an interview given to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', she stated she was "sick" of an image-driven society.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/blogs/thread-count/nicola-roberts-one-fifth-of-britains-biggest-girl-group-talks-solo-record-and-style-ambitions-20111011 |title=Nicola Roberts, One-Fifth of Britain's Biggest Girl Group, Talks Solo Record and Style Ambitions |last=Nika |first=Colleen |date=11 October 2011 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> After her success with the anti-tanning bill Roberts took a similar stance with bullying saying "it doesn't need to happen" and found that British laws were failing to combat the issue with Roberts saying "People are still scared to go to school, kids are threatening to kill themselves; it's disgusting that it persists. So, again, I'm giving a voice to a cause, to hopefully affect change."<ref name="rollingstone"/> Roberts then progressed to the British education secretary [[Michael Gove]] to raise the issue.<ref name="bbcnews"/>
