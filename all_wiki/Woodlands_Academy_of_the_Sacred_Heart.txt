'''Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart''' (''Woodlands'', ''WA'', or ''WASH'') is a [[private school|private]], [[Roman Catholic]] [[single sex education|girls']] [[high school]] in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], north of [[Chicago]]. Founded by the [[Society of the Sacred Heart]], it is located in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] but is run by lay staff with several Sisters sitting on the Board of Trustees.

==History==
The Convent of the Sacred Heart was established in 1858 by Mother Margaret Crawley [[Society of the Sacred Heart|RSCJ]].<ref name="School Mission Statement">{{cite web|url=http://www.woodlandsacademy.org/about/mission.asp| title=School Mission Statement| access-date=2007-05-11| publisher=Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart}}</ref> In 1860 it moved to its new premises in Taylor Street and was renamed Academy of the Sacred Heart. In 1904, the Sisters moved the school to [[Lake Forest, Illinois]], on the outskirts of [[Chicago]]. The now-defunct [[Barat College]] was founded in 1918 and the college and academy shared the large "Old Main" building. In 1961 the present name "Woodlands Academy" was adopted following a restructuring of the elementary and secondary schools. Donors later purchased the premises of the former Barat College and donated it to the academy, reuniting the campus with its roots.<ref>[http://www.woodlandsacademy.org/about_woodlands/our_history/index.aspx Our History]</ref>
