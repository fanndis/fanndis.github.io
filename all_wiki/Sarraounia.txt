== Biography ==
''Sarraounia'' means ''queen'' or ''female chief'' in the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] language. Among the predominately animist Azna people of [[Lougou]] and surrounding Hausa towns and villages, the term refers to a lineage of female rulers who exercised both political and religious power.<ref name="alou2009"/> Sarraounia Mangou was the most famous of the Sarraounias due to her resistance against French colonial troops at the [[Battle of Lougou]] in 1899. While most chiefs in Niger pragmatically submitted to French power,<ref name="alou2009"/> Sarraounia Mangou mobilized her people and resources to confront the French forces of the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]], which [[Battle of Lougou|launched a fierce attack on her fortress capital of Lougou]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Hares Sayed |title=War, Violence, Terrorism, and Our Present World: A Timeline of Modern Politics |publisher=[[Xlibris]] |year=2017 |isbn=978-1543419009}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=March 2020}}

Overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the French, she and her fighters retreated from the fortress, and engaged the attackers in a protracted guerrilla battle which eventually forced the French to abandon their project of subduing her.
<!--According to native oral history she was a witch with pure yellow eyes who could hurl fire at the invaders and even summon fog to help them get away from the french army.
its said her magical charms erased her troops footsteps from the battle field and any crops that were blazed to ash regrew overnight with more than enough food to keep the warriors going.{{citation needed}}-->

The 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' is a retelling of her struggle against Voulet and Chanoine's troops.
