The '''2020 Belarusian protests''' are a series of ongoing [[Demonstration (political)|political demonstrations]] and [[protests]] against the [[Government of Belarus|Belarusian government]] and President [[Alexander Lukashenko]].<ref name="Shkliarov" /><ref name="Hrydzin">{{cite web |last=Hrydzin |first=Uladz |date=25 May 2020 |title=Belarusians Protest Against Lukashenka's Run For a Sixth Term As President |url= https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-protests-politcs/30632716.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}</ref> The largest antigovernmental protests in Belarus' history, the demonstrations began in the lead-up to and during the [[2020 Belarusian presidential election|2020 presidential election]], in which Lukashenko sought his sixth term in office.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="Hrydzin" /> In response to the demonstrations, a number of relatively small pro-government rallies were held.<ref name="F24Sun" />

Initially moderate, the protests intensified nationwide after official election results were announced on the night of 10 August, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner. [[Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya]], the main opponent of Lukashenko, rejected these results as falsified and claimed instead to have received 60–70% of the votes. On 14 August, she announced the creation of the [[Coordination Council]], with membership applications open to all Belarusians who also agreed that the official election had been falsified.<ref name="BBC148" /><ref name="OKOpress_council_conditions" /> On 12 October, the Coordination Council issued Lukashenko an ultimatum to cease all repression, free detainees and step down from the presidency by 25 October. After Lukashenko failed to comply, nationwide strikes began on 26 October.

On 23 September, Belarusian state media announced that Lukashenko had been inaugurated for another five-year term in a brief ceremony.<ref name="BBC inauguration" /> The following day, the EU published a statement which rejected the legitimacy of the election, called for new elections, and condemning the repression and violence against the protesters.<ref>https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2020/09/24/belarus-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-the-so-called-inauguration-of-aleksandr-lukashenko/</ref> On 2 October, the EU introduced sanctions against 40 Belarusian officials accused of political repression and vote rigging.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/belarus-officials-eu-sanctions-lukashenko</ref> Lukashenko himself was not included on the list. The Belarusian government responded by imposing symmetrical sanctions against an undisclosed list of EU officials.<ref name="EU_Bel_sanctions"/> Moreover, Lukashenko accused the EU and other "Western organizations" of trying to "harm Belarus" by destabilizing the current regime while supporting the opposition.

The protesters have faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the [[United Nations Human Rights Office]] on 1 September cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape.<ref name="UN_1_September_statement" />

==Background==

Nina!" and fought over her while other activists attempted to tear off the masks of police officers. As a result of clashes 69 people were detained in police vans (according to Viasna).

[[File:2020 Belarusian protests — Minsk, 13 September p0007.jpg|thumb|right|"Heroes March" in Minsk, 13 September 2020]]
On 13 September, the "Heroes March" rally took place in Minsk. Police presence at major city arteries was felt in the morning, aided by OMON military carriers and unmarked personnel. Any bystanders met with opposition symbols were hastily detained. A large police van accidentally ran into a passenger car and drew attention to itself. Reinforced cordons were placed at exits from metro stations, streets and lanes in the central area of the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsru.com/world/13sep2020/byminskonsunday.html |title=Военные и бронетехника снова стянуты в центр Минска.

Individuals trying to break police cordons were severely beaten and then detained. Residents of Malinovka, Moskovsky and other districts decided to amass at metro station "Grushevka" in an attempt to lure police in while the initial column moved towards the centre. Around Renaissance Hotel, protesters were met with another police barrier, this time followed by military personnel in carriers who issued a warning to open fire. A crowd of women came forward and stood in a chain in hopes to persuade OMON, but officers indifferently beat up protesters of both sexes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://people.onliner.by/2020/09/13/zachem-vy-eto-delaete |title=Милиционер ударил женщину в Жодино, жесткие задержания в Минске |publisher=onliner.by |date=13 September 2020 |language=ru}}</ref> Seeing how the forces blocked off central districts of the capital, some of the protesters decided to get to the city centre by public transport and thus succeeded in occupying Nemiga St by the early afternoon. The majority of them decided to go to Independence Ave through Zybitskaya St, but pro-government provocateurs from within the crowd gave false direction in hopes of splitting the crowd. As result, the crowd has initially split on Victors Ave until a larger rally came from Drozdy, forcing police to use truncheons, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades in order to stop them.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5f5e3e789a79476a80055d4d |title=Рядом с домом главы ЦИК Белоруссии применили светошумовую гранату |publisher=rbc.ru |date=13 September 2020 |language=ru}}</ref> With mass detentions being carried out at that time, some protesters tried to help detainees free themselves from police.

According to Russia's press service statement issued on 19 August 2020, "Russia pointed out that foreign attempts to interfere in the country’s domestic affairs were unacceptable and could further escalate tensions".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Putin tells Merkel foreign interference in Belarus' affairs is unacceptable|url=https://tass.com/politics/1190881|access-date=19 August 2020|website=TASS}}</ref> As Georgy Saralidze, advisor to the director of the [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]] on program policy, noted in an interview with Vestnik Kavkaza that western countries had been striving to isolate Belarus away from Russia for several years. "The main goal is to prevent the expansion of the [[Union State]], and ideally just to destroy it. What Vladimir Putin said to Merkel and Macron is a very symptomatic thing, because now there are attacks that Russia allegedly interferes in the affairs of Belarus. Moreover, there are no statements on the part of Russia, apart from the recognition of the election results. If you call it interference, then those who do not recognize the election also interfere in the affairs of Belarus."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Москва призвала Париж и Берлин не вмешиваться в дела Беларуси|url=https://vestikavkaza.ru/news/makron-ekstrenno-pozvonil-putinu-po-belarusi.html|access-date=19 August 2020|website=vestikavkaza.ru|language=ru-RU}}</ref>

==Support for victims==
Unregistered candidate [[Valery Tsepkalo]] created a non-profit organization "Belarus of the future". The primary goal of the program is to support citizens of Belarus who have suffered from political repression. Tsepkalo was not the first who started supporting them.
