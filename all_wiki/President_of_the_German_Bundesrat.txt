{{PoliticsGermany}}
In Germany, the '''President of the Bundesrat''' or '''President of the Federal Council''' (German: ''Bundesratspräsident'') is the chairperson or speaker of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (Federal Council). He or she is elected by the Bundesrat for a term of one year (usually from November 1 to October 31 in the next year). Traditionally, the Presidency of the Bundesrat rotates among the [[Minister President (Germany)|leaders of the sixteen state governments]] (most of them hold the title Minister President, the head of government of [[Berlin]] holds the title [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor]], the head of government of [[Hamburg]] holds the title [[First Mayor of Hamburg|First Mayor]] and the head of government of [[Bremen]] holds the title [[List of mayors of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor]]). This is however only an established praxis, theoretically the Bundesrat is free to elect any member it chooses, and a President could also be re-elected (which has happened once). As well as acting as a chairperson the President of the Bundesrat is ''ex officio'' deputy of the [[President of Germany]].

The President of the Bundesrat convenes and chairs plenary sessions of the body and is formally responsible for representing the Federal Republic in the Bundesrat. He or she is aided by two vice-presidents who play an advisory role and deputise in the president's absence. The three together constitute the Präsidium of the Bundesrat.

The current President of the Bundesrat is [[Reiner Haseloff]], the [[Minister President (Germany)|Minister President]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]], whose one-year term started on 1 November 2020.

==Election==
The President of the Bundesrat usually is elected during the last session of a Bundesrat's year of business in October of a given year, and serves for the following year of business, starting on November 1 and ending on 31 October in the year that follows. The [[Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] merely provides, in Article 52.1, that "the Bundesrat elects its President for one year". However, in practice the position rotates among the states equally, in accordance with a predetermined order. The order in which the position rotates from one ''Land'' to another is altered periodically and is determined by population, the presidency descending in order from the most populous states to the least. This rotation is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] known as the “Königstein agreement” (''Königsteiner Vereinbarung''), having been formulated at a 1950 seating in [[Königstein im Taunus]], Hessen.

The ''Königsstein agreement'' also states that, if the sitting President of the Bundesrat exits his office as Minister President of his or her state (for example, if they loses a state election, dies or resigns from his office) the new Minister President of that state is elected President of the Bundesrat subsequently, but only to complete his or her predecessors term; the last time this occurred was in April 1999, when [[Hans Eichel]], President of the Bundesrat and Minister President of [[Hesse]], had lost the [[1999 Hesse state election]] and his successor [[Roland Koch]] served the end of his term until October 1999. The current order of rotation of the presidency of the Bundesrat - related to the number of inhabitants, from highest to lowest - is as follows:

#[[North Rhine-Westphalia]]
#[[Bavaria]]
#[[Baden-Württemberg]]
#[[Lower Saxony]]
#[[Hesse]]
#[[Saxony]]
#[[Rhineland-Palatinate]]
#[[Berlin]]
#[[Schleswig-Holstein]]
#[[Brandenburg]]
#[[Saxony-Anhalt]]
#[[Thuringia]]
#[[Hamburg]]
#[[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]
#[[Saarland]]
#[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]

==Deputy to the Federal President==
Article 57 of the Basic Law provides that:

:If the Federal President is unable to perform his duties, or if his office falls prematurely vacant, the President of the Bundesrat shall exercise his powers.

If the office of the Federal President falls vacant, the President of the Bundesrat fills in as acting [[head of state]].  If the president resigns, dies, or is removed from office, a successor is elected within thirty days.

Three Presidents of the Bundesrat have served as acting head of state:
# [[Karl Arnold]] (from 7 September 1949 to 12 September 1949 after he was elected as President of the Bundesrat and before [[Theodor Heuss]] was elected as the first [[President of Germany]]. With a tenure of only six days he is yet the shortest serving head of state in [[German history]])
# [[Jens Böhrnsen]] (from 31 May 2010 to 30 June 2010 after the resignation of [[Horst Köhler]] and before the election of [[Christian Wulff]])
# [[Horst Seehofer]] (from 17 February 2012 to 18 March 2012 after the resignation of [[Christian Wulff]] and before the election of [[Joachim Gauck]])
If the Federal President is abroad on a state visit the President of the Bundesrat does not assume all of the Federal President's responsibilities but may "deputise" for him or her, performing on the Federal President's behalf merely those tasks that require his or her physical presence, such as the signing of documents.
