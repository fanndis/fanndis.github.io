'''''Selma''''' is a 2014 [[List of historical period drama films|historical]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Ava DuVernay]] and written by Paul Webb. It is based on the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|1965 Selma to Montgomery voting rights marches]] initiated and directed by [[James Bevel]]<ref>"James L. Bevel The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement" by Randy Kryn, a paper in [[David Garrow]]'s 1989 book ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'', Carlson Publishing Company.</ref><ref>Randy Kryn, [http://cfm40.middlebury.edu/node/287 "Movement Revision Research Summary Regarding James Bevel"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174523/http://cfm40.middlebury.edu/node/287 |date=March 3, 2016 }}, published by [[Middlebury College]], October 2005.</ref> and led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Hosea Williams]], and [[John Lewis]]. The film stars actors [[David Oyelowo]] as King, [[Tom Wilkinson]] as President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Tim Roth]] as [[George Wallace]], [[Carmen Ejogo]] as [[Coretta Scott King]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Bevel.

''Selma'' premiered at the [[American Film Institute]] Festival on November 11, 2014, began a limited US release on December 25, and expanded into wide theatrical release on January 9, 2015, two months before the 50th anniversary of the march. The film was re-released on March 20, 2015 in honor of the 50th anniversary of the historical march.

''Selma'' received critical acclaim, with particular praise given to DuVernay's direction and Oyelowo's performance, though it was met with some criticism for its historical inaccuracies, largely centered on the perceived vilification of Johnson and the omission of several prominent Jewish civil rights leaders. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and won [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[87th Academy Awards]]. It also received four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor]], and won for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-announced-updated-1201376916/|title=Golden Globe: 'Birdman,' 'Boyhood' and 'Imitation Game' Top Nominations|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 11, 2014|access-date=December 11, 2014|archive-date=January 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106055547/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-announced-updated-1201376916/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Plot==
In 1964, Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) accepts his [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Four black girls walking down stairs in the [[Birmingham, Alabama]] [[16th Street Baptist Church]] are killed by a [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|bomb]] set by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  [[Annie Lee Cooper]] attempts to register to vote in [[Selma, Alabama]] but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. 
King travels to Selma with [[Ralph Abernathy]], [[Andrew Young]], [[James Orange]], and [[Diane Nash]]. [[James Bevel]] greets them, and other [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] activists appear. FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests they disrupt his marriage. [[Coretta Scott King]] has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer [[Mahalia Jackson]] to inspire him with a song.

King, other SCLC leaders, and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]] to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others.

Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] speaks out against the movement. Coretta meets with [[Malcolm X]], who says he will drive whites to ally with King by advocating a more extreme position. Wallace and [[Al Lingo]] decide to use force at an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama, using [[State police|state troopers]] to assault the marchers. A group of protesters runs into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in, beat and shoot [[Jimmie Lee Jackson]]. King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to ask people to continue to fight for their rights. King receives harassing phone calls with a recording of [[sexual activity]] implied to be him and another woman leading to an argument with Coretta; she knows it is a fabrication but the strain of constant death threats has taken its toll on her. King is criticized by members of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC.)

As the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#First Selma-to-Montgomery March|Selma to Montgomery march]] is about to begin, King talks to Young about canceling it, but Young convinces King to persevere. The marchers, including [[John Lewis]] of SNCC, [[Hosea Williams]] of SCLC, and Selma activist [[Amelia Boynton]], cross the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back, and when the marchers hold their ground, the troopers attack with clubs, horses, [[tear gas]], and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television as the wounded are treated at [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel]], the movement's headquarter church.

Movement attorney [[Fred Gray (attorney)|Fred Gray]] asks federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson]] to let the march go forward. President Johnson demands that King and Wallace cease their activities, and sends [[John Doar]] to convince King to postpone the next march. White Americans, including [[Viola Liuzzo]] and [[James Reeb]], arrive to join the second march. Marchers cross the bridge again and see the state troopers lined up, but the troopers turn aside to let them pass. King, after praying, turns around and leads the group away, and again comes under sharp criticism from SNCC activists. That evening, Reeb is beaten to death by a white mob on a street in Selma.

Judge Johnson allows the march. President Johnson speaks before a [[Joint session of the United States Congress#Historic joint sessions|Joint Session of Congress]] to ask for quick passage of a [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|bill to eliminate restrictions on voting]], praising the courage of the activists. The march on the highway to Montgomery takes place, and, when the marchers reach Montgomery, King [[How Long, Not Long|delivers a speech]] on the steps of the [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol]].

On June 18, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that screenwriter Paul Webb had written an original story about Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon B.

DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles. While she did not think she would "get anywhere close to just the beauty and that nuance of his speech patterns", she did identify some of King's basic structure, such as a tendency to speak in triplets (saying one thing in three different ways).<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-how-selma-filmmakers-made-755242|title = Oscars: How 'Selma' Filmmakers Made a Movie About MLK Without Using His Words|last1 = Appelo|first1 = Tim|date = December 16, 2014|work = The Hollywood Reporter|last2 = Golloway|first2 = Stephen|access-date = April 17, 2020|archive-date = March 5, 2020|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200305093523/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-how-selma-filmmakers-made-755242|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=371479848|title = A Vital Chapter Of American History On Film In 'Selma'|last = Norris|first = Michele|date = December 23, 2014|publisher = NPR|access-date = April 4, 2018|archive-date = June 23, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623150001/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=371479848|url-status = live}}</ref> In early 2014, [[Oprah Winfrey]] came on board as a producer along with Pitt,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shaw|first1=Lucas|title=Oprah Winfrey Joins Brad Pitt as Producer of Mlk Drama 'Selma'|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oprah-winfrey-joins-brad-pitt-producer-mlk-drama-selma/|publisher=thewrap.com|date=January 19, 2014|access-date=June 4, 2014|archive-date=June 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140614160649/http://www.thewrap.com/oprah-winfrey-joins-brad-pitt-producer-mlk-drama-selma/|url-status=live}}</ref> and by February 25 [[Paramount Pictures]] was in final negotiations for the US and Canadian distribution rights.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fleming |first1=Mike Jr. |title=Paramount To Make Mlk Pic 'Selma'; Oprah Winfrey Producing |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/02/selma-mlk-movie-paramount-oprah-winfrey/ |publisher=deadline.com |date=February 25, 2014 |access-date=June 4, 2014 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704025445/http://www.deadline.com/2014/02/selma-mlk-movie-paramount-oprah-winfrey/ |url-status=live }}</ref> DuVernay did not receive screenwriting credit due to a stipulation within Webb's original contract, which gave Webb the sole credit.<ref name="The Wrap: screenplay controversy"/>

According to Young, the two were always mutually respectful, and King respected Johnson's political problems.<ref>{{cite news|title='Selma' sets off a controversy amid Oscar buzz|author=Tumulty, Karen|date=December 31, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/selma-sets-off-a-controversy-amid-oscar-buzz/2014/12/31/7551108e-9100-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=January 22, 2015|archive-date=January 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127144425/http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/selma-sets-off-a-controversy-amid-oscar-buzz/2014/12/31/7551108e-9100-11e4-ba53-a477d66580ed_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On television, Young pointed out that it was US Attorney General [[Robert F.

Some Jews who marched with King at Selma wrote that the film omits any mention of the Jews who contributed significantly to the civil rights movement, “airbrushing” Jews out of the film, particularly Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], who appeared in news photos at the front of the march with King.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joseph|first1=Peniel|author-link=Peniel E.

Director DuVernay and US Representative [[John Lewis]], who is portrayed in the film marching with King during the civil rights movement, responded separately that the film ''Selma'' is a work of art about the people of Selma, not a documentary. DuVernay said in an interview that she did not see herself as "a custodian of anyone's legacy".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ifill|first1=Gwen|title=Director Ava DuVernay on sharing the story of 'Selma' and deconstructing American heroes|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/director-ava-duvernay-sharing-story-selma-deconstructing-american-heroes/|publisher=PBS|date=January 8, 2015|access-date=January 20, 2015|archive-date=January 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119195715/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/director-ava-duvernay-sharing-story-selma-deconstructing-american-heroes/|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to criticisms that she rewrote history to portray her own agenda, DuVernay said that the movie is "not a documentary.
