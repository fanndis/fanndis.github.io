== History ==
The company has its origins in several independent warehouse and transportation management companies in the [[United States]] which were acquired in 1985 by [[National Freight Corporation|NFC plc]] (formerly the National Freight Corporation, the [[nationalisation|nationalised]] [[transportation]] business in the United Kingdom created by the [[Attlee ministry|post war Labour government]]).<ref name=mustoe>{{cite web |url=http://www.nynehead-books.co.uk/description.php?II=1495 |title=Gordon Mustoe, '&#39;BRS Parcels Services and The Express Carriers'&#39; |publisher=Nynehead-books.co.uk |date=1955-01-01 |accessdate=2011-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006151838/http://www.nynehead-books.co.uk/description.php?II=1495 |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The new company was re branded ''Exel'' and the [[Americas]] headquarters was established in [[Westerville, Ohio]], in 1992. By the year 2000, Exel had grown and expanded operations to include [[Canada]], [[Latin America]] and [[South America]].

==Controversies==
In August 2011, the main distribution center for Hershey candies was subjected to a strike by about 400<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2011/08/26/hershey-fudges-labor-relations-image/ |title=Hershey Fudges Labor Relations Image| work=Forbes | first=Susan | last=Adams}}</ref> young foreign workers brought to the United States under the J1 "cultural exchange" visa program. The center in [[Palmyra, Pennsylvania]] was run for Hershey by Exel.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/08/foreign_guestworkers_union_off.html Foreign guestworkers, union members protesting Hershey Co. policies for foreign workers]</ref> Exel in turn subcontracted the staffing of the center to another firm SHS OnSite Solutions based in [[Lemoyne, Pennsylvania]]. The students were recruited by yet another organization called the Council on Educational Travel (CETUSA).<ref name="cis">[http://www.cis.org/kammer/hershey-j1-students Hershey Leaves a Bitter Taste for Foreign Students]</ref>

In February 2012, the [[US Department of Labor|Department of Labor's]] [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] fined Exel almost $300,000 for wilfully failing to record and report on the job injuries for four years.<ref>Department of Labor News Release entitled, ''US Labor Department's OSHA cites 2 companies, proposes $288,000 in fines for workplace safety and health violations involving foreign students'' #12-O321-PHI, dated 13 February 2012</ref>

In 2011, the [[U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] on behalf of Contrice Travis, sued Exel for sexual discrimination alleging that Exel failed to promote a female associate to a supervisory position. In July 2013, during a four day trial in [[Atlanta Georgia]] the jury heard evidence such as, "Travis's former supervisor testified that when he recommended Travis for the position, the general manager informed him that he would never put a woman in that position."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130613006145/en/Shegerian-Associates-Founder-Points-Exel-Case-Classic|title=Shegerian & Associates Founder Points to Exel Case as Classic Example of Sex Discrimination|publisher=BuainessWire|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>

The jury found the charges to be true, and awarded Travis $25,000 in compensatory damages and $475,000 in punitive damages plus back pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/6-11-13b.cfm|title=Jury Awards $500,000 in EEOC Sex Discrimination Suit Against Exel, Inc.|publisher=EEOC|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>
