===National Security Council===
The Council was originally created under temporary provision on July 3, 1992 as the ''National Security Council'', but significantly revamped and strengthened under [[Ukrainian President|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] in 1994. The council was headed by a Presidential adviser in national security matters:
* July 1, 1992 - April 19, 1993 [[Volodymyr Selivanov]] (Adviser of the [[President of Ukraine]] on national security matters - Secretary of National Security Council)

On August 23, 1994 [[President of Ukraine]] adopted new provision for the Council. After the adaptation of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] on June 28, 1996, the provisions of the council (National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine) were outlined in the Article 107.
