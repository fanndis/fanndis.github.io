'''Agilent Technologies, Inc.''' is an American analytical instrumentation development and manufacturing company that offers its products and services to markets worldwide. Its global headquarters is located in [[Santa Clara, California]]. Agilent was established in 1999 as a spin-off from [[Hewlett-Packard]]. The resulting [[initial public offering|IPO]] of Agilent stock was the largest in the history of [[Silicon Valley]] at the time.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4">{{cite journal|author = Arensman|title = Unfinished business: managing one of the biggest spin-offs in corporate history would be a challenge even in the best of times.
