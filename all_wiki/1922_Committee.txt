The '''1922 Committee''', formally known as the '''Conservative Private Members' Committee''',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/1922-committee-members-theresa-may-brexit-conservative-party-backbench/|title=What is the 1922 Committee, who's its chairman Sir Graham Brady and how is it involved in the no confidence vote?|last=Chaplain|first=Chloe|date=8 April 2019|website=inews.co.uk|accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref> is the [[parliamentary party|parliamentary group]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]]. The committee, consisting of all Conservative [[backbencher]] MPs, meets weekly while [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] is in session and provides a way for backbenchers to co-ordinate and discuss their views independently of [[frontbencher]]s. Its executive membership and officers are by consensus limited to backbench MPs, although since 2010 frontbench Conservative MPs have an open invitation to attend meetings. The committee can also play an important role in choosing the party leader. The group was formed in 1923<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/1922-committee-the-22/|title=The 1922 Committee|website=Parliament.uk|date=12 December 2018|accessdate=12 December 2018}}</ref> but became important after 1940. It speaks frankly to the party leader / prime minister. Whips are present but their role is limited to announcing future business and reporting questions and complaints to the chief [[whip (politics)|whip]].

==Committee constitutional matters==
The 1922 Committee has an 18-member executive committee, the chairman of which oversees the election of party leaders, or any Conservative party-led [[vote of no confidence]] in a current leader. Such a vote can be triggered by 15 per cent of Conservative MPs (currently 55) writing a letter to the chairman asking for such a vote. This process was used most recently on 12 December 2018, against [[Theresa May]], who won the vote. The last time a leader lost such a vote was on 29 October 2003, when [[Iain Duncan Smith]] was defeated by 90 to 75.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tory leader ousted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3225127.stm|accessdate=23 August 2015|agency=BBC|date=29 October 2003}}</ref>

==Origins==
The name does not, as is sometimes wrongly supposed, stem from the 19 October 1922 [[Carlton Club meeting]], in which Conservative MPs successfully demanded that the party withdraw from the [[Coalition Government 1916–1922|coalition government]] of [[David Lloyd George]], and which triggered the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]]. The committee was formed after the election, in April 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01366/SN01366.pdf |title=Leadership elections: Conservative Party |department=Briefing Paper Number 01366 |last=Johnston |first=Neil |date=24 May 2019 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |access-date=24 May 2019 |page=16}}</ref><ref>Harris 2013, p.265</ref>

The MPs who founded the committee were not the same as those who had taken the decision to end the 1916–22 coalition government. It began as a small dining group of new members elected in 1922. The committee soon developed into a [[ginger group]] of active backbenchers.<ref>John Ramsden (1998) An Appetite for Power – A History of the Conservative Party since 1830 {{ISBN|0 00 255686 3}} p287</ref> After the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]] and [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] elections, the membership expanded as more new Conservative MPs were elected, and in 1926 all backbench MPs were invited to become members. It became known as the Conservative Private Members' Committee. Consequently, it became a platform for the majority rather than a focus for discontent.<ref>"1922 Committee","Political Notes", ''The Times'', 22 December 1926, p. 12.</ref>

The term "men in suits" or "men in grey suits", meaning a delegation of Conservative MPs who tell a party leader that it is time for them to step down without forcing an open challenge, is often used in reference to members of the 1922 Committee.<ref name="Churchill-to-Major">{{cite book |last=Shell |first=Donald |editor-last1=Shell |editor-first1=Donald |editor-last2=Hodder-Williams |editor-first2=Richard |title=Churchill to Major: The British Prime Ministership since 1945 |chapter=Prime Ministers and their Parties |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLgYDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT154 |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-315-48151-7 |pages=154–5}}</ref><ref name="Brogan et al">{{cite news |last1=Brogan |first1=Benedict |last2=Sylvester |first2=Rachel |last3=Jones |first3=George |title=Duncan Smith loses backing of the 'men in grey suits' |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1444380/Duncan-Smith-loses-backing-of-the-men-in-grey-suits.html |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=17 October 2003 |access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> It became popular after the resignation of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="Brant">{{cite news |last=Brant |first=Robin |title=1922 committee and Tory MPs' contact details |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31859094 |work=BBC News Online |date=12 March 2015 |access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref><ref name="Rawnsley">{{cite news |last=Rawnsley |first=Andrew |title=Dead man talking |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/12/conservatives.conservatives2003 |work=The Observer |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref>

==2010 changes==
On 19 May 2010, shortly after the Conservatives had formed a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] suggested altering the committee to involve frontbench [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in the recommendation forming process, angering some [[backbench]] MPs.<ref name="Cameron">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693078.stm|title=Cameron angers MPs with bid to change 1922 Committee|date=19 May 2010|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> On 20 May 2010, Committee members voted to approve the change, with 168 votes in favour and 118 against. Many backbench party members criticised the move and voted against it, while ministers had argued such a change would be necessary to continue operating coherently as a party during its membership of a [[coalition]] government.<ref name="Vote">{{cite news|title=1922 Committee: David Cameron wins vote on rule change|date=20 May 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8693078.stm|accessdate=20 May 2010|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

However, under its most recent chairman [[Graham Brady]], it was clarified shortly after that vote that although frontbenchers are now able to attend meetings of the committee, only backbenchers would be able to vote for its officers and executive committee,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8706572.stm Brady elected as Tories' 1922 Committee chairman] BBC News 26 May 2010</ref> similar to the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]].

As of 24 May 2019 after the Chairman Graham Brady stood down, the executive committee comprised:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/10/1922-committee-how-tories-men-grey-suits-wield-power|title=The 1922 Committee: how the Tories' men in grey suits wield power|work=New Statesman|last=Eaton|first=George|date=11 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conservativehome.com/parliament/2017/07/1922-executive-committee-election-results-announced.html|title=1922 Executive Committee election results announced.
