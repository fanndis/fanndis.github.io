'''Dropbox''' is a [[file hosting service]] operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in [[San Francisco]], California, that offers [[cloud storage]], [[file synchronization]], [[personal cloud]], and [[Client (computing)|client]] software. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by [[MIT]] students [[Drew Houston]] and [[Arash Ferdowsi]] as a [[startup company]], with initial funding from [[seed accelerator]] [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].

Dropbox has been ranked as one of the most valuable startups in the US and the world, with a valuation of over US$10&nbsp;billion, and it has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date. However, Dropbox has also [[Criticism of Dropbox|experienced criticism and generated controversy]] for issues including security breaches and privacy concerns.

== Concept ==
Dropbox brings files together in one central place by creating a special folder on the user's computer. The contents of these folders are synchronized to Dropbox's servers and to other computers and devices where the user has installed Dropbox, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices. Dropbox uses a [[freemium]] [[business model]], where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Dropbox Basic users are given two [[gigabyte]]s of free storage space. Dropbox Plus users are given two [[terabytes]] of storage space, as well as additional features, including advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, and an optional Extended Version History add-on. Dropbox offers computer apps for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] computers, and mobile apps for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[Windows Phone]] smartphones and tablets. In March 2013, the company acquired [[Mailbox (application)|Mailbox]], a popular email app, and in April 2014, the company introduced [[Dropbox Carousel]], a photo and video gallery app. Both Mailbox and Carousel were shut down in December 2015, with key features from both apps implemented into the regular Dropbox service. In October 2015, it officially announced [[Dropbox Paper]], its [[collaborative]] document editor, in a reported effort to expand its operations towards businesses. In March 2016, Dropbox had 500 million users.<ref>Benjamin Rains, Zacks. "[https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/311337/should-you-buy-dropbox-dbx-stock Should You Buy Dropbox (DBX) Stock?]."

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Dropbox}}

Dropbox founder Drew Houston conceived the Dropbox concept after repeatedly forgetting his [[USB flash drive]] while he was a student at [[MIT]]. In a 2009 "Meet the Team" post on the Dropbox blog, he wrote that existing services at the time "suffered problems with Internet [[latency (engineering)|latency]], large files, [[software bug|bugs]], or just made me think too much". He began making something for his personal use, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problems.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Ying |title=Meet the Team!

The Dropbox software enables users to drop any file into a designated folder. The file is then automatically uploaded to Dropbox's cloud-based service and made available to any other of the user's computers and devices that also have the Dropbox software installed, keeping the file up-to-date on all systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is syncing and how does it work? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/8839?path=syncing_and_uploads |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref> When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the [[block (data storage)|pieces of the file]] that have been changed, whenever possible.<ref>{{cite web |title=Does Dropbox always upload/download the entire file any time a change is made? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/8 |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

When a file or folder is deleted, users can recover it within 30 days. For Dropbox Plus users, this recovery time can be extended to one year, by purchasing an "Extended Version History" add-on.<ref name="Extended Version History"/>

Dropbox accounts that are not accessed or emails not replied in a year are automatically deleted.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dropbox shows how it manages costs by deleting inactive accounts|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/dropbox-shows-how-it-manages-costs-by-deleting-inactive-accounts.html|last=Novet|first=Jordan|date=2018-02-23|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

Dropbox also offers a [[Local area network|LAN]] sync feature, where, instead of receiving information and data from the Dropbox servers, computers on the local network can exchange files directly between each other, potentially significantly improving synchronization speeds.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is LAN sync? |url=https://www.dropbox.com/help/137?path=syncing_and_uploads |publisher=Dropbox |accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

Dropbox originally used [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon S3|S3]] storage system to store user files, but between 2014 and 2016 they gradually moved away from Amazon to use their own hardware, referred to as "Magic Pocket", due to Dropbox's description as "a place where you keep all your stuff, it doesn’t get lost, and you can always access it".<ref>{{cite web |first=Cade |last=Metz |title=The epic story of Dropbox's exodus from the Amazon cloud empire |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/epic-story-dropboxs-exodus-amazon-cloud-empire |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 14, 2016 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref> In June 2017, the company announced a major global network expansion, aiming to increase synchronization speeds while cutting costs.

In April 2015, Dropbox launched a Dropbox Notes collaborative note-taking service in [[Beta test|beta testing phase]], prompting speculation if Dropbox was planning to bring out a product to compete with [[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides|Google Docs]]. ''[[TechCrunch]]'' noted that Dropbox Notes appeared to be a new version of "Project Composer", a previous iteration of the service with roots from the acquisition of Hackpad in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sarah |last=Perez |title=Dropbox's Collaborative Note-Taking Service, Dropbox Notes, Heads Into Beta Testing |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/23/dropboxs-collaborative-note-taking-service-dropbox-notes-heads-into-beta-testing/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nathan |last=Ingraham |title=Dropbox is getting ready to launch a collaborative notes service |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/23/8486097/dropbox-notes-collaboration-service-beta |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 23, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Chuong |last=Nguyen |title=Dropbox Notes poised to challenge Google Docs at launch |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/dropbox-notes-poised-to-challenge-google-docs-at-launch-1292112 |website=[[TechRadar]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=April 24, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref> In October 2015, Dropbox announced the upcoming launch of [[Dropbox Paper]], its collaborative document editor, noted by the media as the result of its development of a Dropbox Notes service earlier in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |first=Nathan |last=Ingraham |title=Paper is Dropbox's new vision for how teams can work together |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/10/15/dropbox-paper-team-collaboration-tools/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Dropbox announces Paper, its take on collaborative document editing |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/15/9541017/dropbox-announces-paper-its-take-on-collaborative-document-editing |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Dropbox Announces Paper, A Google Docs Competitor |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/15/dropbox-announces-paper-a-google-docs-competitor/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 15, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref> Dropbox Paper entered open [[Beta test|beta]] in August 2016, allowing anyone to join and test the product.

While Dropbox uses SSL to encrypt data in transit between itself and customers, and it stores data in encrypted form, it does not use [[end-to-end encryption]] in which the user controls the keys used to encrypt the stored data.
