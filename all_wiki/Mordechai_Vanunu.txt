Vanunu spent 18 years in prison, including more than 11 in solitary confinement, though no such restriction is mentioned in Israel's penal code, nor imposed by his verdict. Released from prison in 2004, he was further subjected to a broad array of restrictions on his speech and his movement, and arrested several times for violations of his parole terms, giving interviews to foreign journalists and attempting to leave Israel. He claims having suffered "cruel and barbaric treatment" at the hands of prison authorities, and suggests that these would have been different if he had not converted to Christianity.<ref>{{cite news|title=Israeli nuclear spy released|url=https://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/21/israel.vanunu|work=CNN|date=21 April 2004|access-date=12 February 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, Vanunu was sentenced to six months in prison for violating terms of his parole. The sentence was considered unusually severe even by the prosecution, who expected a [[suspended sentence]]. However, in May 2010, Vanunu was arrested again and sentenced to three months in jail on a charge that he had met foreigners, in violation of conditions of his 2004 release from jail. In response, [[Amnesty International]] issued a press release on July 2007, stating that "The organisation considers Mordechai Vanunu to be a [[prisoner of conscience]] and calls for his immediate and unconditional release."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGMDE150442007|title=Israel: Mordechai Vanunu sentence clear violation of human rights|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|date=2 July 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710201838/http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGMDE150442007|archive-date=10 July 2007}}</ref>

==Early and educational life==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2017}}
Vanunu was born in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], the second of 11 children born to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family that lived in the city's [[Mellah]], or Jewish quarter. His father, Shlomo, ran a grocery store, and his mother, Mazal, was a housewife. Vanunu studied in an [[Alliance française]] school, and a Jewish religious elementary school, or [[cheder]]. In 1963, following a rise in anti-Semitic sentiment in Morocco, Vanunu's father sold his business, and the family emigrated to Israel. Vanunu was ten years old at the time. The family transited through France, spending a month in a camp in [[Marseilles]] before being taken to Israel by sea. Upon arrival in Israel, the family was sent by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] to settle at [[Beersheba]], which at that time was an impoverished desert city. During their first year in Israel, the family lived in a small wooden hut without electricity.

Vanunu's father purchased a small grocery store in the town's market area, and the family moved into an apartment. Vanunu's father devoted his spare time to religious studies. He came to be regarded as a [[rabbi]], earning respect in the market. Vanunu was sent to a Yeshiva Tichonit, a religious elementary school on the outskirts of town, which mixed religious and conventional studies.<ref name="Hounam, pg. 31-32">Hounam, pg. 31-32</ref>

After completing the 8th grade, his parents enrolled him in a [[yeshiva]], but after three months, he was withdrawn.<ref name=Leshem/> For high school, Vanunu attended Yeshivat Ohel Shlomo high school, a [[Bnei Akiva]]-run school, where he was an excellent student, earning honors. According to Vanunu, whilst in secondary school, he had a personal crisis which led to him deciding not to observe religious Judaism. In an interview, he said that "already at this stage, I decided to cut myself off from the Jewish religion, but I didn't want to have a confrontation with my parents because I wanted to complete my studies".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanunu.com/uscampaign/archive2/yastranger.html|title='I felt like I was a stranger' - Vanunu's testimony|website=www.vanunu.com}}</ref>

He finished high school with a partial [[matriculation]]. Vanunu's parents wanted him to attend a higher yeshiva; he agreed but left after a week. He then found a temporary job in the court archives. In October 1971, he was conscripted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. He tried to join the [[Israeli Air Force]] as a pilot, but after having been rejected by examiners, they sent him to the [[Combat Engineering Corps]], where he became a [[sapper]]. After basic training, he completed a junior commanders' course, then a non-commissioned officers course, and was given the rank of Sergeant-Major.

He was stationed in a [[highlands]] area and saw action during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. In 1974, he participated in the demolition of army installations in areas of the Golan that were to be returned to Syrian control. Vanunu was offered a permanent job with the army as a career soldier, but declined the offer, and was honorably discharged in 1974. He then enrolled at [[Tel Aviv University]] and entered a pre-academic course, completing his matriculation, then began studying physics. During this period, he worked in a variety of places, including in a bakery and retirement home. After failing two exams at the end of his first year and realizing that the full-time work he needed to do to pay his tuition interfered with his studies, Vanunu suspended his studies and returned to his parents' home in [[Beersheba]], where he found temporary work.<ref name=Leshem>Leshem, Guy: ''"I Felt like a Stranger; I Was Alone"'' - [[Yediot Ahronot]] - 24 November 1999</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2004/03/26/the-ordeal-of-mordechai-vanunu/ |title=The Ordeal of Mordechai Vanunu |work=counterpunch |publisher=The Independent |first=Robert |last=Fisk |date=26–28 March 2004 |access-date=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="Gideon's Spies">Thomas, Gordon: ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad''</ref><ref>Richelson, Jeffrey: ''Spying on the Bomb: American Nuclear Intelligence from Nazi Germany to Iran and North Korea'' (2007)</ref> He applied for a job with [[Shin Bet]], the Israeli domestic intelligence and police service, but was rejected for reasons of incompatibility.<ref name=Haaretz>https://www.haaretz.com/wwwMobileSite/$canonicalPath</ref>

==Negev Nuclear Research Center==
In 1976, Vanunu applied for a job at the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]], an Israeli facility used to develop and manufacture nuclear weapons<ref name=haaretz-20040425>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=406179&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221162238/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=406179&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 February 2009 |title=Who's afraid of Mordechai Vanunu? |author=Yossi Melman |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=25 April 2004 |access-date=2008-03-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/plut.html |title=Israel: Plutonium Production |publisher=Wisconsin Project On Nuclear Arms Control |journal=The Risk Report |volume=2 |issue=4 |date=July–August 1996 |access-date=19 December 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128053251/http://www.wisconsinproject.org/countries/israel/plut.html |archive-date=28 November 2006 }}</ref> located in the [[Negev|Negev Desert]] south of [[Dimona]]. Most worldwide intelligence agencies estimate that Israel developed nuclear weapons as early as the 1960s, but the country has intentionally maintained a "[[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nuclear ambiguity]]", neither acknowledging nor denying that it possesses nuclear weapons. Vanunu had heard from a friend of his brother Meir that well-paying jobs were being advertised by the facility.<ref name="Hounam, pg. 31-32"/>

After a lengthy interview with the facility's security officer, he was accepted for training. He signed a contract forbidding disclosure of sensitive security materials and had to promise not to visit any Arab or Communist countries for five years after his employment at the facility ended. He passed health checks, after which his training began. He was put through an intensive training course in physics, chemistry, mathematics, first aid, fire drill, and English. He did sufficiently well to be accepted and was employed as a nuclear plant technician and shift manager in February 1977.<ref name="Gideon's Spies"/><ref>Hounam, p. 33</ref> Vanunu earned a high salary by Israeli standards, and lived well. His work record was so good he qualified for a car and telephone allowance, though he had no interest in either and simply had his brother Meir's car registered in his name and had the telephone installed at his parents’ house.<ref name="Hounam, p. 34"/>

In 1979, he enrolled at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] in Beersheba. Initially, he wanted to study engineering, but within a week switched to economics, and also began a Greek philosophy course. In the autumn of 1980, he took a backpacking trip through Europe. He toured [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Germany]], and [[Scandinavia]], and then visited [[Greece]] and toured the Greek islands with a Canadian friend. After returning to Israel, he bought a flat in Beersheba. In the summer of 1983, he took a three-month trip to the United States and Canada with a friend, transiting through Ireland in the process on a charter flight through [[Shannon Airport]]. This was in direct violation of instructions from his workplace, which mandated direct flights to North America only, in case of hijacking. Upon his return he was threatened with a disciplinary tribunal, but this never happened.<ref name=haaretz-20040425/><ref name="Hounam, p. 34">Hounam, p. 34</ref>

At that time, his political views had begun to change, becoming critical of many policies of the Israeli government. He opposed the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and when he was called up to serve in that war as a reserve soldier in the Engineering Corps, he refused to perform field tasks and instead did kitchen duty. He also campaigned for equal rights for [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]].<ref name=Haaretz/><ref name="apprenticeship">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/06/16/1023864379443.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=The apprenticeship of Mordechai Vanunu|date=17 June 2002}}</ref> In March 1984, he formed a left-wing group called "Campus" with five Arab and four Jewish students. He became acquainted with many Arab students, including pro-[[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] activists. Vanunu was also affiliated with a group called "Movement for the Advancement of Peace". He developed a particular resentment for what he viewed as the dominance of Israeli society by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] or Jews of European origin, and the perceived discrimination against [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] from the Middle East and North Africa. He felt that he was looked down on by those who ran the Dimona facility due to his Moroccan origin. According to Dr. Ze'ev Tzahor of Ben-Gurion University, "he projected a deep sense of deprivation. He assumed an Ashkenazi dominance in Israel that encompassed all social strata and an Ashkenazi consensus closing off all possibilities of advancement for Oriental Jews." According to ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', Vanunu's anti-Ashkenazi feelings morphed into anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli feelings, and he became the principal advocate for Arab students on campus, arguing their case with what other Jewish students saw as irrational intensity.<ref>Hounam, pp. 39-40</ref> He became known on campus as a radical. His activities drew increasing attention from his employer.<ref name=Haaretz/>

In his security file at the Negev Nuclear Research Center, it was noted that he had displayed "left-wing and pro-Arab beliefs".<ref name="Gideon's Spies"/> In May 1984, he was questioned by the head of security at Dimona and a lawyer who was possibly from [[Shin Bet]], and was let off with a stern warning about divulging any unauthorized information.<ref>Hounam, pp. 36-37</ref>

In June 1984, he was again interrogated at the facility's security office. The next month, he left for France for two weeks with a student group to meet [[History of the Jews in France|French-Jewish]] students in [[Paris]] and when he returned, he was interrogated again. In 1985, Vanunu reportedly joined the [[Maki (political party)|Israeli Communist Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://people.com/archive/a-man-of-mystery-sells-a-chilling-story-and-then-vanishes-vol-26-no-20|title=A Man of Mystery Sells a Chilling Story and Then Vanishes|last=Gross|first=Ben|volume=26|issue=20|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=17 November 1986|access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://972mag.com/saying-goodbye-to-the-soviet-spy-who-was-an-israeli-patriot/114498|title=A Soviet spy and an Israeli patriot|last=Matar|first=Haggai|magazine=[[+972 Magazine]]|date=3 December 2015|access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref> Vanunu later claimed that he had developed a very close friendship with an Israeli Arab, and after a year, discovered that his friend was being paid to spy on him.<ref>Hounam, p. 47</ref>

Vanunu graduated from Ben-Gurion University in 1985 with a BA in philosophy and geography.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=Eileen|title=Third Intifada/Uprising: NONVIOLENT But With Words Sharper Than A Two-Edged Sword - Memoirs of a Nice Irish American 'Girl's' Life in Occupied Territory|publisher=Outskirts Press|date=5 February 2007|isbn=978-1-4327-0254-0|page=104}}</ref> In early 1985, he lost his job following a mass layoff of workers due to government cutbacks, but his [[trade union|labor union]] won him his job back. After he resumed working at the facility, Vanunu secretly smuggled in a camera and covertly took 57 photographs. He quit his job on 27 October 1985, due to repeated efforts by his superiors to transfer him to tasks that were less sensitive than his previous positions at the facility. He was given severance pay of $7,500 and a reference letter praising his work and describing his departure as a layoff.<ref>Hounam, p. 39</ref><ref>Cochran, Thomas B.

On 15 April 2015, The National Security Archive of George Washington University published documents corroborating Vanunu's statements regarding the Dimona [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]]. The archived documents detail the discovery of Israel's nuclear deceptions, debates over Israel's lack of candor and efforts to pressure the Israelis to answer key questions about the Dimona facility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2015/04/17/u-s-documents-collaborate-mordechai-vanunu-re-israeli-wmd|title=U.S. Documents Corroborate Mordechai Vanunu RE: Israeli WMD|work=The Arab Daily News|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

==Disclosure, abduction and publication==
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2017}}
After leaving his job, Vanunu started attending Israeli Communist Party meetings, but was unimpressed with the level of discussion and soon stopped going. He also tried modeling nude for art students but was not booked again for being too nervous and jumpy. In November 1985, he moved in with Judy Zimmet, an American woman who was working as a midwife at [[Soroka Medical Center]]. After accompanying Zimmet and her sister on a tour around Israel, he embarked on a backpacking trip throughout the [[Far East]], and planned to meet her in the United States afterwards, though he later became uncertain about continuing the relationship. On January 19, 1986, he left Israel for Greece via a boat from [[Haifa]] to [[Athens]]. After spending a few days in Athens, he flew to [[Thailand]] on an [[Aeroflot]] flight to [[Bangkok]]. He transited through [[Moscow]], spending a night at a transit hotel there. During his time in Thailand, he visited the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], where he tried [[opium]] and hash cocktails. He then flew to [[Myanmar]], where he met and befriended Fiona Gall, daughter of British journalist [[Sandy Gall]]. After touring [[Mandalay]] together, Vanunu flew on his own to [[Nepal]].

During his time in Nepal, Vanunu visited the Soviet embassy in [[Kathmandu]] to inquire about the travel documents he would need for a future trip to the [[Soviet Union]]. He then returned to Thailand, and from there went to Australia on a flight to [[Sydney]]. Vanunu decided to settle permanently in Sydney, and after ten days of sightseeing, he found a job as a dishwasher at the Menzies Hotel, and then at a Greek restaurant. Meanwhile, he studied for and eventually gained a taxi license. He also began attending a church, and in July 1986, converted to [[Christianity]], joining the [[Anglican Church of Australia]].<ref name="apprenticeship"/><ref name = diehl>Sarah J. Diehl and James Clay Moltz (2008). ''Nuclear Weapons and Nonproliferation: A Reference Handbook'' (ABC-CLIO; {{ISBN|978-1-59884-071-1}}), pg. 208.</ref><ref name="guardian.co.uk">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/21/israel3 "Vanunu released after 18 years"], guardian.com, 21 April 2004; retrieved 28 July 2009.</ref> He moved into an apartment owned by the church and found work driving a taxi owned by a parishioner.

During this time, he met Oscar Guerrero, a freelance journalist from [[Colombia]]. Guerrero persuaded Vanunu to sell his story, claiming that his story and photographs were worth up to $1 million. After failing to interest ''[[Newsweek]]'', Guerrero approached the British ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]]'', and within a few days, Vanunu was interviewed by ''Sunday Times'' journalist [[Peter Hounam]]. According to American journalist Louis Toscano, Guerrero approached the Israeli consulate in August 1986, offering help in tracking down an Israeli "traitor". Guerrero was hoping to be paid. He met with an Israeli intelligence officer named Avi Kliman and told him Vanunu's story. Kliman was initially dismissive but took down Vanunu's name and passport number, which was checked. They met a second time, during which Guerrero handed over four crudely copied photographs.<ref>Hounam, pp. 13-14</ref> On September 7, 1986, two men who identified themselves as officers from Shin Bet approached Vanunu's older brother Albert in his carpentry shop in Beersheba and questioned him about his brother. They told him that he was in Australia, that he was talking to a British newspaper about his work at the nuclear research center, urged him to dissuade his brother, and then made him sign a non-disclosure agreement barring him from talking about the meeting.<ref>Hounam, p. 53</ref> On September 10, Vanunu and Hounam flew to London from Australia. There, in violation of his non-disclosure agreement, Vanunu revealed to the ''Sunday Times'' his knowledge of the Israeli nuclear programme, including the photographs he had secretly taken at the Dimona site.

The ''Sunday Times'' was wary of being duped, especially in light of the recent [[Hitler Diaries]] hoax. As a result, the newspaper insisted on verifying Vanunu's story with leading nuclear weapon experts, including former U.S. nuclear weapons designer [[Ted Taylor (physicist)|Theodore Taylor]] and former British [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|AWE]] engineer [[Frank Barnaby]],<ref name="barnaby-opinion">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/barnaby.pdf|title=Expert opinion of Frank Charles Barnaby in the matter of Mordechai Vanunu|author=Frank Barnaby|date=14 June 2004|access-date=16 December 2007}}</ref> who agreed that Vanunu's story was factual and correct. In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, was sent to Israel to find people who knew Vanunu and verify his story.<ref>Hounam, p. 12</ref> Prangnell verified Vanunu's backstory, meeting a few people at Ben-Gurion University who identified Vanunu from a photograph, as well as meeting neighbors and others who confirmed he had worked at the Dimona nuclear plant.<ref>Cohen, Yoel, p. 58</ref>

Vanunu gave detailed descriptions of [[lithium-6]] separation required for the production of [[tritium]], an essential ingredient of [[Nuclear weapon design#Fusion-boosted fission weapons|fusion-boosted fission]] bombs. 
While both experts concluded that Israel might be making such single-stage boosted bombs, Vanunu, whose work experience was limited to material (not component) production, gave no specific evidence that Israel was making [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|two-stage thermonuclear]] bombs, such as [[Neutron bomb|neutron]] bombs. 
Vanunu described the [[plutonium]] processing used, giving a production rate of about 30&nbsp;kg per year, and stated that Israel used about 4&nbsp;kg per weapon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1086956_1,00.html|title=Focus: The secrets that shocked the world|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=25 April 2004|location=London, UK|access-date=13 May 2010|first1=Francis|last1=Elliott|first2=Deborah|last2=Haynes}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://armscontrolwonk.com/Barnaby.pdf|title=The Nuclear Arsenal in the Middle East|author=Frank Barnaby|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=17|issue=1|date=1987|pages=97–106|access-date=28 December 2006|doi=10.1525/jps.1987.17.1.00p0146h|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105132638/http://armscontrolwonk.com/Barnaby.pdf|archive-date=5 November 2006}}</ref> From this information it was possible to estimate that Israel had sufficient plutonium for about 150 nuclear weapons.<ref name="barnaby-opinion"/>

During his stay in Britain, the ''Sunday Times'' initially put Vanunu up in a hotel in London close to the newspaper's premises, but shortly afterward, he was moved to what was considered a safer location: a lodge near [[Welwyn]], in rural [[Hertfordshire]], which was in an obscure location and accessed by a narrow road. Hounam considered it an excellent hiding place. During one foray into London together with a ''Sunday Times'' journalist, Vanunu encountered an Israeli friend, Yoram Bazak, and his girlfriend Dorit on [[Regent Street]]. They agreed to meet later.<ref>Hounam, p. 19</ref> When they met, Bazak intensely questioned Vanunu on his views towards Israel's defense policy, and during the conversation, Vanunu told Bazak about the possibility of him publicly revealing secrets from Dimona to the British press, Bazak responded with a menacing threat.<ref>Hounam, p. 21</ref> Hounam speculated that Vanunu's meeting with Bazak was no mere coincidence and that Bazak had been recruited by Mossad in an attempt to discover Vanunu's motives and try to dissuade him.<ref>Hounam, p. 54</ref> Vanunu later grew bored of rural Hertfordshire and asked for a new location in London, and he was booked in the first hotel he had stayed in under a false name. Hounam speculated that as Oscar Guerrero, who had followed him and Vanunu to London, had already stayed there, Mossad likely had that hotel under surveillance.<ref>Hounam, p. 56</ref>

In September, as the story neared publication, the ''Sunday Times'' approached the Israeli Embassy with the story, offering it a chance to rebut the allegations. The Israeli press attache, [[Eviatar Manor]], was twice visited by journalists to discuss the story, and on the second visit, was handed some of Vanunu's photographs. The material was rushed to Israel for review. The Israeli response denied the allegations, characterizing Vanunu as a minor technician with limited knowledge of the reactor's operations.<ref>Karsh, Efraim: ''Israel: the First Hundred Years: Volume II: From War to Peace?'', p. 146</ref><ref>Hounam, pp. 60-64</ref>

Vanunu states in his letters that he intended to share the money received from the newspaper (for the information) with the [[Anglican Church of Australia]]. Meanwhile, Guerrero, despite having met Hounam and Vanunu at the airport when they arrived in London and receiving an assurance from Hounam that he would get his money, sold the story to the tabloid ''[[The Daily Mirror|Sunday Mirror]]'', whose owner was [[Robert Maxwell]]. In 1991, a self-described former [[Mossad]] officer or government translator named [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] claimed that Maxwell, allegedly an agent for Israeli intelligence services, had tipped off the Israeli Embassy about Vanunu in 1986.<ref>Robert Verkaik [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/the-mystery-of-maxwells-death-469294.html "The mystery of Maxwell's death"], ''The Independent'', 10 March 2006</ref> In sharing his story with the ''Sunday Mirror'', Guerrero forfeited the agreed-upon payment of $25,000 from ''The Sunday Times''.<ref>Hounam, p. 17</ref>

The Israeli government decided to capture Vanunu, but determined to avoid harming its good relationship with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], and not wanting to risk confrontation with British intelligence, determined Vanunu should be persuaded to leave British territory under his own volition. Israel's efforts to capture Vanunu were headed by [[Giora Tzahor]].<ref>Ronen, Gil [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/157934#.UF3g5FHa98E Agent Who Nabbed Vanunu Killed in Accident] at [[Arutz Sheva]], 17 July 2012. Retrieved 23 September 2012.</ref>

Through constant surveillance and analysis by Mossad psychologists, the Mossad found that Vanunu had become lonely and eager for female companionship. Masquerading as an American tourist called "Cindy", Israeli Mossad agent [[Cheryl Bentov]] befriended Vanunu, and on 30&nbsp;September persuaded him to fly to Rome with her on a holiday.<ref name=haretz>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=%20417663&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y |title=Capturing nuclear whistle-blower was 'a lucky stroke,' agents recall|author=Yossi Melman |publisher=Haaretz |date=21 April 2004|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221125605/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=%20417663&contrassID=2&subContrassID=1&sbSubContrassID=0&listSrc=Y|archive-date=February 21, 2009 }}</ref> This relation has been perceived as a classic [[Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting#Love, honeypots, and recruitment|honey trap]] operation whereby an intelligence agent employs seduction to gain the target's trust—a practice which has been officially sanctioned in Israel.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Kalman, Matthew|title=Mossad's Seductive 'Honey Trap' Is Kosher, Rabbi Finds|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/04/mossads-seductive-honey-trap-is-kosher-rabbi-finds|work=[[AOL News]]|date=4 October 2010|access-date=30 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113135152/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/04/mossads-seductive-honey-trap-is-kosher-rabbi-finds/|archive-date=13 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author= Beam, Christopher |title= The Spy Who Said She Loved Me.

The ''Noga'', disguised as a merchant ship, was fitted with electronic surveillance equipment and satellite communications gear in its [[superstructure]], and was primarily used to intercept communications traffic in Arab ports. As the ship was heading from [[Antalya]] in Turkey back to Haifa, the captain was instructed by encrypted message to change course for Italy and anchor off the coast of [[La Spezia]], out of the port in international waters.

Once in Rome, Vanunu and Bentov took a taxi to an apartment in the city's old quarter, where three waiting Mossad operatives overpowered Vanunu and injected him with a paralyzing drug. Later that night, a white van hired by the Israeli embassy arrived, and Vanunu was carried to the vehicle bound to a stretcher. The van drove with Vanunu and the agents to [[La Spezia]]'s dock, where they boarded a waiting speedboat, which reached the waiting ''Noga'' anchored off the coast. The crew of the ''Noga'' were ordered to assemble all in the ship's common hall behind locked doors, as Vanunu and the Mossad agents boarded the ship, which then departed for Israel. During the journey, Vanunu was kept in a secluded cabin, with just the Mossad agents routinely interrogating and guarding him in turns, while none of the ''Noga'''s crew were allowed to approach either of them.
 
On 7 October, the ship anchored off the coast of Israel between Tel Aviv and Haifa, where it was met by a smaller vessel to which Vanunu was transferred. Vanunu was detained in Israel and interrogated.<ref name=haretz /><ref>Hounam, Peter: ''The woman from Mossad: The story of Mordechai Vanunu & the Israeli nuclear program</ref><ref>Thomas, Gordon: ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad'' (2002)</ref> He was detained in a [[Gedera]] prison, in a wing run by Shin Bet.<ref>Cohen, p. 110</ref> On 5 October, the ''Sunday Times'' published the information it had revealed, and estimated that Israel had produced more than 100 nuclear warheads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709033602/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article830147.ece|url-status=dead|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|archive-date=July 9, 2009|website=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref>

==Trial and imprisonment==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2017}}
On January 6, 1987, he began a [[hunger strike]] over his prison conditions. During a visit with his brother Asher and in a letter to his brother Meir, he complained, among other things, of being held in [[solitary confinement]] 23 hours a day. When Judy Zimmet traveled to Israel and asked to visit him in prison, prison authorities said they could only meet in the presence of prison officials and with them separated by a glass barrier. Vanunu rejected these conditions, demanding he is allowed to meet her face to face.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/28/Vanunu-deplores-treatment-in-jail/1830538808400|title=Vanunu deplores treatment in jail|publisher=upi.com|date=28 January 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/01/27/Vanunu-rejects-conditions-to-meet-American-girlfriend/5454538722000|title=Vanunu rejects conditions to meet American girlfriend|publisher=upi.com|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1987/01/07/archive/vanunu-stages-hunger-strike|title=Vanunu Stages Hunger Strike|publisher=JTA.org|date=7 January 1987}}</ref> He filed three appeals to the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] protesting his conditions, which were rejected.

On August 30, 1987, Vanunu's trial opened. He was charged with treason, aggravated espionage, and collection of secret information with intent to impair state security. The trial, held in secret, took place in the Jerusalem District Court before Chief Justice Eliyahu Noam and Judges Zvi Tal and Shalom Brenner. Vanunu was initially represented by Amnon Zichroni, then by [[Avigdor Feldman]], a prominent Israeli civil and human rights lawyer. The prosecutor was Uzi Hasson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/31/world/israel-opens-trial-in-espionage-case.html|title=ISRAEL OPENS TRIAL IN ESPIONAGE CASE|date=31 August 1987|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Vanunu was denied contact with the media, but he inscribed the details of his abduction (or "hijacking", as he put it), on the palm of his hand, which he held against the van's window while being transported to court, for the waiting press to get that information.

The [[Capital punishment in Israel|death penalty in Israel]] is restricted to special circumstances, and only two executions have ever taken place there. In 2004, former Mossad director [[Shabtai Shavit]] told [[Reuters]] that the option of [[extrajudicial execution]] was considered in 1986, but rejected because "Jews don't do that to other Jews."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1043340.htm|title=Israeli nuclear whistleblower due to be released from jail (transcript from AM radio)|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=12 February 2004}}</ref> Treason is a capital offense under Israeli law, and Vanunu could have faced the death penalty, but prosecutor Uzi Hasson announced that he would not seek the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/03/24/Israeli-court-convicts-nuclear-technician-of-treason-spying/5798575182800|title=Israeli court convicts nuclear technician of treason, spying|publisher=UPI.com|date=24 March 1988}}</ref>

During his trial, Vanunu was brought to court wearing a motorcycle helmet to conceal his face. On 1 September 1987, while being brought into court, Vanunu tried to take off his helmet and started shouting in an apparent attempt to talk to the reporters nearby. His guards stopped him using physical force, and police sirens were turned on to drown out his voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-01/news/mn-5361_1_mordechai-vanunu|title=Israeli Sirens Drown Out a Handcuffed Vanunu|first=United Press|last=International|date=1 September 1987|work=LA Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1987/09/02/archive/vanunu-and-police-struggle-at-courthouse-door|title=Vanunu and Police Struggle at Courthouse Door|publisher=JTA.org|date=2 September 1987}}</ref>

Peter Hounam and Frank Barnaby both testified as defense witnesses for Vanunu. Before appearing in court, Hounam was warned that he would be arrested if he reported on the proceedings or his own testimony. He was allowed to report that he "gave evidence" regarding his "relationship" with Vanunu.<ref>Jones, Derek: ''Censorship: A World Encyclopedia'', p. 2558</ref><ref>https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/barnaby.pdf</ref>

On 28 March 1988, Vanunu was convicted. He was sentenced to eighteen years of imprisonment from the date of his abduction in Rome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-11-25-9911250182-story.html|title=PAPER PRINTS EXCERPTS FROM TRIAL OF ISRAELI SPY|first=Tribune News|last=Services|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> The Israeli government refused to release the transcript of the court case until, under a threat of legal action, it agreed to let censored extracts be published in ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'', an Israeli newspaper, in late 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Vanunu served his sentence at [[Shikma Prison]] in [[Ashkelon]],<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> where he was held in administratively imposed solitary confinement. On May 3, 1989, he appealed his conviction and sentence to the Israeli Supreme Court and was brought from prison in a closed police vehicle to the Supreme Court for an appeal hearing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1989/05/04/archive/vanunu-appeal-opens-in-israel-as-italians-rally-behind-him|title=Vanunu Appeal Opens in Israel As Italians Rally Behind Him|publisher=JTA.org|date=4 May 1989}}</ref> In 1990, his appeal was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1990/05/29/archive/high-court-rejects-vanunus-appeal-will-decide-on-publishing-decision|title=High Court Rejects Vanunu's Appeal, Will Decide on Publishing Decision|date=1990-05-29}}</ref> The following year, an appeal to the Supreme Court arguing for better prison conditions was also rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1991/11/05/archive/vanunu-loses-bid-for-better-conditions|title=Vanunu Loses Bid for Better Conditions|date=1991-11-05}}</ref> On March 12, 1998, after having spent over eleven years in solitary confinement, Vanunu was released into the general prison population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/65034.stm|title=BBC News - WORLD - Israel ends 12-year solitary|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> While in prison, Vanunu took part in small acts of defiance, such as refusing psychiatric treatment, refusing to initiate conversations with the guards, reading only English-language newspapers rather than Hebrew ones, refusing to work, refusing to eat lunch when it was served, and watching only [[BBC|BBC television]]. "He is the most stubborn, principled and tough person I have ever met", said his lawyer, Avigdor Feldman. In 1998, Vanunu appealed to the Supreme Court for his Israeli citizenship to be revoked. The Interior Minister denied Vanunu's request on grounds that he did not have another citizenship. He was denied parole because he refused to promise that he would never speak of the Dimona facility or his kidnapping and imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=229406|title=Vanunu to High Court: I no longer want Israeli citizenship|work=JPost.com|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/jun/05/familyandrelationships.israelandthepalestinians</ref>

Many critics argue that Vanunu had no additional information that would pose a real security threat to Israel and that its government's only motivation is to avoid political embarrassment and financial complications for itself and allies such as the United States. 
By not acknowledging possession of nuclear weapons, Israel avoids a US legal prohibition on funding countries that proliferate [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Such an admission would prevent Israel from receiving over $2 billion each year in military and other aid from [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1970963,00.html|title=Calls for Olmert to resign after nuclear gaffe|date=13 December 2006|publisher=The Guardian|location=London, UK|first=Luke|last=Harding|access-date=13 May 2010}}</ref> [[Ray Kidder]], then a senior American nuclear scientist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], has said:{{quote|On the basis of this research and my own professional experience, I am ready to challenge any official assertion that Mr. Vanunu possesses any technical nuclear information not already made public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonviolence.org/vanunu/archive2/jan26.html|title=U.S. Expert: It's Safe to Release Vanunu|publisher=Nonviolence.org (from [[Ha'aretz]])|date=26 January 2000}}</ref>}}

==Release, liberties restrictions and asylum applications==
{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
Vanunu was released from prison on 21 April 2004. Surrounded by dozens of journalists and flanked by two of his brothers, he held an impromptu press conference but refused to answer questions in Hebrew because of the suffering he said he sustained at the hands of the State of Israel. 
Vanunu said Israel's Mossad spy agency and the [[Shin Bet]] security services tried to rob him of his [[sanity]] by keeping him in solitary confinement. "You didn't succeed to break me, you didn't succeed to make me crazy," he said. Vanunu also called for Israel's nuclear disarmament, and for its dismantlement as a Jewish state. 
Around 200 supporters and a smaller number of counter-demonstrators attended the conference.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> He indicated a desire to completely dissociate himself from Israel, initially refusing to speak in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and planning to move to Europe or the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serve.com/vanunu/20060113jakarta.html|title=Discussion with a Friend from JAKARTA (letter from Vanunu)|publisher=The Mordechai Vanunu Website|date=13 January 2006}}</ref> as soon as the Israeli government would permit him to do so.

Shortly before his scheduled release, Vanunu remained defiant under interrogation by the security service, Shin Bet. In recordings of the interview made public after his release, he is heard saying "I am neither a traitor nor a spy, I only wanted the world to know what was happening." He also said, "We don't need a [[Jewish state]]. There needs to be a Palestinian state. Jews can, and have lived anywhere, so a Jewish State is not necessary."<ref name=Vanunu_defiant>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3640989.stm|title=Vanunu defiant ahead of release|publisher=BBC|date=19 April 2004|access-date=3 October 2007}}</ref> "Vanunu is a difficult and complex person.

Following his release, Vanunu moved to an apartment in [[Jaffa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-2905585,00.html|script-title=he:המרגל מרדכי ואנונו: "אני גאה ומאושר, אין יותר סודות"|publisher=www.ynet.co.il|trans-title=The spy Mordechai Vanunu: "I am proud and happy, there are no more secrets"|author=Hanan Greenberg|author2=Shmulik Hadad|date=21 April 2004|language=he}}</ref> After the address was published in the media,  he decided to live in [[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem|St. George's Cathedral]] in [[Jerusalem]].

A number of prohibitions were placed upon Vanunu after his release from jail and are still in force:

On 22 April 2004, Vanunu asked the government of Norway for a [[Norwegian passport]] and [[refugee|asylum]] in the country for "humanitarian reasons", according to Norwegian media. He also sent applications to other countries, and stated that he would accept asylum in any country because he fears for his life.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Former conservative Norwegian Prime Minister [[Kåre Willoch]] asked the conservative government to give Vanunu asylum, and the [[University of Tromsø]] offered him a job. On 9 April 2008, it was revealed that Vanunu's request for asylum in Norway was rejected in 2004 by [[Erna Solberg]], at the time Minister of Local Government in the liberal coalition government led by then [[Prime Minister of Norway|Norwegian Prime Minister]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

While the Norwegian foreigner directorate (State Department) (UDI) had been prepared to grant Vanunu asylum, it was suddenly decided that the application could not be accepted because Vanunu had applied for it from outside of the borders of Norway. An unclassified document revealed that Solberg and the government considered that extracting Vanunu from Israel might be seen as an action against Israel and thereby unfitting the Norwegian government's traditional role as a friend of Israel and as a political player in the Middle East. Since the information has been revealed, Solberg has rejected criticism and defended her decision.<ref name="vg.no">{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=531398|title=Erna Solberg hindret Vanunu i å få asyl - VG Nett|publisher=Vg.no|access-date=20 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=531398 |archive-date=30 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/midtosten/artikkel.php?artid=531446|title=Vanunu: - Håper Norge angrer asyl-avslaget - VG Nett|publisher=Vg.no|access-date=20 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/midtosten/artikkel.php?artid=531446|archive-date=30 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/midtosten/artikkel.php?artid=531497|title=Vanunu-venner i harnisk - VG Nett|publisher=Vg.no|access-date=20 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/midtosten/artikkel.php?artid=531497|archive-date=30 June 2009}}</ref>

Vanunu's application for asylum in Sweden was also rejected on the grounds that Sweden, like Norway, does not accept absentee asylum applications. He also unsuccessfully requested asylum in Ireland, which would require him to first be allowed to leave Israel. He has not applied for asylum in his native [[Morocco]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 2006, [[Amnesty International]]'s British branch chief, [[Kate Allen (Amnesty International)|Kate Allen]], wrote that [[Microsoft]] handed over the details of Vanunu's [[Hotmail]] email account by alluding that he was being investigated for espionage. This happened before a court order had been obtained.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/amnesty/story/0,,1784718,00.html|title=Today, our chance to fight a new hi-tech tyranny|date=28 May 2006|publisher=The Observer|location=London, UK|first=Kate|last=Allen|access-date=13 May 2010}}</ref>

International calls for his freedom of movement and freedom of speech made by organizations supporting Vanunu have been either ignored or rejected by Israel. On 15 May 2008, the "Norwegian Lawyer's Petition for Vanunu" was released, signed by 24 Norwegian attorneys. It calls on the Norwegian government to urgently implement a three-point action plan "within the framework of international and Norwegian law" and allow Vanunu to travel to, live and work in Norway. On 11 October 2010, his appeal to rescind the restrictions and allow him to leave Israel and speak to foreigners was denied by the Israeli Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/october112010/beyond-nuclear.php|title=Israel Denies Vanunu's Freedom Again |publisher=Salem-News.Com|access-date=20 November 2010}}</ref>

In March 2015, Vanunu established an Indiegogo campaign to raise the $10,000.00 that he was ordered to pay the Israeli newspaper ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'', when Israel's Court ruled against Vanunu's libel suit against the publication for a November 1999 article. ''Yedioth Ahronoth'''s headline read: "Vanunu gave Hamas activists information on bomb assembly in prison" and a second-page insert entitled, "He's done it again", claimed Vanunu sent messages containing bomb-making information to incarcerated members of Hamas. Avigdor Feldman, Vanunu's defense attorney argued the report was fabricated by Shin Bet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2015/03/23/mordechai-vanunu-cases-of-libel-and-extortion-security-and-press/|title=Mordechai Vanunu: Cases of Libel and Extortion Security and Press|work=The Arab Daily News|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

On 7 May 2015, Mordechai Vanunu reported the restrictions denying his right to leave Israel were renewed for the 12th year since he was released from prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2015/05/08/mordechai-vanunu-reports-israel-renews-human-rights-restrictions-12th-year/|title=Mordechai Vanunu Reports Israel Renews Human Rights Restrictions 12th year|work=The Arab Daily News|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

On 3 June 2015, Minister Vidar Helgesen said Norway had asked Israel to abolish the restrictions against Vanunu leaving Israel for humanitarian considerations. Centre Party foreign policy spokesman Navarsete stated, "I would urge the government to make a difference…it would attract international attention if Norway gave nuclear whistleblower asylum or emergency passport – despite the Israeli sanctions against him." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2015/06/06/free-vanunu-to-norway-international-intervention-required/|title=Free Vanunu to Norway: International Intervention Required|work=The Arab Daily News|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

On 12 August 2015, Mordechai Vanunu and his wife applied for family reunification via the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv. Vanunu's exit to Norway must be accepted by Israel and his entry approved by Norway.

On 23 December 2015, Vanunu wrote: "Freedom of speech and Freedom of movement. 2016 Freedom year" in an update to his 30 October 2015 statement regarding his 8th Supreme Court Appeal. On 30 October Vanunu wrote: "I had a court hearing on 26 October 2015. We appealed all the restrictions. I even spoke to the Judges.

On 24 February 2016, Vanunu tweeted his latest news regarding Israel's Supreme Court which has ordered the Prosecution to respond no later than 21 April 2016 regarding Vanunu's 8th Supreme Court appeal to end all restrictions and allow him to leave Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2016/02/25/mordechai-vanunu-latest-news-at-twitter/|title=Mordechai Vanunu Reports Latest News at Twitter|first=Eileen|last=Fleming|date=25 February 2016|access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref>

On 30 January 2017, Vanunu wrote on Facebook that the three Supreme Court judges were to rule "in a few weeks" regarding his latest appeal seeking to end all restrictions against him so that he can leave Israel. As of 3 March 2017, the last Vanunu wrote on Facebook: "Vanunu Mordechai February 15 at 11:52 am ·We are now waiting for the Supreme court decision, it could be any time soon. And it could be good or nothing, so I am used to all this for 31 years,1986-2017.

On 2 June 2019, Vanunu reported at his Facebook Wall, "that for the 16th year, after 18 years behind bars" Israel renewed the restrictions against Vanunu "not to meet foreigners, not leave the country".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thearabdailynews.com/2019/06/05/vanunu-mordechais-33-years-captivity-continues-at-facebook/ | title=The Arab Daily News &#124; Vanunu Mordechai's 34th Year Captivity Continues at Facebook}}</ref>

On 3 December 2019, Israel's Supreme Court dismissed Vanunu's latest petition seeking to end the restraining orders against "his freedom" and "privacy" citing "a concern about the probability of closeness to the certainty that if the restrictions imposed on Vanunu are removed, he will act to publish this [relevant confidential] information." <ref>[https://thearabdailynews.com/2019/12/21/mordechai-vanunus-2019-supreme-court-petition-for-full-freedom-from-israel-dismissed/ Mordechai Vanunu’s 2019 Supreme Court Petition for full freedom from Israel: DISMISSED! - The Arab Daily News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Arrests and hearings==
Yossi Melman, an Israeli journalist, wrote in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' "Vanunu's harassment by the Israeli government is unprecedented and represents a distortion of every accepted legal norm."<ref name="haaretz.com"/> Vanunu was denied parole at a hearing in May 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/87850.stm|date=4 May 1998|title=Vanunu denied parole|publisher=BBC|access-date=5 October 2008}}</ref> Five years later, parole was again refused. At this parole hearing, Vanunu's lawyer Avigdor Feldman maintained that his client had no more secrets and should be freed. However, the prosecution argued that the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war with Iraq]] would preclude his release. 
After the hearing, Feldman said, "The prosecutor said that if Vanunu were released, the Americans would probably leave Iraq and go after Israel and Israel's nuclear weapons - which I found extremely ridiculous." The real force blocking Vanunu's release, who had been known only as "Y", was exposed in 2001 as Yehiyel Horev, the head of [[Mossad]]'s nuclear and military secrets branch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/correspondent/2841377.stm|date=16 March 2003|title=Israeli nuclear 'power' exposed|publisher=BBC|access-date=5 October 2008|first=Olenka|last=Frenkiel}}</ref>

Following his release in 2004, Vanunu appeared in Israeli courts on numerous occasions on charges of having violated the terms of his release. He was arrested and detained for attempting to go to Bethlehem, on at least one occasion his room in [[St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem|St. George's Cathedral]] was raided by policemen and his belongings were confiscated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article390133.ece|title=Israelis seize Vanunu inside cathedral|date=12 November 2004|publisher=timesonline|access-date=5 October 2008|location=London, UK|first=David|last=Sharrock}}</ref>

Yehiel Horev, the strictest of all the security chiefs in Israel, especially in regard to the protection of institutions such as the [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center]] and the [[Israel Institute for Biological Research]], is apprehensive that if Vanunu goes abroad, he will continue to be a nuisance by stimulating the public debate over Israel's nuclear policy and the [[nuclear weapons]] he says Israel possesses. This is the secret that it is claimed has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/november052010/all-things-nuclear-ef.php|title=All Things Nuclear Must Pass: US, Israel and Iran|publisher=Salem-News.Com|access-date=20 November 2010}}</ref>

On 11 November 2004, Vanunu was arrested by the International Investigations Unit of the Israel Police at around 9{{nbsp}}am while eating breakfast. The arrest stemmed from an ongoing probe examining suspicions of leaking national secrets and violating legal rulings since his release from prison.

Police raided the walled compound of St. George's Cathedral, removing papers and a computer from Vanunu's room. After a few hours' detention, Vanunu was put under house arrest, which was to last seven days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4003869.stm|title=Bishop angry over Vanunu arrest|date=11 November 2004|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

On 24 December 2004, in a vehicle marked as belonging to the foreign press, Vanunu was arrested by Israeli Police while he was attempting to enter the [[West Bank]] in violation of his release restrictions (see above), allegedly to attend mass at the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. After posting [[bail]] of 50,000 [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]], he was released into five-day house arrest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4124597.stm|title=Police keep Vanunu in Jerusalem|date=25 December 2004|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

On 26 January 2005, the BBC reported that its Jerusalem deputy bureau chief, Simon Wilson, was banned from Israel after he refused to submit interview material made with Vanunu to Israeli censors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4208619.stm|title=Israel bars senior BBC producer|date=26 January 2005|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Vanunu gave the interview in violation of court orders. Wilson was allowed to return to Israel on 12 March 2005 after signing an apology letter acknowledging that he defied the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1435915,00.html|title=BBC says sorry to Israel|date=12 March 2005|publisher=The Guardian|location=London, UK|first=Chris|last=McGreal|access-date=13 May 2010}}</ref>

On 17 March 2005, Vanunu was charged with 21 counts of "contravening a lawful direction" (maximum penalty two years' imprisonment per count) and one count of "attempting to contravene a lawful direction."{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

On 18 November that year, Vanunu was arrested at the al-Ram checkpoint north of Jerusalem as he was returning by bus from the West Bank. The Israeli authorities claimed Vanunu's travel ban includes visits to the Palestinian territories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4450004.stm|title=Vanunu held after West Bank visit|date=18 November 2005|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Law/Legal+Issues+and+Rulings/Mordechai|title=Mordechai Vanunu update|publisher=Mfa.gov.il|access-date=20 November 2010}}</ref>

Vanunu was informed on 13 April that the Israeli government has continued his house arrest in Jerusalem and renewed all the restrictions against him, for the fourth time and third year of detention in east Jerusalem.

On 30 April, Vanunu was convicted of violating the order barring foreign contacts and traveling outside Jerusalem.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853978.html Vanunu convicted of violating order barring foreign contacts], Nir Hasson, Haaretz, 30 April 2007. Retrieved 30 April 2007.</ref>

In July, Vanunu was sentenced to a further six months imprisonment for speaking to foreigners and traveling to [[Bethlehem]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,,2117087,00.html|title=Vanunu jailed again after talks with foreigners|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 July 2007|location=London, UK|first=Conal|last=Urquhart|access-date=13 May 2010}}</ref> The court's sentence was unexpected, and even the prosecution expected the court to hand down a suspended sentence, meant solely as a deterrent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/877367.html|title=Vanunu to return to prison for violating the terms of his parole|date=7 February 2007|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> Following his sentence, Vanunu commented that his conviction proved that Israel was still ruled, in effect, by the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] because the law under which he was convicted is from that era. "Maybe I need to turn to [[Queen Elizabeth II|the Queen]] or to [[Tony Blair]] in order to grant me justice," he said.<ref>Nir Hasson, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/877367.html Vanunu to return to prison for violating the terms of his parole], ''Haaretz'', 2 July 2007; retrieved 2 July 2007.</ref>

While having dinner at the [[American Colony Hotel]] in East Jerusalem with a foreigner, Vanunu was arrested for the second time on a Christmas Eve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18957.htm|title=Christmas Eve arrest|publisher=Informationclearinghouse.info|access-date=20 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610115851/http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18957.htm|archive-date=10 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 7 January 2008, the day before his appeal against the above sentence was to begin, Vanunu was re-sentenced to six months of community service.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-lets-mordechai-vanunu-detail-its-nuclear-program-on-primetime-tv/ | title=Israel lets Mordechai Vanunu discuss its nuclear program on primetime TV}}</ref>

On 9 April 2008, it was reported that Norway had joined Sweden, Canada and Denmark in refusing asylum to Vanunu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-04-15/vanunu-turned-down-by-norway-for-asylum/1552240|title=Vanunu turned down by Norway for asylum|publisher=ABC.au|access-date=24 August 2013|date=2005-04-15}}</ref>

On 9 April 2008, unclassified documents revealed that the Norwegian [[Bondevik's Second Cabinet]] (19 October 2001 – 17 October 2005) denied Vanunu asylum in 2004 as a supportive gesture to Israel.<ref name="vg.no"/>

On 13 May that year, Vanunu wrote that although three judges had attempted to convince the Government Lawyer to offer community service in East Jerusalem, it had been denied. Vanunu's appeal against his six-month jail sentence was set to resume on 8 July 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Jerusalem-court-hears-Vanunu-appeal|title=Jerusalem court hears Vanunu appeal|publisher=Jerusalem Post|access-date=24 August 2013}}</ref>

On 15 May 2008, the Norwegian Lawyer's Petition called upon the Norwegian government to urgently implement a three-point action plan within the framework of international and Norwegian law, to grant Vanunu asylum and permission to work and stay in Norway.

On 23 September 2008, the Jerusalem District Court announced: "In light of (Vanunu's) ailing health and the absence of claims that his actions put the country's security in jeopardy, we believe his sentence should be reduced." Vanunu said his health is fine and that, "The issue is about my right to be free, my right to speak and my right to leave the state."

In October, [[First Minister of Scotland|Scottish First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] voiced support for him and stated his shared opposition to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2010/07/19/demands-release-nuclear-whistleblower-israel-holds-vanunu-solitary-confinement|title=Demands for Release of Nuclear Whistleblower as Israel Holds Vanunu in Solitary Confinement|publisher=Common Dreams|date=19 July 2010|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/evening-times/20081001/281672545758176|title=Connecting People Through News|website=PressReader.com|access-date=4 March 2017}}</ref>

On 14 June 2009, Vanunu stated, "The Central Commander of the General Army testified in court that it is OK if I speak in public as long as I do not talk about nuclear weapons... They renewed the restrictions to not speak to foreigners until November. The appeal [against three months in jail for speaking to foreign media in 2004] was scheduled for January, then May 6th and June 18th.

On 6 July, Vanunu's "attorney [[Avigdor Feldman]]...and the state agreed that after six months, pending a review of his conduct, Vanunu will be able to ask for the restrictions to be lifted and be allowed to travel abroad."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Vanunu was arrested by Jerusalem Police on 28 December in a hotel, following an alleged meeting with his girlfriend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/12/29/1009933/vanunu-arrested-for-meeting-foreigner|title=JTA.org|publisher=JTA.org|date=29 December 2009|access-date=20 November 2010}}</ref> The following day, Russian media reported that a search of Vanunu's belongings uncovered a letter from an American causing Israeli officials to be concerned that "he could be orchestrating something." 

On 1 January 2010, it was revealed that Vanunu has known his Norwegian girlfriend, Kristin Joachimsen, a scholar and an associate professor of biblical studies, for two years.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Vanunu published a video message to the media on 7 January regarding his most recent arrest and Israel's "impotent" nuclear ambiguity.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 14 April that year, Vanunu reported that the restrictions denying him the right to leave Israel were renewed for another year.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On 11 May 2010, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Vanunu would "serve a three-month jail sentence handed to him by Jerusalem District Court and not community service" which would begin 23 May 2010.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Vanunu had been sentenced to community service but stated his refusal to perform community service in west Jerusalem, claiming that he would be in danger of being assaulted by a member of the Israeli public; however, he offered to do community service in east Jerusalem.

On 14 July 2011, Vanunu appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court to instruct Interior Minister [[Eli Yishai]] to revoke his Israeli citizenship, claiming that "the Israeli street" and media were treating him belligerently, and that he could "no longer find his place in Israeli society", and that despite his release from prison, "the State of Israel continues to penalize him by imposing various restrictions on his person and travels".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Vanunu's appeal noted an amendment to the Citizenship Act which allowed the Interior Minister to revoke his citizenship even if he did not hold another one, and claimed that revocation of his Israeli citizenship would allow him to seek citizenship or permanent residency in a European country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/Int/App/HPage/SorryPage/0,6173,L-,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204222858/https://www.ynetnews.com/Int/App/HPage/SorryPage/0,6173,L-,00.html|url-status=dead|title=Sorry Back to main page|date=25 October 2012|archive-date=4 December 2017|publisher=ynetnews.com}}</ref>

Vanunu was arrested on 23 April 2015, but it was not reported until six days later, when his attorney Michael Sfard posted on his Facebook page, "Vanunu was in a bookstore near the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem where he met two tourists and to the amazement of the store's customers, it was raided by seven border police…after hours of interrogation, Vanunu was released." Vanunu was arrested on suspicions he had violated the restriction against his speaking with foreigners for more than 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thearabdailynews.com/2015/04/29/comic-relief-in-the-saga-of-mordechai-vanunu|title=Comic Relief in the Saga of Mordechai Vanunu|work=The Arab Daily News|access-date=15 June 2015}}</ref>

In March 2009 Vanunu wrote to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee in Oslo:

{{quote|I am asking the committee to remove my name from the list for this year's list of nominations. I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes [[Shimon Peres]], the [[President of Israel]]. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy. Peres established and developed the atomic weapon program in Dimona in Israel.

Peres was the man who ordered the [[kidnapping]] of me in Italy Rome, Sept. 30, 1986, and for the secret trial and sentencing of me as a spy and traitor for 18 years in [[solitary confinement|isolation]] in prison in Israel. Until now he continues to oppose my freedom and release, in spite of my serving full sentence of 18 years. For all these reasons I don't want to be nominated and will not accept this nomination. I say No to any nomination as long as I am not free, that is, as long as I am still forced to be in Israel. {{Allcaps|What I want is freedom and only freedom}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Mordechai |last=Vanunu |date=1 March 2009 |title=Letter of Mordechaï Vanunu to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee |url=http://www.vanunu.com/20090301nobel.html |publisher=Mordechai Vanunu J.C. |access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref>}}
