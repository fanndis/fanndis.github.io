The '''Mini''' is a small [[economy car]] produced by the English-based [[British Motor Corporation]] (BMC) and its successors from 1959 until 2000.

The layout was also adapted for larger subcompact designs.

This distinctive two-door car was designed for BMC by [[Sir Alec Issigonis]]. It was manufactured at the [[Longbridge plant|Longbridge]] plant in England located next to BMC's headquarters and at the former Morris Motors plant at Cowley near Oxford, in the Victoria Park/Zetland [[British Motor Corporation (Australia)]] factory in [[Sydney]], Australia, and later also in Spain ([[Authi]]), Belgium, Italy ([[Innocenti]]) Chile, Malta, Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia ([[Industrija Motornih Vozil|IMV]]).<ref name="pravilivozili">[http://ba.n1info.com/Auto/a74796/Proizvodnja-automobila-u-bivsoj-Jugoslaviji.html SFRJ četvorotočkaši: Šta su pravili i vozili Jugosloveni?] at ba.n1info.com, 23-12-2015 {{in lang|sr}}</ref> 

The [[Innocenti Mini|Italian version of the Mini]] which was sold under the Innocenti marque was produced in Lambrate, a district of Milan.

The Mini [[Mark I Mini|Mark I]] had three major UK updates&nbsp;– the Mark II, the Clubman, and the Mark III. Within these was a series of variations, including an [[estate car]], a [[pick-up truck]], a van, and the [[Mini Moke]], a [[jeep]]-like buggy.

The performance versions, the Mini Cooper and Cooper "S", were successful as both race and [[rally car]]s, winning the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965, and 1967. In 1966, the first-placed Mini (along with nine other cars) was disqualified after the finish, under a controversial decision that the car's headlights were against the rules.<ref>{{cite news|title=1966: Future of Monte Carlo rally in doubt |date=21 January 1966 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/21/newsid_2506000/2506863.stm |website=On This Day |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

On its introduction in August 1959, the Mini was marketed under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]] names, as the Austin Seven and Morris Mini-Minor.<ref name=austinmemories>[http://www.austinmemories.com/page8/page36/page36.html Austin Seven – Mini, www.austinmemories.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801051923/http://www.austinmemories.com/page8/page36/page36.html |date=1 August 2015 }} Retrieved on 16 June 2013</ref> The Austin Seven was renamed Austin Mini in January 1962<ref name=austinmemories/> and Mini became a [[marque]] in its own right in 1969.<ref name=marque>Michael Sedgwick & Mark Gillies, A-Z of Cars 1945–1970, 1986</ref><ref name="aro-story2">{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Keith|title=Mini development story Pt.2|url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/ado15story2f.htm|work=AROnline|first2=Ian|last2=Nicholls|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054039/http://www.aronline.co.uk/ado15story2f.htm|archivedate=3 October 2011}}</ref> In 1980, it once again became the Austin Mini, and in 1988, just "Mini" (although the "Rover" badge was applied on some models exported to Japan).

[[BMW]] acquired the [[Rover Group]] (formerly [[British Leyland]]) in 1994, and sold the greater part of it in 2000, but retained the rights to build cars using the [[Mini (marque)|Mini name]].  Retrospectively, the car is known as the "Classic Mini" to distinguish it from the modern, BMW influenced [[Mini Hatch|MINI]] family of vehicles produced since 2000

[[File:Mini cross section.jpg|thumb|right|A cross-section shows how a Mini maximises passenger space.]]
The Mini came about because of a fuel shortage caused by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name="Greatcars">{{cite book |last=Coulter |first=Jeremy |title=The World's Great Cars |year=1989 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |location=London |isbn=0-86283-726-X}}</ref> Petrol was once again rationed in the UK, sales of large cars slumped, and the market for German [[bubble car]]s boomed, even in countries such as Britain, where imported cars were still a rarity. The [[Fiat 500]], launched in 1957, was also hugely successful, especially in its native [[Italy]].

[[Leonard Lord]], the somewhat [[autocratic]] head of BMC, reportedly detested these cars so much that he vowed to rid the streets of them and design a 'proper miniature car'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/0910_1959_2000_bmc_mini/index.html |title=1959–2000 BMC Mini&nbsp;– Classic Mini Cooper&nbsp;– Automobile Magazine |publisher=Automobilemag.com |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817094034/http://www.automobilemag.com/features/collectible_classic/0910_1959_2000_bmc_mini/index.html |archivedate=17 August 2010 }}</ref> He laid down some basic design requirements – the car should be contained within a box that measured {{convert|10|*|4|*|4|ft|m}}; and the passenger accommodation should occupy {{convert|6|ft}} of the {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}} length; and the engine, for reasons of cost, should be an existing unit.

[[Alec Issigonis]], who had been working for [[Alvis cars|Alvis]], had been recruited back to BMC in 1955 with a brief from Lord to design a range of technically advanced family cars in the same innovative spirit as his earlier [[Morris Minor]] to complement BMC's existing conventional models.<ref name="issigbio">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Jonathan |title=Alec Issigonis: The Man Who Made the Mini |publisher=Breedon Books Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-449-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nahum |first=Andrew |title=Issigonis and the Mini |publisher=Icon Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-84046-640-5 }}</ref> Issigonis had set out design projects for three cars – large and small family cars and a very small economy car. His initial work was on the largest car, designated XC9001, with the smallest car, XC9003, having the lowest priority despite it being Issigonis' greatest personal interest. With Lord's dictum to produce a bubble car competitor and his revised design requirements being laid down in October 1956, work on XC9001 stopped and XC9003 became the priority. The team that designed the Mini was remarkably small; in addition to Issigonis, Jack Daniels (who had worked with him on the Morris Minor), Chris Kingham (who had been with him at Alvis), two engineering students, and four draughtsmen worked on the project. Together, by July 1957, they had designed and built the original XC9003 prototype, which was affectionately named the  "Orange Box" because of its colour.<ref name="reed1"/> Leonard Lord approved the car for production on 19 July and XC9003 became project [[Amalgamated Drawing Office|ADO15]].

The ADO15 used a conventional [[BMC A-Series engine|BMC A-Series]] [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder]], [[water-cooled]] engine,<ref name="ado15">{{cite web |url=http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |title=Engines of the ADO15 and family |publisher=Mgcars.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190240/http://www.mgcars.org.uk/carclub/sf020201.html |archivedate=7 February 2009 }}</ref> but departed from tradition by mounting it [[Transverse engine|transversely]], with the engine-oil lubricated, four-speed transmission in the [[sump]], and by employing [[front-wheel drive]]. Almost all small front-wheel drive cars developed since have used a similar configuration, except with the transmission usually separately enclosed rather than using the engine oil. The radiator was mounted at the left side of the car so that the engine-mounted fan could be retained, but with reversed pitch so that it blew air into the natural low pressure area under the front wing. This location saved vehicle length, but had the disadvantage of feeding the radiator with air that had been heated by passing over the engine. It also exposed the entire ignition system to the direct entry of rainwater through the grille. Early prototypes used the existing 948-cc A-Series unit, but this provided the ADO15 with performance far greater than its price and purpose required – a top speed over 90&nbsp;mph. The engine was reduced to a new 848-cc capacity with a shorter [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]]. This reduced power from 37 to 33&nbsp;bhp and caused a significant drop in [[torque]], so provided more realistic performance, especially when the ADO15 body was widened by 2 inches (5.08&nbsp;cm) over the XC9003 prototype, which blunted the car's top speed while improving its stability and roadholding. Even so, the ADO15 had a top speed of 75&nbsp;mph, which was better than many other [[economy car]]s of the time.

The [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system, designed by Issigonis's friend Dr. [[Alex Moulton]] at [[Moulton Developments Limited]], used compact rubber cones instead of conventional springs. This space-saving design also featured rising progressive-rate springing of the cones, and provided some natural damping, in addition to the normal dampers. Built into the subframes, the rubber cone system gave a raw and bumpy ride accentuated by the woven-webbing seats, but the rigidity of the rubber cones, together with the wheels' positioning at the corners of the car, gave the Mini [[go kart]]-like handling.

[[File:Mini-ature_Parking_Space_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1169507.jpg|thumb|right|The Mini became an icon of 1960s [[British popular culture]], and featured in the 1969 caper film ''[[The Italian Job]]''.]]
Initially, an interconnected fluid system was planned, similar to the one that Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton were working on in the mid-1950s at Alvis. They had assessed the mechanically interconnected [[Citroën 2CV]] suspension at that time (according to an interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s),{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--Again this apocryphal "interview by Moulton with ''[[Car Magazine]]'' in the late 1990s"! Which issue? Who was the interviewer? Some credibility, please! -->  which inspired the design of the hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Morris/Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. The short development time of the car meant this was not ready in time for the Mini's launch. The system intended for the Mini was further developed and the [[hydrolastic]] system was first used on the [[Morris 1100]], launched in 1962; the Mini gained the system later in 1964. As launched, the Mini had simpler suspension made from [[cone|conical]] springs of solid rubber. These were compact, saving on intrusion into the cabin space, and required no maintenance. The fully independent suspension the rubber cones provided was almost unheard of in low-cost cars of the time. The conical shape gave the springs a progressive action, becoming stiffer at greater degrees of compression. This gave the ADO15 a smooth ride over small bumps, but minimised roll and pitch on more uneven surfaces. It also allowed the springs to cope with the huge variance in load between an unladen car (about 600&nbsp;kg or 1300&nbsp;lb) and a fully laden one (just over 1000&nbsp;kg or 2240&nbsp;lb, or a 70% increase).

Ten-inch (254&nbsp;mm) wheels were specified, so new tyres had to be developed, the initial contract going to [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. Issigonis went to Dunlop stating that he wanted even smaller, {{convert|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels (even though he had already settled on 10-inch). An agreement was made on the 10-inch size, after Dunlop rejected the eight-inch proposition.

Many features were designed into the ADO15's interior to maximise its passenger and luggage space on top of the major savings allowed by the transverse engine and 10-inch wheels. Sliding windows allowed single-skin doors to be fitted, improving elbow room and reducing costs. A bracing bar was fitted across the door frame to brace the single skin and this was later adapted into a large storage bin on each door. Issigonis later said that he had sized the bins to carry the ingredients of his favourite drink, a [[Martini (cocktail)|dry martini]]<ref name="issigbio"/> in the correct proportions (one bottle of [[vermouth]] and 2 of [[Gordon's Gin]]). Similar bins were provided outboard of the rear seats, also serving a dual function of bracing the single-skin body panel. Small items could also be stowed under the rear seats, and early Minis were sold with optional [[wicker]] baskets specially shaped to slot under the seats. The fixed rear parcel shelf contributed to the rigidity of the body shell, although it did preclude fitting the ADO15 with a [[hatchback]]. The [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] lid was hinged at the bottom so that the car could be driven with it open to increase luggage space. On early cars, the [[vehicle registration plate|number plate]] was hinged at the top so that it could swing down to remain visible when the boot lid was open. This feature was later discontinued after it was discovered that exhaust gases could leak into the cockpit when the boot was open.

The Mini was designed as a [[monocoque]] shell with welded seams visible on the outside of the car running down the [[A-pillar|A and C pillars]], and between the body and the floor pan. Those that ran from the base of the A-pillar to the wheel well were described as 'everted' (lit., 'turned outward') to provide more room for the front seat occupants{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. To further simplify construction, the hinges for the doors and boot lid were mounted externally. This also saved a small amount of cabin space. It also made the ADO15 very easy to assemble from complete [[knock-down kit]]s in overseas markets with only basic industry. Cars could be assembled with minimal use of [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] as the external seams made the panels largely 'self-aligning'. They also allowed panels to be stacked flat on top of one other for easy shipping. As originally built, all the structural body panels were welded to the top of the single floor pressing, but this caused major problems with water entering the cabin and was quickly changed in the first months of production.

Early prototypes were fully unitary in construction, but the cars broke apart under the high loads from the large lever ratios used with the rubber cone suspension. The design was changed to use steel subframes to carry the drivetrain and suspension for the front and rear. This also simplified production, as both subframes could be built up independently and then mated to the already-completed bodyshell. It also opened up the possibility of easily producing variants on the ADO15 as a body of any shape or design could be used provided it could accommodate the subframes.

In 1959, BMC and Alec Issigonis won the [[Dewar Trophy]], for the design and production of the Mini.

The Mini shape had become so well known that by the 1990s, [[Rover Group]]&nbsp;– the heirs to BMC&nbsp;– were able to register its design as a trademark in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |title=Trade Mark & Copyright Attorneys in Ashby-de-la-Zouch |publisher=Verymark.info |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805192734/http://www.verymark.info/?page_id=2 |archivedate=5 August 2010 }}</ref>

The Mini was marketed under BMC's two main brand names, Austin and Morris, until 1969, when it became a marque in its own right.<ref name=marque/> The Morris version was known to all as "the Mini" or the "Morris Mini-Minor". This seems to have been a play on words: the Morris Minor was a larger, well known, and successful car that continued in production, and ''minor'' is [[Latin]] for "lesser", so an abbreviation of the Latin word for "least"&nbsp;– ''minimus''&nbsp;– was used for the new even smaller car. One name proposed for the almost identical Austin version was Austin Newmarket, but it was sold as the Austin Seven (sometimes written as ''SE7EN'' in early publicity material&nbsp;– with the '7' using the letter V rotated anticlockwise so it approximated the number 7), which recalled the popular small [[Austin 7]] of the 1920s and 1930s.

Until 1962, the cars appeared in North America and France as the Austin 850 and Morris 850, and in Denmark as the Austin Partner (until 1964) and Morris Mascot (until 1981). It was introduced in Australia as Morris 850 only (not "Austin"), and then later as Morris Cooper and Morris Cooper S versions, as well.  The Morris name Mini (Mini-Minor) was first used for Austin's version by BMC in 1961 when the Austin Seven was rebranded as the Austin Mini,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk/mini_brochures.htm |title=mini_brochures |publisher=Mk1-performance-conversions.co.uk |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> somewhat to the surprise of the [[Sharp's Commercials]] car company (later known as Bond Cars), who had been using the name [[Bond Minicar|Minicar]] for their three-wheeled vehicles since 1949.

In 1964, the suspension of the cars was replaced by another Moulton design, the [[hydrolastic]] system. The new suspension gave a softer ride, but it also increased weight and production cost. In 1971, the original rubber suspension reappeared and was retained for the remaining life of the Mini.

From October 1965, the option of the unique [[Automotive Products]] designed four-speed [[AP automatic transmission|automatic transmission]] became available. Cars fitted with this became the Mini-Matic.

Slow at the outset, Mark I sales strengthened across most of the model lines in the 1960s, and production totalled 1,190,000.<ref name="sales"/> [[Ford]] purchased a Mini and dismantled it to see if they could offer an alternative. Ford determined that the BMC must have been losing around £30 per car, so decided to produce a larger car&nbsp;– the [[Ford Cortina|Cortina]], launched in 1962&nbsp;– as its competitor in the budget market. BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money.<ref>Laban, Brian (2005) ''The Little Book of MINI''</ref> Larger profits came from the popular De Luxe models and from optional extras such as seat belts, door mirrors, a heater, and a radio, which would be considered necessities on modern cars, as well as the various Cooper and Cooper S models.

The Mini entered into popular culture in the 1960s with well-publicised purchases by film and music stars.<ref>{{cite book |last=Golding |first=Rob |year=2007 |quote=Initial sales were worryingly slow.

A variety of Mini types was made in [[Pamplona]], Spain, by the [[Authi]] company from 1968 onwards, mostly under the Morris name. {{anchor|Chile}} In 1969, a fibreglass version of the Mini Mark II was developed for British Leyland's Chilean subsidiary (British Leyland Automotores de Chile, S.A., originally the independent assembler EMSSA). The bodyshell mould was created by the [[Peel Engineering Company]]. Production began in 1970 and continued for a few years; these fibreglass Minis can be recognised by the missing body seams and by larger panel gaps. The Chilean market was never very large and the hyperinflation and political and social collapse led to the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|1973 coup]].

The Mark III Mini had a modified bodyshell with enough alterations to see the factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows, although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening quarterlight windows). The suspension reverted from hydrolastic to rubber cones<ref name=Autocar1976/> as a cost-saving measure.<ref name="mrtb5">{{cite book | title=Mini Gold Portfolio 1981–1997 | isbn=1-85520-385-5 }}</ref> (The 1275 GT and Clubman retained the hydrolastic system until June 1971, when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.<ref name=Autocar1976/>)

In 1969, the simple name Mini completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |title=Mini–mk III (1969–2000) history, pictures |publisher=Histomobile.com |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=11 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153350/http://www.histomobile.com/1/Mini/1969/-_.htm?lan=1 |archivedate=15 June 2011}}</ref> In April 1974, a heater became standard equipment on the entry-level Mini 850, as well, having by then already been included in the standard specification of the other models for some time.<ref name=Autocar1976/>

In the late 1970s, Innocenti introduced the [[Innocenti Mini|Innocenti 90 and 120]], [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]]-designed hatchbacks based on the Mini platform. Bertone also created a Mini Cooper equivalent, christened the [[Innocenti De Tomaso]], that sported a 1275-cc engine similar to the MG Metro engine, but with an 11-stud head, a special inlet manifold, and used the "A" clutch instead of the "Verto" type. It also used [[Constant-velocity joint|homokinetic shafts]] instead of rubber couplings.

The Mini was still popular in Britain, but appeared increasingly outdated in the face of newer and more practical rivals. Since the late 1960s, plans had been in place for a newer and more practical supermini to replace it, though the Mini was still the only car of this size built by British Leyland for the home market.

The Mark IV was introduced in 1976, though by this stage British Leyland was working on a new small car which was widely expected to replace the Mini before much longer. It had a front rubber-mounted subframe with single tower bolts and the rear frame had some larger bushings introduced, all intended to improve the car's mechanical refinement and to reduce noise levels. Twin column stalks for indicators and wipers were introduced, as were larger foot pedals. From 1977 onwards, the rear light clusters included reversing lights.

In July 1979 the lower end of the Mini range was altered. The basic Mini 850 (which had featured in various forms since the original launch 20 years before) was withdrawn. Its place was taken by two models at slightly lower and slightly higher price points. The new base model was the Mini City, with black-painted bumpers, an untrimmed lower facia rail, part-fabric seats and wing mirror and sun visor only on the driver's side, plus unique 'City' body graphics and boot badge. Above the City was the new 850 SDL (Super Deluxe), which had the same specification as the standard Mini 1000 but with the smaller engine.
 
For August 1979 the Mini's 20th anniversary was marked by the introduction of the first true limited-edition Mini, which was the Mini 1100 Special. This was a 5000-car run with the 1098cc engine, broadly to the specification already in production for the European market as a standard model with the same name. However this was the first time a UK-market 'round-nose' (i.e. non-Clubman) Mini had been available with the 1098cc engine, and the UK limited edition was also fitted with unique Exacton alloy wheels – the first time these were fitted to a factory-produced Mini – and plastic wheelarch extensions. Inside was the 1275GT's three-dial instrument cluster and a leather-rimmed wheel with a rectangular centre from the Innocenti Mini hatchback. 

The 1100 Special<ref>http://www.minipassionmini.50megs.com/pdf/Mini%20Special%201100%20UK%201979.pdf</ref> and 850 City models were phased out by 1980,<ref>https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/1979/1705775/mini_850_city.html</ref> and during the same year the engine was upgraded to the improved A-Plus unit from the new Metro. This was then followed by a number of incremental developments.

In 1978, the Mini was one of the key cars made available to disabled motorists under the new [[Motability]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/25/newsid_2500000/2500373.stm | work=BBC News | title=1978: Motability gets moving in the UK | date=25 July 1978}}</ref>

Reports of the Mini's imminent demise surfaced again in 1980 with the launch of the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] (badging with the word "mini" in all lowercase). Faced with competition from a new wave of modern superminis like the [[Ford Fiesta]], [[Renault 5]], and [[Volkswagen Polo]], the Mini was beginning to fall out of favour in many export markets, with the South African, Australian, and New Zealand markets all stopping production around this time. Buyers of small cars now wanted modern and practical designs, usually with a hatchback.

Although the Mini continued to be produced after the Metro's launch, production volumes were reduced as British Leyland and its successor Rover Group concentrated on the Metro as its key supermini. The original Mini's last year in the top ten of Britain's top selling cars was 1981, as it came ninth and the Metro was fifth. The arrival of the Metro also had production of the larger Allegro pruned back before it was finally discontinued in 1982. In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis and over 175,000 Metros. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the [[BMC A-Series engine#A-Plus versions|A-Plus engine]], 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' [[List of Mini limited editions#Anniversary editions|limited-edition]] model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact [[city car]] that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of [[List of Mini limited editions#Colours|limited editions]] with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the [[List of Mini limited editions#London Collection|London Collection]] of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.

All cars had {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} brake discs and plastic wheel arches (Mini Special arches), but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape. The Mini Cooper was relaunched in 1990, 20 years after the demise of the original model.

The engine mounting points were moved forward to take 1275-cc power units, and includes the later Horizontal Integral Float version of the [[SU carburettor|SU carb]], plus the single-point fuel-injected car, which came out in 1991. The 998-cc power units were discontinued. An internal bonnet release was fitted from 1992. Production ended in August 1996 as the Mark VII replaced it.

This was the final version, twin point injection with front-mounted radiator. Full-width dashboard replaces the original shelf, internal bonnet release. Introduction of [[airbag]] on driver's side. The basic Mini was the 1.3i, the other model in the range being the Mini Cooper. The end of production in October 2000 not only signalled the end of original Mini production after 41 years, but also brought about the demise of the 1275-cc engine which had powered the Mini and numerous other BL/BMC/ARG cars for more than 35 years.

==Variants==
The popularity of the original Mini spawned many models that targeted different markets.

===Wolseley Hornet and Riley Elf (1961–69)===
[[File:Wolseley Hornet Biggleswade.JPG|thumb|Wolseley Hornet]]
[[File:Riley Elf.jpg|thumb|right|Riley Elf]]
Released in 1961 as more luxurious versions of the Mini, both the [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]] Hornet and the [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more conventional [[Three-box styling|three-box design]].
The wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at {{convert|2.036|m|ft|abbr=on}}, whereas the overall length was increased to {{convert|3.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This resulted in a dry weight of {{convert|638|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|642.3|kg|abbr=on}} (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and {{convert|618|kg|abbr=on}}/{{convert|636.4|kg|abbr=on}} for the Hornet.<ref name="AKD4062C">Hornet and Elf Workshop Manual, Part No. AKD 4062C, BMC Service Limited, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref>
Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit "Wolseley" badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars.<ref>[http://www.motorbase.com/vehicle/by-id/710/ "Riley Elf", ''Motorbase'']. Retrieved on 21 June 2008.</ref> The name "Wolseley Hornet" was first used on [[Wolseley Hornet six|1930s saloon, coupé, sports and racing cars]], while the name "Elf" recalled the [[Riley Nine|Riley Sprite]] and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name "Imp" could not be used as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.
Both the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their "Fisholow" brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.
Very early Mark I versions of both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below scuttle panel) that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.
Early production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats.<ref name="AKD3489">Body Service Parts List, Riley Elf, Wolseley Hornet, British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, BMC Service division, Cowley, Oxford, England.</ref> Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.
In 1966 the Heinz food company commissioned, from Crayford Convertibles ([[Crayford Engineering]]), 57 convertible Hornets to be given as prizes in a UK competition.  Many are still on the road as of 2020.

Both the Elf and the Hornet went through three engine versions. Initially, they used the {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} {{convert|34|bhp|abbr=on}} engine (engine type 8WR)<ref name="AKD4062C"/> with a single HS2 carburettor, changing to a single HS2 carburettor {{convert|38|bhp|abbr=on}} version of the Cooper's {{convert|998|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} power unit (engine type 9WR)<ref name="AKD4062C"/> in the Mark II in 1963. This increased the car's top speed from {{convert|71|to|77|mph|abbr=on}}. Therefore, Mark II cars also came with increased braking power in the form of front drum brakes with twin leading shoes to cope with the increased power output. Both Mark I and Mark II featured four-speed gearboxes (three synchromesh gears) with rod gear change, a.k.a. "magic wand" type. Automatic gearboxes became available on the Mark II in 1965 as an option. The Mark III facelift of 1966 brought wind-up windows and fresh-air fascia vents. Concealed door hinges were introduced two years before these were seen on the mainstream Mini. The gear selecting mechanism was updated to the rod type, as seen on all later Mini type cars. Automatic gearboxes were available to the Mark III in 1967 again. Full-four synchromesh gearing was eventually introduced during 1968. 30,912 Riley Elfs and 28,455 Wolseley Hornets were built.<ref name="sales"/> Production of both models ceased in late 1969.

===Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1960–69)===
[[File:1i i8.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk1 with internal fuel tank]]
[[File:2 t75.jpg|thumb|Morris Mini Traveller Mk2]]
These models were two-door estate cars with double "barn"-style rear doors. Both were built on a slightly longer chassis of {{convert|84|in|m}} compared to {{convert|80.25|in|m}} for the saloon.

The early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman cars had an internal fuel tank located on the left hand side of the rear load area.  This is identifiable by the fuel filler cap being on the left hand side of the car just below the rear window.
In October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the filler cap was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car – the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.

From the start of production both models had a decorative, non-structural, ash wood trim on the rear body, in the style of a pre-war [[shooting-brake]]. This gave the car a similar appearance to the larger Morris Minor Traveller and gave rise to these cars simply being called a [[Woodie (car body style)|woodie]].  It is a popular misconception that the difference between the Traveller and the Countryman is the wood trim.
An all steel version of both the Traveller and the Countryman without the wood trim was launched for export markets in April 1961 and for the home market in October 1962, but the woodie version remained more popular.

In October 1967 the Mk2 version was launched with the same changes as the saloon.

Approximately 108,000 Austin Mini Countrymans and 99,000 Morris Mini Travellers were built.<ref name="sales"/> Variations of this model were also built in South Africa, by Innocenti in Italy and by Industria de Montagem de Automoveis in Portugal.

The Mini Traveller and Countryman Register was created in 2009 to help locate and preserve the remaining Mini Traveller and Countryman cars.

===Mini Van (1960–83){{anchor|Mini_Van}}===
[[File:Austin Mini Van3222dg.JPG|thumb|right|1963 Austin Mini Van]]
The Mini Van was a commercial panel van (in US English, a [[sedan delivery]]) rated at ¼-ton load capacity. Built on the longer Traveller chassis but without side windows, it proved popular in 1960s Britain as a cheaper alternative to the car: it was classed as a commercial vehicle and as such carried no sales tax. A set of simple stamped steel slots served in place of a more costly chrome grille. The Mini Van was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978, the number representing the gross vehicle weight of 0.95&nbsp;tons. 521,494 were built.

A utility vehicle intended for the British Army was built with a twin-engined 4-wheel-drive. Although the 4WD Moke could climb a 1:2 gradient, it lacked enough ground clearance for military use.<ref>[http://www.theunmutual.co.uk/minimoke.htm Kitcher, Nigel and Davy, Rick.

===Mini Pick-up (1961–83)===
[[File:Mini pickup ADO8547.JPG|thumb|Mini Pick-up.]]
A pick-up truck (technically a [[coupé utility]] by definition{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}), {{convert|11|ft|m|abbr=on}} in total length was built on the longer Mini Van platform, with an open-top rear cargo area and a tailgate. The factory specified the weight of the Pick-up as less than {{convert|1500|lb|abbr=on}} with a full {{convert|6|impgal}} tank of fuel.

As with the Van, the Pick-up had stamped metal slots for airflow into the engine compartment. The Pickup was basic, although the factory brochure described a "fully equipped Mini Pick-up is also available which includes a recirculatory heater." Passenger-side sun visor, seat belts, laminated windscreen, tilt tubes and cover were also available at extra cost.<ref>[http://www.minipickup.org/literature/viewitem.php?p=6519 "Dependable in service – Austin Mini van and pickup"]. ‘'Mini Pick-up International'’ Retrieved on 21 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313045007/http://www.minipickup.org/literature/viewitem.php?p=6519 |date=13 March 2012 }}</ref>
Like the van, the Pick-up was renamed as the Mini 95 in 1978.

A total of 58,179 Mini Pick-up models were built.<ref name="sales"/>

A small round sticker with a kangaroo logo was placed on the triangular panel between the door and the front body seam.  The "Kangaroo" name was supposedly coined because it is claimed that a kangaroo can go all day without drinking which the advertisers used to emphasise the frugal fuel consumption and, possibly, larger fuel tank.

Issigonis' friend [[John Cooper (car maker)|John Cooper]], owner of the [[Cooper Car Company]] and designer and builder of [[Formula One]] cars, saw the potential of the Mini for competition. Issigonis was initially reluctant to see the Mini in the role of a performance car, but after John Cooper appealed to BMC management, the two men collaborated to create the Mini Cooper. The Austin Mini Cooper and Morris Mini Cooper debuted in September 1961.<ref name="issigbio"/><ref>{{cite news|title=B.M.C.

The {{convert|848|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} engine from the Morris Mini-Minor was given a longer stroke to increase capacity to {{convert|997|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} increasing power from {{convert|34|to|55|bhp|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ado15"/> The car featured a race-tuned engine, twin [[SU carburetor|SU carburettors]], a closer-ratio gearbox and front [[disc brake]]s, uncommon at the time in a small car. One thousand units of this version were commissioned by management, intended for and designed to meet the [[homologation]] rules of [[Group A|Group 2]] rally racing. The 997&nbsp;cc engine was replaced by a shorter stroke 998&nbsp;cc unit in 1964. In 1962, Rhodesian [[John Love (racing driver)|John Love]] became the first non-British racing driver to win the British Saloon Car Championship driving a Mini Cooper.
[[File:Timo Mäkinen - 1965 Rally Finland (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Timo Mäkinen]] and Mini Cooper S on their way to the first of a [[hat-trick]] of wins in the [[Rally Finland|1000 Lakes Rally]] in Finland]]
A more powerful Mini Cooper, dubbed the "S", was developed in tandem and released in 1963. Featuring a 1071&nbsp;cc engine with a 70.61&nbsp;mm bore and nitrided steel crankshaft and strengthened bottom end to allow further tuning; and larger [[Vacuum servo|servo-assisted]] disc brakes, 4,030 Cooper S cars were produced and sold until the model was updated in August 1964. Cooper also produced two S models specifically for circuit racing in the under 1,000&nbsp;cc and under 1,300&nbsp;cc classes respectively, rated at {{convert|970|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|1275|cc|cuin|abbr=on}}, both had a {{convert|70.61|mm|abbr=on}} bore and both were also offered to the public. The smaller-engine model was not well received, and only 963 had been built when the model was discontinued in 1965. The 1,275&nbsp;cc Cooper S models continued in production until 1971.

Sales of the Mini Cooper were: 64,000 Mark I Coopers with 997&nbsp;cc or 998&nbsp;cc engines; 19,000 Mark I Cooper S with 970&nbsp;cc, 1,071&nbsp;cc or 1,275&nbsp;cc engines; 16,000 Mark II Coopers with 998&nbsp;cc engines; 6,300 Mark II Cooper S with 1,275&nbsp;cc engines. There were no Mark III Coopers and 1,570 Mark III Cooper S.

An agreement between BMC and [[Innocenti]] was announced in 1959 to assemble manufacture BMC cars for the Italian market.<ref name="Innocenti">{{cite journal |last=LaChance |first=Dave |title=The Mini from Milan – 1973 Innocenti Mini |journal=Hemmings Sports and Exotics |date=March 2017 |url= https://www.hemmings.com/stories/article/the-mini-from-milan-1973-innocenti-mini |accessdate=3 November 2020}}</ref> The first Mini Coopers assembled in Milan from imported [[knock-down kit]]s with sales of the Innocenti Mini Cooper 1300 began in March 1966.<ref name="Innocenti"/> It was licensed in 1973 to Spain's Authi (Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses), which began to produce the Authi Mini Cooper 1300. The Cooper name was discontinued from the UK Mini range at this time.

A new Mini Cooper named the RSP (Rover Special Products) was briefly relaunched in 1990–91, with slightly lower performance than the 1960s Cooper. It proved popular and a new Cooper-marked Mini went into full production in late 1991. To meet emission standards, Coopers from 1992 on were fitted with a [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the 1,275&nbsp;cc engine, and in 1997 a multi-point fuel-injected engine was introduced, along with a front-mounted radiator and various safety improvements.<ref name="parnell2">{{cite book |last=Parnell| first=John |title=Original Mini-Cooper: The Restorers Guide To All MKL, II, And III Models |isbn=1-870979-32-X | year=1993 |publisher=Bay View}}</ref> "I love my Mini Cooper," remarked [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 2003.

In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist [[Roy Haynes (designer)|Roy Haynes]], who had previously worked for [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the [[Austin Maxi]]. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. A new model, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original "round-front" design remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT.

[[File:Mini Clubman Estate (12769772824).jpg|thumb|left|Mini Clubman Estate|230x230px]]
Production of the Clubman and 1275 GT got off to a slow start because the cars incorporated "lots of production changes" including the relocation of tooling from the manufacturer's [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] plant to the [[Longbridge plant]]: very few cars were handed over to customers before the early months of 1970.<ref name="Autocar197102">{{cite journal| first=Geoffrey |last=Howard| title = 10,000-mile (0 km) long-term report: Mini Clubman Estate| journal=Autocar | volume = 134 | issue = 3907| pages = 22–23 |date = 11 February 1971}}</ref>

Early domestic market Clubmans were still delivered on cross-ply tyres despite the fact that by 1970 [[Radial tire|radials]] had become the norm for the car's mainstream competitors.<ref name=Autocar197102/> By 1973 new Minis were, by default, being shipped with radial tyres, though cross-plies could be specified by special order, giving British buyers a price saving of £8.<ref name="Autocar197304">{{cite journal| title = Auto Test Mini 850| journal=Autocar | volume = 138 | issue = 4012 | pages = 8–12 |date = 19 April 1973}}</ref>

[[File:Mini 1275 GT, front.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 1275 GT|229x229px]]
The 1275 GT is often incorrectly described as the "Mini Clubman 1275 GT". The official name was always just the "Mini 1275 GT", and it was a separate, distinct model from the Clubman (although it shared the same frontal treatment as the Mini Clubman, and was launched at the same time).

In 1971, the 1,275&nbsp;cc Mini Cooper S was discontinued in the UK, leaving the Mini 1275 GT as the only sporting Mini on sale for the rest of the decade. Innocenti in Italy, however, continued making their own version of the Mini Cooper for some time. While the UK-built 1275 GT was not nearly as quick as a 1275 Mini Cooper S, it was cheaper to buy, run, and insure. It was the first Mini to be equipped with a [[tachometer]]. It also featured a standard-fit close-ratio gearbox, and initially had 10-inch (25.4&nbsp;cm) Rostyle wheels covering the 7.5inch (19.05&nbsp;cm) Cooper S type disc brakes, and a boot board; both were dropped in 1974. Performance of the 1275GT was lively for the time, achieving 0–{{convert|60|mph|abbr=on}} in 12.9&nbsp;seconds, and the excellent mid-range torque offered a {{convert|30|–|50|mph|abbr=on}} time in top gear of only nine seconds. The bluff front, however, meant that the model struggled to reach {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Throughout the 1970s, British Leyland continued to produce the classic 1959 "round-front" design, alongside the newer Clubman and 1275 GT models. The long-nose Clubman and 1275 GT offered better crash safety, were better equipped, and had better under-bonnet access, but they were more expensive and aerodynamically inferior to the original 1959 design. The Mini Clubman and 1275 GT were replaced in 1980 by the new hatchback Austin Metro, while production of the original "round-front" Mini design continued for another 20 years. At the end of Clubman and 1275 GT production, 275,583 Clubman saloons, 197,606 Clubman Estates and 110,673 1275 GTs had been made.<ref name="sales"/>

[[File:Leyland Mini LS.jpg|thumb|right|The Leyland Mini LS was produced by [[Leyland Australia]] from 1977 to 1978]]

To end Mini production in Australia, a limited-edition runout model was produced – the 1275LS. Fitted with a pollution control 1,275&nbsp;cc engine sourced from Europe, the LS had a single {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on}} carburettor and {{convert|8.4|in|mm|adj=on}} disc brakes. Production of this model commenced in July 1978 and concluded in October 1978 with an approximate total of 810 vehicles produced.

==End of production==
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the British market received numerous "special editions" of the Mini, which shifted the car from a mass-market item into a fashionable icon. It was this image that perhaps helped the Mini become such an asset for [[BMW]], which later bought the remnants of BMC as the [[MG Rover Group|Rover Group]]. It was even more popular in Japan, which took the lion's share of the circa 40,000 Minis produced annually in the early 1990s.<ref name=Facorca/> It was seen there as a retro-cool icon, and inspired many imitators. The [[E.R.A. Mini Turbo|ERA Mini Turbo]] was particularly popular with Japanese buyers.

In 1994, under [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]], a [[first cousin once removed]] of Issigonis, BMW took control of the Rover Group, which included the Mini, fitting an [[airbag]] to comply with European legislation.

[[File:2000 Mini Cooper (X411 JOP) 1.3.jpg|thumb|left|The last Mini produced, a Rover Cooper Mini Sport, rolled off the Longbridge line on 4 October 2000]]
By March 2000, Rover was still suffering massive losses, and BMW decided to dispose of most of the companies. The sell-off was completed in May that year. [[MG (car)|MG]] and Rover went to [[Phoenix Venture Holdings|Phoenix]], a new British consortium; and [[Land Rover]] was sold to [[Ford Motor Company]]. BMW retained the Mini name and the planned new model, granting Rover temporary rights to the brand and allowing it to manufacture and sell the run-out model of the old Mini. By April 2000, the range consisted of four versions: the Mini Classic Seven, the Mini Classic Cooper, the Mini Classic Cooper Sport and—for overseas European markets—the Mini Knightsbridge. The last Mini (a red Cooper Sport) was built on 4 October 2000 and presented to the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust in December of that year.<ref name="reed1"/> A total of 5,387,862 cars had been manufactured, nearly 1.6 million of which were sold in Britain, although the majority of these were sold at least 20 years before the Mini's demise, meaning that the majority of those sold had been scrapped before the end of the original Mini's production life.<ref name="sales"/>

After the last of the Mini production had been sold, the 'Mini' name passed to BMW ownership. [[Mini Hatch]], the new model made by BMW, is technically unrelated to the old car but retains the classic transverse four-cylinder, front-wheel-drive configuration and "bulldog" stance of the original.

The last Mini to leave the Longbridge plant did so in 2012, when a 1970s 1275GT which was used by staff to travel around the car plant was recovered from the disused tunnels under the plant. The car was damaged by a storage container falling on it and had been left without an engine or gearbox for around 30 years before being recovered during work to infill the tunnels. This car was sold at auction in July 2013 for £1400.<ref name="Mini-2013">{{cite news | title = Final Longbridge factory Mini sold at auction | date = 28 July 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23482725 | work = BBC News Online | accessdate = 28 July 2013}}</ref>

==Limited editions==
{{Main|List of Mini limited editions}}
From the Mark IV onward, many special limited-production editions of the Mini were offered. These included models that were created to commemorate racing victories or to celebrate an anniversary of the Mini marque. Limited editions generally came equipped with a unique combination of interior and exterior trim and special decals. Examples include Mini 1100 Special, Mini 1000 Special HL (only available in silver colour with black vinyl roof, black cloth upholstery seats with head restraints and walnut interior trim, for Portugal market only), Mini Rio, Mini Mayfair, Mini Park Lane, Mini Cooper RSP, Mini Flame, Mini Red Hot, Mini Jet Black, Mini Racing, Mini Thirty (30) which 3000 examples were produced, 2000 in Red and 1000 in Black and the Mini Monza. There was also a version inspired by ''[[The Italian Job]]'', a 1969 film famous for having a trio of Minis in its epic closing car chase.

[[File:1969 Mini 9X prototype Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon.jpg|thumb|left|Mini 9X at the [[Heritage Motor Centre]]]]

From 1967 to 1979, Issigonis had been designing a replacement for the Mini in the form of an experimental model called the 9X.<ref name="issigbio"/> It was longer and more powerful than the Mini, but due to politicking inside [[British Leyland]] (which had now been formed by the merger of BMC's parent company [[British Motor Holdings]] and the [[Leyland Motor Corporation]]), the car did not reach production.

A number of prototypes produced for vehicles based on the Mini but which never saw production are held and sometimes displayed at the British [[Heritage Motor Centre]] museum at [[Gaydon]], Warwickshire. These included the Twini, a re-engineered [[four-wheel-drive]] Moke with two engines—one at the front and another at the back; the [[Austin Ant]], a second attempt to produce a four-wheel-drive vehicle, this time using a [[transfer case]]; and a two-seater convertible MG edition of the Mini, cancelled due to it being perceived as competition for the [[MG Midget]].

In 1992, a project considering possible improvements to the Mini was started. Codenamed ''Minki'' ("Mini" plus [[Rover K engine|K-Series]] engine), it included a redesigned dashboard, a two-piece [[Trunk (automobile)#Door|rear door or tailgate]] instead of a boot, fold down rear seats, [[Hydragas]] suspension and a 3-cylinder version of the K-Series engine with a 5-speed gearbox.<ref name="am-minki">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |title=Austin Memories: Minki |work=austinmemories.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209025952/http://www.austinmemories.com/page46/page46.html |archivedate=9 February 2010 }}</ref> However, the project was cancelled by management within Rover, who decided that the cost of engineering the changes, and achieving compliance with modern crash testing standards, was too great for the production volumes that could be expected of an updated Mini.

In 1995 the idea to update the Mini again surfaced but this time with BMW management. As part of the process of deciding how to replace the Mini, a vehicle representing what the current Mini could have become, if it had been developed further over its production history, was commissioned.<ref name="am-minki"/> This resulted in the ''Minki-II'', designed to house the 1.4L MPI K-Series engine with an extensive redesign inside, but without the original Minki's tailgate. The car had to be widened by 50mm and lengthened by 50mm to accommodate the new engine and gearbox, with Hydragas suspension and dashboard from a [[Rover Metro|Rover 100]]. The Minki-II was used for Hydragas development work, this suspension being considered at the time for the R59 project, later to become the [[Mini Hatch]].

==Motorsport==
BMC operated a Competition Department at [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], Oxfordshire, under the control of Stuart Turner, which built specially prepared Minis (mostly based on Cooper and Cooper S versions) to compete in international rallies and other motorsport. This department played a key role in ensuring the Mini's huge success in motorsport throughout the 1960s, in particular, winning the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in 1965, 1966 and 1967, and dominating all of the first 9 positions in the [[1966 Gallaher 500]] at Bathurst.

The car also won the [[1961 British Saloon Car Championship season|1961]], [[1962 British Saloon Car Championship season|1962]], [[1969 British Saloon Car Championship season|1969]], [[1978 British Saloon Car Championship season|1978]] and [[1979 British Saloon Car Championship season]], as well as the [[British Rally Championship]] in 1962, 1963 and 1970, the [[European Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966, and won the [[Finnish Rally Championship]] in 1965 and 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/171318/Winners+of+FRC.html|title=Winners of FRC|website=Ralli SM}}</ref> Minis also won the [[1965 Lowood 4 Hour]] endurance race, and the final [[Finnish Grand Prix]] in 1963. The Cooper S also had some success in the [[European Touring Car Championship]], winning in 1964 and 1968, the [[Guia Race of Macau]] (a 1-2-3 finish in 1965, a 1–2 finish in 1970 and a win in 1972), and the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning its class in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. A further title was the 1971 [[Sun-7 Chesterfield Series]]. The Mini also achieved class wins at the [[1963 Armstrong 500]], repeating this feat every year until [[1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500|1969]], and having class wins at the 1964, 1965 and [[1971 Sandown 250]], and [[Six Hour Le Mans]] in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972, as well as the [[1971 Phillip Island 500K]]. The car also won the [[Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Championship]] in 1998. Mini Leyland came 4th place in the under-2-litre category in the [[1966 Trans-Am season|1966]], [[1967 Trans-Am season|1967]] and [[1969 Trans-Am season]]s, improving to 3rd in [[1970 Trans-Am season|1970]].

The Mini Cooper S won the [[Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1964, 1965 and 1967.<ref name="montecarlo"/> Minis initially placed first, second and third in the 1966 rally as well, but were disqualified after a controversial decision by the judges. The disqualification related to the use of a variable resistance [[headlight|headlamp]] dimming circuit in place of a dual-filament lamp.<ref name="browning">{{cite book | last=Browning |first=Peter | title=The Works Minis | isbn=0-85429-128-8 | year=1971 | publisher=Foulis | location=Henley on Thames }}</ref> Fourth placed Roger Clark's Ford Cortina was disqualified for the same reason, along with six other cars.  The fifth car past the finishing line, a [[Citroën DS]], a model that had won the race previously, was awarded first place – the DS had similar headlamps, but these were standard production equipment on the car – in line with the letter of the rules.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/21/newsid_2506000/2506863.stm |title=BBC Future of Monte Carlo rally in doubt |work=BBC News  |accessdate=11 October 2010 |date=21 January 1966}}</ref> The driver of the Citroën, [[Pauli Toivonen]], felt that he had not really "won" the rally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_family.htm |title=Pauli Toivonen and Harri Toivonen Profiles |website=Thruxton.f9.co.uk |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref> BMC probably received more publicity from the disqualification than they would have gained from a victory.<ref name="classicmotorsports">{{cite journal | title=Legend of the Mini | journal=Classic Motorsports | year=2004 | issue=109 | page=8}}</ref>

In [[rallycross]], the Mini finished on the podium in the first ever race, at [[Lydden Hill Race Circuit]] in February 1967, winning races in the [[FIA European Rallycross Championship]] in 1974 and 1975. The car competed as late as the [[1979 Australian Rallycross Championship]].

==Awards==
The Mini has won many awards over the years, including second place in 1999's "Global" [[Car of the Century]] award, behind only the [[Model T Ford]]. In the same competition, run by the prestigious [[Global Automotive Elections Foundation]], the Mini was selected "European Car of the Century". ''[[Grassroots Motorsports]]'' awarded Mini with the Editors' Choice award in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grassrootsmotorsports.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229033723/http://www.grassrootsmotorsports.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 February 2000|date=29 February 2000|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> The Mini also received awards for "Car of the Century" (''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' magazine 1995) and "Number One Classic Car of All Time" (''[[Classic & Sports Car]]'' magazine 1996).

In the end 5.3&nbsp;million Minis were sold, making it the most popular British car ever made.

At its peak, the Mini was a strong seller in most of the countries where it was sold, with the United Kingdom inevitably receiving the highest volumes. The 1,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/millionth-mini |title=Millionth Mini – British Pathé |website=Britishpathe.com |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref> with the 2,000,000th in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/two-millionth-mini-special |title=Two Millionth Mini – Special – British Pathé |website=Britishpathe.com |date=2014-01-23 |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref> The 3,000,000th Mini came off the production line in 1972, with the 4,000,000th in 1976.<ref>{{cite web|last=Day |first=James |url=http://libraryofmotoring.info/tag/classic-mini/ |title=classic Mini &#124; library of motoring – An online collection of MINI information |website=Libraryofmotoring.info |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref>

It dominated the mini-car market until the arrival of the [[Hillman Imp]] in 1963. It outsold the Imp. Competition arrived with the more modern and practical [[Vauxhall Chevette]] of 1975, but the Mini continued to sell well until its "replacement"—the [[Austin Metro|Metro]]—arrived in 1980. By this time, the Mini's design had been overtaken by numerous more modern and practical vehicles.

Although the Metro did not replace the Mini, production figures for the Mini dipped during the 1980s, and interest in the design was not revived until the reintroduction of the Mini Cooper in 1990. This helped sales of the Mini through the 1990s, to the end of production on 4 October 2000.

A total of 1,581,887 Minis were sold in Britain after its launch in 1959. The last new one to be registered was sold in 2004, some four years after the end of production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/motors/advice/tm_headline=recession-proof-wise-buys-revealed&method=full&objectid=23171460&siteid=63127-name_page.html |title=icLiverpool – Recession-proof wise-buys revealed |publisher=Icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=5 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427101129/http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/motors/advice/tm_headline%3Drecession-proof-wise-buys-revealed%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D23171460%26siteid%3D63127-name_page.html |archivedate=27 April 2009 }}</ref>

Between 1960 and 1967, BMC exported approximately 10,000 left-hand drive BMC Minis to the United States. Sales were discontinued when stricter federal safety standards were imposed in 1968<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/04/cars-uncle-sam-says-you-cant-have/|title=Uncle Sam Says No, You Absolutely Can't Have These Cars|date=11 April 2011|journal=Wired}}</ref><ref>''The rise and fall of mini in America'' by Joy Keller, source mossmotoring.com [http://www.mossmotoring.com/rise-fall-rise-mini-america/], visited feb15 2016</ref><ref>''The Classic Mini – 1968 Austin Mini'', Hemmings Motor News, November, 2007 by Mike McNessor, source Hemmings.com magazine [http://www.hemmings.com/magazine/hmn/2007/11/The-Classic-Mini---1968-Austin-Mini/1539245.html]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/ |title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Regulations |website=Nhtsa.gov |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miniusa.com/content/miniusa/en/footer-navigation/faq.html |title=FAQ |website=Miniusa.com |accessdate=2017-03-03}}</ref> and the arrival of the larger and more profitable [[Austin America]]. Mini sales fell in the 1967 calendar year and the US importer was expecting the forthcoming Austin America to find a larger market. The America was also withdrawn in 1972 due to slow sales and the introduction of bumper-height standards. Mini sales continued in Canada until 1980. MkIII variants, as with their UK counterparts remained badged as a "Mini" (no distinction between Austin or Morris), and in 1976 with the takeover of British Leyland, became British Leyland Minis (MkIV). Leyland Minis also were subject to stricter government regulation with high bumpers, large turn indicators, warning buzzers and lights for seat belts and also a fitting of air pollution pumps which required a specially designed radiator.

Today the U.S. Government exempts cars older than 25 years [[Grey import vehicle#United States|from all import laws]], so older Minis can be freely imported. The [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] applies a similar rule after 15 years.

Issigonis designed the Mini with an emphasis on [[Automobile safety#Active and passive safety|active safety]]. Asked about the [[crashworthiness]] of the Mini, he said: "I make my cars with such good brakes, such good steering, that if people get into a crash it's their own fault"<ref name="faith">{{cite book |title=Crash: The limits of car safety |last=Faith |first=Nicholas |publisher=Boxtree |isbn=0-7522-1192-7 |year=1997}}</ref> and "I don't design my cars to have accidents".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Road Safety&nbsp;– Better Cars, Better Roads or Just Better Drivers? |first=Jack |last=McLean |url=http://www.atse.org.au/uploads/McLean%20J.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326083117/http://www.atse.org.au/uploads/McLean%20J.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}</ref>

In July 1965 [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] announced that following "comments by safety experts" about the Mini's external doorhandles, these would be modified on new cars so that the gap between the handle and the door panel would be effectively closed.<ref name="Autocar196506">{{cite journal |title=News and Views: Safety changes to Minis |journal=Autocar |page=230 |date=30 July 1965}}</ref>

Nicholas Faith states in his book that [[Murray Mackay]], one of the UK's leading motor vehicle crash and safety researchers, was critical of the pre-1967 Mini's [[Automobile safety#Passive safety|passive safety]] features, including the protruding filler cap, the door latch, and the vulnerability of the passenger space to engine intrusion.<ref name="faith"/>

The Mini was withdrawn from the American market because it could not meet the 1968 U.S. safety regulations and [[emission standard]]s,<ref>{{cite web|last=Strickland |first=Jonathan |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/mini-cooper.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How the MINI Cooper Works" |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=21 March 2007 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}</ref> and although often updated, not sufficiently to comply with U.S. regulations.<ref name="bbc_20020621"/> It continued to be sold in Canada until 1980.<ref name="faith"/><ref name="bbc_20020621">{{cite news |title=Mini mania big in US |first=Kevin |last=Anderson |date=21 June 2002 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2052620.stm |accessdate=24 February 2008}}</ref>

The Mini was modified during its production to improve its safety. In 1974 a prototype Mini experimental safety vehicle was built, the Mini Clubman SRV4. It featured a longer [[crumple zone]], a "pedestrian friendly" front-end, run-flat tyres, strengthened door sills, extra internal padding and recessed door handles, the latter having been used earlier on Australian-built Minis owing to local laws.<ref>{{cite web|title=Safety First: the SSV/SRV cars |publisher=AROnline |url=http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm |accessdate=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008203617/http://www.austin-rover.co.uk/index.htm?researchsrvf.htm |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}</ref> [[William Daniels (automotive engineer)|Jack Daniels]], one of the original Issigonis team,<ref>{{cite news |title=Leading MG engineer dies at home |date=30 November 2004 |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/oxfordshire/4055447.stm |accessdate=24 February 2008

A UK Department for Transport statistics publication, presenting estimates of the risk of driver injury in two-car injury collisions, based on reported road accident data, estimated that the 1990–2000 Mini was one of two small cars (the other being the [[Hyundai Atos|Hyundai Atoz]]), which, with an estimated 84% of drivers likely to be injured, presented the greatest risk of driver injury; the average risk for the small car category was 76%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cars: Make and Model: The Risk of Driver Injury in Great Britain: 2000–2004 |publisher=UK Department for Transport |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/carsmmrisk/carsmakeandmodeltheriskofdri1800 |accessdate=24 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116063017/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/carsmmrisk/carsmakeandmodeltheriskofdri1800 |archivedate=16 November 2007 }}</ref>

==50th anniversary==
Several key events marked the 50th anniversary of the Mini in 2009. On 13 January 2009, the [[Royal Mail]] released a limited edition of stamps entitled "British Design Classics", featuring an original, egg-shell blue, MK1 Mini, registration XAA 274.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/stamps/jump1?catId=90700753&mediaId=90500750 |title=Royal Mail&nbsp;– British Design Classics |publisher=Royalmail.com |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080513112858/http://royalmail.com/portal/stamps/jump1?catId=90700753&mediaId=90500750 |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}</ref> On 17 May, a world record parade of 1,450 Minis congregated at [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] as part of a London to Brighton run.<ref>{{cite web|title=Largest parade of Mini cars|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/2000/largest-parade-of-mini-cars|work=Guinness World Records|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> The following week, 10,000 Minis and 25,000 people attended an anniversary party at [[Silverstone Circuit]] on the border of [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Northamptonshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carscoop.blogspot.com/2009/05/photo-album-from-mini-50th-anniversary.html |title=Car Scoop&nbsp;– Photo Album from MINI's 50th Anniversary Festivities at Silverstone |publisher=Carscoop.blogspot.com |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>

Between 7 and 10 August 2009 approximately 4000 minis from around the world congregated at Longbridge Birmingham to celebrate the 50th anniversary.
