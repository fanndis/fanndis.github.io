'''Gestation''' is the period of [[prenatal development|development]] during the carrying of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] inside [[Viviparity|viviparous]] [[animals]].<ref name="Oxford">{{cite web |title=gestation {{!}} Definition of gestation in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gestation |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English}}</ref> It is typical for [[mammal]]s, but also occurs for some non-mammals. [[Pregnancy (mammals)|Mammals during pregnancy]] can have one or more gestations at the same time, for example in a [[multiple birth]].

The time interval of a gestation is called the ''[[gestation period]]''. In [[obstetrics and gynecology|human obstetrics]], ''[[gestational age]]'' refers to the [[Human fertilization#Fertilization age|fertilization age]] plus two weeks. This is approximately the duration since the woman's [[Menstruation#Onset and frequency)|last menstrual period (LMP)]] began.

==Mammals==
{{main|Pregnancy (mammals)}}

In mammals, pregnancy begins when a [[zygote]] (fertilized ovum) implants in the female's [[uterus]] and ends once the fetus leaves the uterus.

On the main article link above, are average and approximate gestation values ordered by number of days (note: human gestational age is counted from the last menstrual period; for other animals the counting method varies, so these figures could be 14 days off)

===Humans===
{{main|Pregnancy}}
Human pregnancy can be divided roughly into three trimesters, each approximately three months long. The first trimester is from the last period through the 13th week, the second trimester is 14th–27th week, and the third trimester is 28th–42nd week.<ref name="ACOG_BabyGrowth">[http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq156.pdf?dmc=1&ts=20130303T2230398164 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - How Your Baby Grows During Pregnancy]</ref> Birth normally occurs at a [[gestational age]] of about 40 weeks, though it is common for births to occur from 37 to 42 weeks.<ref name="ACOG_BabyGrowth"/> From the 9th week of pregnancy (11th week of [[gestational age]]), the embryo is called a fetus.

Various factors can come into play in determining the duration of gestation. For humans, male fetuses normally gestate several days longer than females and [[Multiple birth|multiple pregnancies]] gestate for a shorter period.<ref name=britannica>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232124/gestation |title=gestation |work=Britannica - The Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

==Non-mammals==
A viviparous [[animal]] is an animal employing [[viviparity]]: the embryo develops inside the body of the mother, as opposed to outside in an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] ([[oviparity]]). The mother then gives live birth. The less developed form of viviparity is called [[ovoviviparity]], which, for instance, occurs in most [[Viperidae|vipers]]. The more developed form of viviparity is called [[placenta|placental viviparity]]; mammals are the best example, but it has also evolved independently in other animals, such as in [[scorpion]]s, some [[shark]]s, and in [[velvet worm]]s. Viviparous offspring live independently and require an external food supply from birth. Certain lizards also employ this method such as the genera ''Tiliqua'' and ''Corucia.'' The placenta is attached directly to the mother in these lizards which is called viviparous matrotrophy.

Ovoviviparous [[animal]]s develop within [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s that remain within the mother's body up until they hatch or are about to hatch. This strategy of [[childbirth|birth]] is known as ovoviviparity. It is similar to vivipary in that the embryo develops within the mother's body. Unlike the embryos of viviparous species, ovoviviparous [[embryo]]s are nourished by the [[egg yolk]] rather than by the mother's body. However, the mother's body does provide [[gas exchange]]. The young of ovoviviparous [[amphibian]]s are sometimes born as [[larva]]e, and undergo [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] outside the body of the mother.

The fish family [[Syngnathidae]] has the unique characteristic whereby females lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in a brood pouch on the male's chest, and the male incubates the eggs. Fertilization may take place in the pouch or before implantation in the water. Included in Syngnathidae are [[seahorse]]s, the [[pipefish]], and the [[weedy sea dragon|weedy]] and [[leafy sea dragon]]s. Syngnathidae is the only family in the animal kingdom to which the term "[[male pregnancy]]" has been applied.<ref name="biology">{{cite journal | last = Jones | first = Adam G. |author2=Avise, John C. | title = Male Pregnancy | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 20 | pages = R791 | date = 2003-10-14 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2003.09.045 | pmid = 14561416}}</ref>
