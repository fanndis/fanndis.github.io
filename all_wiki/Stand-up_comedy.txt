| quote=A strict, limiting definition of standup comedy would describe an encounter between a single, standing performer behaving comically and/or saying funny things directly to an audience, unsupported by very much in the way of costume, prop, setting, or dramatic vehicle. Yet standup comedy's roots are...entwined with rites, rituals, and dramatic experiences that are richer, more complex than this simple definition can embrace. We must...include seated storytellers, comic characterizations that employ costume and prop, team acts[,]...manifestations of standup comedy routines...such as skits, improvisational situations, and films...and television sitcoms...however our definition should stress relative directness of artist/audience communication and the proportional importance of comic behavior and comic dialogue versus the development of plot and situation}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

As the name implies, "stand-up" comedians usually perform their material while standing, though this is not mandatory. Similar acts performed while seated can be referred to as "sit-down comedy".

|quote= In comedy venues, proceedings are managed and organised throughout the performance by a compere who acts as an anchor for the evening's events in the venue. Comperes are more than just an announcer who brings on the acts. They provide continuity between acts who often have divergent styles and or different performance skills; they perform routines between acts using their own material; they pass comment on the performers; they share details of the evening itinerary, they may run a joke competition for the audience, and they encourage the audience's participation. In short, the compere acts to frame a series of performances into a single event.}}</ref> this is followed by a "middle"/"feature" act that lasts 15–20 minutes but is expected to have "30 minutes of solid material"; the feature act is followed by the headliner, who performs for "an hour."<ref name=acts/><ref name=MSU>{{cite book

== Stand-up genres ==
Just as within any art form, stand-up has multiple genres and styles, with their own formats, unwritten rules, and target audience. Some of these include:

* [[Observational comedy]] that focuses on finding humour from aspects of common life.
* [[Character comedy]] where the comedian performs partly or throughout their set as one or more invented characters.
* [[Surreal humour]] often including long, meandering stories or unusual characters
* [[Comedy music]] where a comedian will mostly or significantly use a music instrument or their voice within their set.
* [[Insult comedy]] based on ridiculing the audience or a 'common enemy', deriving humour from those outside of the insult enjoying the joke.
* [[Political satire]] where the political figures, establishment or ideologies are subject of ridicule.
* [[Improvised comedy]] where the bulk of the comedian's material is invented on-stage, often based on information or events in the audience.

It's an energy flow from the comedian to the audience, where the audience returns that flow of energy in the form of laughter. The laughter, in turn, feeds the comic's next outpouring of energy.

The phrase refers metonymically to a whole category of sex jokes in which 'dirty' words are used to refer directly to 'dirty' body parts...as well as to acts and sexual functions...Among insiders, comics who tell dick jokes are considered hacks, and the laughs they raise cheap. The self-respecting road comic tries to come up with original material that not only audiences but also their peers—those with whom they work and those who book their work—will appreciate}}</ref>}}

The act would be returned with unacceptable sections underlined in blue pencil (possibly giving rise to the term "blue" for a comedian whose act is considered bawdy or smutty). The comedian was then obliged not to deviate from the act in its edited form.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The rise of the post-war comedians coincided with the rise of television and radio, and the traditional music hall circuit suffered greatly as a result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} By the 1970s, music hall entertainment was virtually dead. Alternative circuits had evolved, such as [[working men's club]]s.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Some of the more successful comedians on the working men's club circuit—including [[Bernard Manning]], [[Bobby Thompson (comedian)|Bobby Thompson]], [[Frank Carson]] and [[Stan Boardman]]—eventually made their way to television via such shows as ''[[The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club]]''. The "alternative" comedy scene also began to evolve. Some of the earliest successes came from [[folk club]]s, where performers such as [[Billy Connolly]], [[Mike Harding]] and [[Jasper Carrott]] started as relatively straight musical acts whose between-song banter developed into complete comedy routines. The 1960s had also seen the satire boom, including the creation of the club, [[The Establishment (club)|the Establishment]], which, amongst other things, gave British audiences their first taste of extreme American stand-up comedy from [[Lenny Bruce]].<ref>"So Farewell Then: The Untold Life of Peter Cook" Cook, Wendy E. {{ISBN|0-00-722893-7}}, p. 139-144</ref> [[Victoria Wood]] launched her stand-up career in the early 1980s, which included observational conversation mixed with comedy songs. Wood was to become one of the country's most successful comedians, in 2001 selling out the [[Royal Albert Hall]] for 15 nights in a row.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In 1979, the first American-style stand-up comedy club, the [[Comedy Store, London|Comedy Store]] was opened in London by [[Peter Rosengard]], where many alternative comedy stars of the 1980s, such as [[Dawn French]] and [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Alexei Sayle]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Rik Mayall]] and [[Ade Edmondson]] began their careers.<ref>Wilmut, R and Rosengard, P ''Didn't You Kill My Mother-In-Law: The Story Of Alternative Comedy In Britain.'' {{ISBN|978-0-413-17390-4}}</ref> The stand-up comedy circuit rapidly expanded from London across the UK. The present British stand-up comedy circuit arose from the 'alternative' comedy revolution of the 1980s, with political and observational humor being the prominent styles to flourish. In 1983, young drama teacher Maria Kempinska created [[Jongleurs]] Comedy Clubs before it closed in 2017. Stand-up comedy is believed to have been performed originally as a one-man show. Lately, this type of show started to involve a group of young comedians, especially in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

===Spain===
Although the antecedents of this genre can be traced back to the monologues of [[Miguel Gila]] in the 1950s, [[:es:Comedia en vivo#España|the rise of live comedy in Spain]] took a long time in comparison with the American continent. The first generalized relationship with this comic genre occurred in 1999 with the creation of the [[Comedy Central Spain|Paramount Comedy]] channel, which included the ''New Comics'' program as one of its flagship programs, where monologuists such as [[Ángel Martín]], José Juan Vaquero, [[David Broncano]], and [[Joaquín Reyes (actor)|Joaquín Reyes]] stood out.
Also, in 1999 began the journey of the program [[The club of comedy]], an open adaptation of the popular comic format. In its first stage (1999-2005), it underwent several chain changes and released comedians like [[Luis Piedrahita]], [[Alexis Valdes]] or [[:es:Goyo Jiménez|Goyo Jiménez]]. In its new stage, starting in 2011 in [[La Sexta]] and presented by [[Eva Hache]], it tries to start in the genre of comic monologue media characters from different artistic fields such as: [[Imanol Arias]], [[José Luis Gil]], [[Isabel Ordaz]] and [[Santiago Segura]].
Special mention deserves the [[:es:Buenafuente|Buenafuente]] program, started in 2005. The presenter, [[Andreu Buenafuente]], made an initial monologue of about 9 to 11 minutes where he links current issues with everyday humorous situations. This became the most famous part of the program and made him one of the most recognized comedians in Spain, for his connection with the public and his ability to improvise.
On the other hand, the comedian [[Ignatius Farray]] became one of the most representative icons of this genre today.

===United States===
Stand-up comedy in the United States got its start from '''[[monologist]]s''' performing [[Stump speech (minstrelsy)|stump-speech monologues]] from within the [[minstrel show]]s of the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web

 |quote=[Mark Twain] is a reference figure for...what we want to perceive to be the American character. As a public speaker and lecturer, indeed, the mature Mark Twain was very possibly our last performing humorist who presented himself as a 'general' personage—neither an easterner nor exactly a westerner, the embodiment...of national regionalism, all parts equal, none predominating. This 'generic' persona, so different from Will Roger's lariat-twirling actor, is equally remote from the ethnic ''shtick'' of Woody Allen and Richard Pryor or the urban neurosis of Joan Rivers and David Brenner. He has no direct, obvious successors, only his impersonators; the humor of our contemporary nightclubs is fragmented and typecast. The foe of humbug, explicitly rebelling against outworn Romantic forms and themes, he detested high airs and smug complacency—putting him in the progression that has led to the stand-up insults of W.C. Fields as well as Lenny Bruce...Among other feats, he contrived his public persona so as to convey the impression of (feigned) laziness, lack of [[erudition]], easy success...Mark Twain endures because he is greater than any of his possible classifications—crackerbarrel philosopher, literary comedian...vernacular humorist, after-dinner speaker}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

| quote= Pure joke telling, a form closer to modern stand-up, was not unknown in vaudeville, but it was not common until the last decade of the form, when vaudeville moved closer to stand-up by placing increasing emphasis on the character of the emcee. The emcee's patter had to be brisk as to not slow down the desired quick flow of the vaudeville bill, and the short jokes he would use seem to have set the standard for post-vaudeville stand-up comics.}}</ref> Comedians of this era often depended on fast-paced joke delivery, slapstick, outrageous or lewd innuendo, and donned an ethnic persona—African, Scottish, German, Jewish—and built a routine based on popular stereotypes.<ref>{{cite journal

Rather, we see many instances of performers appropriating material from other performers. Vaudeville performers often reprised short acts from well-known plays, sang parts of operas or danced in the styles of the moment. Originality was not a priority.}}</ref> Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment as a way to escape and confront city living.

 |quote=The new wave of satiric comedians hailed from college campuses and cellar nightclubs, such as San Francisco's 'the hungry i' (named for its 'hungry intellectual' clientele). These comics attracted younger, more affluent, more educated, more self-consciously 'hip' audiences than those for whom comedians trained in vaudeville performed. Critic Ralph J. Gleason commented that the new comedy 'bears a strong resemblance to jazz. It is rooted in the same dissent, nurtured in the same rebellion and articulated in the same language in which the priorities of the Establishment have no standing at all.' When the new comedians reached the mainstream through comedy albums and appearances on television variety shows, they often had to moderate their iconoclastic material to suit national tastes. In adapting, they relied on comic talent that transcended politics, and in so doing, became part of the mass culture they once had satirized.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

The one-man-show genre, which is similar, but allows other approaches (enacting characters, songs and scenes) was introduced in Brazil by José Vasconcellos in the 60's. Taking a step closer to the North American format, Chico Anysio and Jô Soares maintained the format - specially in their live nation-wide talks shows, and generally, in the opening monologues - bringing to Brazil a genre more similar to what we currently know as Stand-up.

Stand-up began to be interesting news in 2005 in ''São Paulo'', when the first club was created, called ''Clube de Comédia Stand-Up:'' composed of Marcelo Mansfield, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Marcela Leal and Márcio Ribeiro. In São Paulo the comedy club would present in Beverly Hills, the traditional comedy venue in Moema. Shortly afterwards it migrated to Mr. Blues and Bleeker Street, in ''Vila Madalena''. In ''Rio de Janeiro'', ''Comédia em Pé, (''Comedy Standing Up): composed of Cláudio Torres Gonzaga, Fábio Porchát, Fernando Caruso and Paulo Carvalho, had its debue at the venue ''Rio Design Leblon''. These were the first stand-up performances in the country.

In 2006, the comic Jô Soares watched ''Clube de Comédia'' in São Paulo and invited the comic Diogo Portugal for an interview in his talk show. That was a definitive moment to call attention towards the genre. He mentioned many different shows that he was a part of and attracted the public attention and media coverage to the bars that held these presentations. In Curitiba, with this momentum, many other stand-up nights began opening up. In São Paulo, Danilo Gentili, that had just become a part of ''Clube da Comédia,'' invited Mário Ribeiro and gathered other young comics that were frequent spectators at the club, to create ''Comédia Ao Vivo'' (Live Comedy): composed of Dani Calabresa, Luiz França, Fábio Rabin.

With the show CQC - ''Custe o Que Custar'', on the channel Band, a nation-wide TV outlet, in 2008, the genre took gained its permanent spot on the national stage. With bug names like Danilo Gentili, Rafinha Bastos and Oscar Filho, the curiosity grew exponentially.

Following CQC's example many channels and TV shows on Brazil's national television invested in Stand-up comedy. After this many other groups gained recognition in the clubs and live performances around the two biggest cities of Brazil.

===India===
Modern stand-up comedy in India is a young art form, however [[Chakyar koothu]] was prominent in [[Trivandrum]] and southern [[Kerala]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. It had all the attributes of modern stand-up comedy and is widely considered to be the oldest known staged comedy act anywhere in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Even though the history of live comedy performances in India traces its early roots back to 1980s, for a long time stand-up comedians were only given supporting/filler acts in various performances (dance or music).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In 1986, India's [[Johnny Lever]] performed in a charity show called "Hope 86", in front of the whole Hindi film industry as a filler and was loved by audience. His talent was recognized, and he would later be described as "the iconic comedian of his generation".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/videos/johnny-lever-on-phalke-awards/3660|title=Johnny Lever on Phalke Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-johny-lever-the-missing-comic-in-hindi-films-1596571|title=Johny Lever: The missing comic in Hindi films|first=Rito|last=Paul|date=October 9, 2011|website=DNA India}}</ref>

It was not until 2005, when the TV show ''[[The Great Indian Laughter Challenge]]'' garnered huge popularity and stand-up comedy in itself started getting recognised. Thus, a lot more comedians became popular and started performing various live and TV shows. The demand for comedy content continues to increase. Some popular comedians around 2005-2008 include [[Raju Srivastav]], [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] and [[Sunil Pal]]. Most of them performed their acts in Hindi.

Around 2008-2009, two other popular comedians [[Papa CJ]] and Vir Das returned to India and started making their marks on Indian comedy scene. Both of them were exposed to UK and US comedy routines and they performed mostly in English. At the same time, a few more youngsters got inspired and started taking plunge into stand-up comedy.

Since 2011, the stand-up comedy has been getting substantial appreciation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Comedy Store from London opened an outlet in Mumbai's Palladium Mall where people would regularly enjoy comedians from UK. The Comedy Story also supported local comedians and helped them grow. This outlet eventually become Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai.

Around 2011, people started organizing different comedy open mic events in Mumbai, Delhi (and Gurgaon), Bangalore. All of this happened in association with growth of a counterculture in Indian cities which catered to the appetite of younger generations for live events for comedy, poetry, storytelling, and music. Various stand-up events were covered by popular news channels such NDTV / Aajtak etc. and were appreciated by millions of viewers.

As a result of these developments, plus the increasing penetration of [[YouTube]] (along with [[Internet]]/[[World Wide Web]]), Indian stand-up comedy started reaching further masses. While the established comedians such as Vir Das, Papa CJ were independently growing through various corporate / international performances, other comedians such as [[Vipul Goyal]], [[Biswa Kalyan Rath]], [[Kenny Sebastian]], [[Kanan Gill]], [[Kunal Kamra]] grew popular through YouTube videos.

The industry, still in its early stages, now sees a lot more influx of aspiring comedians as it transforms the ecosystem around it.

| quote      = 'Def Comedy Jam' is an extraction of the hip-hop scene: its setting, music, performers, and audience are all part of the contemporary rap arena. The stage is set very close to the audience so that comics are neither at a distance from nor at an exaggerated level above them. This setting engenders a sense of community and familiarity. Indeed, instead of the usual monologue that comedians normally present in stand-up comic situations, this setting allows for the comics to carry on a dialogue with the audience. Comedians often ask questions of the audience, and the answers are heard by nearly everyone. This dialogue is a form of the African American oral tradition of call and response, which is quite different from the hecklers mainstream comedians may encounter. Although hecklers are generally an undesirable, but often expected, aspect of stand-up comic routines, the call and response of 'Def Comedy Jam' is an essential element of African American dialogic performances. Similarly, the audience's response to the performance illustrates the connection between them and the performer. The 'Def Comedy Jam' audience is made up largely of young African Americans; the laughter is animated and boisterous. Many male audience members jump out of their seats, stand up, shout, and 'high five' one another—or even the comic— when they find an anecdote, joke, or situation particularly amusing.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

The Victory and Blue Circuit troupes entertained stateside military personnel, while the Hospital Circuit troupes were tasked with visiting the wounded and the Foxhole Circuit troupes headed overseas...As stated in the 1944 guide given to all USO Foxhole Circuit performers, 'You're in the Army now.'...By V-E Day, the USO was putting on 700 shows per day all around the world and, by the end of the war, had sent over 7,300 entertainers overseas to perform for the troops. Together, they put on an estimated 420,000 performances for over 130 million service member attendees...Although big-name stars like Edward G.

==Other media==
Many of the earliest vaudeville-era stand-ups gained their greater recognition on radio. They often opened their programs with topical monologues, characterized by [[ad-lib]]s and discussions about anything from the latest films to a missed birthday. Each program tended to be divided into the opening monologue, musical number, followed by a [[sketch comedy|skit]] or story routine. A "feud" between [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]] was used as comic material for nearly a decade.

[[Home Box Office|HBO]] presented comedians uncensored for the first time, beginning with [[Robert Klein]] in 1975, and was instrumental in reaching larger audiences. George Carlin was a perennial favorite, who appeared in 14 HBO comedy specials.

Continuing that tradition, most modern stand-up comedians use television or motion pictures to reach a level of success and recognition unattainable in the comedy-club circuit alone.

Late-night talk shows and award show ceremonies are commonly hosted by comedians, delivering monologues similar to stand-up.

Since the mid-2000s, online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have also provided a venue for stand-up comedians, and many comedians' performances can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybits.com/watch-stand-up-comedians-on-youtube/|title=Watch Stand Up Comedians on YouTube|accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Daniel Scocco |publisher=Dailybits.com |date=2008-09-23}}</ref>

An Amazon TV show, ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', depicts the fictional life of a woman comedian, set in the late 1950s. She often interacts with [[Lenny Bruce]].
