''Dagbladet Information'' is the youngest major newspaper in Denmark<ref name=bbc5/> and remains independent of the larger publishing houses. The paper is owned by A/S Information<ref name=bbc5/> and is published by A/S Dagbladet Information from Monday to Saturday.<ref name=eurot/> It is based in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=bbc5/><ref name=eurot/>

In the 1970s ''Dagbladet Information'' was one of the [[alternative media]] together with ''[[Politisk Revy]]'' in Denmark and covered all dimensions of new [[social movements]].<ref name=jam/>

The newspaper, which despite being politically independent, is regarded as [[left liberal]]<ref name=eurot/> and [[left-wing|leftist]]<ref>{{cite web|author1=Henrik Søndergaard|author2=Rasmus Helles|title=Media policies and regulatory practices in a selected set of European countries, the EU and the Council of Europe: The case of Denmark|url=http://www.mediadem.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Denmark.pdf|work=MEDIADEM|accessdate=12 December 2014|format=Background information report|date=October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213030216/http://www.mediadem.eliamep.gr/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Denmark.pdf|archive-date=13 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> by some, but known as being equally critical in its point of view of all political organizations. It prints letters from prominent conservative figures and it usually puts great focus in enlightening both sides of a case. The tone is very serious and the amount of charts and pictures is very limited and comparable to the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''. ''Information'' has a syndication agreement with the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian (newspaper)|the Guardian]]'', and often collaborates with ''[[The Independent]]'' for articles and reports.

''Dagbladet Information'' was published in [[Broadsheet (newspaper)|broadsheet format]] until 30 November 2004 when it began to be published in [[Compact (newspaper)|compact format]].<ref name=bbc5/> The paper covers in-depth [[Analytic journalism|analytical]] articles.<ref name=bbc5/>

On 8 September 2006, the newspaper printed six of the less offensive entries from the [[Iran Holocaust Cartoons Contest|Iranian Holocaust cartoon exhibition]], which was a response to the ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' [[Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. The editor chose the cartoons after consulting the main rabbi in Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5327852.stm|title=Paper reprints Holocaust cartoons|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 September 2006|accessdate=8 September 2006}}</ref>
