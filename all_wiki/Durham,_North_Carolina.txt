'''Durham''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈdʌrəm/]]) is a [[city]] in and the [[county seat]] of [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]]<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> in the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Small portions of the city limits extend into [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] and [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]].
The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] estimated the city's population to be 278,993 as of July 1, 2019, making it the [[List of municipalities in North Carolina|4th-most populous city in North Carolina]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|79th-most populous city]] in the United States.<ref name="USCensusEst2019"/> The city is located in the east-central part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region along the [[Eno River]].

A railway depot was established on land donated by [[Bartlett S. Durham]] in 1849, the namesake of the city. Following the [[American Civil War]], the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the [[tobacco industry]]. The town was incorporated by act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], in April 1869. The establishment of [[Durham County, NC|Durham County]] was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881. It became known as the founding place and headquarters of the [[American Tobacco Company]]. [[Textile industry|Textile]] and [[Electric power industry|electric power]] industries also played an important role. While these industries have declined, Durham underwent revitalization and population growth<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indyweek.com/api/content/c9b21274-b05e-59ea-8373-b4de7a9723c2/|title=To Keep Up With Growth, Durham Needs to Add Two Thousand Housing Units a Year.

Durham is home to several recognized institutions of higher education, most notably [[Duke University]] and [[North Carolina Central University]]. Durham is also a national leader in health-related activities, which are focused on the [[Duke University Hospital]] and many private companies. Duke and its [[Duke University Health System]], in fact, are the largest employers in the city. North Carolina Central University is a [[historically black university]] that is part of the [[University of North Carolina]] system. Together, the two universities make Durham one of the vertices of the [[Research Triangle]] area; central to this is the [[Research Triangle Park]]<ref name="RTP">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtp.org/main/index.php?pid=184&sec=1|title=Where is RTP?|publisher=Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina|others=[[The Herald Sun]] reports that it is the 4th smartest city in the USA.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104012521/http://www.rtp.org/main/index.php?pid=184&sec=1|archive-date=November 4, 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=October 9, 2007}}</ref> south of Durham, which encompasses an area of 11 square miles and is devoted to research facilities.

On the Duke University campus are the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] [[Duke Chapel]] and the [[Nasher Museum of Art]]. Other notable sites in the city include the [[Museum of Life and Science]], [[Durham Performing Arts Center]], [[Carolina Theatre (Durham)|Carolina Theatre]], and [[Duke Homestead and Tobacco Factory]]. [[Bennett Place]] commemorates the location where [[Joseph E. Johnston]] surrendered to [[William T. Sherman]] in the American Civil War. The city is served, along with [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], by [[Raleigh–Durham International Airport]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Durham, North Carolina}}

===Pre-establishment===
The [[Eno people|Eno]] and the Occoneechi, related to the [[Sioux]] and the [[Shakori Tribe|Shakori]], lived and farmed in the area which became Durham. They may have established a village named Adshusheer on the site. [[Trading Path|The Great Indian Trading Path]] has been traced through Durham, and Native Americans helped to mold the area by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.

In 1701, Durham's beauty was chronicled by the English explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]], who called the area "the flower of the Carolinas." During the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to George Carteret by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] (for whom the Carolinas are named). Early settlers built gristmills, such as [[West Point Mill|West Point]], and worked the land.

Prior to the American Revolution, frontiersmen in what is now Durham were involved in the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator movement]]. According to legend, Loyalist militia cut Cornwallis Road through this area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. Later, William Johnston, a local shopkeeper and farmer, made Revolutionaries' munitions, served in the Provincial Capital Congress in 1775, and helped underwrite [[Daniel Boone]]'s westward explorations.

Large plantations, Hardscrabble, Cameron, [[Lipscomb House|Lipscomb]], and Leigh among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, [[Stagville|Stagville Plantation]] lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free [[African-American]]s in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.

===Antebellum and Civil War===
Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east–west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new [[North Carolina Railroad]] needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot.<ref>{{cite web|title=Durham|url=https://durhamnc.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/4097|website=durhamnc.gov|publisher=Durham City Government|access-date=24 January 2017}}</ref> In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by [[Bartlett S. Durham|Dr. Bartlett S. Durham]]; the station was named after him in recognition of his gift.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Welcome to The City of Durham {{!}} Durham, NC|url=https://durhamnc.gov/1457/Welcome-to-The-City-of-Durham|access-date=2020-07-30|website=durhamnc.gov}}</ref> A [[U.S. Post Office|U.S. post office]] was established there on April 26, 1853, now recognized as the city's official birthday.<ref name=":0" />

Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General [[William T. Sherman]] occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], was headquartered in [[Greensboro]] {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Appomattox, Virginia]] on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at [[Bennett Place]], the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Durham Station.

As both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's [[Virginia tobacco|Brightleaf Tobacco]], which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/tobacco-part-3-rise-big-tobacco|title=Tobacco- Part 3: The Rise of "Big Tobacco" {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}</ref>

===Notable bridge===
Starting in 2016, the [[Norfolk Southern–Gregson Street Overpass]], a railroad bridge, has been the subject of news coverage, because truck crashes have been recorded by a video camera and published on the web.<ref name="indy">{{cite news |title = A Little off the Top: Durham's 'Canopener Bridge' Makes the Front Page of the ''Wall Street Journal'' |date = January 6, 2016 |work = [[Indy Week]] |first = Danny |last = Hooley |access-date = January 8, 2016 |url = http://www.indyweek.com/news/archives/2016/01/06/a-little-off-the-top-durhams-canopener-bridge-makes-the-front-page-of-the-wall-street-journal }}</ref>

===Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco===

[[File:WhiteDoorColoredDoor.jpg|thumb|Separate "white" and "colored" entrances to a cafe in Durham, North Carolina, 1940]]

The community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving [[tobacco]] industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the "[[Bull Durham Tobacco Factory]]".<ref name=":0"/> The name "Bull Durham" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British [[Colman's]] Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Overview of Durham History - Museum of Durham History|url=https://www.museumofdurhamhistory.org/learn/overview-of-durham-history/|access-date=2020-07-30|language=en-US}}</ref> Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of [[Colman's]] of [[Norwich]], England.

===Incorporation===
As Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]. In 1911, parts of [[Cedar Fork Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Cedar Fork Township]] of [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] was transferred to Durham County and became [[Carr Township, Durham County, North Carolina|Carr Township]].<ref name="1923hill_dir_durham" />

===Early growth (1900–1970)===
[[File:Atcfls.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the newly renovated [[American Tobacco|American Tobacco Campus]]]]
[[File:Durham Main Street.JPG|thumb|Looking west along Parrish Street, home of what was then known as Black Wall Street]]
The rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and [[Washington Duke]]'s W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as [[American Tobacco]], a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.

Prevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. [[Duke Power]] (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910–1920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local "powerhouses". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now the [[Durham Area Transit Authority]]) until 1991.

The success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.
[[File:Durham Tobacco IAds.JPG|thumb|Early advertisements of Tobacco products made in Durham]]

Much of the early city [[architecture]], both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890–1930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.<ref>{{cite web|title=This day in 1914|url=https://www.facebook.com/museumofdurhamhistory/photos/a.286366331389809.90199.144344455591998/835801223112981/?type=1&theater|work=Web page|publisher=Museum of Durham History|access-date=March 23, 2014}}</ref>

Durham quickly developed a vibrant Black community, the center of which was an area known as ''[[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina|Hayti]]'', (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses — the best known of which are [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company]] and [[Mechanics and Farmers Bank (Durham, North Carolina)|Mechanics & Farmers Bank]] — were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as "Black Wall Street." In 1910, [[James E. Shepard|Dr. James E. Shepard]] founded [[North Carolina Central University]], the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.

In 1924, [[James Buchanan Duke]] established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father [[Washington Duke]] to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to [[Duke University]] and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the [[Duke University East Campus|Duke East Campus]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/duke-university/|title=Duke University|last=Williams|first=Shane|publisher=North Carolina History Project|access-date=March 3, 2020}}</ref>

Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. [[Textile]] mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.

In a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first "science park" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the [[Research Triangle Park]] an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Civil Rights Movement===
[[File:Carolina Theatre at night.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carolina Theatre (Durham)|Carolina Theatre]] was the first theater in Durham to admit [[African-American]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carolinatheatre.org/about-us/history |title=History |publisher=Carolina Theatre |access-date=July 15, 2012}}</ref>]]

As a result of its substantial African-American community, including many courageous activists, a prominent [[civil rights movement]] developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and [[James E. Shepard]], has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for Black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, [[Douglas E. Moore]], minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.

Widely credited as the [[Royal Ice Cream sit-in|first sit-in of the Civil Rights Movement in North Carolina]], on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Royal Ice Cream|Royal Ice Cream Parlor]] and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the [[Greensboro Four]], three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greensboro3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=1&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=1495&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=2762&hn=greensboro3&he=.com |title=NC Finally Recognizes Pre-Woolworth Sit-Ins In 1956 |publisher=Greensboro3.com |date=January 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202064022/http://greensboro3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=1&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=1495&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=2762&hn=greensboro3&he=.com |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="sciblog_Royal">{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/11/dedication_of_1957_royal_ice_c.php |title=Dedication of the 1957 Royal Ice Cream sit-in historical marker |date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=Terra Sigillata |access-date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816045824/http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/11/dedication_of_1957_royal_ice_c.php |archive-date=August 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="hwymkrg123">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=G-123%20-%20ROYAL%20ICE%20CREAM%20SIT-IN |title=G-123 Royal Ice Cream Sit-In |publisher=North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program |access-date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818183910/http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=G-123%20-%20ROYAL%20ICE%20CREAM%20SIT-IN |archive-date=August 18, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

The six-month-long sit-in at a [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s counter in [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro, NC]], captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry "Fill up the jails," during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, "Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South."

This community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ehrsam|first1=Frederick|title=The downfall of Durham's historic Hayti: Propagated or preempted by urban renewal?|url=https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/10/Ehrsam-Fred_DJE.pdf}}</ref> The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hills, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.

==Sports==
[[File:Coachkfls.jpg|thumb|A Duke basketball game at [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]]]]
Collegiate athletics are a primary focus in Durham. Duke University's men's basketball team draws a large following, selling out every home game at [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Favat|first=Brian|date=May 18, 2009|title=Headlines: Men's Basketball Attendance Ranked 99th Nationally|url=http://www.bcinterruption.com/2009/05/headlines-mens-basketball-attendance.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522032228/http://www.bcinterruption.com/2009/05/headlines-mens-basketball-attendance.html|archive-date=May 22, 2009|access-date=July 15, 2012|publisher=BC Interruption}}</ref> The fans are known as the [[Cameron Crazies]] and are known nationwide for their chants and rowdiness.

Durham's professional sports team is the [[Durham Bulls]] [[International League]] [[baseball]] team. A movie involving an earlier [[Carolina League]] team of that name, ''[[Bull Durham]]'', was produced in 1988. Today's Bulls play in the [[Durham Bulls Athletic Park]], on the southern end of downtown, constructed in 1994. One of the more successful teams in the minor leagues, the Bulls usually generate an annual attendance of around 500,000. Previously the [[Durham Athletic Park]], located on the northern end of downtown, had served as the Bull's homebase. Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. The DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women's fast pitch [[softball]] team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998 to 2000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.

==Politics==
[[File:2008-07-05 Durham County Courthouse.jpg|thumb|Old Durham County Courthouse]]
The area is predominantly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], and has voted for the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in every election since the city's founding in 1869. Durham County is the most liberal county in North Carolina, measured by the percentage of voters aligning with the Democratic party in the last several presidential elections [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina#By county]]. The shifting alliances of the area's [[political action committee]]s since the 1980s has led to a very active local political scene. Notable groups include the [https://www.dcabp.org Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People], [[The People's Alliance (Durham, NC)|the Durham People's Alliance]], and the [https://www.friendsofdurham.com/ Friends of Durham]. The first two groups tend to be affiliated with Democratic party progressive activists, while the third group tends to attract Republican activists. Compared to other similarly sized Southern cities, Durham has a larger than average population of middle class African-Americans and white [[Liberalism|liberals]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Working together in coalition, these two groups have dominated city and county politics since the early 1980s.

Durham operates under a [[council-manager government]]. The mayor, since 2017, is [[Steve Schewel]], who was elected with 59.45% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://er.ncsbe.gov/?election_dt=11/07/2017&county_id=32&office=ALL&contest=0 |title = 11/07/2017 OFFICIAL MUNICIPAL ELECTION RESULTS - DURHAM |publisher=North Carolina State Board of Elections & Ethics Enforcement |access-date=March 16, 2018 }}</ref> The seven-member City Council is the primary budgetary and lawmaking authority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamnc.gov/council/ |title=Durham, NC - City of Medicine |publisher=Durhamnc.gov |access-date=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024115053/http://www.durhamnc.gov/council/ |archive-date=October 24, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Key political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, issues related to growth and development. Naturally, a merger of Durham City Schools (several [[inner city]] neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s has not been without controversy. More recently, the Durham City Council's 2018 statement opposing militarized policing that mentioned Israel has drawn its third lawsuit [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article228418349.html]. In 2018, Durham appointed its first Latinx council member [https://durhamnc.gov/3286/Javiera-Caballero Javiera Caballero]. Durham has had majority female county boards since the 1980s, and in 2020, Durham elected, for the first time, an all female Durham County Board of Commissioners and the first Muslim-American woman to win elected office in the history of North Carolina [https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article240880111.html].

Federally, Durham is split between [[North Carolina's 1st congressional district]] and [[North Carolina's 4th congressional district]]. The 1st district is represented by Democrat [[G.K. Butterfield]], elected in 2004. The 4th district is represented by Democrat [[David Price (American politician)|David Price]], elected in 1996.

The allegations were made by [[Crystal Gail Mangum]] a young, female African-American student and mother of two young children. She and another young woman had been hired to dance at a party that the team held in an off-campus house. In 2007, all charges in the case were dropped and the players were declared innocent. Durham County District Attorney [[Mike Nifong]] was dismissed from his job and disbarred from legal practice for his criminal misconduct handling of the case including withholding of [[exculpatory evidence]]. There have been several other [[Responses to the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case|results]] from the case, including lawsuits against both city and Duke University officials.

The new [[Durham County Justice Center]] was completed in early 2013.

National bus service is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. [[GoDurham]] provides municipal bus service.

[[File:Datafls.jpg|thumb|Durham Station Transportation Center]]
[[GoTriangle]] offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]] and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], as well as to and from the [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]], [[Research Triangle Park]] and several of the region's larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive [[vanpool]] and [[carpool|rideshare]] program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.

From 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a {{convert|28|mi|km|adj=on}} rail corridor from northeast [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], through downtown Raleigh, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], and [[Research Triangle Park]], to Durham using [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor {{convert|7|mi|km}} to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area have struggled with determining the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=May 21, 2008 |access-date=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>
