The New Zealand Labour Party formed in 1916 out of various [[Socialism in New Zealand|socialist parties]] and [[trade union]]s. It is the country's oldest political party still in existence.<ref name="founded"/> Alongside its main rival, the [[New Zealand National Party]], Labour has dominated [[List of New Zealand governments|New Zealand governments]] since the 1930s.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp= 32–33}} {{As of|2020}}, there have been six periods of Labour government under ten Labour [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|prime ministers]].

The party first came to power under prime ministers [[Michael Joseph Savage]] and [[Peter Fraser]] from [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|1935 to 1949]], when it established [[welfare in New Zealand|New Zealand's welfare state]]. It governed [[Second Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1957 to 1960]], and again [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1972 to 1975]] (a single [[term of office|term]] each time). In 1974, the prime minister [[Norman Kirk]] died in office, which contributed to a decline in party support. Up to the 1980s, the party advocated a strong role for governments in economic and social matters. When it governed from [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|1984 to 1990]], Labour instead [[privatised]] [[State ownership|state assets]] and reduced the role of the state in the economy; Labour prime minister [[David Lange]] also introduced [[New Zealand's nuclear-free policy]]. Labour again became the largest party [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|from 1999 to 2008]], when it governed in coalition with, or based on negotiated support from, several minor parties; [[Helen Clark]] became the first Labour prime minister to lead her government through the third term in office.<!-- Savage, Fraser, and Lange won two terms each. -->

Following the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 general election]], Labour comprised the second-largest [[caucus]] represented in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]] the party, under [[Jacinda Ardern]], returned to prominence with its best showing since the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]], winning 36.9% of the [[party vote]] and 46 seats.<ref name="2017 general election results">{{cite web|title=2017 General Election – Official Result|url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2017/|publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|New Zealand Electoral Commission]]|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> On 19 October 2017, Labour formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|minority coalition government]] with [[New Zealand First]], with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]]. In the [[2020 New Zealand general election|2020 general election]], Labour won in a [[Landslide victory|landslide]], winning an overall majority of 10 and 50.01% of the vote. Jacinda Ardern currently serves as the [[Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|party leader]] and prime minister, while [[Kelvin Davis (politician)|Kelvin Davis]] is the [[Deputy Leader of the New Zealand Labour Party|deputy leader]].

== History ==
{{see also|Socialism in New Zealand}}
The New Zealand Labour Party was established on 7 July 1916 in [[Wellington]],<ref name="founded">{{cite web|title=New Zealand Labour Party founded|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/the-new-zealand-labour-party-is-formed|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=4 February 2017|date=23 December 2016}}</ref> bringing together socialist groups advocating [[proportional representation]]; the abolition of the [[country quota]]; the [[recall election|recall]] of [[members of Parliament]]; as well as the [[nationalisation]] of [[Production (economics)|production]] and of [[trade|exchange]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=ix}} Despite its Wellington origins, the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] town of [[Blackball, New Zealand|Blackball]] is often regarded as the birthplace of the party,<ref>{{cite web|title=Returning to Labour's Roots|url=http://www.labour.org.nz/returning_to_labours_roots|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=en|date=18 April 2016}}</ref> as it was the location of the founding of one of the main political organisations which became part of the nascent Labour Party. The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice Labour Party politicians regard themselves as part of a broader [[labour movement]] and tradition.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Labour Party: The labour movement in New Zealand|url=http://www.labour.org.nz/history|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref>

=== Formation (1901–1916) ===
{{formation of New Zealand Labour Party}}
The New Zealand Labour Party was an amalgamation of a number of early groups, the oldest of which was founded in 1901. The process of unifying these diverse groups into a single party was difficult, with tensions between different factions running strong.{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=13}}

At the turn of the century, the radical side of New Zealand [[working class]] politics was represented by the [[New Zealand Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], founded in 1901. The more moderate leftists were generally supporters of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=13f}} In 1905, a group of working-class politicians who were dissatisfied with the Liberal approach established the [[Independent Political Labour League]],{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=17f}} which managed to win a seat in Parliament in the {{NZ election link|1908}}.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=216}}{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|p=19}} This established the basic dividing line in New Zealand's left-wing politics – the Socialists tended to be revolutionary and militant, while the moderates focused instead on progressive reform.<ref name="McLintock1966"/>

In 1910, the Independent Political Labour League was relaunched as an organisation called the [[New Zealand Labour Party (1910)|Labour Party]], distinct from the modern party. Soon, however, the leaders of the new organisation decided the additional effort was needed to promote left-wing cooperation, and organised a "[[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1912 conference|Unity Conference]]". The Socialists refused to attend, but several independent labour activists agreed. The [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] was born.<ref name="McLintock1966">{{cite book |chapter-url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/political-parties/page-8 |title=An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand |chapter=Labour Party |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage|Ministry for Culture and Heritage / Te Manatū Taonga]] |editor-first=A.

Soon afterward, the labour movement was hit by the [[Waihi miners' strike]], a major industrial disturbance prompted by radicals in the union movement.<ref name="Black Tuesday">{{cite web|title='Black Tuesday' – The 1912 Waihi strike|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/black-tuesday/the-1912-waihi-strike|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> The movement was split between supporting and opposing the radicals, and in the end, the conservative government of [[William Massey]] suppressed the strike by force. In the strike's aftermath, there was a major drive to end the divisions in the movement and establish a united front. Therefore, another [[Labour Unity Conferences#The 1913 conference|Unity Conference]] was called, and this time the Socialists attended.<ref name="Black Tuesday"/> The resulting group was named the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]].

Not all members of the United Labour Party accepted the new organisation, however, and some continued under their own banner. Gradually, however, the differences between the Social Democrats and the ULP Remnant broke down, and in 1915 they formed a unified caucus both to oppose Reform better and to differentiate themselves from the Liberals.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=SUNCH19150706.2.96 |work=Sun |page=11 |title=A Separate Identity |date= 6 July 1915 |accessdate= 30 March 2016 |volume=II |issue=438}}</ref> A year later yet another gathering was held. This time, all major factions of the labour movement agreed to unite, establishing the modern Labour Party.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=70–1}}

=== Early years (1916–1935) ===
Almost immediately, the new Labour Party became involved in the acrimonious debate about [[conscription]], which arose during [[World War I]] – the Labour Party strongly opposed conscription,{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} several leading members were jailed and expelled from Parliament for their stand against the war: [[Peter Fraser]],  [[Harry Holland]], [[Bob Semple]] and [[Paddy Webb]].<ref name="Derby">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Derby|first1=Mark|title=Conscription, conscientious objection and pacifism – Conscription|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/conscription-conscientious-objection-and-pacifism/page-1|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The loss of leadership threatened to seriously destabilise the party, but the party survived.<ref name="Derby"/> Fraser, Semple and Webb later supported conscription in [[World War II]].<ref name="Derby"/>

In its first real electoral test as a united party, the {{NZ election link|1919}}, Labour won eight seats – the party's quick success shocked many conservatives.{{sfn|Lipson|2011|p=211}} This compared with 47 for the governing [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] and 21 for the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Gustafson|1980|pp=18}}

Although Labour had split with its more militant faction (who went on to form various socialist parties), it maintained what were at the time radical socialist policies. Labour's 'Usehold' policy on land was, in essence, the replacement of freehold tenure by a system of perpetual lease from the state, with all land transfer conducted through the state (the full nationalisation of farmland). This policy was unpopular with voters and was dropped by Labour, along with other more radical policies, throughout the 1920s.<ref name="McLintock1966" />

[[File:New Zealand Parliamentary Labour Party, 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Members of the Labour parliamentary [[caucus]], 1922. Prominent members are [[Harry Holland]] (seated, left of centre), [[Peter Fraser]] (seated, right of centre) and [[Michael Joseph Savage]] (back row, rightmost).]]
In the {{NZ election link|1922}}, Labour more than doubled its number of seats, winning seventeen. In the {{NZ election link|1925}}, it declined somewhat but had the consolation of soon overtaking the Liberals as the second-largest party. Labour leader Harry Holland became the official [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] on 16 June 1926, after the [[1926 Eden by-election|Eden by-election]] on 15 April elected [[Rex Mason]] (Labour) to replace [[James Parr (politician)|James Parr]] (Reform) who had resigned. After the {{NZ election link|1928}}, however, the party was left in an advantageous position – the Reform Party and the new [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] (a revival of the Liberals) were tied on 27 seats each, and neither could govern without Labour support. Labour chose to back United, the party closest to its own views – this put an end to five terms of Reform Party government.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=79}}

The rigours of the [[Great Depression]] brought Labour considerable popularity, but also caused tension between Labour and the United Party. In 1931, United passed a number of economic measures which Labour deemed hostile to workers, and the agreement between the two parties collapsed. United then formed [[United–Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|a coalition government]] with Reform, making Labour the Opposition. The coalition retained power in the {{NZ election link|1931}}, but gradually, the public became highly dissatisfied with its failure to resolve the country's economic problems. Harry Holland died in 1933 and was replaced by his deputy Michael Joseph Savage as party leader. In the {{NZ election link|1935}}, the Labour Party gained a significant majority, gaining 53 seats to the coalition's 19, and returned to government.

Several of the early Labour Party stalwarts were Australian-born: [[Alfred Hindmarsh]], [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Bob Semple]], [[Paddy Webb]], [[Bill Parry (politician)|Bill Parry]] and later [[Jerry Skinner]], [[Mabel Howard]], [[Hugh Watt]] and [[Dorothy Jelicich]].

=== First Government (1935–1949) ===
{{main|First Labour Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Michael Joseph Savage, the first Prime Minister from the Labour Party]]
Party leader [[Michael Joseph Savage]] became [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] on 6 December 1935, marking the beginning of Labour's first term in office. The new government quickly set about implementing a number of significant reforms, including a reorganisation of the [[welfare in New Zealand|social welfare system]] and the creation of the [[state housing]] scheme.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Aimer|first1=Peter|title=Labour Party – First Labour government, 1935 to 1949|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/labour-party/page-2|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Workers also benefited from the introduction of the forty-hour week, and legislation making it easier for unions to negotiate on their behalf.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Richard A.|title=Employment and Labor Law Reform in New Zealand Lecture|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|date=2001|volume=33|url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2222&context=journal_articles|accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref> Savage himself was highly popular with the working classes, and his portrait could be found on the walls of many houses around the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Joseph Savage|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/michael-joseph-savage-biography|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> At this time the Labour Party pursued an alliance with the [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Rātana]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rātana and Labour seal alliance – 22 April 1936|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/ratana-and-labour-seal-alliance|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=17 May 2017|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The opposition, meanwhile, attacked the Labour Party's more left-wing policies and accused it of undermining free enterprise and hard work. The year after Labour's first win, the Reform Party and the United Party took their coalition to the next step, agreeing to merge with each other. The combined organisation was named the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], and would be Labour's main rival in future years.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=100}}

[[File:Labour Government caucus 1935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Members of the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] on the steps of the [[New Zealand Parliamentary Library|Parliamentary Library]] in Wellington, 1935]]
Labour also faced opposition from within its ranks. While the Labour Party had been explicitly socialist at its inception, it had been gradually drifting away from its earlier radicalism. The death of the party's former leader, the "doctrinaire" Harry Holland, had marked a significant turning point in the party's history. Some within the party, however, were displeased about the changing focus of the party, most notably [[John A. Lee]]. Lee, whose views were a mixture of socialism and [[social credit]] theory, emerged as a vocal critic of the party's leadership, accusing it of behaving autocratically and of betraying the party's rank and file. After a long and bitter dispute, Lee [[The Lee Affair|was expelled]] from the party, establishing his own breakaway [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John A Lee|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/john-a-lee|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|date=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Savage died in 1940 and was replaced by [[Peter Fraser]], who became Labour's longest-serving prime minister. Fraser is best known as New Zealand's leader for most of [[World War II]]. In the [[post-war]] period, however, ongoing shortages and industrial problems cost Labour considerable popularity, and the National Party, under [[Sidney Holland]], gained ground although Labour was able to win the 1943 and 1946 elections. Eventually, in the {{NZ election link|1949}}, Labour was defeated.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=133}}

Fraser died shortly afterward, and was replaced by [[Walter Nash]], the long-serving [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=136}} It would be some time before Labour would return to power; however – Nash lacked the charisma of his predecessors, and National won considerable support for opposing the "industrial anarchy" of the [[1951 New Zealand waterfront dispute|1951 waterfront dispute]]. In the {{NZ election link|1957}}, however, Labour had a narrow majority of two seats, and returned to office.

=== Second Government (1957–1960) ===
{{main|Second Labour Government of New Zealand}}
Nash, Labour's third prime minister, took office in late 1957. Upon coming to power, Labour decided that drastic measures were needed to address [[balance of payments]] concerns.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=152}} This resulted in the highly unpopular "[[Black Budget (New Zealand)|Black Budget]]" of [[Arnold Nordmeyer]], the new Minister of Finance, which raised taxes on alcohol, cigarettes, cars, and petrol.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=154}} It is widely thought to have doomed the party to defeat despite the economy having rejuvenated less than a year after the Black Budget was adopted.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=154}} In the {{NZ election link|1960}}, the National Party returned to power.

[[File:Norman Kirk 1966 campaign opening.jpg|thumb|Leader [[Norman Kirk]] opening Labour's election campaign in 1966]]
The elderly Nash retired in 1963, suffering from ill health.{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=160}} He was replaced by Nordmeyer, but the taint of the Black Budget ensured that Nordmeyer did not have any appreciable success in reversing the party's fortunes. In 1965, the leadership was assumed by the younger [[Norman Kirk]], who many believed would revitalise the party. Labour was defeated again in the next two elections, but in the {{NZ election link|1972}}, the party gained a significant majority over its rival.

=== Third Government (1972–1975) ===
{{main|Third Labour Government of New Zealand}}
Kirk proved to be an energetic Prime Minister and introduced a number of new policies. His foreign policy stances included strong criticism of [[nuclear weapon]]s testing and of [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] system. Kirk's health was poor, however, and was worsened by his refusal to slow the pace of his work. In 1974, Kirk was taken ill and died. He was replaced by [[Bill Rowling]], who did not have the same appeal – in the {{NZ election link|1975}}, Labour was defeated by National, which was led by [[Robert Muldoon]].{{sfn|Franks|McAloon|2016|pp=184}}

Rowling remained the leader of the Labour Party for some time after his defeat. In the {{NZ election link|1978}} and the {{NZ election link|1981}} Labour won a larger share of the vote than National but failed to win an equivalent number of seats. Rowling himself was compared unfavourably to Muldoon, and did not cope well with Muldoon's aggressive style. Rowling was eventually replaced by [[David Lange]], who the caucus perceived as more charismatic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wallace Rowling|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/people/wallace-rowling|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=16 November 2017|language=en|date=21 August 2014}}</ref> In the [[snap election]] of {{NZ election link year|1984}}, Labour defeated the National party.

=== Fourth Government (1984–1990) ===
{{main|Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand}}
[[File:David Lange (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The free-market policies of [[David Lange]]'s government deviated sharply from previous Labour governments]]
When the Fourth Labour Government came into power it uncovered a fiscal crisis that had been largely hidden by the outgoing [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Third National Government]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=38–39}} Government debt was skyrocketing, due largely to the costs of borrowing to maintain a fixed exchange rate. When the result of the election became clear Lange asked Muldoon to devalue the dollar, which he refused to do, resulting in [[1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis|a constitutional crisis]] and precipitating some of the changes in the [[Constitution Act 1986]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Patriated – History of the Governor-General|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/patriated|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=19 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The economic policy agenda of the Fourth Labour Government differed significantly from previous Labour governments. The Minister of Finance, [[Roger Douglas]], was a supporter of [[free market]] theories, and sought to implement sweeping reforms ("[[Rogernomics]]") to the economy and tax system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Tim|last2=Reardon|first2=John|title=About Turn: An Analysis of the Causes of the New Zealand Labour Party's Adoption of Neo-Liberal Policies 1984–1990|journal=Political Quarterly|year=2007|volume=78|issue=3|page=447 455|url=http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/28177/3E59BD56-D5F3-4E4B-A565-9C7078145D81.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Easton">{{cite encyclopedia |author1-link=Brian Easton (economist) |last1=Easton |first1=Brian |title=Economic history – Government and market liberalisation |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-11 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |date=11 March 2010 |access-date=17 July 2020}}</ref> This involved floating the New Zealand dollar, cutting government spending, reducing taxes and removing almost all industry subsidies.<ref name="Easton"/> The government also revolutionised New Zealand's foreign policy, making the country a [[New Zealand nuclear-free zone|nuclear-free zone]],<ref name="Lange1990">{{cite book| last =  Lange| first =  David| author-link = David Lange| title = Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way| publisher = Penguin Books| year =  1990| location =  New Zealand| pages =| url =}}</ref> and effectively leaving the [[ANZUS]] alliance. [[Immigration to New Zealand|Immigration policy]] was liberalised and migration from Asia was promoted.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brawley|first1=Sean|title='No White Policy in NZ': Fact and Fiction in New Zealand's Asian Immigration Record, 1946–1978|journal=New Zealand Journal of History|date=1993|volume=27|issue=1|pages=33–36|url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/docs/1993/NZJH_27_1_03.pdf}}</ref>

Other Fourth Labour Government innovations included extended the jurisdiction of the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] back to the date of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi; [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|Homosexual Law Reform]], which legalised homosexual relations; and the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights Act]], which enumerated civil and political rights. Throughout its first term, the government remained largely unified behind the radical financial, economic and social policy reforms that were enacted but early signs of dissension began to appear before the 1987 election.{{sfn|Holland-Boston|1988|p=?}}

In {{NZ election link year|1987}} Labour won another considerable election victory against the National Party while ruptures over the direction of policy remained concealed. Despite taking votes from affluent areas, Labour suffered negative swings in more traditional seats, the blue ribbon seat of [[Remuera (New Zealand electorate)|Remuera]] nearly fell into the Labour column. This second term, which increased Labour's majority and was won mostly on the back of its [[anti-nuclear]] stance, caused emerging divisions over economic policy to begin arising within Cabinet.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=40}} Ministers were divided on the extent and pace of further reforms, and there was a rebellion among party members and disillusion among Labour voters. The party was also criticised by the [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions|Council of Trade Unions]]. One vocal critic of government policy, [[Jim Anderton]], left to establish the [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]] which later formed the basis of the left-wing [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance Party]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=40}}<ref name="Vowles 2013">{{cite book|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|title=Voters' Vengeance: 1990 Election in New Zealand and the Fate of the Fourth Labour Government|date=2013|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=9781869407124|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UFeAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|language=en}}</ref> At the same time Roger Douglas and Lange fought intermittent battles inside Cabinet with Douglas wanting to dramatically expand his economic programme. A [[flat tax]] proposal by Douglas was strongly opposed by Lange who moved to sack him, resulting in political clashes throughout 1988, but Lange successfully removed him following extended struggles. After Douglas was re-elected to Cabinet the next year, Lange thereafter resigned from office himself in 1989, interpreting Douglas's reappointment as a vote of no confidence in his leadership.<ref name="Hubbard">{{cite news|last=Hubbard|first=Anthony|title=The Reluctant Prime Minister|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9433705/The-Reluctant-Prime-Minister|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=23 November 2013}}</ref>

Lange was replaced by [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]].<ref name="Hubbard"/> However, Palmer failed to rebuild the shattered remnants of Lange's government and, by September 1990, Palmer was replaced by [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]]. Despite Moore's ascension somewhat salvaging poll ratings Labour suffered its worst defeat since it first took office in 1935 (losing twenty-eight seats) and was flung into the political wilderness after their election landslide loss.<ref name="Vowles 2013"/> National swept to power seemingly repudiating the Lange/Douglas program but then engaged in even more radical policies than Labour had contemplated, political disillusionment caused by both governments was decisive in the later adoption of [[mixed-member proportional representation]] (MMP).

Moore himself was eventually replaced by [[Helen Clark]], despite recovering sixteen seats at the 1993 election. Clark led the party in opposition to the National government for six years under the administrations of Bolger (1993–1997) and Shipley (1997–1999). During this period in opposition, the party made a measured repudiation of Rogernomics, although it has never returned to its original leftist roots (Labour's contemporary position is left-of-centre).<ref name="boston"/> When the {{NZ election link|1996}}, the first conducted under the MMP electoral system, gave the balance of power to the centrist [[New Zealand First]] party, many believed that Labour would return to power, but in the end New Zealand First formed their own coalition arrangement with the National Party. Despite initially appearing coherent, the coalition became increasingly unstable and eventually collapsed, leaving the National Party to govern as a [[minority government]] from 1998 to 1999.

[[File:Labourlogo2008.png|thumb|left|Party logo in 2008]]
Following the {{NZ election link|2005}}, Labour formed a coalition with the [[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive Party]] (breakaway party of the old Alliance), and entered into complex [[confidence and supply]] agreements with the centrist [[United Future]] and [[New Zealand First]] parties, which gave both parties' leaders a ministerial portfolio, while remaining outside the Cabinet. A limited support agreement was also made with the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]], whereby certain policy concessions were to be made to the Greens in return for abstention on confidence and supply votes. Labour lost power when the National Party soundly defeated it in the {{NZ election link|2008}}.

=== Voter base ===
Historically, the party drew upon a stable sectional voter [[base (politics)|base]] comprising the urban [[working class]], predominantly [[manual labour]]ers and trade unionists. From the 1930s onwards, Labour has increasingly positioned itself as a broad-based party by responding and adapting to different social and economic problems and changing demographics (appealing to an expanding migrant population and a diversified ethnic, social make-up).<ref name="Aimer"/> Beginning in the 1980s, there was a shift away from class-issues and towards the promotion of individual freedoms, particularly for members of disadvantaged groups such as women and Māori. The modern party's core support base lies among young people, urban workers, civil servants, and minorities (particularly the Māori and [[Pacific Islander]] communities).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bracewell-Worrall|first1=Anna|title=What the data tells us: Māori and Pacific voters throw support behind Labour|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/what-the-data-tells-us-m-ori-and-pacific-voters-throw-support-behind-labour.html|accessdate=6 May 2018|work=Newshub|date=10 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|title=Towards Consensus?: The 1993 Election and Referendum in New Zealand and the Transition to Proportional Representation|date=2013|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=9781869407162|pages=20–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0JeAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>

== Organisation ==
=== Party structure ===
==== General and special branches ====
Party membership is tied into geographically-based branches in each [[New Zealand electorates|parliamentary electorate]]. General branches must consist of at least 10 members aged 15 or over.<ref name="constitution2016">{{cite web|title=Constitution and Rules|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/parties/rules/labour_party_constitution_2015.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=July 2016}}</ref> Members may also form special branches where they have a special community of interest (such as university students and academics, young people, women, Māori people, Pacific Islanders, multicultural groups, people with disabilities, the [[Rainbow Labour|rainbow community]] and industrial workers).<ref name="constitution2016"/> Influential branches include [[Princes Street Labour]] (this Auckland university branch is described as the "ideological powerhouse of the party",<ref>{{cite web|title=Princes Street|url=http://www.younglabour.org.nz/princes_street|publisher=New Zealand Young Labour|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> and has contributed many prominent Labour politicians) and [[Vic Labour]] (the [[Victoria University of Wellington]] branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=VicLabour|url=http://www.younglabour.org.nz/viclabour|publisher=New Zealand Young Labour|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>

{{New Zealand Labour Party membership}}
Membership figures are rarely released to the public. Full (non-affiliate) membership is known to have peaked at 55,000 in 1976. During the 1980s and 1990s, party membership plummeted to levels not seen since before the First Labour Government. This decline might be attributed to disillusionment on the part of some members with the economic policies of the Fourth Labour Government ("[[Rogernomics]]"). Membership figures began to recover under Helen Clark's leadership, with 14,000 members recorded in 2002.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Peter|first1=Aimer|title=Labour Party – Ideology and the role of unions: Labour Party membership, 1917–2002|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/graph/34047/labour-party-membership-1917-2002|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>

==== Conference, councils and committees ====
Delegates from all branches in the electorate, together with delegates from affiliated unions, make up the Labour Electorate Committee (LEC). The LEC is responsible for party organisation in the electorate.<ref name="constitution2016"/> The party is divided into six regional areas, which each year convene a Regional Conference.<ref name="Organisation">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Aimer|first1=Peter|title=Labour Party – Organisation of the Labour Party|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/labour-party/page-7|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=13 June 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> Policy and other matters are debated and passed onto the Annual Conference.<ref name="constitution2016"/>

The Annual Conference (called Congress in election years) is the supreme governing body of the Labour Party when it is in session. All constituent bodies of the party are entitled to send delegates to Annual Conference.<ref name="constitution2016"/>

The New Zealand Council is the Labour Party's governing [[executive committee|executive]].<ref name="Organisation" /> It ensures that the party is governed effectively according to its constitution. The NZ Council consists of the president, two senior vice presidents (one of which must be a [[Māori people|Māori]]), three vice presidents (representing women, affiliates, and Pacific Islanders), seven regional representatives, one Policy Council representative, three Caucus representatives, and the general secretary.<ref name="constitution2016"/>

The Policy Council, responsible for the development of the policy platform and [[election manifesto]],<ref name="platform"/> is elected for a three-year term following each [[Elections in New Zealand|general election]]. The party structure also provides for [[Special Interest Group]] Councils: representing the affiliates, women's issues, Māori issues, Pacific Islands, [[primary industries]], local government, and youth.<ref name="constitution2016"/>

==== Caucus and parliamentary leadership ====
[[File:Labour-Pacfic-Launch-19 (35995067264) (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Leader [[Jacinda Ardern]] with party members at a 2017 Labour election campaign event]]
The elected members representing the Labour Party in the House of Representatives meet as the Parliamentary Labour Party, also called the [[Caucus]]. The current parliamentary leader is [[Jacinda Ardern]].<ref name="info">{{cite web|title= Party Information|url= http://www.labour.org.nz/party_resources|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate= 4 February 2017|language= en}}</ref> A leadership election is triggered upon the vacancy of the position of leader or a [[motion of no confidence]]. Candidates are nominated from within the Caucus. Under Labour Party rules, party members have 40% of the votes, MPs have another 40% of the votes, and affiliated unions have 20% of the votes.<ref name="constitution2016"/> Some observers{{who|date=April 2020}} have criticised the influence of the unions in leadership elections.<ref name="unions1"/>

=== Affiliated trade unions ===
In the first decades of the 20th century, [[manufacturing]] industries grew strongly in New Zealand's main cities and union membership also increased. The Labour Party was formed in this period as the political wing of the labour movement and was financed by trade unions. Since then, the unions have retained close institutional links with the party. There are currently six unions that are directly affiliated to the party and pay affiliation fees, as well as receiving a percentage of the vote in party leadership elections.<ref name="unions1">{{cite news|title=Opinion: Unions rip off Labour leadership|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/opinion/opinion-unions-rip-off-labour-leadership-2014111910|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=Newshub|date=18 November 2014}}</ref> These unions are the following:

* [[Central Amalgamated Workers' Union]] (CAWU)

In addition, the president of the [[New Zealand Council of Trade Unions]] continues to speak at the Labour Party Annual Conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.nz/conference-2012 |title=Conference 2012 – New Zealand Labour Party |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120005216/http://www.labour.org.nz/conference-2012 |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Young Labour ===
{{main|New Zealand Young Labour}}
Young Labour is the party's [[youth wing]]. It exists to organise young members (under 26<ref>{{cite web|title=About Young Labour|url=http://www.younglabour.org.nz/about|publisher=New Zealand Young Labour|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref>) and encourage wider involvement of young New Zealanders in centre-left politics. Young Labour is the most active sector in the Labour Party and plays a significant role in policy development and campaign efforts. It is endearingly called the "conscience of the party".<ref>{{cite news|title=Young, gifted and politically aware|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/hutt-news/703584/Young-gifted-and-politically-aware|accessdate=13 June 2017|work=Stuff.co.nz|date=4 November 2008|language=English}}</ref>

In March 2018, it was reported that four people under 16 were allegedly sexually assaulted at a Young Labour summer camp in February. The camp was said to have "mountains of alcohol", and people under the legal drinking age of 18 were said to have consumed alcohol. Although Young Labour and the Labour Party were aware of the allegations, party leadership failed to tell the Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. The party offered counselling and support after the allegations were publicly reported.<ref>{{cite news |title='We failed in our duty of care' – Labour leadership |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/352475/we-failed-in-our-duty-of-care-labour-leadership |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=14 March 2018 |language=en-nz}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='We took too long' – Jacinda Ardern on alleged sex assaults at Young Labour camp |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/03/labour-confirms-inappropriate-behaviour-after-sexual-assault-claims.html |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=13 March 2018 |language=en}}</ref> An independent review into the party's conduct and sexual assault complaint policy was announced by Party President [[Nigel Haworth]], and was completed late August.

=== Local government ===
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2018}}
As of 2019, the [[Auckland Council]] had four councillors serving under the Labour ticket and one serving under the affiliated [[City Vision]] ticket. Overall, the centre-left maintain a majority and the incumbent mayor, [[Phil Goff]], is a former leader of the party. In addition, there are 27 elected Labour Party community board members across Auckland, while City Vision holds 14 seats.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In [[New Plymouth District|New Plymouth]], former MP [[Harry Duynhoven]] served as [[Mayor of New Plymouth|mayor]] from 2010 to 2013, when he was voted out of office. [[Lianne Dalziel]] was elected to be [[Mayor of Christchurch]] in the [[2013 New Zealand local elections|2013 local body elections]] succeeding Sir [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]], and former {{NZ electorate link|Rotorua}} electorate then list MP [[Steve Chadwick]], was elected as [[Mayor of Rotorua]] in the 2013 elections, Both Dalziel and Chadwick ran however as independents.

In [[Christchurch City Council|Christchurch]], Labour maintains an umbrella, including community independents called [[The People's Choice (political ticket)|The People's Choice]] (formerly Christchurch 2021). Labour candidates stand as 'The People's Choice (Labour)' and hold 10 community board seats, seven council seats, and several community board chairmanships.

[[Wellington City|Wellington]] has three Labour Party councillors: Fleur Fitzsimons – Southern Ward councillor, Teri O'Neill – Eastern Ward councillor and Rebecca Matthews – Onslow-Western Ward Councillor. There are many more local councillors in the Wellington region who are Labour Party members, but do not run as endorsed candidates of the party.

[[Daran Ponter]] of the Wellington City ward on the [[Wellington Region|Greater Wellington Regional Council]] is the only councillor to have been elected on a Labour ticket, although other councillors such as Ros Connelly and Penny Gaylor have a history with the party. [[Campbell Barry]] has been the mayor of [[Lower Hutt]] since 2019, and was elected on a Labour ticket along with Wainuiomata ward councilor Keri Brown.

In [[Dunedin]], the city councillor and former Labour MP [[David Benson-Pope]] announced on 26 February 2016 that he would be contesting the [[2016 New Zealand local elections|Dunedin local elections]] in October under the "Local Labour" ticket. While still a Labour Party member, Benson Pope had stood in the [[2013 Dunedin local elections|2013 local elections]] as an independent candidate. This report coincided with the dissolution of the city's main local body ticket, the centre-left [[Greater Dunedin]] group. On 20 April, it was reported that the Labour Party had dropped its plan to field a bloc of candidates in the 2016 Dunedin elections. However, the Party has not ruled out endorsing other candidates.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Elder |first1=Vaughan |title=No Labour ticket; Hawkins, Vandervis declare hand |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/380331/no-labour-ticket-hawkins-vandervis-declare-hand |accessdate=29 April 2016 |work=Otago Daily Times |date=20 April 2016}}</ref> In 2019, Steve Walker was elected to the Dunedin City Council and [[Marian Hobbs]] was elected to the Otago regional council, both on a Labour Party ticket.<ref name="ODT 26 Feb 2016">{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Chris |title=Greater Dunedin disbands |url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/374454/greater-dunedin-disbands |accessdate=30 March 2016 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=26 February 2016}}</ref>

In [[Palmerston North]], councillor Lorna Johnson and Zulfiqar Butt are the only two representatives to have been elected to the city council on a Labour ticket. However, there are several other councilors who are, or have been, members of the Labour Party who serve as independents.

In Whanganui, the town's mayor [[Hamish McDouall]] is a Labour member and previously contested the [[Whanganui (New Zealand electorate)|seat of Whanganui]] for the party. McDouall ran on an independent ticket.

In addition, there are many others councillors in almost all areas of New Zealand that are members or have previously had connections with the Labour Party, but have instead contested local elections as independents.

: Labour did not stand candidates in every electorate until [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946]], when it stood candidates in all 80 electorates. According to the National Executive reports,{{sfn|Brown|1962|p=225}} the number of official candidates in 1919 is uncertain (53 or possibly 46). The party ran 41 candidates in 1922; 56 in 1925; 55 in 1928; 53 in 1931; 70 in 1935; 78 in 1938; and 77 in 1943. Labour did not run against independent candidates who voted with Labour, such as [[Harry Atmore]] in Nelson and [[David McDougall]] in Mataura, Southland. Labour did not run candidates against the two [[Country Party (New Zealand)|Country Party]] candidates in 1935, but did in 1938, when both candidates were defeated.
