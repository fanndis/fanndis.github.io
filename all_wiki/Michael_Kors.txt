==Career==
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.<ref name=voguepedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Michael_Kors |title=Michael Kors |work=Vogue |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227143208/http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Michael_Kors |archive-date=December 27, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lafaille |first=Rena |date=2 June 2011 |title=Seven Surprising Facts About Michael Kors |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/michael-kors-surprising-facts-superstar-designer/story?id=13733549 |work=ABC News |accessdate=4 October 2016}}</ref> As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.<ref name=voguepedia /> Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kilcooley-O'Halloran |first=Scarlett |date=January 24, 2013 |title=Michael Kors |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/michael-kors |work=Vogue |access-date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>

In 1977, he enrolled at the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in New York City.<ref>[http://www.infomat.com/whoswho/michaelkors.html Infomat Michael Kors Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114225022/http://infomat.com/whoswho/michaelkors.html |date=2010-01-14 }}, Infomat.com, September 10, 2009</ref>  However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from [[Bergdorf Goodman]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, [[Dawn Mello]], the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2010/09/13/news/companies/michael_kors_fashion.fortune/index.htm |title=Michael Kors: Retail's next billion-dollar man |work=cnn.com}}</ref>

In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at [[Bergdorf Goodman]]. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He got back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women's ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.<ref>[https://www.styl.sh/articles/59-the-michael-kors-story The Michael Kors Story] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729213259/https://www.styl.sh/articles/59-the-michael-kors-story |date=2017-07-29 }}, December 11, 2012</ref>  In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand.  Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.
