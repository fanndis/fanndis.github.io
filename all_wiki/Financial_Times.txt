The '''''Financial Times''''' ('''''FT'''''){{#tag:ref|Although 'FT' [[Acronym|stands for]] "Financial Times'", it is [[Italic type|titled in italics]], i.e. ''FT'' along with ''Financial Times''.|group="nb"}} is an international [[Newspaper|daily newspaper]] printed in [[broadsheet]] and published digitally that focuses on business and economic [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]]. Based in London, England, the paper is owned by the Japanese holding company, [[Nikkei, Inc.|Nikkei]], with core editorial offices across Britain, the United States, and continental Europe. In July 2015, [[Pearson plc|Pearson]] sold the publication to Nikkei for [[Pound sign|£]]844 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.32 billion) after owning it since 1957. In Spring 2019, it reported one million paying subscriptions, three-quarters of which are digital subscriptions.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FT tops one million paying readers|url=https://aboutus.ft.com/en-gb/announcements/ft-tops-one-million-paying-readers/|website=aboutus.ft.com|language=en-gb|access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Guardian20190419">{{Cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|date=14 April 2019|title=Financial Times thrives by focusing on subscriptions|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2019/apr/14/financial-times-thrives-by-focusing-on-subscriptions|access-date=19 April 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The newspaper has a prominent focus on [[Business journalism|financial journalism]] and economic analysis over [[News media|generalist reporting]], drawing both criticism and acclaim. The daily sponsors an [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|annual book award]] and publishes a "[[Financial Times Person of the Year|Person of the Year]]" feature.<!--Article uses British English, e.g. "-ise" over "-ize". See: WP:ISE.-->

The paper was founded in 1888 as the '''''London Financial Guide''''' before rebranding a year later as the ''Financial Times''. It was first circulated around metropolitan London by [[Financial Times#History|James Sheridan]], who, along with his brother and [[Horatio Bottomley]], sought to report on city business opposite the ''[[Financial News (1884–1945)|Financial News]]''. The succeeding half-century competition between the two papers would eventually culminate in a [[Financial News (1884–1945)#History|1945 merger]], led by [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]], which established it as [[List of business newspapers#Top circulation|one of the largest business newspapers]] in the world. Globalisation from the late-19th to mid-20th century facilitated editorial expansion for the ''FT'', with the paper adding opinion columns, special reports, [[political cartoon]]s, [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], book reviews, technology articles, and global politics features. The paper is often recognisable by its light-pink (salmon) broadsheet and digital display. It is supplemented by its lifestyle magazine (''[[FT Magazine]])'', weekend edition (''[[Financial Times#FT Weekend|FT Weekend]]''), and a small portfolio of industry publications.

The [[Financial Times#Editorial stance|editorial stance of the ''Financial Times'']] centres on [[economic liberalism]], particularly free trade and free markets. Since its founding it has supported [[liberal democracy]], favouring [[Classical liberalism|classically liberal]] politics and policies from international governments. Its newsroom is independent from its editorial board. Due to its history of economic commentary, the ''FT'' publishes a [[Financial Times#Indices|variety of financial indices]], primarily the [[FTSE All-Share Index]]. Its typical depth of coverage has, since the late-20th century, linked the paper with a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] and educated readership.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Plunkett|first1=John|last2=Martinson|first2=Jane|date=2015-07-24|title=Financial Times sold to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844m|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/23/financial-times-sale-pearson|access-date=2020-05-29|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=A Brief History of the Financial Times|url=https://www.gale.com/binaries/content/assets/gale-us-en/primary-sources/intl-gps/intl-gps-essays/full-ghn-contextual-essays/ghn_essay_ftha_kynaston1_website.pdf|last=Kynaston|first=David|date=1988|publisher=Viking Adult|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> The ''Financial Times'' is headquartered in [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]] at [[Cannon Street|10 Cannon Street]], near the city's financial centre, where it maintains its [[Publishing|publishing house]], corporate centre, and main editorial office.

==History==
[[File:Financial Times 1888 front page.jpg|thumb|The front page of the ''Financial Times'' on 13 February 1888.|247x247px]]
The ''FT'' was launched as the ''London Financial Guide'' on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the ''Financial Times'' on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of "The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the [[City of London]], its only rival being the more daring and slightly older (founded in 1884) ''Financial News''. On 2 January 1893 the ''FT'' began printing on light pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named ''Financial News'': at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the newspaper|url=http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108062240/http://help.ft.com/newspaper-delivery/about-the-newspaper/#axzz3ZDPTGgyZ|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 January 2012|website=ft.com|publisher=Financial Times|access-date=4 May 2015}}</ref>

After 57 years of rivalry the ''Financial Times'' and the ''Financial News'' were merged in 1945 by [[Brendan Bracken, 1st Viscount Bracken|Brendan Bracken]] to form a single six-page newspaper. The ''Financial Times'' brought a higher circulation while the ''Financial News'' provided much of the editorial talent. The ''Lex'' column was also introduced from ''Financial News''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gale.cengage.co.uk/images/FT%20Brief%20History%20by%20David%20Kynaston.pdf |title=A brief history of the FT by David Kynaston, author of ''The Financial Times: A Centenary History''. |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015044548/http://gale.cengage.co.uk/images/FT%20Brief%20History%20by%20David%20Kynaston.pdf |archive-date=15 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] bought the paper in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/pearson-plc-history/ |title=International Directory of Company Histories: Pearson plc History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |access-date=15 October 2013}}</ref> Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the [[world economy]] towards [[globalisation]]. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the ''FT'' began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first ''FT'' (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the ''FT'' has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/2011mediakit/history_video.html |title=FT's Media Kit: FT Heritage and Innovation |publisher=Fttoolkit.co.uk |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215215337/http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/2011mediakit/history_video.html |archive-date=15 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The European edition is distributed in continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe, reporting on matters concerning the European Union, the [[euro]] and European corporate affairs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.financialtimes.net/about_fttour.html |title=FT tour |publisher=Financialtimes.net |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513183713/https://www.financialtimes.net/about_fttour.html |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1994 ''FT'' launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, ''How To Spend It''. In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com/news/2009/october/financial-times-launches-how-to-spend-it-online.html?article=true |title=Financial Times launches How To Spend It online |publisher=Pearson |date=1 October 2009 |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015160117/http://www.pearson.com/news/2009/october/financial-times-launches-how-to-spend-it-online.html?article=true |archive-date=15 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> On 13 May 1995 the ''Financial Times'' group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage. The second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online. ''FT'' introduced subscription services in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com/news/2002/april/ftcom-to-launch-improved-website-with-new-content-and-services.html?article=true |title=FT.com to launch improved website with new content and services for users, subscribers and advertisers |publisher=Pearson |date=30 April 2002 |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015160115/http://www.pearson.com/news/2002/april/ftcom-to-launch-improved-website-with-new-content-and-services.html?article=true |archive-date=15 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> FT.com is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription.

In 1997 the ''FT'' launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the ''FT'' became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK. In 2000 the ''Financial Times'' started publishing a German-language edition, ''[[Financial Times Deutschland]]'', with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, [[Gruner + Jahr]]. In January 2008 the ''FT'' sold its 50% stake to its German partner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pearson.com/news/2008/january/pearson-to-sell-its-ft-deutschland-stake-to-gruner-%2B-jahr.html?article=true |title=Pearson to sell its FT Deutschland stake to Gruner + Jahr |publisher=Pearson |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015160113/http://www.pearson.com/news/2008/january/pearson-to-sell-its-ft-deutschland-stake-to-gruner-%2B-jahr.html?article=true |archive-date=15 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> ''FT Deutschland'' never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of €250 million over 12 years.

=== Wirecard exposé ===
{{main|Wirecard scandal}}
In January 2019, the ''FT'' began a series of [[Investigative journalism|investigative articles]] detailing fraud suspicions at German payments group [[Wirecard]]. When the Wirecard share price plunged, German news media speculated that [[market manipulation]] was behind this attack on a German corporate, focusing on the lead author of the ''FT'' series, Dan McCrum. The Public prosecutor's office in [[Munich]] subsequently launched an investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/wirecard-ermittlungen-gegen-financial-times-journalisten-16047237.html |title=Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt gegen einen Financial-Times-Journalisten |publisher=faz.net |date=18 February 2019 |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref> After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German [[Federal Financial Supervisory Authority]] (BaFin) the responsible state's attorney announced investigations into several ''FT'' journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/zahlungsdienstleister-wirecard-erhebt-schwere-anschuldigungen-gegen-die-financial-times/24681644.html |title=Wirecard erhebt schwere Anschuldigungen gegen die "Financial Times" |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=21 July 2019 |access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>

On June 22, 2020 and after 18 months of investigations and an external audit, Wirecard announced that €1.9 billion worth of cash reported in its accounts "may not exist". The company subsequently filed for [[insolvency]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Wirecard investors set for legal battle as accounting questions mount |url=https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/wirecard-investors-set-for-legal-battle-as-accounting-questions-mount-59114712 |access-date=26 June 2020 |work=S&P Global |date=26 June 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> BaFin itself became subject of a [[European Securities and Markets Authority]] investigation for its response to the scandal.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Pascale |title=EU to investigate German financial watchdog over Wirecard scandal |url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/06/25/wirecard-goes-bust-amid-german-accounting-scandal |access-date=27 June 2020 |work=euronews |date=25 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Audience==
According to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits amongst most senior financial decision makers in the world's largest financial institutions, the ''Financial Times'' is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' (WSJ), its main rival. ''[[The Economist]]'', which was once 50% owned by ''FT'', reaches 32%. ''FT'''s ''[[The Banker]]'' also proved vital reading, reaching 24%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcmsurvey.com/Media.html |title=Global Capital Markets Survey 2011 |publisher=Gcmsurvey.com |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015044909/http://www.gcmsurvey.com/Media.html |archive-date=15 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> In addition ''FT'' was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. ''The Economist'' was also rated the third most credible title by most influential professional investors (those who personally managed asset funds worth $5 billion or more), while the ''WSJ'' was second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fttoolkit.co.uk/admediakit/pdfs/PIC_2010_May.ppt |title=Worldwide Professional Investment Community Study 2010. |access-date=15 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524155213/http://fttoolkit.co.uk/admediakit/pdfs/PIC_2010_May.ppt |archive-date=24 May 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Content==
The ''FT'' is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from ''FT'' journalists such as [[Martin Wolf]], [[Gillian Tett]] and [[Edward Luce]], and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles. About 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the United Kingdom.

===The ''Lex'' column===
The ''Lex'' column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The ''FT'' calls ''Lex'' its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for ''Lex Mercatoria'', a Latin expression meaning literally "merchant law". It was conceived by [[Hargreaves Parkinson]] for the ''Financial News'' in the 1930s and moved to the ''Financial Times'' when the two merged.

''Lex'' boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government&nbsp;– including [[Nigel Lawson]] (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[Richard Lambert]] (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), [[David Freud]] (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), [[Andrew Balls]] (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and [[Jo Johnson]] (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).<ref name="about_lex">{{cite web|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070903221825/http://www.ft.com/lex/about | archive-date = 3 September 2007 |url = http://www.ft.com/lex/about|title = About Lex|access-date =4 September 2007|work=Financial Times}}</ref>

==''FT Weekend''==
The ''FT'' publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the ''Financial Times Weekend''. It consists of international economic and political news, ''Companies & Markets'', ''Life & Arts'', ''House & Home'' and ''[[FT Magazine]]''.

===''How to Spend It''===

FT Knowledge is an associated company which offers educational products and services. FT Knowledge has offered the "Introducing the City" course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000. FT Predict is a [[prediction market]] contest hosted by the ''Financial Times'' that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political, and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki's ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.

The ''Financial Times'' also ran a business-related game called "In the Pink" (a phrase meaning "in good health", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase "in the red" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of £10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.

==Indices==
[[File:Indices Financial Times.jpg|thumb|225x225px|A selection of ''FT'' [[Stock market index|market indices]], 2019]]
The ''Financial Times'' collates and publishes a number of [[Stock market index|financial market indices]], which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former ''Financial News Index'', started on 1 July 1935 by the ''Financial News''. The ''FT'' published a similar index; this was replaced by the ''Financial News Index''—which was then renamed the ''Financial Times (FT) Index''—on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (later [[BP]]), [[British-American Tobacco]], [[Lever Brothers]] (later [[Unilever]]) and [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.<ref name="Littlewood">''The Stock Market'', John Littlewood.</ref>

The [[FTSE All-Share Index]], the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation.<ref name=Littlewood /> The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times ('''F-T''') and the [[London Stock Exchange]] ('''S-E'''). On 13 February 1984 the [[FTSE 100]] was introduced, representing about eighty percent of the London Stock Exchange's value.<ref name=Littlewood /> In 1995 [[FTSE Group]] was made an independent company. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, [[Frankfurt]] and San Francisco in 2001, [[Madrid]] in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.

Other well-known FTSE indices include the [[FTSE 350 Index]], the [[FTSE SmallCap Index]], the [[FTSE AIM UK 50 Index]] and [[FTSE AIM 100 Index]] as well as the [[FTSE AIM All-Share Index]] for stocks, and the FTSE UK Gilt Indices for government bonds.

==People==
In July 2006 the ''FT'' announced a "New Newsroom" project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs. A number of former ''FT'' journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. [[Robert James Thomson|Robert Thomson]], previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of ''[[The Times]]'' and is now the publisher of the ''Wall Street Journal''. [[William Lewis (journalist)|Will Lewis]], a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the ''FT'', is the current editor of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''. [[Dominic Lawson]] went on to become editor of the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' until he was sacked in 2005. [[Andrew Adonis]], a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]], and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the [[House of Lords]] after the 2005 election. [[Ed Balls]] became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with [[Gordon Brown]], the [[chancellor of the exchequer]] (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became [[Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]] in July 2007. [[Bernard Gray]], a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the ''[[Times Educational Supplement]]''. David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper's transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.

Sir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the ''Financial Times'' from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the [[London School of Economics]] as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997. He continues his work there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/management/people/gowen.aspx |title=Directory of the Management Department at the London School of Economics |publisher=Lse.ac.uk |date=30 June 2014 |access-date=15 July 2014}}</ref> During his tenure at the FT he had to deal with rapid technological change and issues related to it, for example repetitive strain injury (RSI), which affected dozens of FT journalists, reporters and staff in the late 1980s.
