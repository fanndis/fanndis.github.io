'''''Abitur''''' ({{IPA-de|abiˈtuːɐ̯|lang}}) is a qualification granted at the end of [[secondary education]] in [[Germany]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Estonia]]. It is conferred on students who pass their final exams at the end of [[International Standard Classification of Education|ISCED 3]], usually after twelve or thirteen years of schooling (see also for Germany [[Abitur after twelve years|''Abitur'' after twelve years]]). In German, the term ''Abitur'' has roots in the archaic word ''Abiturium'', which in turn was derived from the [[Latin]] ''abiturus'' (future active participle of ''abire'', thus "someone who is going to leave").

As a [[matriculation examination]], ''Abitur'' can be compared to [[A level]]s, the ''[[Matura]]'' or the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]], which are all ranked as level 4 in the [[European Qualifications Framework]].

== In Germany ==
===Overview===
The ''Zeugnis der Allgemeinen Hochschulreife'' ("certificate of general qualification for university entrance"), often referred to as ''Abiturzeugnis'' ("''Abitur'' certificate"), issued after candidates have passed their final exams and have had appropriate grades in both the last and second last school year, is the document which contains their grades and formally enables them to attend [[university]]. Thus, it encompasses the functions of both a school graduation certificate and a college entrance exam.<ref>For some subjects, additional entrance exams may be required, for example in sports, music and fine arts.</ref>

The official term in Germany for this certificate of education is ''Allgemeine Hochschulreife''; the contraction ''Abi'' is common in colloquial usage. In 2005, a total of 231,465 students passed the ''Abitur'' exam in Germany. The numbers have risen steadily and in 2012, a total of 305,172 students obtained the ''Allgemeine Hochschulreife''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fachserie 11, Reihe 1|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/BildungForschungKultur/Schulen/AllgemeinbildendeSchulen2110100137004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|publisher=Statistisches Bundesamt|accessdate=15 April 2014|authorlink=2110100137004|page=282|language=German|date=5 November 2013}}</ref> This number, reflecting those who pass the traditional ''Abitur'' at their high school, is, however, lower than the total count. Adding (for 2012) the 51,912 students who obtained the ''Hochschulreife'' at vocational training schools, that total number increases to 357,084. If those who obtain the ''Fachhochschulreife'' (144,399 in 2012) are also added, then the total of those who obtained the right to study at a university or a ''Fachhochschule'' is 501,483 (2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Schnellmeldungsergebnisse zu Studienberechtigten der allgemeinbildenden und beruflichen Schulen|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/BildungForschungKultur/Schulen/SchnellmeldungStudienberechtigtePDF_5211001.pdf?__blob=publicationFile|publisher=Statistisches Bundesamt|accessdate=15 April 2014|authorlink=5211001138004|page=3|date=27 February 2014}}</ref>

===History===
Until the 18th century, every German university had its own entrance examination. In 1788 [[Prussia]] introduced the ''Abiturreglement'', a law, for the first time within Germany, establishing the ''Abitur'' as an official qualification. It was later also established in the other German states. In 1834, it became the only university entrance exam in Prussia, and it remained so in all [[states of Germany]] until 2004. Since then, the German state of [[Hesse]] allows students with ''Fachhochschulreife'' (see below) to study at the universities within that state.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

===Equivalency===
{{references|section|date=August 2020}}
The academic level of the ''Abitur'' is comparable to the [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate]], the [[GCE Advanced Level]] and the [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement tests]]. Indeed, the study requirements for the International Baccalaureate differ little from the German exam requirements. It is the only school-leaving certificate in all states of Germany that allows the graduate (or ''Abiturient'') to move directly to [[university]]. The other school leaving certificates, the ''[[Hauptschulabschluss]]'' and the ''[[Realschulabschluss]]'', do not allow their holders to matriculate at a university. Those granted certificates of ''Hauptschulabschluss'' or ''Realschulabschluss'' can gain a specialized ''Fachhochschulreife'' or an ''Abitur'' if they graduate from a ''Berufsschule'' and then attend ''[[Berufsoberschule]]'' or graduate from a ''Fachoberschule''.

However, the ''Abitur'' is not the only path to university studies, as some universities set up their own entrance examinations. Students who successfully passed a "[[Begabtenprüfung]]" ("test of aptitude") are also eligible. Students from other countries who hold a high school leaving certificate that is not counted as being equivalent to the ''Abitur'' (such as the American high school diploma) and who do well enough on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] or [[SAT]] test, may also enter German universities. A person who does not hold the ''Abitur'' and did not take an aptitude test may still be admitted to university by completing at least the 10th grade and doing well on an IQ test (see: [[Hochbegabtenstudium]]).

====Other qualifications called ''Abitur'' in colloquial usage====
{{references|section|date=August 2020}}
In German, the [[European Baccalaureate]] is called ''europäisches Abitur,'' and the [[International Baccalaureate]] is called ''internationales Abitur,'' both not to be confused with the German ''Abitur''.

The term ''Fachabitur'' was used in all of Western Germany for a variation of the ''Abitur'' until the 1990s; the official term for the German qualification is ''fachgebundene Hochschulreife''. This qualification includes only one foreign language (usually, English). The ''Abitur'', in contrast, usually requires two foreign languages. The ''Fachabitur'' also allows the graduate to start studying at a university but is limited to a specified range of majors, depending on the specific subjects covered in his ''Fachabitur'' examinations. But the graduate is allowed to study for all majors at a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (University of Applied Sciences, in some ways comparable to [[Institute of technology#Germany|polytechnics]]). Today, the school leaving certificate is called ''fachgebundenes Abitur'' ('restricted subject ''Abitur')''.

Now the term ''Fachabitur'' is used in most parts of Germany for the ''Fachhochschulreife (FHR)''. It was introduced in [[West Germany]] in the 1970s together with the ''[[Fachhochschule]]n''. It enables the graduate to start studying at a ''Fachhochschule'' and, in Hesse, also at a university within that state. In the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]s of some states it is awarded in the year before the ''Abitur'' is reached. However, the normal way to obtain ''Fachhochschulreife'' is graduation from a German ''Fachoberschule'', a vocational high school, also introduced in the 1970s.

The term ''Notabitur'' ('emergency ''Abitur''') describes a qualification used only during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. It was granted to male German ''Gymnasium'' students who voluntarily enlisted for military service before graduation as well as young women who were evacuated from the major cities before they could complete their ''Gymnasium'' education as planned (approximately three to five million children and teenagers had to be [[Evacuations of children in Germany during World War II|evacuated during the war]]). The ''Notabitur'' during World War I included an examination, roughly equivalent to the ''Abitur'' exam. The World War II ''Notabitur'', in contrast, was granted without an examination. After the war this was a major disadvantage for the students concerned since, unlike its World War I counterpart, the certificate was generally not recognised in [[West Germany]] and never recognised in [[East Germany]]. Universities requested the ''Abitur'' to consist of written exams including at least two foreign languages (almost always Latin and French, the latter sometimes replaced by English). Students, who received the ''Notabitur'' during World War II were offered to re-enter school to prepare for and take the exam after the war had ended. Those special ''Abitur'' preparation classes were made up of young adults of different age and sex, which was very unusual at the time.

[[File:Abipedia.jpg|thumb|right|This German graduate (''Abiturient'') wrote on his car: "Class of 2008: Not knowing anything, but knowing where it is written. Abipedia" (a [[portmanteau]] word compiled from ''Abitur'' and [[Wikipedia]])]]

===Equivalent high school graduation certificate in other countries===
The equivalent graduation certificate in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Austria]], [[Poland]] and other countries of [[continental Europe]] is the ''[[Matura]]''; while in England, [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and the [[West Indies]], it is [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]; in [[Scotland]] it is [[Higher Grade]]; in the [[Republic of Ireland]] it is the [[Leaving Certificate]]; in [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]] it is the "[[apolytirion]]" (a kind of high school diploma); in [[Malta]] it is the [[Matriculation Certificate (Malta)|Matriculation Certificate]] (MATSEC), in [[Hungary]] it is called "érettségi bizonyítvány" roughly equivalent with the German phrase ''Zeugnis der Allgemeinen Hochschulreife'' as it originates from the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy.

In Australia, the graduation certificate awarded to high school students is the [[Senior Secondary Certificate of Education]] (SSCE). However, the name of the SSCE varies from state to state. In Victoria, it is called the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE); in New South Wales it is called the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher Schools Certificate]] (HSC).

In India various states name it differently. Each Indian state has its own examination board, some individual states having their own entrance test system. Passing the specified examination qualifies the student to enter into undergraduate program in a university. For example, in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] this is known as Board of Intermediate Examination (BIE).

For professional, specialist programs and well reputed institutions there are entrance tests.  For engineering there is a Joint Engineering Entrance [[Joint Entrance Examination]] conducted at all India level. For medical undergraduate [[MBBS]] programs there is a national eligibility and entrance test known as NEET-UG [[National Eligibility and Entrance Test]] conducted at all of India. There is also an all India level examination conducted by Central Board of Secondary education [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] the certification is known as [[Higher Secondary School Certificate|Higher Secondary Certificate]] (HSC).

===Exams===
During the final examinations (''Abiturprüfungen''), students are tested in four or five subjects (at least one of which is oral). Procedures vary by [[States of Germany|state]].

|}
Although some tested subjects are chosen by the student, three areas must be covered:
* Language, literature and the arts
** German, [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] (in Saxony and Brandenburg), foreign languages (typically English, French, Latin, Ancient Greek, Spanish, Italian or Russian; rarely Dutch, Chinese, Japanese, Ancient Hebrew, Turkish, Modern Greek, Portuguese or Polish).
** Music, visual or performing arts, literature
* Social sciences
** [[Political science]], [[history]], [[geography]], [[economics]]
** [[Psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[ethics]]
* Mathematics, natural sciences and technology
** [[Mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]
** [[Computer science]], [[technology]], [[nutritional science]]
* Sports
Occasionally, schools (especially ''[[:de:berufsorientierte Gymnasien|berufsorientierte Gymnasien]]'') offer vocational subjects such as [[pedagogy]], [[business informatics]], [[biotechnology]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

Final exams are usually taken from March to May or June. Each written basic-level examination takes about three hours; advanced-level examinations take four-and-a-half hours, and written exams are in essay format. Oral examinations last about 20 min. Papers are graded by at least two teachers at the school. In some parts of Germany students may prepare a presentation, research paper or participate in a competition, and may take additional oral exams to pass the ''Abitur'' if the written exam is poor.

Before [[German reunification|reunification]],  ''Abitur'' exams were given locally in [[West Germany]], but Bavaria has conducted centralized exams (''[[:de:Zentralabitur|Zentralabitur]]'') since 1854. After reunification, most states of the former [[East Germany]] continued centralized exams, and at the beginning of the 21st century, many states adopted centralized exams. In 2013, all other states except [[Rheinland-Pfalz]] also introduced centralized written exams at least in the core subjects (German, mathematics and the first foreign language, usually English). The exams are structured as follows:
* German: Choose 1 out of 3 tasks. Topics are usually [[lyric poetry]], [[German literature#18th century|classic and contemporary literature]] or linguistics (history and changes to the language). Each task is usually divided into two or three parts.
* English: Choose 1 out of 3 tasks. Topics may vary but are usually connected to personal identity and [[multiculturalism]], [[science]] and [[technology]] or environmental change and [[globalization]] (politics, economy and culture). Classical literature is rarely taught, and students primarily deal with literature of the last century. Each task consists of three parts: comprehension (summary), analysis and interpretation and commentary and discussion.
* Mathematics: Choose three of six tasks, one in each area: [[calculus|differential and integral calculus]], [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]] and [[probability theory]]. Each task is usually split into five or six smaller tasks.

The ''[[Kultusministerkonferenz]]'' (KMK) of several states expanded the exams to scientific subjects and the social sciences. The physics and chemistry exams include an experiment that must be performed and analyzed.

===Scoring===
Each semester of a subject studied in the final two years yields [[Academic grading in Germany#Details of the German system|up to 15 points]] for a student, where advanced courses count double. The final examinations each count quadruple.

The exact scoring system depends on the Bundesland, in which one takes Abitur. Passing the ''Abitur'' usually requires a composite score of at least 50%. Students with a score below that minimum fail and do not receive an ''Abitur''. There are some other conditions that the student also has to meet in order to receive the ''Abitur'': taking mandatory courses in selected subject areas, and limits to the number of failing grades in core subjects. Finally, students often have the option of omitting some courses from their composite score if they have taken more courses than the minimum required.

The best possible grade of 1.0 can be achieved if the score ranges between 823 and 900 points; the fraction of students achieving this score is normally only around 0.2%–3%<ref>German: [http://www.gew.de/Binaries/Binary29531/9graf-abinote%20sehr%20gut%20bul%c3%a42005.pdf Abiturnoten-Ländervergleich 2005 – Abiturnote "sehr gut" in den Bundesländern 2005]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002094058/http://www.gew.de/Binaries/Binary29531/9graf-abinote%20sehr%20gut%20bul%C3%A42005.pdf |date=2 October 2011 }}, Gewerkschaft Erziehung und Wissenschaft, 15 August 2007</ref> even among the already selective population of ''Abitur'' candidates.

===Statistics===
Historically, very few people received their ''Abitur'' in Germany because many attractive jobs did not require one. The number of persons holding the ''Abitur'' has steadily increased since the 1970s, and younger jobholders are more likely to hold the ''Abitur'' than older ones. The percentage of students qualified for tertiary education is still lower than the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] average.

== The International Abitur ==
The International Abitur is offered at schools outside Germany that are accredited by the German Government. The five Abitur exams (three written exams and two oral exams) are in the following subjects: German Literature, European History or Economics or Math or a Natural Science or a language. In February of senior year (grade 12), all students take the written examinations for the German International Abitur in three subjects including German. In late spring, students have mandatory oral examinations in two subjects, which are overseen by a German educational official. The final GPA includes grades from both junior and senior years, as well as for the five Abitur exams. The final diploma that students receive after successful completion of these exams allows them to qualify for admission to Universities in Germany.
