"'''Only Girl (In the World)'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] from her fifth album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). The album's lead single, it was released on September 10, 2010. [[Crystal Nicole|Crystal Johnson]] wrote the song in collaboration with producers [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]]. Rihanna contacted Stargate before ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s production and asked them to create lively, uptempo music. "Only Girl (In the World)" was the first song composed for the album, and the singer decided to include it on the track list before she recorded her vocals. Backed by strong [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[synthesizer]], it is a [[dance-pop]] song that has an electronic composition. In its lyrics, Rihanna demands physical attention from her lover.

Critical response to "Only Girl (In the World)" was positive; a number of critics praised its composition and Rihanna's decision to move away from the dark themes of her previous album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009). The song reached number one on the United States' [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart two weeks after ''Loud''<nowiki/>'s second single, "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]", peaked at number one. It was the first time in the chart's history that an album's lead single reached number one after its second single. In the United Kingdom the song spent two weeks at number one and is the 19th-bestselling single of all time by a female artist, with over a million copies sold. The song peaked at number one in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland, and reached the top five in France, Germany and Switzerland.

Rihanna performed "Only Girl (In the World)" on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States, ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the United Kingdom and a shortened version at the [[2011 Brit Awards|31st Brit Awards]]. [[Anthony Mandler]] directed the song's music video, in which Rihanna is alone in an open natural landscape. The video suggests that she is the only female in the world, echoing the song's title and lyrics, and critics praised its bright, colorful theme. "Only Girl (In the World)" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording]] at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2011.
