'''''The Village Voice''''' was an American news and culture paper, known for being the country's first [[alternative newspaper|alternative]] [[newsweekly]]. Founded in 1955 by Dan Wolf, Ed Fancher, [[John Wilcock]], and [[Norman Mailer]], the ''Voice'' began as a platform for the creative community of [[New York City]]. While it ceased publication in 2017 and stopped generating online content in 2018, its archives are still accessible online.

Over its 63 years of publication, ''The Village Voice'' received three [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, the [[National Press Foundation]] Award, and the [[George Polk Award]]. ''The Village Voice'' hosted a variety of writers and artists, including writer [[Ezra Pound]], cartoonist [[Lynda Barry]], and film critics [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Jonas Mekas]] and [[J. Hoberman]].

In October 2015, ''The Village Voice'' changed ownership and severed all ties with former parent company Voice Media Group (VMG).<ref>Joe Pompeo, [http://www.politico.com/media/story/2015/10/village-voice-sold-to-new-owner-004344 "Village Voice sold to new owner,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801194902/http://www.politico.com/media/story/2015/10/village-voice-sold-to-new-owner-004344 |date=August 1, 2017}} Politico, October 12, 2015.</ref> The ''Voice'' announced on August 22, 2017, that it would cease publication of its print edition and convert to a fully digital venture, on a date to be announced.<ref name="jleland">[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]] and Sarah Maslin Nir, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/nyregion/village-voice-to-end-print-publication.html?mcubz=1 "After 62 Years and Many Battles, Village Voice Will End Print Publication,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823215238/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/nyregion/village-voice-to-end-print-publication.html?mcubz=1 |date=August 23, 2017}} ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 22, 2017.</ref> The final printed edition, featuring a 1965 photo of [[Bob Dylan]] on the cover, was distributed on September 21, 2017.<ref name="guardian-21sep2017">{{cite news |last1=Helmore |first1=Edward |title=The Village Voice prints its final edition – with Bob Dylan on the cover |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/21/village-voice-final-edition-new-york-bob-dylan |access-date=September 21, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 21, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922013933/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/sep/21/village-voice-final-edition-new-york-bob-dylan |archive-date=September 22, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>  After halting print publication in 2017, the ''Voice'' provided daily coverage through its website until August 31, 2018, when it announced it was ceasing production of new editorial content.<ref name="Pager">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/business/media/the-village-voice-closes.html |title=The Village Voice, a New York Icon, Closes |last1=Pager |first1=Tyler |date=August 31, 2018 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 5, 2018 |last2=Peiser |first2=Jaclyn}}</ref> The ''Voice'' continues to have an active website, which features archival material related to current events.

===Early history===
[[File:1955 October cover The Village Voice.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Cover of the October 1955 issue]]
The ''Village Voice'' was launched by Ed Fancher, Dan Wolf, and [[Norman Mailer]]<ref name=nyt-wolf-obit>Lawrence van Gelder, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DF1E39F931A25757C0A960958260 Dan Wolf, 80, a Village Voice Founder, Dies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214075340/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4DF1E39F931A25757C0A960958260 |date=February 14, 2009}}, ''The New York Times'', April 12, 1996.

In 1960, it moved from 22 Greenwich Avenue to 61 [[Christopher Street]] in a landmark triangular corner building adjoining Sheridan Square, and a few feet west of the [[Stonewall Inn]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/10/13/the-voice-makes-a-move-in-1960/ |title=The Voice Makes a Move in 1960 |website=villagevoice.com |access-date=April 27, 2018 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164357/https://www.villagevoice.com/2008/10/13/the-voice-makes-a-move-in-1960/ |archive-date=March 1, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> then, from the 1970s through 1980, at 11th Street and University Place; and then Broadway and 13th Street.

Early columnists of the 1950s and 1960s included [[Jonas Mekas]], who explored the underground film movement in his "Film Journal" column; [[Linda Solomon]], who reviewed the Village club scene in the "Riffs" column; and [[Sam Julty]], who wrote a popular column on car ownership and maintenance. John Wilcock wrote a column every week for the paper's first ten years. Another regular from that period was the cartoonist [[Kin Platt]], who did weekly theatrical caricatures. Other prominent regulars have included [[Peter Schjeldahl]], [[Ellen Willis]], [[Jill Johnston]], Tom Carson, and [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]].

For more than 40 years, [[Wayne Barrett]] was the newspaper's [[muckraker]], covering New York [[Real estate development|real estate developers]] and politicians, including [[Donald Trump]]. The material continued to be a valuable resource for reporters covering the Trump presidency.<ref name="Pager" />

The ''Voice'' has published investigations of New York City politics, as well as reporting on national politics, with arts, culture, music, dance, film, and theater reviews. Writers and cartoonists for the ''Voice'' have received three [[Pulitzer Prize]]s: in 1981 ([[Teresa Carpenter]], for feature writing),<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/cgi-bin/year.pl?1409,27 The Pulitzer Prize Winners, 1981] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223410/http://www.pulitzer.org/cgi-bin/year.pl?1409,27 |date=March 3, 2016}}, official Pulitzer Prize site.

In 1999, film critic [[J. Hoberman]] and film section editor Dennis Lim began a similar [[Village Voice Film Poll]] for the year in film. In 2001, the ''Voice'' sponsored its first music festival, Siren Festival, a free annual event every summer held at [[Coney Island]]. The event moved to the lower tip of Manhattan in 2011, and was re-christened the "[[4knots]] Music Festival", a reference to the speed of the East River's current.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Maura |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/04/4knots_music_festival_announcement_july_16_2011.php |title=Maura Johnston, "Announcing The 4Knots Music Festival, Taking Place This July 16", The Village Voice Blogs, April 14, 2011 |publisher=Blogs.villagevoice.com |date=2011-04-14 |access-date=2013-11-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231805/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/04/4knots_music_festival_announcement_july_16_2011.php |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During the 1980s and onward, the ''Voice'' was known for its staunch support for [[gay rights]], and it published an annual [[Gay Pride]] issue every June. However, early in its history, the newspaper had a reputation as having a [[homophobia|homophobic]] slant. While reporting on the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, the newspaper referred to the riots as "The Great Faggot Rebellion".<ref>{{cite web |first1=Walter Troy|last1=Spencer |title=Too Much My Dear |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&dat=19690710&id=u-wjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1707,293555&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |date=July 10, 1969|access-date=18 August 2015|via=[[Google News]]}}</ref> Two reporters, Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott IV, both used the words "[[faggot (slang)|faggot]]" and "[[dyke (slang)|dyke]]" in their articles about the riots. (These words were not commonly used by homosexuals to refer to each other at this time.) Smith and Truscott retrieved their press cards from the ''Voice'' offices, which were very close to the bar, as the trouble began; they were among the first journalists to record the event, Smith being trapped inside the bar with the police, and Truscott reporting from the street.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/06/24/stonewall-at-40-the-voice-articles-that-sparked-a-final-night-of-rioting/ |title=Stonewall at 40: The Voice Articles That Sparked a Final Night of Rioting |website=villagevoice.com |access-date=April 27, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424034403/https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/06/24/stonewall-at-40-the-voice-articles-that-sparked-a-final-night-of-rioting/ |archive-date=April 24, 2018 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> After the riot, the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) attempted to promote dances for gays and lesbians in the ''Voice'', but were not allowed to use the words "gay" or "homosexual", which the newspaper considered derogatory. The newspaper changed its policy after the GLF petitioned it to do so.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Carter|title=Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked The Gay Revolution|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0312671938|page=226}}</ref> Over time, the ''Voice'' changed its stance, and, in 1982, became the second organization in the US known to have extended [[domestic partner]] benefits. Jeff Weinstein, an employee of the paper and shop steward for the publishing local of District 65 UAW, negotiated and won agreement in the union contract to extend health, life insurance, and disability benefits to the "spouse equivalents" of its union members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturevulture.net/ArthurLazere-Journalist/Journalism-OntheJob/DomesticPartners.htm |title=DomesticPartners |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=February 12, 2009 |access-date=June 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212223047/http://www.culturevulture.net/ArthurLazere-Journalist/Journalism-OntheJob/DomesticPartners.htm |archive-date=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

The ''Voice''{{-'}}s competitors in New York City include ''[[New York Observer]]'' and ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]''. Seventeen alternative weeklies around the United States are owned by the ''Voice's'' former parent company [[Village Voice Media]]. The film section writers and editors also produced a weekly Voice Film Club podcast.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/voice-film-club/id686641853?mt=2 |title=iTunes - Podcasts - Voice Film Club by The Village Voice |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |access-date=2015-06-25 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626113431/https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/voice-film-club/id686641853?mt=2 |archive-date=June 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>   

In 1996, after decades of carrying a cover price, the ''Voice'' switched from a paid [[weekly newspaper|weekly]] to a free, [[alternative newspaper|alternative]] weekly.

In 2005, the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] alternative weekly chain [[New Times Media]] purchased the company and took the Village Voice Media name. Previous owners of ''The Village Voice'' or of Village Voice Media have included co-founders Fancher<ref>{{cite web|title=Edwin Fancher Oral History - On founding the Voice|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/resources/oral_his.htm#EF|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|access-date=1 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627040922/http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/resources/oral_his.htm#EF|archive-date=June 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Wolf,<ref name=nyt-wolf-obit/> New York City Councilman [[Carter Burden]],<ref name=nyt-wolf-obit/> ''New York Magazine'' founder [[Clay Felker]], [[Rupert Murdoch]], and [[Leonard N.

===Acquisition by New Times Media===
After ''The Village Voice'' was acquired by [[New Times Media]] in 2005, the publication's key personnel changed. The ''Voice'' was then managed by two journalists from [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

In April 2006, the ''Voice'' dismissed music editor [[Chuck Eddy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/arts/music/30idol.html |title=Idolator and Pazz & Jop Polls - Report |last=Sisario |first=Ben |date=November 30, 2006 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-09-02 |language=en}}</ref> Four months later, the newspaper sacked longtime music critic [[Robert Christgau]]. In January 2007, the newspaper fired sex columnist and erotica author [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]]; long-term creative director [[Ted Keller]], art director Minh Oung, fashion columnist [[Lynn Yaeger]] and Deputy Art Director [[LD Beghtol]] were laid off or fired soon afterward. [[Editor in chief]] [[Donald Forst]] resigned in December 2005. Doug Simmons, his replacement, was sacked in March 2006 after it was discovered that a reporter had fabricated portions of an article. Simmons' successor, [[Erik Wemple]], resigned after two weeks. His replacement, [[David Blum]], was fired in March 2007. [[Tony Ortega (journalist)|Tony Ortega]] then held the position of editor in chief from 2007 to 2012.

The sacking of [[Nat Hentoff]], who worked for the paper from 1958 to 2008, led to further criticism of the management by some of its current writers, Hentoff himself, and by the ''Voice''{{-'}}s ideological rival paper ''[[National Review]]'', which referred to Hentoff as a "treasure".<ref name=lay>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31voice.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss Village Voice Lays Off Nat Hentoff and 2 Others] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116153645/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31voice.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss |date=January 16, 2017}}".

===Voice Media Group===
Village Voice Media executives Scott Tobias, Christine Brennan and Jeff Mars bought Village Voice Media's papers and associated web properties from its founders in September 2012, and formed the Denver-based [[Voice Media Group]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Village Voice Media Execs Acquire The Company’s Famed Alt Weeklies, Form New Holding Company |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/voice-media-group-acquisition/ |publisher=Tech Crunch |access-date=September 27, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926195112/http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/23/voice-media-group-acquisition/ |archive-date=September 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In May 2013, ''The Village Voice'' editor Will Bourne and deputy editor Jessica Lustig told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that they were quitting the paper rather than executing further staff layoffs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/business/media/top-editors-abruptly-leave-village-voice.html?_r=0 |title=Top Editors Abruptly Leave Village Voice Over Staff Cuts |last=Carr |first=David |date=10 May 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=May 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608004216/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/business/media/top-editors-abruptly-leave-village-voice.html?_r=0 |archive-date=June 8, 2013 |url-status=live |author-link=David Carr (journalist) |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Both had been recent appointments. By then, the ''Voice'' had employed five editors since 2005.

== Backpage sex trafficking ==
{{Main|Backpage}}

[[Backpage]], a classified advertisement website owned by the same parent company as ''The Village Voice'', was used as a hub for sex trafficking of both adults and minors. In 2012, [[Nicholas Kristof]] wrote an article in ''The New York Times'' detailing a young woman's account of being sold on Backpage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kristof |first1=Nick |title=Where Pimps Peddle Their Goods |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/kristof-where-pimps-peddle-their-goods.html |access-date=18 May 2019 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2012-03-17}}</ref> ''The Village Voice'' released an article entitled "What Nick Kristof Got Wrong" accusing Kristof of fabricating the story and ignoring journalistic standards.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2012-03-21/news/kristof/ |title=What Nick Kristof Got Wrong: Village Voice Media Responds |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115082042/https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/03/21/what-nick-kristof-got-wrong-village-voice-media-responds/ |archive-date=2017-11-15 |access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> Kristof responded, noting that the ''Voice'' did not dispute the column, but rather tried to show how the timeline in Kristof's original piece was inaccurate. In this rebuttal, he not only justified his original timeline, but expressed sadness "to see Village Voice Media become a major player in sex trafficking, and to see it use its journalists as attack dogs for those who threaten its corporate interests", noting another instance of ''The Village Voice'' attacking journalists reporting on Backpage's role in sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kristof |first1=Nick |title=Responding to Village Voice on Sex Trafficking [Opinion] |url=https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/responding-to-village-voice-on-sex-trafficking/ |website=The New York Times |access-date=18 May 2019 |date=2012-03-21}}</ref>

After repeated calls for a boycott of ''The Village Voice'', the company was sold to Voice Media Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/19/boycott-village-voice-senators-push-for-action-on-backpage-com |title=Boycott Village Voice?
