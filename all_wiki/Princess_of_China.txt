"'''Princess of China'''" is a duet recorded by British [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Coldplay]] and [[Barbados|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]] for Coldplay's fifth studio album ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]''. The song was written by band members [[Guy Berryman]], [[Jonny Buckland]], [[Will Champion]], and [[Chris Martin]], along with [[Brian Eno]], and is influenced by the music genres of [[electronic rock]], [[electropop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The song was released as the fourth single from ''[[Mylo Xyloto]]'' and was sent to US [[Mainstream]] radio on 14 February 2012. It was later released as a digital download on 13 April 2012. A companion EP to the single, featuring an acoustic version of the song, was released on 1 June 2012.

"Princess of China" was met with a generally mixed response from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with some praising the collaboration between Martin and Rihanna, though others criticized it for being generic and uninspiring. The song performed well on international charts around the world. The song peaked at number 20 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It has also reached the top ten of the Australian and New Zealand charts and five other international charts.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by Adria Petty and Alan Bibby, was filmed in March 2012 in Los Angeles and released on 2 June 2012. The video depicts a complicated love story of Rihanna and Chris Martin, scenes of which include a sword fight and Rihanna imitating a multi-armed goddess. The video was met with positive reviews, with critics praising the Asian theme of the video. The song was performed live on the [[54th Grammy Awards]] held at [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].

It has boy and girl lead characters and top of our list for the girl part was Rihanna, but it took a while to pluck up the courage to ask her. We did a show in Las Vegas and I met her and said, 'Do you think there's any chance?'

The song was mixed by Mark Spike Stent, Rik Simpson, Daniel Green and Michael Brauer.<ref name="Notes"/> In an interview with [[MTV News]] Martin confirmed that the "Princess of China" is the band's favourite song on the album because of how it differs from their previous efforts in terms of genre and musical direction.<ref name="MTVTease"/> When asked if fans would unite and react favourably to the song, Martin expressed that he was not concerned with how it would be received, and noted that Rihanna is always pushing the boundaries of the music industry.<ref name="Metro1">{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Ann|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/876022-chris-martin-rihanna-duet-princess-of-china-is-best-bit-of-mylo-xyloto|title=Chris Martin: Rihanna duet Princess of China is best bit of Mylo Xyloto|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]]|date=2011-09-20|accessdate=2011-09-21}}</ref>

"Princess of China" premiered on Dutch radio on 16 October 2011 and was later uploaded to the band's official [[VEVO]] account on [[YouTube]], but it was removed by their record label, [[EMI]].<ref name="Metro2"/> The song was made available to purchase via [[Music download|digital download]] on 25 October 2011.<ref name="iTunesUS1">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/princess-of-china/id471339278?i=471339674|title=Mylo Xylto|publisher=[[iTunes Store]].

==Critical reception==
"Princess of China" received mixed reviews from music critics. A reviewer for ''[[NME]]'' commented that "Princess of China" is an attempt to sound as pop-oriented as possible and compared the effort to one of Coldplay's previous singles, "[[Viva la Vida]]", writing "Well, if you can get beyond the outrageously chart-hungry intro – that glossy synth sound wouldn't sound out of place on a [[Taio Cruz]] album – it's actually kind of awesome. For all the poppy surface sheen, this is a song with surprisingly hefty balls, possessed of a pounding momentum that recalls 'Viva La Vida{{'}}."<ref name="NME1"/> Josh Eells said, in his review of the album for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', that "Princess of China" is a ballad about loss and regret, co-starring Rihanna. It's a partnership that probably came together over champagne brunch at [[Jay-Z]]'s, but its synth-fuzz groove is offhandedly seductive."<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Josh Eells |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/mylo-xyloto-20111017 |title=Mylo Xyloto &#124; Album Reviews |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>
