==Investigative journalism career==
[[File:Amy Goodman.jpg|thumb|Goodman speaking at Power to the Peaceful Festival, San Francisco, 2004]]
In 1991, covering the [[History of East Timor|East Timor independence movement]], Goodman and fellow journalist [[Allan Nairn]] reported that they were badly beaten by [[Indonesian soldiers]] after witnessing a [[Mass murder|mass killing]] of Timorese demonstrators: what became known as the [[Santa Cruz Massacre]].<ref>[https://www.democracynow.org/1997/11/12/massacre_the_story_of_east_timor "Massacre: The Story of East Timor"], ''Democracy Now!'', November 12, 1997. Retrieved January 14, 2018.</ref>

In 1998, Goodman and journalist [[Jeremy Scahill]] (later a founding editor of ''[[The Intercept]]'', along with [[Glenn Greenwald]] and [[Laura Poitras]]) documented [[Chevron Corporation]]'s role in a confrontation between the [[Nigerian Army]] and villagers who had seized oil rigs and other equipment belonging to oil corporations. Two villagers were shot and killed during the standoff.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/11/1517242 "Drilling and Killing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805105701/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F07%2F11%2F1517242 |date=August 5, 2004 }}: As President Bush Meets with the CEO of Chevron Texaco in Nigeria, a Look at Chevron’s Role in the Killing of Two Nigerian Villagers", ''Democracy Now!'', July 11, 2003.

Chevron Corp.|Parabe]] oil platform, which had been occupied by villagers who accused the company of contaminating their land. Soon after landing, the Nigerian military shot and killed two of the protesters, Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu, and wounded 11 others. Chevron spokesperson Sola Omole acknowledged that the company transported the troops. Omole said that Chevron management had requested troops from the government to protect their facility. The documentary made by Goodman and her colleagues, ''[[Drilling and Killing: Chevron and Nigeria's Oil Dictatorship]]'', won the [[George Polk Award]] in 1998.

Michael Delli Carpini, dean of the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]], said of Goodman: "She's not an editorialist. She sticks to the facts... She provides points of view that make you think, and she comes at it by saying: 'Who are we not hearing from in the traditional media?'"<ref>Tanya Barrientos,  [http://www.democracynow.org/about/in_the_news/Inquirer "She’s taking the watchdog to task"], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', (May 13, 2004).</ref>

===''Democracy Now!''===
{{Main|Democracy Now!}}

Goodman had been news director of [[Pacifica Radio]] station [[WBAI]] in New York City for more than a decade when she co-founded ''Democracy Now! The War and Peace Report'' in 1996. Since then, ''Democracy Now!'' has been described as "probably the most significant progressive news institution that has come around in some time" by professor and media critic [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]].<ref name="thenation.com">{{cite journal |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050523/ratner |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209131047/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050523/ratner |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 9, 2012 |title=Amy Goodman's 'Empire' |last=Ratner |first=Lizzy |journal=The Nation |date=May 23, 2005}}</ref>

In 2001, the show was temporarily pulled off the air, as a result of a conflict between some Pacifica Radio board members and staff members and listeners over the direction of the station. During that time, it moved to a converted firehouse, from which it broadcast from January 2002 for nearly eight years, until November 13, 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Block|first=Jennifer|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2002/01/15/a-dose-of-democracy-now/|website=The Village Voice|title=A Dose of Democracy, Now: WBAI Listeners Get Their Station Back|date=January 15, 2002|access-date=May 21, 2018}}</ref> ''Democracy Now!'' subsequently moved to a studio located in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.<ref>[http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2009/11/page/2/ Andy Worthington Archive for November 2009].
