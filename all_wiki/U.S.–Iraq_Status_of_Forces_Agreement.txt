The '''U.S.â€“Iraq Status of Forces Agreement''' (official name: '''Agreement Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq''') was a [[status of forces agreement]] (SOFA) between Iraq and the United States, signed by President [[George W. Bush]] in 2008. It established that U.S. combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and all U.S. combat forces will be completely out of Iraq by December 31, 2011.<ref name="sofatext" /> The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that were not related to combat.<ref name="sofatext"/> U.S. contractors working for U.S. forces would have been subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies would retain their immunity. If U.S. forces committed still undecided "major premeditated felonies" while off-duty and off-base, they would have been subjected to an undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.-Iraq committee if the U.S. certified the forces were off-duty.<ref name=Juris><blockquote>On the other hand, Iraq had primary legal jurisdiction over off-duty soldiers and civilians who committed "major and premeditated crimes" outside of U.S. installations. These major crimes would have needed to be defined by a joint committee and the United States retained the right to determine whether or not its personnel were on- or off-duty. Iraq also maintained primary legal jurisdiction over contractors (and their employees) that had contracts with the United States.</blockquote>[http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/iraq/articles/112408_how_comfortable_iraq_sofa/ ''Arms Control Center'': How Comfortable is the U.S.-Iraq SOFA?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128062748/http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/iraq/articles/112408_how_comfortable_iraq_sofa/ |date=2015-01-28 }}</ref><ref name=JMOCC><blockquote>Committees assigned to deal with U.S.-led combat operations and jurisdiction over U.S. military personnel were among those that have not met even as Iraq moved toward sovereignty, U.S. Army Gen.

==Negotiations==
American-led [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]] participating in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were initially subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of their parent states. After the handover of [[Sovereignty|sovereign power]] to an [[Government of Iraq from 2006|Iraqi administration]], [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]] in Iraq were nominally subject to Iraqi jurisdiction, and operated without any Status of Forces Agreement.<ref>{{cite web

==Approval process==

===Approval by Iraqi Cabinet===
On November 16, 2008, Iraq's Cabinet approved the agreement, which cited the end of 2009 for the pull out of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities, and 2011 as the fixed deadline for removal of U.S. military presence in country. U.S. concessions involved a ban on U.S. forces searching and raiding homes without Iraqi approval, the right of Iraqis to search shipments of weapons and packages entering the country for U.S. recipients, and the right of Iraq's justice system to prosecute American troops for serious crimes under some circumstances. The vote was passed by 27 of the 37-member cabinet, of which nine members were absent and one opposing. The agreement then went before Parliament.<ref>{{cite news

Some anonymous U.S. officials and specialists who follow the war have argued they believe that parts of the agreement may be circumvented and that other parts may be open to interpretation, including: the parts giving Iraqi legal jurisdiction over United States soldiers who commit crimes off base and off duty, the part requiring for US troops to obtain Iraqi permission for all military operations, and the part banning the United States from staging attacks on other countries from Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&id=37963&heading=Middle%20East|title=''OmanTribune'': Key parts of US-Iraq pact could be lost in translation|website=Omantribune.com|accessdate=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404151259/http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&id=37963&heading=Middle%20East|archive-date=4 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, administration officials have argued that Iraqi prosecution of U.S. soldiers could take three years, by which time the U.S. will have withdrawn from Iraq under the terms of the agreement.

In a letter to U.S. military personnel about new rules of engagement, Gen. [[Raymond T.

When asked by Charlie Rose in a PBS interview how big the American "residual" force would be in Iraq after 2011, Secretary of Defense Gates replied that although the mission would change, "my guess is that you're looking at perhaps several tens of thousands of American troops".<ref name=GatesResidual>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/washington/22combat.html|title=With Pullout Deadlines Comes Effort to Redefine Role of U.S. Military in Iraq|first=Elisabeth|last=Bumiller|date=21 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

After the deal passed, over 9,000 Iraqis gathered to protest in Baghdad's eastern suburb of [[Sadr City]]. Protesters burned a U.S. flag and held banners reading: "No, no to the agreement".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iranvnc.com/|title=Loading..|website=iranvnc.com|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> "We condemn the agreement and we reject it, just as we condemn all injustice", Sheikh Hassan al-Husseini told worshippers right after the vote at the weekly Friday prayers in Baghdad.

On December 3, 2008, about 2,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria staged a protest against the Iraqâ€“U.S. military pact saying that the agreement would place Iraq under US domination.

===International===
Most foreign troops which were part of the force in Iraq were scheduled to leave by December 31, 2008, with forces from [[Azerbaijan]],<ref name=Pullout /> Poland,<ref name=Pullout /> [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]],<ref name=Pullout /> Japan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24766416-12377,00.html|title=Japan ends Iraq mission|website=Theaustralian.news.com.au|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> [[Bosnia]],<ref name=Pullout /> [[South Korea]],<ref name=Pullout /> and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]<ref name=Pullout /> leaving. The Iraqi and British governments were negotiating a security agreement reportedly similar to the Iraq-U.S. status of forces agreement. The possibly-informal pact expected the role of British troops to be minimal by the end of 2009. With the British and American military, a small force from two or three other countries was expected to remain.<ref name=Pullout>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/world/middleeast/06iraq.html|title=Troop Pullout to Leave U.S. and Britain as Iraq Force|first=Alissa J.|last=Rubin|date=5 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

Before the pact's approval by the Iraqi parliament, senior Iranian lawmaker [[Kazem Jalali]] said: "The Iraqi Parliament should take the interests of the people of Iraq into consideration and make the right decision, worthy of its nation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=76581&sectionid=351020101|title=''Press TV'': Iran advises Iraq on US security deal |website=Presstv.ir|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> Iranian judiciary chief [[Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi]] said, "The Iraqi government has done very well regarding this (security pact)".<ref>"[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-11-17-iran-pact_N.htm Iran's judiciary chief lauds U.S.-Iraqi pact]", ''USA Today''.</ref>

According to Syrian officials and academics, the pact posed a risk to Syria's security. "The American presence in Iraq, whether permanent or temporary, threatens Syrian security", said Syrian vice-president Farouq al-Shara. President Bashar al-Assad said that the deal would turn "Iraq into a launch pad for attacking its neighbours instead of supporting them". "The continued US presence in the region, with what Newsweek magazine says is the largest embassy in the world [in Baghdad], means ... it will interfere in all of the region's affairs", said  Syrian political analyst Jasim Zakariya. Syria alleged that the United States carried out an air strike in September 2008 on a Syrian village, killing eight civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/syria/?id=29182|title=Syria sees Iraq-US pact as threat|website=Middle-east-online.com|accessdate=7 January 2019}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Role of Contractors under SOFA==
U.S. contractors working for U.S. forces will be subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies may retain their immunity. "The immunity question, the largest question being talked about, is not addressed in the ... agreement", said Alan Chvotkin, who works on behalf of contractors, including Moyock, N.C.-based Blackwater Worldwide. Chvotkin said he believed Blackwater's guards still have immunity under Decree 17 issued by L.&nbsp;Paul Bremer. Blackwater currently has no license to work in Iraq.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/23/AR2008122301586.html] {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref>

==December 14, 2008 press conference==
{{main|Muntadhar al Zaidi#Shoe incident}}
On December 14, 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the security pact with Iraq. In his fourth and final trip to Iraq, the president appeared with Iraq's prime minister and said more work is to be done.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2008-12-14-bush-iraq_N.htm|title=Bush signs security deal in Iraq - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> During the press conference discussing the signing of the pact<ref>{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html|title=President Bush and Iraq Prime Minister Maliki Sign the Strategic Framework Agreement and Security Agreement|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in his palace in the heavily fortified Green Zone, President Bush dodged two shoes thrown at him from the audience. The man who threw his shoes, [[Muntadhar al-Zaidi]], an Iraqi journalist with Egypt-based [[al-Baghdadia]] television network, could be heard yelling in Arabic: "This is a farewell ... you dog!" as he threw his first shoe, and when throwing his second shoe al-Zaidi could be heard yelling: "This is for the widows, the orphans and those who were killed in Iraq!"<ref name=NYTShoe>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/world/middleeast/15prexy.html?hp Touting New Security Deal, Bush Makes Final Iraq Visit]", ''New York Times'', 15 December 2008.</ref> While pinned on the ground by security personnel, he screamed: "You killed the Iraqis!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/12/14/bush.iraq/index.html|title=Iraqi journalist throws shoes at Bush in Baghdad|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> As the man's screaming could be heard outside, Bush said "That's what people do in a free society, draw attention to themselves."

==SOFA negotiations==
Negotiations between the U.S. and Iraq for a new SOFA began in fall 2010. There were late-night meetings at the fortified compound of then Iraqi president, [[Jalal Talabani]], and in video conferences between Baghdad and Washington. In June 2011, diplomats and Iraqi officials said that President Obama had told Prime Minister Maliki that he was prepared to leave up to 10,000 soldiers to continue training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). Mr. Maliki agreed, but said he needed time to line up political allies. Eventually, he gained authorization to continue talks with the U.S. on keeping troops in Iraq.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/world/middleeast/united-states-and-iraq-had-not-expected-troops-would-have-to-leave.html|title=U.S. and Iraq Had Not Expected Troops Would Have to Leave|first1=Tim|last1=Arango|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=7 January 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> The Iraqi parliament returned from a recess in late November 2011 (shortly before the year-end withdrawal date) because of a concern that remaining U.S. troops would not be granted immunity by Iraqi courts. American field commanders were concerned about the [[Sadrist Movement|Sadrist]] response if the troops remained and about Iraqi readiness for a transfer of power.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/15/iraq-withdrawal-us-troops_n_1012661.html |work=[[Huff Post]] |title=Iraq Withdrawal: U.S. Abandoning Plans To Keep Troops In Country |date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>

In August 2011, after debates between the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, the U.S. settled on the 3,000 to 5,000 troop number. An American official said intelligence assessments stated that Iraq was not at great risk of slipping into chaos in the absence of American forces, which was a factor in the decision.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

In October 2011, American officials pressed Iraqi leadership to meet again at President Talabani's compound to discuss the issue. This time the U.S. asked Iraq to take a stand on the question of immunity for troops, hoping to remove what had always been the biggest challenge. However, they misread Iraqi politics and the Iraqi public. Having watched the Arab Spring sweep across the region and still haunted by the traumas of this and previous wars, the Iraqis were unwilling to accept anything that infringed on their sovereignty.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

Iraqi leadership picked up on that sentiment quickly. As a result, they publicly said they would not support legal immunity for any American troops. Some American officials have privately said that pushing for that meetingâ€”in essence forcing the Iraqis to take a public stand on such a controversial matter before working out the politics of presenting it to their constituents and to Parliamentâ€”was a severe tactical mistake that ended any possibility of keeping American troops past December 2011.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

After the pull out was announced, White House aides said the U.S. would keep its embassy in Baghdad and two consulates. They also said there will be about 4,000â€“5,000 defense contractors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/21/iraq-rejects-us-plea-bases|title=Iraq rejects US request to maintain bases after troop withdrawal|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=7 January 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>
