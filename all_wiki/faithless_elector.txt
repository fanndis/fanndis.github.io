In the [[United States Electoral College]], a '''faithless elector''' is an elector who does not vote for the candidates for [[U.S. President]] and [[U.S. Vice President]] for whom the elector had pledged to vote and instead votes for another person for one or both offices or abstains from voting. As part of [[United States presidential election]]s, each [[U.S. state|state]] selects the method by which its electors are to be selected, which in modern times has been exclusively based on a popular vote in each state, and generally requires its electors to have pledged to vote for the candidates of their party if appointed. A pledged elector is only considered a faithless elector by breaking their pledge; [[unpledged elector]]s have no pledge to break. The consequences of an elector voting in a way inconsistent with their pledge vary from state to state.

Electors are typically chosen and [[nomination|nominated]] by a political party or the party's [[presidential nominee]], and are usually party members with a reputation for high loyalty to the party and its chosen candidate. Thus, a faithless elector runs the risk of party censure and political retaliation from their party, as well as potential legal penalties in some states. Candidates for electors are nominated by state political parties in the months prior to [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. In some states, such as Indiana, the electors are nominated in [[primary election|primaries]], the same way other candidates are nominated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/electors.html#selection |title=About the Electors|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration}}</ref> In other states, such as [[Oklahoma]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], electors are nominated in party conventions. In [[Pennsylvania]], the campaign committee of each candidate names their candidates for elector (an attempt to discourage faithless electors). In some states, high-ranking and/or well-known state officials up to and including [[Governor (United States)|governors]] often serve as electors whenever possible (the Constitution prohibits federal officials from acting as electors, but does not restrict state officials from doing so). The parties have generally been successful in keeping their electors faithful, leaving out the rare cases in which a candidate died before the elector was able to cast a vote.

There have been a total of 165<ref name="FairVote">{{cite web |title=Faithless Electors |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_electors |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref> instances of faithlessness {{asof|2016|lc=y}}, 63 of which occurred in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] when [[Horace Greeley]] died after Election Day but before the Electoral College convened. Nearly all have voted for third party candidates or non-candidates, as opposed to switching their support to a major opposing candidate. During the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 election]], Virginia's entire 23-man electoral delegation faithlessly abstained<ref name="SabatoErnst2014"/> from voting for victorious [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] vice presidential nominee [[Richard Mentor Johnson#Election of 1836|Richard M. Johnson]].<ref name="FairVote"/> The loss of Virginia's support caused Johnson to fall one electoral vote short of a majority, causing the vice-presidential election to be thrown into the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] for the only time in American history. The presidential election itself was not in dispute because Virginia's electors voted for Democratic presidential nominee [[Martin Van Buren]] as pledged. The U.S. Senate ultimately elected Johnson as vice president after a [[party-line vote]].

The [[United States Constitution]] does not specify a notion of ''pledging''; no federal law or constitutional statute binds an elector's vote to anything. All pledging laws originate at the state level;<ref>{{cite book | title=Promises Of The Constitution: Yesterday Today Tomorrow | author=Openshaw, Pamela Romney | publisher=BookBaby | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BEdXDQAAQBAJ | page=10.3| isbn=9781483529806 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The Indispensable Electoral College: How the Founders' Plan Saves Our Country from Mob Rule | publisher=Gateway Editions | year=2017 | author=Ross, Tara | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0IkDwAAQBAJ | page=26| isbn=9781621577072 }}</ref> the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld these state laws in its 1952 ruling ''[[Ray v. Blair]]''. In 2020, the Supreme Court also ruled in ''[[Chiafalo v. Washington]]'' that states are free to enforce laws that bind electors to voting for the winner of the popular vote in their state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/a398c3e7c8d2c4a1b9ad498ed5f86ed7|title=Justices rule states can bind presidential electors' votes|work=Associated Press|date=July 6, 2020}}</ref>

==Faithless elector laws==
{{As of|2020}}, 33 [[U.S. state|states]] and the [[District of Columbia]] have laws that require electors to vote for the candidates for whom they pledged to vote, though in half of these jurisdictions there is no enforcement mechanism. In 14 states, votes contrary to the pledge are voided and the respective electors are replaced, and in two of these states they may also be fined. Three other states impose a penalty on faithless electors but still count their votes as cast.<ref name=laws>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |date=July 7, 2020 |accessdate=November 21, 2020}}</ref>

Colorado was the first state to void an elector's faithless vote, which occurred during the [[2016 United States Presidential Election|2016 election]]. Minnesota also invoked this law for the first time in 2016 when an elector pledged to [[Hillary Clinton]] attempted to vote for [[Bernie Sanders]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/mn-electors-meet-award-clinton-votes-amid-protests-against-trump/407477396/|title=Minnesota electors align for Clinton; one replaced after voting for Sanders|publisher=}}</ref> Until 2008, Minnesota's electors cast secret ballots. Although the final count would reveal the occurrence of faithless votes, it was impossible to determine which electors were faithless. After an unknown elector was faithless in 2004, Minnesota amended its law to require public balloting of the electors' votes and invalidate any vote cast for someone other than the candidate to whom the elector was pledged.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |date= |title=208.08, 2008 Minnesota Statutes |publisher=Revisor.leg.state.mn.us |url=https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=208.08&year=2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref>

[[Washington (state)|Washington]] became the first state to fine faithless electors after the 2016 election, in the wake of that state having four faithless elector votes. In 2019, the state changed its law for future elections, to void faithless votes and replace the respective electors instead of fining them.<ref>[http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2019-20/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/5074.SL.pdf Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act], Washington State Legislature, July 28, 2019.</ref>

==Legal rulings==
=== ''Ray v. Blair'' ===
{{main|Ray v. Blair}}

The constitutionality of state ''pledge'' laws was confirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1952 in ''[[Ray v. Blair]]''<ref name=":0">''[[Ray v. Blair]]'' {{ussc|343|214|1952}}</ref> in a 5–2 vote.  The court ruled states have the right to require electors to pledge to vote for the candidate whom their party supports, and the right to remove potential electors who refuse to pledge prior to the election.  The court also wrote:<ref name=":0" />

{{quote | However, even if such promises of candidates for the electoral college are legally unenforceable because violative of an ''assumed constitutional freedom of the elector under the Constitution, Art. II, § 1, to vote as he may choose'' [emphasis added] in the electoral college, it would not follow that the requirement of a pledge in the primary is unconstitutional. | U.S. Supreme Court | ''Ray v. Blair'', 1952}}

The ruling only held that requiring a pledge, not a vote, was constitutional and Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Jackson]], joined by Justice [[William O. Douglas|Douglas]], wrote in his dissent:<ref name=":0" />

{{quote|No one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text&nbsp;– that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.}} 

One recent legal scholar believes "a state law that would thwart a federal elector’s discretion at an extraordinary time when it reasonably must be exercised would clearly violate Article II and the Twelfth Amendment".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sheppard |first=Stephen M. |date=May 21, 2015 |title=A Case For The Electoral College And For Its Faithless Elector |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |volume=2015 |issue=1 |url=https://wlr.law.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1263/2015/02/Sheppard-Final-copy.pdf}}</ref>

=== ''Chiafalo v. Washington'' and ''Colorado Department of State v. Baca'' ===
{{main|Chiafalo v. Washington}}

After the 2016 election, electors who attempted to switch their votes in Washington and Colorado were subjected to enforcement of their state's faithless elector laws. The four faithless electors from Washington were each fined $1,000 for breaking their pledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kitsapsun.com/story/news/2016/12/23/four-state-electors-fined-1000-vote/95796628/|title=Four state electors to be fined $1,000 for vote|last=La Corte|first=Rachel|date=December 23, 2016|work=[[Kitsap Sun]]|accessdate=December 25, 2016}}</ref> The electors received legal assistance from the non-profit advocacy group [[Equal Citizens]] founded by [[Lawrence Lessig]]. The Colorado case, ''Baca v. Colorado Department of State'', was initially dismissed by the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]]. On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit | 10th Circuit]] ruled in August 2019 that Colorado's faithless elector law is unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web |last=Paul |first=Jesse |title=Colorado's presidential electors don't have to vote for candidate who wins the state, federal appeals court rules |url=https://coloradosun.com/2019/08/21/faithless-electors-court-decision-colorado-10th-circuit/ |website=The Colorado Sun |date=21 August 2019 |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref> Specifically, the opinion held that electors have a constitutional right to vote for the presidential candidate of their choice and are not bound by any prior pledges they may have made. The opinion said the act of voting for president in the electoral college is a federal function not subject to state law and state laws requiring electors to vote only for the candidates they pledged are unconstitutional and unenforceable. On October 16, 2019, Colorado appealed the 10th Circuit's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web |last=Paul |first=Jesse |title=Colorado asks U.S. Supreme Court to overturn decision allowing presidential electors to vote for whomever they want |url=https://coloradosun.com/?s=Colorado+asks+U.S.+Supreme+Court+to+overturn+decision+allowing+presidential|date=October 16, 2019 |website=Colorado Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Petition for writ of certiorari |url=https://coag.gov/app/uploads/2019/10/Colorado-Cert-Petition-Final.pdf |website=Colorado Attorney General |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>

The decision conflicted with an earlier May 2019 decision by the [[Washington Supreme Court]] ''In re Guerra'',<ref>{{cite web |title=In re Guerra |url=https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/953473.pdf|publisher=Washington Supreme Court|date=May 23, 2019 |accessdate=July 6, 2020}}</ref> in which three electors who had $1000 fines imposed on them for violating their pledges appealed the fines, which were upheld. In contrast to the Colorado case, the Washington court held that presidential electors are state officials under the control of state law and can be criminally punished by a state if they do not vote as they pledged. On October 7, 2019, these electors also appealed their case to the U.S. Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Supreme Court asked to decide whether electors must vote for state popular vote winner |url=https://www.jurist.org/news/2019/10/supreme-court-asked-to-decide-whether-electors-must-vote-for-state-popular-vote-winner/ |website=Jurist |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Petition for writ of certiorari |url=https://equalcitizens.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/19-_PetitionForAWritOfCertiorari.pdf |website=Equal Citizens |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>

On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously in both ''Chiafalo v. Washington'' and ''Colorado Department of State v. Baca'' that states ''may'' enforce laws to punish faithless electors.<ref name="Chiafalo v. Washington">{{cite web |title=19-465 Chiafalo v.

==History==
Over 58 elections, 165 electors have not cast their votes for [[President of the United States|president]] or [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] as prescribed by the legislature of the state they represented.<ref name="FairVote"/> Of those:
* 71 electors changed their votes because the candidate to whom they were pledged died before the electoral ballot (in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] and [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]).
* 1 elector chose to abstain from voting for any candidate (in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]).
* 93 were changed typically by the elector's personal preference, although there have been some instances where the change may have been caused by an honest mistake. 

Usually, faithless electors act alone, although on occasion a faithless elector has attempted to induce other electors to change their votes in concert, usually with little if any success. One exception was the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 election]], in which all 23 Virginia electors acted together, altering the outcome of the electoral college vote but failing to change the outcome of the overall election. The Democratic ticket won states with 170 of the 294 electoral votes, but the 23 Virginia electors abstained in the vote for vice president, meaning the Democratic nominee, [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]], got only 147 votes, exactly half of the electoral college (one short of being elected). Johnson was subsequently elected vice president by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

==List of faithless electors==
{{sources|section|date=November 2020|reason=It should be 100% clear through sources that each person in this list was (1) pledged to vote for a particular party's candidates or particular candidates and (2) did not do that. If the elector contested that status or if that status is not clear, that must be made clear here.}}
The following is a list of all faithless electors. The number preceding each entry is the number of faithless electors in the given year's election.

===1788 to 1796: Before the 12th Amendment===
'''3''' – [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1788-89 election]]: three electors, two from Maryland and one from Virginia, did not vote

'''3''' – [[1792 United States presidential election|1792 election]]: three electors, two from Maryland and one from Vermont, did not vote

'''19''' – [[1796 United States presidential election|1796 election]]: [[Samuel Miles]], an elector from Pennsylvania, was pledged to vote for [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] presidential candidate [[John Adams]], but voted for [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] candidate Thomas Jefferson. He cast his other vote as pledged for [[Thomas Pinckney]]; there was no provision at the time for specifying president or vice president. An additional 18 electors voted for Adams as pledged, but refused to vote for Pinckney.<ref name="Alexander Hamilton by Chernow">Chernow, Ron. ''Alexander Hamilton''. New York: Penguin, 2004. p. 514.</ref> This was an attempt to foil Alexander Hamilton's rumored plan to elect Pinckney as president, and this resulted in the unintended outcome that Adams' opponent, Jefferson, was elected vice president instead of Adams' running mate, Pinckney. This was the only time in U.S. history that the president and vice president have been from different parties, except for [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] (although in that year, while the president and vice president were from different parties, they ran on one ticket from the same third party), and the only time the winners were from different tickets. After the 1800 election resulted in a deadlock, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] was ratified in 1804. It changed the election procedure so that instead of casting two votes of the same type, electors would make an explicit choice for president and vice president.

===1808 to 1840===
'''6''' – [[1808 United States presidential election|1808 election]]: Six electors from New York were pledged to vote for [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] [[James Madison]] for president and former New York governor [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] for vice president. Instead, they voted for Clinton for president, with three voting for Madison for vice president and the other three voting for [[James Monroe]] for vice president.<ref name="FairVote"/>

'''3''' – [[1812 United States presidential election|1812 election]]: Three electors pledged to vote for [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] vice-presidential candidate [[Jared Ingersoll]] instead voted for [[Elbridge Gerry]].<ref name="FairVote"/>

'''1''' – [[1820 United States presidential election|1820 election]]: [[William Plumer]] was pledged to vote for [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] presidential candidate [[James Monroe]], who was not contested for re-election, but he instead cast his vote for [[John Quincy Adams]], who was not a candidate in the election. Some historians contend Plumer wanted George Washington to be the only unanimous selection, or that he wanted to draw attention to his friend Adams as a potential candidate. These claims are disputed.<ref name="Edwards">{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=George|title=Why the Electoral College Is Bad for America|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press}}</ref> Plumer also cast his vice-presidential vote for Richard Rush, not Daniel D. Tompkins as pledged.

'''7''' – [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 election]]: Seven of the nine electors from Georgia refused to vote for vice-presidential candidate [[John C. Calhoun]]; they instead cast their vice-presidential votes for [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]].<ref name="FairVote"/>

'''30''' – [[1832 United States presidential election|1832 election]]: All 30 electors from Pennsylvania refused to vote for the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, [[Martin Van Buren]], voting instead for [[William Wilkins (U.S. politician)|William Wilkins]].<ref name="FairVote"/>

'''23''' – [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 election]]: The 23 electors from Virginia were pledged to vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates [[Martin Van Buren]] for president and [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] for vice president. However, they refused to vote for Johnson because of his open liaison with a slave mistress and voted instead for Senator [[William Smith (South Carolina senator)|William Smith]] of South Carolina, which left Johnson with 147 electoral votes, one short of a majority. Johnson was subsequently elected vice president after a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

'''1''' – [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]]: One elector from [[Virginia]], Arthur Smith of [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight County]], was pledged to vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates [[Martin Van Buren]] for president {{citation needed span|and [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M.

'''8''' – [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]]: the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice-presidential candidate, [[James S. Sherman]], died six days before the popular election. The Republicans had won only two states, Utah and Vermont, and [[Nicholas Murray Butler|Nicholas M. Butler]] was hastily designated to receive the eight electoral votes that were pledged to Sherman. All eight Republican electors accordingly voted for Butler for vice president.<ref name="FairVote"/>

===1948 to 1988===
'''1''' – [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]]: Tennessee Elector [[Preston Parks]] was a candidate to be an elector for both the Democratic Party candidate, [[Harry S. Truman]], and the [[States' Rights Democratic Party]] candidate, [[Strom Thurmond]]. Though the national Democratic Party won the election, Parks had actively campaigned for Thurmond and he voted for Thurmond and [[Fielding L. Wright]].<ref name="Edwards"/>

'''1''' – [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 election]]: Alabama Elector [[W. F. Turner]], pledged for Democrats [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] and [[Estes Kefauver]], cast his votes for Judge [[Walter Burgwyn Jones]] and [[Herman Talmadge]], the former [[Governor of Georgia]].<ref name="Edwards"/>

'''1''' – [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]]: Oklahoma Elector [[Henry D. Irwin]], pledged for Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], contacted the other 218 Republican electors to convince them to cast presidential electoral votes for Democratic non-candidate [[Harry F. Byrd]] and vice-presidential electoral votes for Republican [[Barry Goldwater]]. Most replied they had a moral obligation to vote for Nixon, while Irwin voted for Byrd and Goldwater. Fourteen [[unpledged elector]]s (eight from Mississippi and six from Alabama) also voted for Byrd for president, but supported [[Strom Thurmond]] for vice president – since they were not pledged to anyone, their action was not faithless.<ref name="Edwards"/>

*In Maine, a Democratic Party elector voted for Bernie Sanders but was forced to cast a vote for Clinton.
*A [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] elector tried to do the same but was replaced by one who cast a vote for Clinton. The same Minnesota elector voted for [[Tulsi Gabbard]] for vice president but had that vote invalidated and given to [[Tim Kaine]].
