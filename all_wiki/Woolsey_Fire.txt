The '''Woolsey Fire''' was a destructive [[wildfire]] that burned in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The fire ignited on November 8, 2018 and burned {{convert|96,949|acres|hectare|abbr=on}} of land. The fire destroyed 1,643 structures,<ref name="Woolsey Fire Incident Update" /> killed three people, and prompted the evacuation of more than 295,000 people.<ref name=MercuryNews2018-11-14/> It was one of several fires in California that ignited on the same day.

Many of these were on [[Point Dume]] that juts out from the narrow coastal [[Terrace (geology)|terrace]] that lies between the mountains and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The mitigation measures [[Pepperdine University]] had in place successfully protected the campus, with students sheltering in place, to the south. The entire sparsely populated portion of the Malibu coast west to the community of [[Solromar, California|Solromar]], which includes state and national parklands, suffered damage from the fire. The fire cost at least $6 billion (2018 USD) in property damage.<ref name="Woolsey Fire cost" />

Thousands of residents were kept away from their houses in numerous neighborhoods along the Ventura Freeway and the communities along the Malibu coast. The evacuations frustrated residents as they lasted for many days as the fire continued to threaten houses especially when the winds increased and fanned the flames. The evacuated residents were incrementally allowed to return to see if their houses were damaged or destroyed as the fire continued to spread through the rugged wilderness at the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains. Authorities in many of the damaged communities declared that they needed to prevent residents from returning quickly as neighborhoods were crowded with crews repairing downed power lines and other hazardous conditions. In the months after the fire, people{{who|date=April 2020}} criticized what they thought was a slow and inadequate response by cities and counties during public meetings held by public officials.

While this and other fires were burning, President [[Donald Trump]] blamed poor forest management by the state. Fire scientists explained that forest management (good or bad) had a minor influence on the severity of the fires, and that Woolsey was not a forest fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/13/donald-trump-wildfires-science-forest-management|title=What Trump gets wrong about wildfires, by a fire scientist|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=April 28, 2020}}</ref> The [[California Public Utilities Commission]] is investigating an equipment problem near the point of origin reported by [[Southern California Edison]].
