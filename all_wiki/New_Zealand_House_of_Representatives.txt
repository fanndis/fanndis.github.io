The '''House of Representatives''' is the sole chamber of the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. The House passes [[Law of New Zealand|laws]], provides [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministers]] to form [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], and supervises the work of government. It is also responsible for adopting the state's [[New Zealand Budget|budgets]] and approving the state's accounts.

The House of Representatives is a [[Representative democracy|democratic]] body consisting of representatives known as [[members of parliament]] (MPs). There are usually 120 MPs, though this number can be higher if there is an [[Overhang seat|overhang]].<ref name="facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/about-parliament/how-parliament-works|title=How Parliament works: What is Parliament?|date=28 June 2010|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=31 May 2014}}</ref> [[Elections in New Zealand|Elections]] take place usually every three years using a [[mixed-member proportional representation]] system which combines [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] elected seats with [[closed party list]]s. 72 MPs are elected directly in single-member [[New Zealand electorates|electoral districts]] and further seats are filled by [[list MP]]s based on each [[List of political parties in New Zealand|party]]'s share of the party vote. A [[List of New Zealand governments|government]] is formed from the party or [[Coalition government|coalition]] with the majority of MPs.<ref name="facts" /> If no majority is possible, then a [[minority government]] can be formed with a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement. If a government is unable to maintain the confidence of the House then an early general election can be called.

The House of Representatives was created by the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852|New Zealand Constitution Act]], an Act of the [[British Parliament]], which established a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature; however the upper chamber, the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], was abolished in 1950.<ref name="facts"/> Parliament received full control over all New Zealand affairs in 1947 with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|Statute of Westminster Adoption Act]]. The [[debating chamber]] of the House of Representatives is located inside [[Parliament House, Wellington|Parliament House]] in [[Wellington]], the capital city. Sittings of the House are usually open to the public, but the House may at any time vote to sit in private. Proceedings are also broadcast through [[Parliament TV (New Zealand)|Parliament TV]], [[AM Network]] and [[AM Network#Parliament Today|Parliament Today]].

==Constitutional function==
{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}
The New Zealand House of Representatives takes the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] as its model. The New Zealand Parliament is based, in practice, on the [[Westminster system]] (that is, the [[Parliamentary procedure|procedures]] of the British Parliament).<ref name="parl">{{cite web|title=Parliament Brief: What is Parliament?|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/fact-sheets/pbrief7/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref> As a democratic institution, the primary role of the House of Representatives is to provide representation for the people and to pass legislation on behalf of the people (''see [[#Passage of legislation|§ Passage of legislation]]'').<ref name="parl" />

The House of Representatives also plays an important role in [[responsible government]]. The [[New Zealand Government]] (that is, the [[executive (government)|executive]]), directed by the Cabinet,<ref name="glossary" /> draws its membership exclusively from the House.<ref name="accountable">{{cite web|title=Parliament Brief: Government Accountability to the House|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/fact-sheets/pbrief1/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|date=21 March 2014|access-date=12 November 2020|language=en}}</ref> A government is formed when a party or coalition can show that it has the "confidence" of the House, meaning the support of a majority of members of parliament. This can involve making agreements among several parties. Some may join a coalition government, while others may stay outside the government but agree to support it on [[motion of no confidence|confidence votes]]. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] is answerable to, and must maintain the support of, the House of Representatives; thus, whenever the office of prime minister falls vacant, the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]] appoints the person who has the support of the House, or who is most likely to command the support of the House. In the event that the House of Representatives loses confidence in the Cabinet, and therefore the government, it can dissolve the government if a vote of no-confidence is passed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parties and Government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-8-parties-and-government/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==Members and elections==
{{anchor|Members}}
The House of Representatives normally consists of 120 members, who bear the title "[[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]]" (MP). They were previously known as "Members of the House of Representatives" (MHRs) until the passing of the Parliamentary and Executive Titles Act 1907 when New Zealand became a [[Dominion of New Zealand|Dominion]], and even earlier as "Members of the General Assembly" (MGAs).{{sfn|Scholefield |1950|p=91}}

[[File:GHAHRAMAN-SWORN-IN.jpg|thumb|A member of Parliament, [[Golriz Ghahraman]], being sworn in to the [[52nd New Zealand Parliament|52nd Parliament]], 6 November 2017]]
All members are democratically elected, and usually enter the House following a [[Elections in New Zealand|general election]].<!--Some are elected in by-elections; read on--> Once [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|sworn in]], members normally continue to serve until the next [[dissolution of parliament]] and subsequent general election, which must take place at least every three years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament in Election Year |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/parliament-in-election-year/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Early general elections (sometimes termed "[[snap election]]s") are possible at the discretion of the prime minister,<ref>{{cite web |title=Muldoon calls snap election |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/snap-election-called |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref> especially in the event that a minority government is unable to retain the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of the House. If a member dies or resigns, his or her seat falls vacant. Members who change their party allegiance during a term—known as "[[waka-jumping]]"—may be expelled from the House.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Waka-jumping bill passes into law after heated debate |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/367427/waka-jumping-bill-passes-into-law-after-heated-debate |accessdate=10 August 2020 |work=[[RNZ]] |date=27 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Members may also be expelled in cases of criminal activity or other serious misconduct.

To be a member of Parliament a person must be a [[New Zealand citizen]] (by birth or naturalisation) at the time of the election and not be disqualified from enrolling to vote; bankruptcy is not grounds for disqualification from office.<ref>{{cite web |title=Part 1: Nomination of Candidates |url=https://www.elections.org.nz/becoming-candidate-election/part-1-nomination-candidates |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission New Zealand]] |accessdate=24 February 2019 |language=en |date=11 May 2018}}</ref> [[Party list]] candidates are always nominated by political parties.

Based on British tradition, the longest continuously serving member in the House holds the unofficial title "[[Father of the House (New Zealand)|Father (or Mother) of the House]]".{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=194}} The current Father of the House is [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], first elected in {{NZ election link year|1990}}.

[[File:1860 Parliament.jpg|thumb|Montage of portraits depicting members of the House, the Serjeant-at-Arms, and the Clerk of the House, during the [[2nd New Zealand Parliament|Second Parliament]] in 1860.]]

The House started with 37 members in 1854, with numbers progressively increasing to 95 by 1882, before being reduced to 74 in 1891. Numbers slowly increased again to 99 by 1993.<ref>{{cite web |title=Size of the House of Representatives: 120 or 99 MPs? |url=https://www.parliament.nz/resource/mi-nz/00PLLawRP99031/7260655698b68ee04eb12d92146f2cb3c024995e |accessdate=13 June 2018 |page=1 |format=PDF |publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Library |date=5 October 1999}}</ref> In 1996 numbers increased to at least 120 with the introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] elections (i.e. 120 plus any [[overhang seat]]s;<ref>{{cite web |title=Overhang |url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/Overhang.pdf |website=MMPReview.org.nz |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission New Zealand]]}}</ref> there has been at least one overhang seat in four of the seven MMP elections held since 1996).

==Procedure==
[[File:Opening of 29th NZ Parliament.jpg|thumb|The mace is carried into Parliament by the Serjeant-at-Arms during the Opening of the [[29th New Zealand Parliament|29th Parliament]], 1950]]
The House of Representatives usually sits Tuesday to Thursday when in session.<ref name="standing order">{{cite web|title=Standing Order of the House of Representatives of New Zealand|url=http://www.parliament.am/library/Standing%20orders/nor%20zelandia.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> The House meets in a [[debating chamber]] located inside [[Parliament House, Wellington]]. The layout is similar to the design of the chamber of the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Parliament works|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>
The seats and desks are arranged in rows in a horseshoe pattern.<ref name="seating">{{cite web|title=Where MPs sit in the House|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201410221/where-mps-sit-in-the-house|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=20 December 2016|date=22 October 2014}}</ref> 
The speaker of the House sits in a raised chair at the open end of the horseshoe, giving them a clear view of proceedings. In front of the chair is a table, on which rests the mace. The House of Representatives cannot lawfully meet without the mace—representing the authority of the speaker—being present in the chamber.<ref name="mace" /> (The current mace is an imitation of the one in the British House of Commons; it is over 100 years old, having been used since 7 October 1909.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament's mace is 100 years old - |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews071020091/parliament-s-mace-is-100-years-old |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=24 February 2019 |language=en |date=12 October 2009}}</ref>)

[[File:NZ House of Representatives seating infographic.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Layout of important roles and where they are seated in the Debating Chamber]]
Various officers—clerks and other officials—sit at the table, ready to advise the speaker on procedure when necessary.<ref name="people" /> Members of the Government occupy the seats on the speaker's right, while members of the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|Official Opposition]] sit on the speaker's left. Members are assigned seating on the basis of the seniority in a party caucus; [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministers]] sit around the prime minister, who is traditionally assigned the fourth seat along the front row on the speaker's right.<ref>{{cite web|title=People of Parliament|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/parliament-in-election-year/people-of-parliament/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=28 February 2018|language=en|date=29 June 2017}}</ref> The Opposition leader sits directly across from the prime minister and is surrounded by Opposition spokespersons. A member who is not a Government minister or Opposition spokesperson is referred to as a "[[backbencher]]".<ref name="glossary">{{cite web|title=Glossary of terms|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/glossary/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> A backbencher may still be subject to [[party discipline]] (called "whipping"). [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] ensure that members of their party attend and vote as the party leadership desires. Government whips are seated behind the prime minister; Opposition whips are normally seated behind the leader of the Opposition.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a party whip and what do they do?|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201306271/what-is-a-party-whip-and-what-do-they-do|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=21 February 2018|language=en|date=27 June 2013}}</ref> Members from parties that are not openly aligned with either the Government or the Official Opposition are sometimes referred to as "[[crossbencher]]s".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/18/new-zealand-vote-strangest-dirtiest-election-campaign|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=New Zealand prepares to vote after 'strangest, dirtiest' election campaign|date=18 September 2014}}</ref>

===Debates and votes===
Members have the option of addressing the House in English, [[Māori language|te reo Māori]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliament in te reo|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/the-work-of-government/history-of-parliament/parliament-in-te-reo|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=13 May 2017}}</ref> or [[New Zealand Sign Language]] (with an interpreter provided).<ref name="debate">{{cite web |title=Chapter 16 Debate |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-16-debate |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=21 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Speeches are addressed to the presiding officer, using the words 'Mister Speaker', if a man, or 'Madam Speaker', if a woman.<ref>{{citation|title=Parliamentary Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppQLAQAAIAAJ|volume=329|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref> Only the speaker may be directly addressed in debate; other members must be referred to in the third person, either by full name or office.<ref name="debate"/> The speaker can "[[Naming (parliamentary procedure)|name]]" a member who he or she believes has broken the rules of conduct of the House; following a vote this will usually result in the expulsion of said member from the chamber.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naming and Suspension of Member|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/hansard-debates/rhr/document/47HansD_20030501_00001088/naming-and-suspension-of-member|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:New Zealand House of Representatives Debating Chamber.png|thumb|link=|Chamber pictured during a debate by members of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament]], 11 June 2011]]
During debates, members may only speak if called upon by the speaker. No member may speak more than once on the same question (except that the mover of a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] is entitled to make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end). The Standing Orders of the House of Representatives prescribe time limits for speeches.<ref name="standing order"/> The limits depend on the nature of the motion, but are most commonly between ten and twenty minutes. However, under certain circumstances, the prime minister and other party leaders are entitled to make longer speeches. Debate may be further restricted by the passage of "time allocation" motions. Alternatively, the House may end debate more quickly by passing a motion for "closure".<ref name="standing order"/>

A vote is held to resolve a question when it is put to the House of Representatives. The House first votes by voice vote; the speaker or deputy speaker puts the question, and members respond either "Aye" (in favour of the motion) or "No" (against the motion).<ref name="Martin" /> The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his or her assessment is challenged by any Member, a recorded vote known as a [[division of the assembly|division]] follows. There are two methods of handling a division: ''party vote'' is used for most votes, but ''personal vote'' is used for conscience issues. In the party vote method, the clerk of the House reads out each party's name in turn. A member of the party (usually a whip) will respond to their party's name by stating how many members of the party are in favour and how many members are opposed. The clerk tallies up the votes and gives the results to the speaker, who announces the result. If the members of a party are not unanimous, a list of the members of the party and how they voted must be tabled after the vote.<ref name="NZHR-vote">{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/Features/b/0/0/00NZPHomeNews061120091-Voting-in-the-House-of-Representatives.htm |title= Voting in the House of Representatives |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date= 6 November 2009 |accessdate= 30 August 2012}}</ref> In the personal vote method, members enter one of two lobbies (the "Aye" lobby or the "No" lobby) on either side of the chamber. At each lobby are two [[Teller (elections)|tellers]] (themselves members of Parliament) who count the votes of the Members. Once the division concludes, the tellers provide the results to the speaker, who then announces the result. In the event of a tie, the motion lapses.

[[File:Parliament in Session, Wellington, 1966.jpg|thumb|The Prime Minister, [[Keith Holyoake]], addresses the chamber. (A parliament publicity photograph from 1966.)]]
Every sitting day a period of time is set aside for [[Question time#New Zealand|questions]] to be asked of ministers and select committee chairs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Question time in the House|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201210161/question-time-in-the-house|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=3 July 2017|language=en|date=16 October 2012}}</ref> Questions to a minister must related to their official ministerial activities, not to his or her activities as a party leader, for instance. Questions are allocated on a party basis. In addition to questions asked orally during Question Time, members may also make inquiries in writing. Written questions are submitted to the clerk, either on paper or electronically, and answers are recorded in [[Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)|''Parliamentary Debates'' (Hansard)]] so as to be widely available and accessible.

==Passage of legislation==

Most parliamentary business is about making new laws and amending old laws. The House examines and amends [[bill (law)|bills]]—the title given to a proposed piece of legislation while under consideration by the House—in several formal stages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 7 Parties and Government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/document/00HOOOCPPNZ_71|website=www.parliament.nz|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=23 November 2017|language=en|date=14 October 2010}}</ref> The term for these stages is "[[Reading (legislature)|reading]]", which originates from the practice in the British Parliament where bills were literally read aloud in the chamber. In New Zealand only a bill's title is read aloud. Once a bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages it is [[Enactment of a bill|enacted]] and becomes an [[Act of Parliament]],<ref>{{cite web |title=How a bill becomes law |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/how-laws-are-made/how-a-bill-becomes-law/ |website=www.parliament.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=19 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> forming part of [[Law of New Zealand|New Zealand's law]].

Bills become Acts after being approved three times by House votes and then receiving the [[Royal Assent]] from the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]]. The majority of bills are proposed by the government of the day (that is, the party or coalition parties that command a majority in the House) to implement its policies. These policies may relate to the raising of revenue through taxation bills or the expenditure of money through [[appropriation bill]]s (including those bills giving effect to the [[New Zealand Budget|budget]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Guide to the Budget process |url=https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/guide/guide-budget-process |website=treasury.govt.nz |publisher=[[New Zealand Treasury]] |accessdate=19 June 2019 |language=en |date=17 May 2018}}</ref> It is rare for government bills to be defeated—indeed the first to be defeated in the twentieth century was in 1998, when the Local Government Amendment Bill (No 5) was defeated on its second reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/AboutParl/HowPWorks/PPNZ/8/0/d/00HOOOCPPNZ_71-Chapter-7-Parties-and-Government.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115002636/http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/AboutParl/HowPWorks/PPNZ/8/0/d/00HOOOCPPNZ_71-Chapter-7-Parties-and-Government.htm |archivedate=15 January 2012 }}</ref>

Individual MPs who are not ministers may propose their own bills, called [[private member's bill#New Zealand|members' bills]]—these are usually put forward by opposition parties, or by MPs who wish to deal with a matter that parties do not take positions on. Local government and private individuals may also propose legislation to be introduced by an MP.<ref>{{cite web |title=Private bills and local bills |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/document/00HOHPBReferenceStOrdersAppendixCAPrivate1 |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |date=28 November 2011}}</ref>

[[Proxy voting]] is allowed, in which members may designate a party or another member to vote on their behalf. An excuse is required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/078D6043-9E03-4D87-93BA-A6BB84ACC063/6619/standingorders20095.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the House of Representatives|publisher=New Zealand House of Representatives|date=12 August 2005|accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>

===First Reading===
The first stage of the process is the [[First Reading]]. The MP introducing the bill (often a minister) will give a detailed speech on the bill as a whole. Debate on the bill generally lasts two hours, with 12 MPs making ten-minute speeches (although they can split their speaking time with another MP) on the bill's general principles. Speaking slots are allocated based on the size of each party, with different parties using different methods to distribute their slots among their MPs.<ref name="standing order" />

The MP introducing the bill will generally make a recommendation that the bill be considered by an appropriate select committee (''see {{section link||Committees}}''). Sometimes, it will be recommended that a special committee be formed, usually when the bill is particularly important or controversial. The House then votes as to whether the bill should be sent to the committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the select committee stage even by parties which do not support it—since select committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the Second Reading.<ref name="standing order" />

Prior to the First Reading, the [[Attorney-General of New Zealand|Attorney-General]] will check the bill is consistent with the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990]]. If the bill or part of it is not consistent, the Attorney-General will present a report to the House, known as a Section 7 report, highlighting the inconsistencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 {{!}} The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee|url=http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/lac-revised-guidelines/chapter-5/|publisher=New Zealand Legislation Design and Advisory Committee|accessdate=13 May 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Select Committee stage===
The select committee will scrutinise the bill, going over it in more detail than can be achieved by the whole membership of the House. The public can also make submissions to select committees, offering support, criticism, or merely comments. Written submissions from the public to the committee are normally due two months after the bill's first reading. Submitters can opt to also give an oral submission, which are heard by the committee in Wellington, and numbers permitting, Auckland and Christchurch. The select committee stage is seen as increasingly important today—in the past, the governing party generally dominated select committees, making the process something of a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]], but in the multi-party environment there is significant scope for real debate. Select committees frequently recommend changes to bills, with prompts for change coming from the MPs sitting in the committee, officials who advise the committee, and members of the public. When a majority of the committee is satisfied with the bill, the committee will report back to the House on it. Unless Parliament grants an extension, the time limit for select committee deliberations is six months or whatever deadline was set by the House when the bill was referred.<ref name="standing order" />

===Second Reading===
The Second Reading, like the first, generally consists of a two-hour debate in which MPs make ten-minute speeches. Again, speaking slots are allocated to parties based on their size. In theory, speeches should relate to the principles and objects of the bill, and also to the consideration and recommendations of the select committee and issues raised in public submissions. Parties will usually have made their final decision on a bill after the select committee stage, and will make their views clear during the Second Reading debates. At the conclusion of the Second Reading debate, the House votes on whether to accept any amendments recommended by the select committee by majority (unanimous amendments are not subjected to this extra hurdle).<ref name="standing order" />

The Government (usually through the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]]) has the power (given by the House's Standing Orders) to veto any proposed legislation that would have a major impact on the Government's budget and expenditure plans.<ref name="Financial veto">{{cite web |title=Financial Veto certificates explained |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/financial-veto-certificates-explained/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=25 February 2019 |language=en |date=29 June 2016}}</ref> This veto can be invoked at any stage of the process, but if applied to a bill as a whole will most likely be employed at the Second Reading stage. Since the financial veto certificate was introduced in 1996, the Government has exercised it only once in respect of an entire bill, in 2016,<ref name="Financial veto"/> although many amendments have been vetoed at the Committee of the whole House stage.

If a bill receives its Second Reading, it goes on to be considered by a [[Committee of the whole|Committee of the whole House]].<ref name="standing order" />

===Committee of the whole House===
When a bill reaches the Committee of the whole House stage, the House resolves itself "Into Committee", that is, it forms a committee consisting of all MPs (as distinct from a select committee, which consists only of a few members). When the House is "In Committee", it is able to operate in a slightly less formal way than usual.<ref name="standing order" />

During the Committee of the whole House stage, a bill is debated in detail, usually "part by part" (a "part" is a grouping of clauses). MPs may make five-minute speeches on a particular part or provision of the bill and may propose further amendments, but theoretically should not make general speeches on the bill's overall goals or principles (that should have occurred at the Second Reading).

Sometimes a member may advertise his or her proposed amendments beforehand by having them printed on a "Supplementary Order Paper"; this is common for amendments proposed by government ministers. Some Supplementary Order Papers are very extensive, and, if agreed to, can result in major amendments to bills. On rare occasions, Supplementary Order Papers are referred to select committees for comment.

The extent to which a bill changes during this process varies. If the select committee that considered the bill did not have a government majority and made significant alterations, the Government may make significant "corrective" amendments. There is some criticism that bills may be amended to incorporate significant policy changes without the benefit of select committee scrutiny or public submissions, or even that such major changes can be made with little or no notice. However, under the MMP system when the Government is less likely to have an absolute majority, any amendments will usually need to be negotiated with other parties to obtain majority support.

The Opposition may also put forward [[wrecking amendment]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motions and Amendments - |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-15-motions-and-amendments/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=20 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref> These amendments are often just symbolic of their contrasting policy position, or simply intended to delay the passage of the bill through the sheer quantity of amendments for the Committee of the whole House to vote on.

===Third Reading===
The final Reading takes the same format as the First and Second Readings—a two-hour debate with MPs making ten-minute speeches. The speeches once again refer to the bill in general terms, and represent the final chance for debate. A final vote is taken. If a bill passes its third reading, it is passed on to the governor-general, who will (assuming constitutional conventions are followed) give it Royal Assent as a matter of law. The title is changed from a bill to an Act, and it becomes law.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Assent |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews031220091/the-royal-assent |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=15 December 2018 |date=3 December 2009}}</ref>

==Committees==
{{Main|New Zealand House of Representatives committees}}
[[File:NZ House of Representatives Select Committee.jpg|thumb|A select committee hearing in action during the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|49th Parliament]]]]

In addition to the work of the main chamber, the House of Representatives also has a large number of committees, established in order to deal with particular areas or issues.<ref name="select committees">{{cite web |title=About select committees |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/about-select-committees/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en |date=17 October 2017}}</ref> There are 12 subject select committees,<ref>{{cite web |title=List of select committees |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/scl/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=25 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> which scrutinise and amend bills.<ref name="standing order" /> They can call for submissions from the public,<ref>{{cite web |title=Submissions and Advice |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/submissions-and-advice/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref> thereby meaning that there is a degree of public consultation before a parliamentary bill proceeds into law. The strengthening of the committee system was in response to concerns that legislation was being forced through, without receiving due examination and revision.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ganley |first1=Marcus |title=Select Committees and their Role in Keeping Parliament Relevant: Do New Zealand select committees make a difference? |url=https://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/aspg/documents/aspg_09.pdf |publisher=Department of Political Studies, University of Western Australia |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref>

Each committee has between six and twelve members—including a chairperson and deputy chairperson<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 4: Select Committees |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/parliamentary-rules/standing-orders-2017-by-chapter/chapter-4-select-committees/ |work=Standing Orders |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en |date=2017}}</ref>—with parties broadly represented in proportion to party membership in the House.<ref name="select committees"/> MPs may be members of more than one committee. Membership of committees is determined by the Business Specialist Committee, which is chaired by the speaker.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/sc/scl/business/ |website= |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=25 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

Occasionally a special committee will be created on a temporary basis; an example was the Select Committee established to study the [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy|foreshore and seabed bill]].

==New Zealand Youth Parliament==
Once in every term of Parliament a [[New Zealand Youth Parliament]] is held. This major national event is open to 16- to 18-year-olds who are appointed by individual MPs to represent them in their role for a few days in Wellington. The Youth MPs spend time debating a mock bill in the House and in select committees, and asking questions of Cabinet ministers. The previous [[New Zealand Youth Parliament]] was held in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myd.govt.nz/have-your-say/youth-parliament/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522012307/http://www.myd.govt.nz/have-your-say/youth-parliament/ |archivedate=22 May 2010 }}</ref>
