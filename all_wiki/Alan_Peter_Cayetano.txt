===Secretary of Foreign Affairs (2017–2018)===
On May 10, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that Cayetano was appointed as [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]], following the expiration of the one-year appointment ban on losing candidates of the 2016 elections.<ref>{{cite news|work=Philippine News Agency|last1=Reganit|first1=Cielito|title=Pres.

His appointment to the post by President Duterte was approved by the CA's foreign affairs committee on May 17, 2017. Upon approval of the CA's plenary, he will assume the post as foreign secretary and effectively resign from his post as senator.<ref>{{cite news|title=CA panel approves Cayetano appointment as DFA chief|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/05/17/CA-panel-approves-Cayetano-appointment-DFA-chief.html|access-date=May 17, 2017|work=CNN Philippines|date=May 17, 2017|quote=The committee's decision [of approving Cayetano's appointment] will now be referred to the plenary, which will vote to approve or reject the [Commission of Appointments] panel's ruling.}}</ref> On May 18, Cayetano was sworn in by President Duterte at the [[Malacañang of the South]] in [[Davao City]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Duterte administers oath to new DFA chief Cayetano|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/156955/look-duterte-administers-oath-new-dfa-chief-cayetano|access-date=May 18, 2017|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=May 18, 2017}}</ref>

As Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Cayetano plans an "objective-based" approach in resolving the [[Territories claimed by the Philippines|territorial disputes of the Philippines]], which he describes as negotiation through the use of historical facts, such as the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], to defend the Philippines' claims.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Punzalan|first1=Jamaine|title=After breezing through CA, Cayetano is officially DFA chief|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/17/17/after-breezing-through-ca-cayetano-is-officially-dfa-chief|access-date=May 17, 2017|work=ABS-CBN News|date=May 17, 2017}}</ref> He also vowed to avoid "microphone diplomacy", which he describes as the continual issuing of public statements instead of privately negotiating the issues with the parties.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=New DFA Sec.

In January 2018, Filipino Congressman Gary Alejano revealed that the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano had approved the Chinese Institute of Oceanology of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] to perform a scientific survey of the Rise, while disapproving a French research offer in the Philippine Rise. Under the agreement, majority of researchers must be Chinese. On the same month, China told Filipino counterparts that the Philippines has no right in the Philippine Rise. Filipino President [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s trusted spokesperson [[Harry Roque]] embraced and defended China's statement, causing outrage from various Filipino sectors.<ref name="atimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/article/china-eyes-philippines-strategic-eastern-shores/ |publisher=[[Asia Times]] |title=China eyes Philippines’ strategic eastern shores |first=George |last=Amurao |date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

In March 2018, Cayetano reiterated that the West Philippine Sea is "disputed," despite an international court backed by the [[United Nations]] declared that the Philippines has the sole legal right on the resources of the West Philippine Sea which also deemed the Philippines as the internationally acknowledged country with jurisdiction on the area. Presidential spokesperson Roque also called the area as "disputed," effectively making it as the Duterte administration's policy on the West Philippine Sea. Acting Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Antonio Carpio]], the main proponent of the West Philippine Sea case, told media that the court ruling is clear and that the Filipino foreign secretary and the presidential spokesperson themselves need to be educated more on the matter, because if they continue to call an undisputed area as disputed, China will use it as leverage against the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Rappler|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/197563-cayetano-disputed-west-philippine-sea-carpio |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041755/https://www.rappler.com/nation/197563-cayetano-disputed-west-philippine-sea-carpio |archive-date=March 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On October 9, 2018, President Duterte announced that Cayetano had planned to run in the May 2019 elections for the post of representative of Taguig city. He eventually resigned as Foreign Secretary on October 17, the last day of filing of certificates of candidacies.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Rappler|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/213905-alan-cayetano-resigning-salvador-panelo-press-secretary |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014091544/https://www.rappler.com/nation/213905-alan-cayetano-resigning-salvador-panelo-press-secretary |archive-date=October 14, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was succeeded by former [[Permanent Representative of the Philippines to the United Nations]] [[Teodoro Locsin Jr.|Teodoro Locsin Jr]] as Foreign Secretary on the same day.

===Speaker of the House (2019–2020)===
[[File:House Speaker Cayetano Oath-Taking (2019) (cropped).png|left|thumb|210x210px|Cayetano taking his oath of office as Speaker on July 21, 2019]]
On the first day of the 18th Congress of the Philippines, Cayetano was elected House Speaker after gaining 266 votes against Manila 6th District Representative [[Bienvenido Abante|Benny Abante Jr.]], who garnered 28 votes. Cayetano became the 22nd Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Republic of the Philippines on July 22, 2019. He was nominated by Representatives [[Lord Allan Jay Velasco]], [[Martin Romualdez]] and Presidential Son Rep. [[Paolo Duterte|Paolo "Pulong" Duterte]]. These three representatives also announced their intention to run for speaker, but President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] gave his endorsement to Cayetano.

Cayetano agreed to a share his term with [[Marinduque]] Representative Lord Allan Velasco, while the 1st District Representative of [[Leyte]], Martin Romualdez, who was among the contenders for the office, agreed to become Majority Floor Leader. The term-sharing agreement was influenced by no less than the President.

In 2016, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano was the running mate of the President Rodrigo R. Duterte but lost to the administration bet, Vice President [[Leni Robredo|Maria Leonor "Leni" Robredo]].

House Speaker Cayetano is not new to the House of Representatives. In 1998, he was elected 1st District Representative of Taguig City, and served until 2007. That year, he ran for Senator of the Republic and successfully earned a Senate seat. He was a senator for 10 years until President Duterte appointed him in the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] as successor of then-Foreign Sec. [[Perfecto Yasay]] after the Commission on Appointments denied Yasay's appointment as secretary of the department.

House Speaker Cayetano, in his first speech as speaker, expressed his gratitude to the President and to the members of the House of Representatives for the trust and confidence they bestowed upon him. Cayetano entered the session hall of the House of Representative with a standing ovation and a loud round of applause. After that, a pray-over was led by Rep. [[Eddie Villanueva]]. Right after his speech, the Speaker said, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and all will be added unto you."

Under the term-sharing agreement, Cayetano will serve for 15 months and will be followed by Velasco in the remaining months of the 18th Congress of the Philippines.

On September 2, the House designated him as the Legislative Caretaker of [[Camarines Sur]]'s [[Camarines Sur's 1st congressional district|1st district]] after the elected representative, Marissa Andaya, died of cancer on July 5.<ref>{{cite news|date=September 2, 2020|title=House names Cayetano as Camarines Sur 1st District caretaker|agency=Rappler|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/house-names-alan-peter-cayetano-as-camarines-sur-first-district-caretaker|access-date=October 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014024425/https://www.rappler.com/nation/house-names-alan-peter-cayetano-as-camarines-sur-first-district-caretaker |archive-date=October 14, 2020}}</ref> However, on October 16, just four days after he resigned as Speaker, House members had him replaced by Michael John Duavit (Rizal–1st).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mercado |first1=Neil Arwin |title=Cayetano replaced as legislative caretaker of Camarines Sur’s 1st district |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1348658/cayetano-replaced-as-legislative-caretaker-of-camarines-surs-1st-district |access-date=October 19, 2020 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019103612/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1348658/cayetano-replaced-as-legislative-caretaker-of-camarines-surs-1st-district |archive-date=October 19, 2020}}</ref>
