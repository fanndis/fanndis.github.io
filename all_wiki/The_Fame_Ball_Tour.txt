'''The Fame Ball Tour''' was the debut concert tour by American singer [[Lady Gaga]], in support of her debut studio album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008). North American shows began in March, followed by dates in Oceania and a solo trek through Europe. Dates in Asia soon followed, as well as two performances at England's [[V Festival]] and two shows in North America that had been postponed from April. Gaga described the tour as a traveling museum show incorporating artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s pop-performance art concept. Tickets were distributed for charity also. Alternate versions of the show with minimal variations were planned by Gaga to accommodate different venues.

The show consisted of four segments, with each segment being followed by a video interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album only. Gaga appeared on the stage in new costumes including an innovative dress made entirely of bubbles and premiered an unreleased song called "Future Love". An alternate set list with minor changes were performed after the first North American leg of the tour. The show has received  critical acclaim with critics complimenting her vocal clarity and fashion sense as well as her ability to pull off theatrics like a professional artist.

== Background ==
The tour was officially announced on January 12, 2009 through Gaga's official [[Myspace]] page. It was her first headlining tour; she has previously served as opening act for [[New Kids on the Block]]'s  [[New Kids on the Block: Live]] tour, as well as [[The Pussycat Dolls]]' [[Doll Domination Tour]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602622/20090113/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Gears Up For Pussycat Dolls Tour|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=January 13, 2009|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=November 4, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162100/http://billboard.biz/|archivedate=January 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Gaga stated,  "I consider what I do to be more of an [[Andy Warhol]] concept: pop performance art, multimedia, fashion, technology, video, film.

<blockquote>
"It's not really a tour, it's more of a traveling party. I want it to be an entire experience from [the] minute you walk in [the] front door to [the] minute I begin to sing. And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it&nbsp;— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money."<ref name="promise">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1604302/lady-gaga-promises-life-changing-experience-with-fame-ball-tour/|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Life-Changing Experience' With Fame Ball Tour|date=February 4, 2009|accessdate=February 22, 2009|last=Montgomery|first=James|publisher=MTV|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331182003/http://www.mtv.com/news/1604302/lady-gaga-promises-life-changing-experience-with-fame-ball-tour/|archivedate=March 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Gaga prepared three versions of her show to cater to different sizes of the venues she played. In an interview with ''Billboard'' she said,
<blockquote>
"I am so mental and sleepless and excited for this tour, [...] This is so different than anything you've seen from me in the past year. What's fantastic about [the show] was I was able to plan it while I was on another tour that was on a much smaller scale, opening for the Dolls. This is going to be, like, the ultimate creative orgasm for me 'cause I'm ready to move on. I'm not restricted to a certain structure for my show anymore. No limitations. I'm free. [...] I want to have a clear schedule of the dimensions for each venue so that we can properly execute all the technology and visuals. I need to mentally prepare days in advance if things are going to be taken out; otherwise, I won't have a good show...Every show's gonna be an A show by the time I'm done screaming at everyone&nbsp;– 'Hang it! Hang everything! Find a place to hang it!'

The set list consisted of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like "Fashion" from the ''[[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)|Confessions of a Shopaholic]]'' [[Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)#Soundtrack|soundtrack]] were also considered.<ref name="ready"/> In May, during an interview with ''[[Edmonton Sun]]'' Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer.

The show is mainly divided into four parts with the last part being the encore. The main show began with a video introduction called "The Heart" where Gaga appeared as alter-ego [[Andy Warhol|Candy Warhol]].<ref name="sun">{{Cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-09/features/0904100056_1_concert-review-lady-media-gaga|title=Lady Gaga's larger-than-life stage show shrinks without a band|last=Piccoli|first=Sean|date=April 9, 2009|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|accessdate=April 15, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725000704/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-04-09/features/0904100056_1_concert-review-lady-media-gaga|archivedate=July 25, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She was shown dressing up and displayed the symbol of a pink heart on her T-shirt and said "My name is Lady Gaga, and this is my Haus".<ref name="ew"/> The video was projected on a giant screen in front of the stage. As the video approached towards the end, a countdown from ten to one happened, Gaga's face was shown wearing the video sunglasses, and flames engulfed the screen as it dropped. Gaga appeared in the middle of the stage being surrounded by her dancers holding glass encrusted plates which camouflage them. She wore a futuristic black dress in geometric patterns with a triangular piece on her right breast and [[peplos|peplum]]. DJ [[Space Cowboy (musician)|Space Cowboy]] was present at a corner, playing the backing music.<ref name="ew"/> Gaga came out in the center as the plates rolled around and started singing "[[Paparazzi (Lady Gaga song)|Paparazzi]]".<ref name="chicago"/>

The performance ends with continuous clicking of the camera. Gaga comes to the top of the pillar and sings a combination of "Starstruck" and "[[LoveGame]]" as she is joined by her dancers in tracks and jackets and hands Gaga her trademark disco stick. After "LoveGame", she talks a monologue about the year "3009". And says that "The kids came out of New York and shot the paparazzi." followed by saying "It was a thousand years before when the monster first entered the city, vanished for our hearts and for our brains and for our faces (referencing to the three video interludes of the tour)" and "we knew we could co-exist with this monster with our MUSIC!!! With our art and with our fashion. My name is Lady Gaga." and tells the crowd she feels "beautiful and dirty rich" and sang "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich". This leads to the end of the first part wherein a video introduction called "The Brain" starts with Gaga appearing again as Candy Warhol and brushing her hair.<ref name="chicago"/> After the video ends, Gaga appears on the stage in a black and white [[leotard]] with high-pointed "puff" shoulders and lightning shaped symbols, while riding on a similarly colored [[vespa]].<ref name="sun"/> She then starts singing "The Fame". This is followed by a speech. Gaga said she's been "travelling the whole world, but when I get back, I can still smell the stench of greed." And then she performs "Money Honey" with the dancers who are wearing backpacks. "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" starts immediately, accompanied by hand-waving and Gaga wore a hat made of toppled [[dominoes]].<ref name="chicago"/>

Gaga then leaves the stage only to appear shortly after in a dress completely made of plastic bubbles.<ref name="chicago"/> She sits in front of a glass piano and starts singing an acoustic version of "Poker Face". She sometimes puts her leg on the piano and even plays it with her stilettos. And then, thanks the audience and surprises them by performing an unreleased and new song called "Future Love" whose lyrics referenced far-off galaxies, mechanical hearts and constellations.<ref name="Deacon 2009" /> She was surrounded by a glowing mannequin while singing the song.<ref name="hr"/> The stage had a blue setting with mechanical fog. Gaga left for a costume change as the third video interlude titled The Face starts.

After the video ended, she then came on the stage wearing a [[Ballet tutu|tutu]] shaped dress with pointed shoulder pads and peplum. Her dancers were clad in [[Louis Vuitton]] Steven Sprouse printed trousers which matched Gaga's shoes.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The backdrop changed to show blinking disco lights and Gaga stood in the center wearing her video sunglasses which display the line "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow". A remix of the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] for "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]" started and Gaga was joined by her dancers on stage. When the song shifts to the bridge, Gaga once again is handed her disco stick and performs the bridge with it. The ending shifts to a remixed version of the song. Then Gaga and the dancers, joined by DJ Space Cowboy or DJ Nicodemus, take a bow in front of the audience. Gaga comes back with her dance to perform the encore. The [[encore (concert)|encore]] of the tour consisted of "Boys, Boys, Boys" and the original version of "Poker Face". Gaga was dressed in a khaki leotard embellished with crystals. She wore an admiral's cap and gloves on her hands, both were decorated with the word Gaga on them.

=== Changes from Oceania shows ===
Since the Fame Ball show in Auckland, New Zealand, Gaga performed a different setlist during the rest of the tour, involving outfit changes as well. "Paparazzi", "LoveGame", and "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" were performed in a similar, this time tinfoil tutu with a triangular piece. "The Fame" and "Money Honey" were then followed by "Boys Boys Boys"&nbsp;– all three songs were performed in a glittering silver leotard with small pointy wings, riding a similarly colored vespa. "Just Dance" and "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" were performed in the yellow dress from the American leg of the tour. After performing "Brown Eyes" (replacing "Future Love") and "Poker Face" on the piano, Gaga closed the show with the album version of "Poker Face", wearing a nude corseted leotard embellished with crystals.<ref name="Deacon 2009">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/5833159/Lady-Gaga-at-the-O2-Academy-Brixton-review.html|title=Lady Gaga at the O2 Academy Brixton, review|last=Deacon|first=Michael|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030084302/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/5833159/Lady-Gaga-at-the-O2-Academy-Brixton-review.html|archivedate=October 30, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Reception ==

The Fame Ball Tour received acclaim from critics. Whitney Pastorek from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave a mixed review of the concert saying, "Her onstage banter was at times a bit silly and the visuals occasionally lacking in coherent theme, but her voice was strong and refreshingly free of overbearing tracking vocals. For all her cocky bluster, perhaps the most undeniable aspect of Gaga's talent is this: The girl can, and does, sing." The show was described to be a "sartorial experimentation that it made Rocky Horror look like cotillion. One presumed the Lady approved&nbsp;– and somewhere, to be sure, Andy Warhol stirred in his grave."<ref name="ew">{{Cite news|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/14/lady-gaga-live/|title=Lady GaGa live in L.A|first=Whitney|last=Pastorek|date=March 14, 2009|accessdate=March 16, 2009|work=Entertainment Weekly|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103123427/http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/03/14/lady-gaga-live/|archivedate=November 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Sheri Linden from ''[[Yahoo!]]'' gave a positive review of the concert saying "Gaga's first theater tour is a hot ticket&nbsp;– and the Lady did not disappoint. Borrowing from [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Grace Jones]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Daryl Hannah]]'s "Blade Runner" replicant, Gaga put on a compelling show revolving around her mysterious persona, a trio of leather-jacketed dancers, multiple costume changes and props and a lone DJ providing musical accompaniment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS181405+26-Jan-2009+BW20090126|title=Lady GaGa wows with big beats, bluesy surprises|first=Sheri|last=Linden|date=March 15, 2009|accessdate=March 17, 2009|agency=Reuters|publisher=Yahoo!|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106162100/http://billboard.biz/|archivedate=January 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Christopher Muther from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reviewed the concert in ''House of Blues'' and said "The combination of song and spectacle was crowd-pleasing and exhilarating.

Lynn Saxberg from the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' gave a positive review of the concert at Bronson Centre in Ottawa and said, "Accompanied by a DJ who also played a funky electric guitar, the curvy dynamo (Gaga and Space Cowboy) fronted one of wildest spectacles ever mounted at Bronson Centre, an action-packed circus of sound, lights, video images, fog and choreography. Though heavy on theatrics, there was no skimping on the music." She also commented on Gaga's fashion sense and style in her costumes by saying, "In an hour, Gaga proved her star power by packing in all her hits, displaying influences that ranged from Motown to 80s pop, and exhibiting a fearless fashion sense in several costume changes, none of which covered her bum."<ref>{{cite web|last=Saxberg|first=Lynn|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Concert+Review+Lady+Gaga+Fame+Ball/1439756/story.html|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga's Fame Ball|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=March 28, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815012102/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Concert+Review+Lady+Gaga+Fame+Ball/1439756/story.html|archivedate=August 15, 2009|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref>
