The '''Scottish Green Party''' ({{lang-gd|Pàrtaidh Uaine na h-Alba}}; {{lang-sco|Scots Green Pairtie}}; branded '''Scottish Greens''') is a [[green party|green]]<ref name="Nordsieck"/> [[List of political parties in Scotland|political party]] in [[Scotland]]. The party has six [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]] as of 2016. As of the [[2017 Scottish local elections|2017 local elections]], the party is present in six of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|Scottish local councils]], with a total of 19 councillors.

The Scottish Green Party was created in 1990 when the former [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] split into separate, independent parties, for Scotland, [[Green Party in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], and [[Green Party of England and Wales|England and Wales]]. The party is affiliated to the [[Global Greens]] and the [[European Green Party]].

Party membership increased dramatically following the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|Scottish independence referendum]],<ref>{{cite web|title=SCOTTISH GREENS THANK OVER 3,000 NEW MEMBERS|url=http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/news/scottish-greens-thank-over-3000-new-members/|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> during which it supported Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scottish independence: Greens join Yes Scotland campaign|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19858857/|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref>

==Organisation==
The Scottish Green Party is fully independent, but works closely with the other green parties of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]: the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]] and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party of Ireland]]. It is a full member of the [[European Green Party]]. The party currently has six MSPs and nineteen councillors. At the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 Westminster election]], the party contested 19 seats and polled 25,760 votes, they returned no MPs. Its highest share of the vote was 7.7% of the vote in [[Glasgow North (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North]]. In the [[European Parliament]] election of 2004, it polled 6.8% of the vote and did not return any MEPs. The party lost five of their seven seats in the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]].

According to accounts filed with the [[Electoral Commission (UK)|Electoral Commission]] for the year ending 31 December 2009, the party had an income of about £90,230 that year, an expenditure of £61,165 and a membership of 1,072.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/party-finance/database-of-registers/statements-of-accounts/soa/pdfs/soa_24-05-10_16-03-25.pdf|title=''The Scottish Green Party Statement of Accounts For The Year Ended 31 December 2009'', Electoral Commission website, retrieved 10 May 2011}}</ref>  Within days of the Scottish Independence referendum being held, the membership swelled to more than 5,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29311147 |title=Scottish referendum: 'Yes' parties see surge in members |work=BBC News |date=22 September 2014}}</ref> Launching its manifesto for the 2015 General Election, the Scottish Green Party stated a membership of over 8,500.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32106132 |title=Manifesto launch: Scottish Green Party unveils 'bold vision' |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2015}}</ref> By October 2015 the party were holding their biggest ever conference, with their membership standing at more than 9,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/13839262.Scottish_public__should_have_power_to_propose_independence_referendum_/ |title=Scottish public 'should have power to propose independence referendum' |work=The Herald |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>

The council is composed of two delegates from branches, usually branch co-convenors, representative and special interest groups. The council is currently led by Council Co-Convenors, [[Chris Ballance]] and Mags Hall.

The groups have additional meetings and discussions which are separate from the main party meetings.

==History==
The Scottish Green Party originated as the Scottish branch of the [[Ecology Party (UK)|Ecology Party]], founded in 1978 by [[Leslie Spoor]].<ref name="cockburn">Paul Cockburn, "Leslie Spoor", ''[[The Herald (Scotland)|The Herald]]'', 30 March 2011</ref>  The Ecology Party became the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] and it remained a constituent party until 1990, when the Scottish Green Party became a separate entity. The separation was entirely amicable, as part of the green commitment to [[decentralisation]]: the Scottish Green Party supported the referendum on [[Scottish independence]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/greens-show-their-colours-to-back-vote-for-independence-1-1063139 |title=Greens show their colours to back vote for independence |work=The Scotsman |date=30 July 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> and opposed Britain's entry into the [[European Common Market]] in its 1989 European election manifesto, claiming that the Common Market would cause [[mass unemployment]] for Scottish workers, force Scotland to move towards a [[tourist]]-based economy, enable the destruction of local food markets and cause catastrophic environmental damage – for this reason, the party campaigned for a Europe-wide [[confederation]] of individuals on global issues affecting the environment.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Ken|title=Greens oppose the single market|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xj1AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TlkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5282%2C6384021|accessdate=9 November 2015|work=[[The Glasgow Herald]]|date=19 May 1989|page=15}}</ref>

The Scottish Green Party has its most prominent presence in the [[Scottish Parliament]], which is elected using the [[additional member system (Scottish Parliament)|additional member system]] of [[proportional representation]]. In the first election to this Parliament, in 1999, the Scottish Green Party got one [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) elected by proportional representation, [[Robin Harper]], the UK's first elected Green parliamentarian ([[George MacLeod]] had previously represented the UK Green Party in the House of Lords).  On 1 May 2003 the Scottish Greens added six new MSPs to their previous total.

In the 2007 elections, the Party lost five seats in [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]]. However, in the council elections, taking place under the new [[Single Transferable Vote]] voting system, they gained three Councillors on the [[City of Edinburgh Council]] and five Councillors on [[Glasgow City Council]]. On 11 May, the Greens signed an agreement<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6646227.stm |title=SNP and Greens sign working deal |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/11_05_07_agreement.pdf|title=Text of ''Scottish National Party and Scottish Green Party Cooperation Agreement'' (60Kb pdf), accessed 6 January 2010}}</ref> with the [[Scottish National Party]], which meant that the Greens voted for Alex Salmond as First Minister and supported his initial Ministerial appointments. In return, the Nationalists backed a [[climate change]] bill as an early measure and promised to legislate against ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth. The SNP also agreed to nominate [[Patrick Harvie]], one of the Green MSPs, to convene one of the Holyrood committees: Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change.

On 28 January 2009, the two Green MSPs were instrumental in the defeat of the Government's budget,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7854417.stm |title=Scottish budget rejected by MSPs |work=BBC News |date=28 January 2009}}</ref> though a slightly amended version was passed easily the following week. On 31 May, Cllr Martin Ford, formerly a [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]], joined the Scottish Green Party in protest against the plans by [[Donald Trump]] to develop on an important environmental site at [[Balmedie#Menie estate|Menie]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Gordon |first=Green |url=http://www.twodoctors.org/2009/05/welcoming-martin-ford-to-the-g.html |title=Welcoming Martin Ford to the Greens. |publisher=Two Doctors |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  On 13 October 2009, he was joined by fellow former Liberal Democrat Cllr Debra Storr.<ref>{{cite web |last=Glenn |first=Stephen |url=http://www.twodoctors.org/2009/10/welcoming-debra-storr-to-the-g.html |title=Welcoming Debra Storr to the Greens. |publisher=Two Doctors |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>  Both Councillors continued to serve on Aberdeenshire Council as members of the Democratic Independent group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/councillors/political_affiliation.asp |title=Aberdeenshire Council – Councillor Political Affiliation |publisher=Aberdeenshire.gov.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103193337/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/councillors/political_affiliation.asp |archivedate=3 November 2011}}</ref> At the 2012 Scottish local elections Councillor Debra Storr stood down to concentrate on her professional career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/scottish-council-elections-fight-is-on-for-aberdeenshire-as-anne-robertson-steps-down-1-2275025 |title=Scottish council elections: Fight is on for Aberdeenshire as Anne Robertson steps down |first=Frank |last=Urquhart |work=The Scotsman |date=4 May 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> Councillor Martin Ford was re-elected, this time standing as a Scottish Green Party candidate.

After the [[Scottish Government]] announced the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on Scottish independence]], a campaign group called [[Yes Scotland]] was established to promote a vote for independence. Leading members of the Scottish Green Party actively supported and became involved with the campaign from its foundation, with Patrick Harvie among the members of Yes Scotland's Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yesscotland.net/perspective_why_a_yes_voter_needn_t_be_a_nationalist|title=Perspective: Why a Yes voter needn't be a nationalist|date=2013-01-10|accessdate=2013-04-03}}</ref> In November 2013, Edinburgh councillor [[Maggie Chapman]] succeeded Martha Wardrop as the party's female co-convenor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/u/glasgow-msp-retains-greens-leader-role.1385393124 |title=Glasgow MSP retains Greens leader role |work=[[Evening Times]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref> In December, former convenor [[Robin Harper]] said that he would "absolutely vote No" in the independence referendum and offered his backing to the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign, putting himself at odds with official party policy and its present leadership. Going on to say that he would like to help the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] and that there was a "significant minority" of Greens who were opposed to independence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/scottish-independence-robin-harper-to-vote-no-1-3218200 |title=Robin Harper to vote No |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News|Edinburgh News]] |publisher=[[Johnston Press]] |date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref> Uniquely amongst the parties in the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Green Party is open about and comfortable with the differences of opinion in the party on the constitutional issue, with co-convenor Patrick Harvie pointing out that "even the very firm supporters of independence within the Greens tend to be more strongly motivated by other aspects of our political agenda..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickharviemsp.com/2013/12/the-scottish-green-partys-worst-kept-secret/|title=Patrick Harvie MSP|work=Patrick Harvie MSP|accessdate=13 October 2016}}</ref>

In February 2005 the party announced plans to field candidates in 19 seats in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005 (Scotland)|2005 Westminster elections]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/greens-to-contest-19-seats-in-bid-to-gain-historic-first-mp-1-737796 |title=Greens to contest 19 seats in bid to gain historic first MP |work=The Scotsman |date=28 February 2005 |accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref> In February 2015, the party announced that it would field candidates in 32 seats for the [[2015 United Kingdom general election]] with 40% of their candidates being women.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/scottish-greens-set-to-field-candidates-in-32-seats.1424597966 |title=Scottish Greens set to field candidates in 32 seats
|work=[[Sunday Herald]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=22 February 2015|accessdate=22 February 2015}}</ref> In 2017 the party generated some controversy by standing only 3 candidates at the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39873325|title=General election 2017: Scottish Greens to field three candidates|publisher=BBC|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> In the 2019 [[2019  United Kingdom general election|general election]] they contested significantly more seats in 22 constituencies. They failed to win any seats and lost their deposit in every contest.

In summer 2019, a newly adopted constitution by the party leads to the [[2019 Scottish Green Party co-leadership election]], where new co-leaders are nominated. Patrick Harvie and [[Lorna Slater]] were elected as co-leaders with 43.1% and 30.2% respectively.

==Policy==

While associated mainly with [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] policies, the party has a history of support for communitarian economic policies, including well-funded, locally controlled public services within the confines of a [[steady-state economy]], is supportive of [[proportional representation]] and takes a progressive approach to social policies. The party is also strongly opposed to both [[nuclear power]] and the [[Trident nuclear programme]].<ref>[https://greens.scot/policy/energy Energy]. 'And we will not build new nuclear power plants because they can never be democratically-controlled, decentralised, delivered or decommissioned without massive subsidy'.

We would explore options such as: issuing guidance to Police Scotland not to enforce charges against nonviolent activists involved in protests against the Faslane base and shipments of nuclear weapons on Scottish roads; amending the Marine Scotland Act to include a ban on the movement of nuclear weapons through Scottish waters; and ending government support for businesses involved in the supply chain for Trident'.

According to the party's website, the Scottish Greens are committed to forming a [[sustainable development in Scotland|sustainable society]] and are guided by four interconnected principles:

*[[Ecology]]: Our [[Environment of Scotland|environment]] is the basis upon which every society is formed. Whenever we damage our environment, we damage ourselves. Respect for our environment is therefore essential.
*[[Egalitarianism|Equality]]: A society that is not socially and economically just cannot be sustainable. Only when released from immediate [[poverty]] can individuals be expected to take responsibility for wider issues. Our society must be founded on cooperation and respect. We campaign hard against [[discrimination]] on grounds of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[disability]], [[aging|age]] or [[religion]].
*[[Radical democracy]]: Politics is too often conducted in a polarised, confrontational atmosphere and in a situation remote from those that it affects. We must develop decentralised, participative systems that encourage individuals to control the decisions that affect their own lives.
*[[Peace]] and [[nonviolence]]: Violence at all levels of human interaction must be rejected and succeeded by relations characterised by flexibility, respect and fairness.

The party claims that, taken together, these principles give the party a [[Holism|holistic]] view that is in common with all [[Green party|Green parties]] around the world.<ref>[http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/site/4315 ''The Principles of the Scottish Green Party'', party website, accessed 28 December 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412055649/http://www.scottishgreens.org.uk/site/4315 |date=12 April 2010 }}</ref>

==Councillors==
Prior to the [[2007 Scottish local elections|2007]] elections, the Party had only ever elected one councillor at local level: in May 1990, Roger (aka Rory) Winter, representing the Highland Green Party (''Uainich na Gàidhealtachd''), was elected in [[Nairn]] as Scotland's first Green regional councillor to the then [[Highland Regional Council]]. Cllr Winter broke away from the Greens in 1991 and continued his four-year term as an Independent Green Highlander.

The party made its first major breakthroughs at council level in the 2007 local elections, electing 8 councillors between Glasgow City and the City of Edinburgh Councils.

In the [[2012 Scottish local elections|2012]] local elections this was increased to 14. The party elected councillors for the first time to Aberdeenshire, Stirling & [[Midlothian Council]]s.

At the [[2017 Scottish local elections|2017]] local elections, the party returned a record 19 councillors, including elected councillors to [[Orkney Islands Council]] for the first time. However, the party lost its sole councillor on Midlothian Council.
