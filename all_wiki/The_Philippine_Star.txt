==History==
[[File:Front page of the first-ever issue of The Philippine STAR.jpg|thumb|left|The first issue of ''The Philippine Star'' with the headline, "''Wear yellow and die!''"]]

===Founding===
''The Philippine Star'' was first published seven months after the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and propelled [[Corazon Aquino]] to the [[President of the Philippines|Philippine presidency]].<ref name="Beginnings">{{cite news|last=Yu|first=Doreen|url=http://www.philstar.com/supplements/710349/beginnings-philippine-star|title=The beginnings of The Philippine Star|date=28 July 2011|newspaper=The Philippine Star|access-date=6 May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515094727/https://www.philstar.com/other-sections/supplements/2011/07/28/710349/beginnings-philippine-star|archive-date=May 15, 2019}}</ref> Before its establishment, founders Betty Go-Belmonte, Max Soliven and Art Borjal were veteran journalists involved in the "Mosquito Press", a collective name for the different newspapers critical of the Marcos administration that were published after the [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law era]] from 1972 to 1981.<ref name="Betty6">{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/01/28/1283818/20-years-later-betty-go-belmonte-shines|title=20 years later, Betty Go-Belmonte shines on|last=Ramirez|first=Joanne Rae|date=28 January 2014|work=The Philippine Star|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928023501/http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/01/28/1283818/20-years-later-betty-go-belmonte-shines-on|archive-date=September 28, 2018|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref> At that time, Belmonte was the publisher of a small, monthly magazine called ''The Star'', a predecessor of ''The Philippine Star''.<ref name="Betty1">{{cite web|url=http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/rws/article/viewFile/3153/2960|title=Betty Go-Belmonte: A Filipino Chinese Breaking Barriers|last=Lopez|first=Jade|year=2012|work=Review of Women's Studies|publisher=[[University of the Philippines Diliman]]|access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

On 9 December 1985, a few months before the 1986 People Power Revolution, Belmonte, Soliven, and Borjal, together with [[Eugenia Apostol]], [[Louie Beltran]], and [[Florangel Rosario-Braid]], founded the English-language newspaper ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', which soon became the Marcos administration's most vocal critic. However, after the revolution, questions about finances and a divergence of priorities caused a rift among the ''Inquirer'''s founders, which led to Belmonte, Soliven, and Borjal's founding of ''The Philippine Star''. Belmonte served as the founding chairman of the Board of Directors, while Soliven acted as the founding publisher and chairman of the Editorial Board.<ref name=Beginnings/><ref name=Betty1/> Antonio Roces served as the first [[editor-in-chief]] until his resignation in 1989.

===Early years===
The first issue of the newspaper on 28 July 1986 had eight pages, no advertisements and carried the headline, "Wear yellow and die" that featured the death of 23-year-old Stephen Salcedo, a bystander killed by a mob of Marcos loyalists during a rally at [[Manila]]'s [[Luneta Park]]. The masthead of the newspaper carried the motto, "Truth Shall Prevail", reflecting its editorial policy of presenting both sides of the story instead of the prevailing "scoop mentality" of that time.<ref name=Betty1/> Aside from the main news section, the first issue also includes the World, Nation, Money, Life and Sports sections.

The first issue of ''The Philippine Star'' was printed at Philstar Daily, Inc.'s printing press in Port Area, Manila and made use of a blue and yellow color scheme, which eventually became its signature colors. For its initial price of ₱1.75, the newspaper had an initial print run of “a few thousand copies”.<ref name=Beginnings/>

At first, the newspaper was only published from Mondays to Saturdays because Belmonte prohibited work on Sundays. To capitalize on Sunday readership, Philstar Daily, Inc. began publishing ''Starweek'' in 1987, which served as the Sunday magazine of ''The Philippine Star''. Eventually, in 1988, the newspaper added a Sunday issue in response to the demand for news on that day, while continuing its publication of ''Starweek''. Aside from ''The Philippine Star'', Philstar Daily, Inc. also started publishing a Filipino-language tabloid ''Ang Pilipino Ngayon'', which eventually became ''Pilipino Star Ngayon''.

===Soliven era===
With the sudden death of Belmonte due to cancer on 28 January 1994, Soliven assumed chairmanship of the Board of Directors while retaining his position as publisher. He appointed Belmonte's 30-year-old son, Miguel Belmonte, as executive vice president. In the same year, the newspaper made use of the slogan "The only paper you read from cover to cover", in keeping with the new editorial policy of improving every single section of the paper so each can stand on its own even without the main news section. On 4 August 1995, ''The Philippine Star'' became the first Philippine broadsheet newspaper to publish a colored front page.

===Miguel Belmonte era===
In 1998, the Board of Directors unanimously appointed Miguel Belmonte as president and CEO, while Soliven remained as chairman of the Board of Directors and publisher. The following year, the newspaper introduced “Hotline 2000”, which made use of [[short messaging service|SMS]] as a means for [[opinion polling]], thus becoming a pioneer in [[televoting]] in the Philippine print media industry. It was the beginning of other digital endeavors that brought the newspaper to the [[Information Age|Digital Age]]. In 2000, the newspaper debuted its website, ''philstar.com'', thus becoming one of the first newspapers in the Philippines to have a presence in the [[Internet]]. In the same year, the company began using computer-to-plate printing system. In that year too, Miguel's brother, Isaac Belmonte, was appointed editor-in-chief of the newspaper.

To further expand its readership, ''The Philippine Star'' entered into a partnership with [[fast food]] restaurant [[Jollibee]] in 2003 to become the first newspaper to be distributed free of charge in a fast food restaurant. A complimentary copy of the newspaper was given to Jollibee patrons nationwide for every purchase of a Jollibee [[breakfast|breakfast meal]].

On 24 August 2004, ''The Philippine Star'' acquired [[Cebu City|Cebu City-based]] English-language newspaper ''[[The Freeman]]'' and its sister publication, the [[Cebuano language|Cebuano-language]] tabloid ''Banat'' as part of its strategy to strengthen its presence and influence in the Visayas-Mindanao region. ''The Freeman'' is the longest-running broadsheet newspaper in Cebu City, established on 10 May 1919, while ''Banat'' was first published on 23 August 1994. Both newspapers are owned by the influential Gullas political family.<ref name=Demecillo>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/the-freeman/cebu-news/2019/07/22/1936832/freeman-century-fair-and-fearless-journalism|title=The FREEMAN: A century of fair and fearless journalism|first=Jean Marvette|last=Demecillo|publisher=The Freeman|date=22 July 2019|access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=Loop>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/food-and-leisure/2012/08/02/833871/freeman-celebrates-its-93rd-anniversary|title='Freeman' celebrates its 93rd anniversary|first=Honey|last=Jarque-Loop|publisher=The Freeman|date=2 August 2012|access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref><ref name=Lacamiento>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/02/22/1895857/freeman-celebrates-100th-year|title=The Freeman celebrates 100th year|last=Lacamiento|first=Grace Melanie|date=22 February 2019|website=The Freeman|access-date=12 September 2020}}</ref>

The newspaper lost its founding publisher after Soliven died in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] on 24 November 2006. Isaac Belmonte eventually replaced him as publisher and chairman of the Editorial Board in 2012. Former executive editor Ana Marie Pamintuan serves as current editor-in-chief after replacing Isaac Belmonte in 2012.

===Acquisition by PLDT===
As early 2009, businessman and [[PLDT]] chairman [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]] had expressed his interest in acquiring a stake in ''The Philippine Star'' in a bid to dominate the multimedia industry. The following year, Pangilinan's MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., the media conglomerate of PLDT, acquired a 20-percent stake in the newspaper, as well as an 18-percent stake in its rival ''Philippine Daily Inquirer''. In 2014, MediaQuest finally took control of ''The Philippine Star'' after it acquired a majority stake of 51 percent in the newspaper. The Belmonte family retained a 21-percent stake, as well as management and editorial control. MediaQuest chairman Pangilinan has since appointed lawyer Ray Espinosa as chairman of the newspaper’s Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Agcaoili|first=Lawrence|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/04/01/1307461/mvp-gets-51-star|title=MVP gets 51% of Star|date=1 April 2014|newspaper=The Philippine Star|access-date=5 August 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215841/https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/04/01/1307461/mvp-gets-51-star|archive-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>
 
''The Philippine Star'' acquired the 76.67-percent stake of Hastings Holdings, Inc. in its sister broadsheet ''[[BusinessWorld]]'' in 2015. The transaction was done to enhance to its market leadership and to strengthen ''BusinessWorld'''s position in the newspaper business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/business/113893/philstar-acquires-77-percent-of-businessworld|title=Philstar acquires 77-percent of BusinessWorld|date=July 9, 2015|publisher=Interaksyon.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313140245/http://www.interaksyon.com/business/113893/philstar-acquires-77-percent-of-businessworld|archive-date=March 13, 2016|access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>
