==History==
{{main|History of General Motors}}
[[William C. Durant]]'s [[Durant-Dort Carriage Company]], of [[Flint, Michigan]], had become the leading manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States by 1900. Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the [[Buick|Buick Motor Company]] in 1904.<ref name="horses">{{cite web |url=http://www.gm.com/corporate/about/history/historyPopUp.jsp?0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115004/http://www.gm.com/corporate/about/history/historyPopUp.jsp?0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 2, 2009 |title=GM History |publisher=General Motors Company |accessdate=February 9, 2011 }}</ref> Durant formed the ''General Motors Company'' in 1908 as a [[holding company]], with partner [[Charles Stewart Mott]]. GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then [[Oldsmobile]] on November 12, 1908. In 1909 Durant brought in [[Cadillac]], [[Elmore (automobile)|Elmore]], [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland]] (predecessor of [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]), and the Reliance Motor Truck Company of [[Owosso, Michigan]] and the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of [[Pontiac, Michigan]] (predecessors of [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]). Durant, with the board's approval, tried acquiring [[Ford Motor Company]] in 1909.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.corvettereport.com/general-motors-tries-to-buy-ford-in-1909-what/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 7, 2020 |archive-date=February 23, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200223065000/http://www.corvettereport.com/general-motors-tries-to-buy-ford-in-1909-what/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Durant over-leveraged the fledgling company in making these acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the behest of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1910,_The_Founder_Departs_._._._for_Now |title=GM 1910 the founder departs |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213055217/http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1910,_The_Founder_Departs_._._._for_Now |archive-date=December 13, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Durant re-entered the automotive industry the following year by co-founding the [[Chevrolet|Chevrolet Motor Company]] with Swiss race car driver [[Louis Chevrolet]] (who left the company bearing his name in 1915). In 1916 GM was reincorporated in [[Detroit]] as ''General Motors Corporation''. By 1917 the Chevrolet Motor Company had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of [[Samuel McLaughlin]] and [[Pierre S. du Pont]], reacquired a controlling interest in GM. Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918. Only two years later du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with [[Alfred P. Sloan]].

Sloan established annual styling changes, making previous years' models "dated". He also implemented the pricing strategy that all car companies use today. The pricing strategy had Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac priced from least expensive to most, respectively.

General Motors grew in prominence surpassing Ford Motors selling just over 50% of car sales in 1962. With the prominence of the company, president of General Motors, Charlie Wilson said it best - “What’s good for General Motors is good for America”.

Their industrial dominance was displayed as they manufactured products other than cars and trucks such as [[aircraft]] ([[North American Aviation]]), [[Heavy equipment|construction equipment]] ([[Terex]]), [[Train|trains]] ([[Electro-Motive Diesel]]), Farm tractors ([[Samson Tractor]]/[[Janesville Assembly Plant|Janesville Machine Co.]]), Truck and boat engines([[Detroit Diesel]]&[[Allison Engine Company]], and [[Home appliance|appliances]] ([[Frigidaire]]).

Prior to their sale to [[Groupe PSA]] in 2017, [[Opel]] was the main GM brand name in Europe except in the United Kingdom, where GM's British subsidiary, [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]], used its own "Vauxhall" brand name.

After having lost approximately $18B over 12 years, GM began phasing out mainstream sales of Chevrolet in Europe in late 2013, and finished by late 2015, to focus on Opel/Vauxhall.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/us-generalmotors-chevy-idUSBRE9B407W20131205|title=GM to drop Chevy brand in Europe to focus on Opel|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 21, 2013|work=Reuters|archive-date=December 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224121015/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/us-generalmotors-chevy-idUSBRE9B407W20131205|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/cn/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2013/Dec/1205_chevy_europe.html|title=GM Strengthens its European Brand Strategy|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 21, 2013|archive-date=December 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224104525/http://media.gm.com/content/media/cn/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/cn/en/2013/Dec/1205_chevy_europe.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Chevrolets continue to be sold in [[Russia]] and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], through the [[GM Uzbekistan]] joint venture.

The company manufactures most of its China market vehicles locally. [[Shanghai GM]], a joint venture with the Chinese company [[SAIC Motor]], was created with Canadian Regal in 1990 on March 25, 1997. The Shanghai GM plant was officially opened on December 15, 1998, when the first Chinese-built Buick came off the assembly line. The [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] joint-venture is also successfully selling microvans under the [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile|Wuling]] brand (34 percent owned by GM). Much of General Motors' recent growth has been in the People's Republic of China, where its sales rose 66.9 percent in 2009, selling 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4 percent of the market.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.4wheelsnews.com/gms-china-vehicle-sales-in-2009-rose-66.9-percent/ |author=Andrew C |title=GM's China vehicle sales in 2009 rose 66.9 percent |publisher=4wheelsnow.com |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111007001352/http://www.4wheelsnews.com/gms-china-vehicle-sales-in-2009-rose-66.9-percent/ |archivedate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>

[[SAIC-GM-Wuling]] established the low-cost [[Baojun]] brand to better compete with domestic rivals, [[Chery Automobile|Chery]], [[Geely Automobile|Geely]] and [[BYD Auto|BYD]] for first-time buyers of cars priced around US$10,000. It is estimated that such a market in China is about 5 million vehicles a year, larger than the auto market in France and Britain combined. However, some are worried that 'local brands like [[Baojun]] could eventually become threats to their parent brands if they compete more against established models over time'. Shanghai-GM-Wuling sold 1.23 million vehicles in 2010, mainly commercial vans and trucks, of which about 700,000 units were a van called Sunshine.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/21/us-gm-china-idUKTRE73K07920110421 |title=GM's Baojun lineup in China could expand quickly |date=April 20, 2011 |first=Ben |last=Klayman |work=Reuters |access-date=July 1, 2017 |archive-date=October 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015230817/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/21/us-gm-china-idUKTRE73K07920110421 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In August 2011, GM announced plans to reactivate its plant that previously produced rebadged Chevrolet Blazer as Opel as well as Brazilian Blazer, and also build a new plant in [[Bekasi]], [[West Java]], Indonesia, which would produce 40,000 passenger cars per year for the [[Southeast Asian]] market.

In 2017, GM exited the Indian market, which it had entered for the second time in 1996. The first time was in 1928 when it became the first car maker to manufacture cars in India. GM would, however, continue to manufacture cars from its [[Talegaon Dhamdhere|Talegaon]], [[Maharashtra]] plant for the export market. This plant has a capacity of 1,60,000 units annually. The older Halol, Gujarat plant with a capacity for 50,000 units stopped production on April 28, 2017. It will be sold, with GM in talks with China's [[SAIC Motor]] Corporation Ltd. The India arm's domestic sales for April 2016 – March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17 percent to 0.85 percent for the same period. However, exports surged 89 percent during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in Bengaluru, India will continue doing its global work. About 400 employees, 8 percent of GM's total Indian work-force, would be affected by the pull-out. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India. It will also affect 10,000 employees working with about 120 Outlets/Dealership of GM in India.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/gms-india-exit-the-episodic-events-of-shock-confusion-and-failure/58814677 |title=GM's India Exit: The episodic events of shock, confusion and failure - ET Auto |work=ET Auto |access-date=May 5, 2017 |archive-date=May 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524184753/http://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/gms-india-exit-the-episodic-events-of-shock-confusion-and-failure/58814677 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/general-motors-to-stop-india-sales-on-rising-losses/articleshow/58742167.cms |title=General Motors to stop India sales on rising losses - Times of India |work=The Times of India |access-date=May 5, 2017 |archive-date=May 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529095947/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/general-motors-to-stop-india-sales-on-rising-losses/articleshow/58742167.cms |url-status=live }}</ref>

According to the South Korean unit of General Motors, its domestic sales for March dropped by 58 percent, which is more than half compared to the past year. In February 2018, General Motors had said to shut down one factory and then decide what lies ahead for the remaining three plants in South Korea during rising losses there. In recent years, the US automaker pulled its Chevy brand from Europe which wedged GM Korea's exports since it was a major market for the Korean firm.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-southkorea/gm-koreas-march-domestic-sales-slump-58-percent-as-restructuring-weighs-idUSKCN1H90BX|title=GM Korea's March sales dive; seeks to halt one shift at Bupyeong plant|last1=Choi|first1=Haejin|last2=Jin|first2=Hyunjoo|location=U.S.|date=April 2, 2018|access-date=April 3, 2018|archive-date=April 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403112545/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-southkorea/gm-koreas-march-domestic-sales-slump-58-percent-as-restructuring-weighs-idUSKCN1H90BX|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Africa===
GM has a long history in [[Egypt]] which began in the 1920s with the assembly of cars and light pickup trucks for the local market. In the mid of the 1950s, GM withdrew from the Egyptian market. Some years later, the [[Ghabbour Group|Ghabbour Brothers]] began to assemble [[Cadillac]], [[Chevrolet]] and [[Buick]] models up to the 1990s. Since 1983 GM and [[Al-Monsour Automotive|Al-Monsour Automotive Company]] have owned [[General Motors Egypt]], which is currently the only manufacturer of traditional GM branded vehicles in Egypt.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the 1920s ''Miller Brothers Nigeria'' was founded as an importer of commercial vehicles of the Bedford brand into the country. In 1949, the company opened its own assembly plant and operated under the name [[Niger]]/[[Nigeria]] Motors. In 1965 the plant and its distribution network were split into different companies and renamed as Federated Motors Industries. In 1991 the company was taken in by a joint venture between '''General Motors''' and UACN of [[Nigeria]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Another manufacturing base of the GM for the African markets is the [[Industries Mécaniques Maghrébines]] headquartered in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], which assembles Isuzu and Mazda models for the Maghreb region.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Formed in 1975, General Motors East Africa (GMEA) was the largest assembler of commercial vehicles in the region exporting them from Kenya to East and Central African countries including [[Uganda]], Tanzania, [[Malawi]], Rwanda and [[Burundi]]. Its facility located in [[Nairobi]] assembled a wide range of Isuzu trucks and buses including the popular Isuzu N-Series versatile light commercial vehicle, TF Series pick-ups and Isuzu bus chassis. In addition to assembly, GMEA also marketed the [[Chevrolet]] products [[Chevrolet Spark|Spark]] and Optra. Selling entire GM's 57.7 per cent stake in General Motors East Africa to Isuzu was announced on February 28, 2017.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Muchira |first1=Njiraini |title=General Motors to exit East Africa with sale of stake to Isuzu |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/General-Motors-exit-East-Africa-sale-stake-to-Isuzu/2560-3831344-wfiylw/index.html |newspaper=The EastAfrican |date=February 28, 2017 |access-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224214058/http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/General-Motors-exit-East-Africa-sale-stake-to-Isuzu/2560-3831344-wfiylw/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> After finishing the sale, GMEA was renamed to Isuzu East Africa Limited, effective from August 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Agutu|first1=Nancy|title=General Motors changes name to Isuzu East Africa|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/08/02/general-motors-changes-name-to-isuzu-east-africa_c1609291|newspaper=The Star|location=Kenya|date=August 2, 2017|access-date=December 24, 2017|archive-date=December 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225034848/https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/08/02/general-motors-changes-name-to-isuzu-east-africa_c1609291|url-status=live}}</ref>

General Motors began operating in South Africa in 1913 through its wholly owned subsidiary, [[General Motors South Africa]] and was a market which briefly had its own local brand, [[Ranger (automobile)|Ranger]]. Following the passage of the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act]] in 1986, GM was forced to divest from South Africa, and GMSA became the independent Delta Motor Corporation. GM purchased a 49% stake in Delta in 1997 following the end of [[apartheid]], and acquired the remaining 51% in 2004, reverting the company to its original name. By 2014 it was targeting the production of 50,000 cars a year but was being hampered by national labor unrest, strikes and protests.<ref name="GMsouthafrica">{{cite news|title=South Africa arm of General Motors hit by wage strike shuts plant|url=http://www.southafricanews.net/index.php/sid/223524973/scat/371b1b8643d479c1/ht/South-Africa-arm-of-General-Motors-hit-by-wage-strike-shuts-plant|accessdate=July 5, 2014|publisher=South Africa News.Net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213434/http://www.southafricanews.net/index.php/sid/223524973/scat/371b1b8643d479c1/ht/South-Africa-arm-of-General-Motors-hit-by-wage-strike-shuts-plant|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> GM exited the South Africa market in 2017 by selling part of the business to Isuzu and look for a buyer for the rest of the business.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Snavely|first1=Brent|title=GM to stop selling vehicles in once-promising India, exit South Africa|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/2017/05/18/gm-india-south-africa/329280001/|accessdate=May 18, 2017|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=May 18, 2017|archive-date=May 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518120528/http://www.freep.com/story/money/2017/05/18/gm-india-south-africa/329280001/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Oceania===
In New Zealand, GM was represented by locally assembled Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac, and Pontiac vehicles from 1926, and Vauxhall cars from 1931. After World War II, the local production of Chevrolet and Vauxhalls resumed followed by Pontiac again in 1959.

In 1954 sales of fully imported [[Holden]] vehicles into New Zealand began. New Zealand assembly of Holdens began in 1957 and by the end of the 1960s Holdens replaced all Chevrolets and Pontiacs (both in 1968), and most Vauxhalls. Opel, Bedford, and Isuzu, vehicles were assembled or imported at different times during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. All local General Motors assembly plants in New Zealand closed by 1990. GM New Zealand was renamed [[Holden New Zealand]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fourie|first1=Louis|title=On a Global Mission: The Automobiles of General Motors International Volume 3|date=2016|publisher=Friesen Press|page=1137|edition=1st}}</ref>

Despite its announcement, GM will continue to have some presence in Australia, as they plan to export some Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, and GMC vehicles through a new entity called General Motors Specialty Vehicles, as plans are still on track to bring American-built brands to the region, which was announced before Holden's shutdown.<ref name="caradvice-holden-axed">{{cite web |last1=Dowling |first1=Joshua |title=Holden axed in Australia as General Motors gets out of right-hand-drive globally |url=https://www.caradvice.com.au/827459/holden-axed-in-australia-as-general-motors-gets-out-of-right-hand-drive-globally/ |website=CarAdvice.com |publisher=CarAdvice.com Pty Limited |accessdate=February 17, 2020 |language=en-AU |date=February 17, 2020 |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217022358/https://www.caradvice.com.au/827459/holden-axed-in-australia-as-general-motors-gets-out-of-right-hand-drive-globally/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2020/02/gm-shutting-down-australias-holden-brand-pulling-chevrolet-out-of-thailand/ |title=GM Shutting Down Australia's Holden Brand, Pulling Chevrolet Out of Thailand |first=Paul A. |last=Eisenstein |work=The Detroit Bureau |location=US |date=February 17, 2020 |access-date=February 22, 2020 |archive-date=February 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200217173513/https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2020/02/gm-shutting-down-australias-holden-brand-pulling-chevrolet-out-of-thailand/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

GM's engines were highly successful in the [[Indy Racing League]] (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small [[V8 engine|V-8]] class. GM has also done much work in the [[development of electronics for GM auto racing]]. An unmodified Aurora V-8 in the Aerotech, captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the [[Cadillac V-Series]] has entered motorsports racing.

GM has also used many cars in the American racing series [[NASCAR]]. Currently the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Chevrolet Camaro ZL1]] is the only entry in the series, but in the past the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Buick Regal]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]], [[Chevrolet Lumina]], [[Chevrolet Malibu]], [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]], [[Chevrolet Impala]], and the [[Chevrolet SS]] were also used. GM has won a total of 40 [[NASCAR Cup Series]] [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|manufacturer's championships]], including 34 with Chevrolet, the most of any make in NASCAR history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. GM leads all other automobile manufacturers in races won in NASCAR's premier series at 1,011. Chevrolet leads individual makes with 677 wins.

In Australia, there is the [[Supercars Championship]] which is battled out by the two main rivals of (GM) [[Holden]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. The current [[Holden]] Racing Team cars are based on the [[Holden Commodore]] and run a 5.0-litre V8-cylinder engine producing {{convert|635|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. These cars have a top speed of {{convert|298|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} and run 0–100&nbsp;km/h in 3.8 seconds. The [[Holden Racing Team]] is Australia's most successful team in Australian touring car history. In 2006 and 2007, the drivers' championship was won by the very closely linked (now defunct) [[HSV Dealer Team]]. With Holden's demise in 2020, GM is expected to make the exported Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 the successor-in-line to the Holden Commodore once existing deals are completed.

==Research and development==
{{See also|General Motors Technical Center|General Motors Proving Grounds}}
[[Research and development]] (R&D) at General Motors began organically as the continuation of such R&D as the various divisions (e.g., Cadillac, Buick, Olds, Oakland) were already doing for themselves before the merger. Its character was entirely empirical; it was whatever key people in each company had been competent enough to organize and pursue.
[[Robert McLaughlin (industrialist)|R. S. McLaughlin]]'s Carriage Company in 1876 was designing and inventing Carriage Gear. The [[McLaughlin Motor Car Company|McLaughlin Companies]] became General Motors of Canada Limited.
[[Charles F. Kettering]]'s Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), at [[Dayton, Ohio]], was still an independent firm at this time. Its work was well known to GM central management through its relationship as a supplier and consultancy to Cadillac and Buick.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 1916, Durant organized the United Motors Corporation as an amalgamation of parts suppliers, supplying GM and other OEMs but independent of GM.<ref name="Sloan1964pp24,97">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=24, 97}}.</ref> [[Alfred P. Sloan]], head of the newly acquired [[Hyatt Roller Bearing Corporation]], became United Motors' CEO. United Motors acquired Delco, and Kettering began his association with Sloan. United Motors also acquired at this time the original Remy corporation<ref name="Sloan1964pp24,97"/> (called the Remy Electric Company), a competitor of Delco. In 1918 General Motors bought United Motors.<ref name="Sloan1964pp24,97"/> Various entities grew out of the original Delco and Remy, including the Dayton Metal Products Corporation, the General Motors Research Corporation, the Delco Division and Remy Electric Division of GM, Delco Remy (now [[Remy International, Inc.]]), [[ACDelco]], [[Delco Electronics]], and others. Today's main successor corporation is [[Delphi Automotive]], which nowadays is an independent parent corporation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The General Motors Research Corporation, at Dayton under Kettering, became a true automotive research center. During the next few decades, it led to the development of:
* Many electrical-appliance features for cars and trucks
* In 1911, Charles F. Kettering, with Henry M. Leland, of Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (DELCO) invented and filed U.S. Patent 1,150,523 for the [[Starter (engine)|first electric starter]] in America.
* In 1921, General Motors patented the use of [[Tetraethyllead]] as an antiknock agent leading to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency even though much later it was realized that lead in gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans.<ref name="Kitman">Kitman, J.

Although GM R&D (as it is known in colloquial shorthand) began as an organization largely built around one man (Kettering), it eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them. World War II was a turning point wherein military affairs, after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years, first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them. Civilian life, too, changed in this direction. By the 1950s, corporations such as GM and many others were facing a new era of R&D, different from earlier ones. Less about genius inventors and individual inventions, and more about organizational progress and integrated systems, it raised new questions about where the [[capital (economics)|capital]] for R&D would come from in an era of limitless demand for R&D (although not necessarily for production). [[Alfred P. Sloan|Alfred Sloan]], longtime CEO of GM (1920s to 1960s), discussed in his memoir (also considered a seminal management treatise) the relationships between government, academia, and private industry in the areas of basic science and applied science, in light of this new era.<ref name="Sloan1964pp249-252">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=249–252}}.</ref> The views he laid out reflected (and influenced) wide consensus on these relationships that persists largely to today.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Today, GM R&D, headquartered in [[Warren, Michigan]], is a network of six laboratories, six science offices, and collaborative relationships in over twelve countries including working relationships with universities, government groups, suppliers, and other partners from across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.phmsociety.org/node/244 |title=General Motors Global R&D |publisher=Prognostics and Health Management Society |location=US |year=2013 |access-date=August 30, 2018 |archive-date=August 31, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831035447/https://www.phmsociety.org/node/244 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On September 7, 2014, at the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit GM disclosed it would be introducing auto-pilot features into certain 2017 models of its cars, which would go on sale in 2016.

In October 2017, General Motors acquired Strobe, a solid state [[LIDAR]] company. Strobe's prototypes produce brief "chirps" of frequency-modulated (FM) laser light, where the frequency within each chirp varies linearly. Measuring the phase and frequency of the echoing chirp allows the system to directly measure both the distance and the velocity of objects in the road ahead.

==Small car sales==
[[File:Chevrolet Aveo RS concept front.jpg|thumb|Chevrolet Aveo Concept]]

From the 1920s onward, General Motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economy-car and small-car policies should be.<ref name="Sloan1964pp313-339">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=313–339}}, Chapter 18, "The corporation overseas".</ref><ref name="Sloan1964pp440-442">{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=440–442}}.</ref> The economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped, although a strong distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the U.S. market and policies for other markets. Economy (in some form) always had good demand anywhere, but its definition in the U.S. was long considered different from that in other markets. In this view, "economy" in the U.S. did not mean "small" in the sense of what qualified as "small" outside the U.S. The policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non-U.S. markets than in the U.S., and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country, either as some variant of [[knock-down kit|knockdown]] or with truly extensive domestic sourcing.<ref name="Sloan1964pp313-339"/> GM's acquisitions of Vauxhall Motors Ltd (UK, 1925)<ref name="Sloan1964pp313-339"/> and Adam Opel AG (Germany, 1929),<ref name="Sloan1964pp313-339"/> rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them, were based on analyses that convinced GM managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision.<ref name="Sloan1964pp313-339"/>

Although GM since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the U.S. market (relative to that market's definition in any given decade), and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the U.S. market,<ref name="Sloan1964pp440-442"/> it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the U.S. market in the 1970s through 1990s. GM's response has been that it has always responded to market demands and that most Americans, despite anything they said to the contrary, did not actually demand (at purchasing-decision time) small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent. Although some U.S. consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose (such as 1973 and 1979), they flocked equally enthusiastically to SUVs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Since the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s, GM's interest in truly small-car programs for the U.S. market has been renewed. As part of General Motors Company development, GM revived one of its idled U.S. factories for the production of a small car in [[Orion, Michigan]], with the creation of 1,200 jobs. This will be the first time that GM produced a [[sub compact car]] in the United States since the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] ended production in 1986. This retooled plant will be capable of building 160,000 cars annually, including both small and compact vehicles.

General Motors has published principles regarding the environment and maintains an extensive website to inform the public. In 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free. In order to achieve its landfill-free status, production waste is recycled or reused in the manufacturing process.<ref>{{cite pr|title=GM Surpasses Landfill-Free Facilities Commitment|url=http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2010/Dec/1213_landfill.html|website=GM.com|accessdate=March 8, 2017|archive-date=August 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807113946/http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2010/Dec/1213_landfill.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

GM has long worked on [[alternative fuel vehicle|alternative-technology vehicles]], and has led the industry with ethanol-burning [[flexible-fuel vehicle]]s that can run on either [[E85]] (ethanol) or gasoline. The company was the first to use [[turbocharger]]s and was an early proponent of [[V6 engine]]s in the 1960s, but quickly lost interest as [[muscle car]] popularity increased. They demonstrated<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php |title=America's First Turbine Car |publisher=Conklin Systems |date=November 21, 1952 |accessdate=December 4, 2010 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927183610/http://www.conklinsystems.com/firebird/mlife.php |url-status=live }}</ref> [[gas turbine]] vehicles powered by [[kerosene]], an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, GM pushed the benefits of [[diesel engine]]s and [[cylinder deactivation]] technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the [[Oldsmobile]] diesels and drivability issues in the [[Cadillac]] V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines. In 1987, GM, in conjunction with [[AeroVironment]], built the [[Sunraycer]], which won the inaugural [[World Solar Challenge]] and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the [[General Motors EV1]].<ref>{{cite web|title=General Motors 'SunRaycer'|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1299505|website=Smithsonian Institution|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=March 8, 2017|archive-date=March 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034108/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1299505|url-status=live}}</ref>

===All-electric vehicles===
[[File:EV1 (6).jpg|thumb|The [[electric car|all-electric]] [[General Motors EV1]] was introduced in California in 1996]]
[[File:Chevrolet Bolt EV SAO 2016 8894.jpg|thumb|The [[Chevrolet Bolt EV]] was released in California by late 2016]]

General Motors was the first company (in the modern era) to release an all-electric automobile.<ref name="VDI"/> In 1990, GM debuted the "Impact" concept car at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It was the first car with zero-emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was eventually produced as the [[EV1]] for the 1996 model year. It was available through dealers located in only a few regions (e.g., California, Arizona, Georgia). Vehicles were leased, rather than sold, to individuals. In 1999 GM decided to cease production of the vehicles. When the individual leases had expired, they declined to renew the leases or allow the lessors to purchase them. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors and, with the exception of a few which were donated to museums, all were destroyed. The documentary film ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' covered the EV1 story.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/06/sunday/main3239838.shtml |title=Could the electric car save us? |publisher=CBS News |location=US |date=September 6, 2007 |access-date=June 24, 2017 |archive-date=August 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829092212/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/06/sunday/main3239838.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

The EV1's cancellation had disappointed supporters of electric vehicles.

==Labor conflicts==

===Flint sit-down strike===
{{Main|Flint sit-down strike}}
[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike sleeping.jpg|thumb|Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats]]

The 1936–1937 [[Flint sit-down strike]] against General Motors changed the [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW) from a collection of isolated [[local union|locals]] on the fringes of the industry into a major [[labor union]] and led to the unionization of the domestic [[United States]] [[automobile industry]].

After the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal [[organizing (management)|organizing]] campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, [[General Motors Corporation]], focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.

Organizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to [[Wyndham Mortimer]], the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members in secret and meeting workers at their homes.

As the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]] from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for [[Buick]]s, [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]s, and [[Oldsmobile]]s, and another in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] that produced [[Chevrolet]] parts.

[[File:Flint Sit-Down Strike National Guard.jpg|thumb|[[US National Guard|National Guardsmen]] with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four]]

While the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John Nance Garner]] supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.

That development forced GM to bargain with the union. [[John L. Lewis]], President of the [[United Mine Workers]] and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]] was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW's, so Governor [[Frank Murphy]] acted as a courier and [[mediation|intermediary]] between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the [[U.S. National Guard]], not to evict the strikers, but rather to protect them from the police and corporate [[strike-breaker]]s. The two parties finally reached agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees who were members of the union for the next six months.<ref name="Bak">{{cite journal |url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2008/Frank-Murpheys-Law/ |last1=Bak |first1=Richard |title=(Frank) Murphy's Law |journal=Hour Detroit |date=September 2008 |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |archive-date=July 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723065533/http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/September-2008/Frank-Murpheys-Law/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Tool and die strike of 1939===
{{Main|Tool and die strike of 1939}}

The [[tool and die strike of 1939]], also known as the "strategy strike", was an ultimately successful attempt by the [[United Auto Workers Union]] (UAW) to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.

===United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945-46===

From November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946 (113 days), [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s [[United Automobile Workers]] (UAW), organized "320,000 hourly workers" to form a US-wide strike against the [[General Motors Corporation]], workers used the tactic of the [[sit down strike]].<ref name="Barnard">John Barnard.

However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.

===2007 General Motors strike===
{{Main|2007 General Motors strike}}

The [[2007 General Motors strike]] was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the [[United Auto Workers]] against General Motors.

On September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the [[United Auto Workers]] union went on strike against the company.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/09/24/news/companies/gm_uaw_strikedeadline/?postversion=2007092412 |title=73,000 workers walk in nationwide GM strike |date=September 24, 2007 |last=Isidore |first=Chris |website=CNNMoney |access-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085621/https://money.cnn.com/2007/09/24/news/companies/gm_uaw_strikedeadline/?postversion=2007092412 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time.

Within hours, the ripple effect was felt in Canada with closures of two car assembly plants in [[Oshawa, Ontario]], and a transmission facility in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/09/26/news/companies/uaw_gm_deal/index.htm?postversion=2007092604 |title=GM-UAW reach deal to end strike |date=September 26, 2007 |last=Isidore |first=Chris |website=CNNMoney |access-date=August 3, 2020 |archive-date=August 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190824041648/https://money.cnn.com/2007/09/26/news/companies/uaw_gm_deal/index.htm?postversion=2007092604 |url-status=live }}</ref> By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.

==Controversies==

===Streetcar conspiracy===
{{Main|General Motors streetcar conspiracy}}

Between 1938 and 1950, General Motors (GM) monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to [[National City Lines]] (NCL) and its subsidiaries. It has been alleged that this was part of a deliberate plot to purchase and dismantle [[tram|streetcar]] systems in many cities in the United States as an attempt to monopolize surface transportation.

===Ralph Nader and the Corvair===
[[File:1960-63 Corvair.jpg|thumb|1961–63 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension]]

'''''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]''''' by [[Ralph Nader]], published in 1965, is a pioneering book accusing [[car manufacturers]] of being slow to introduce [[safety]] features, and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. The subject for which the book is probably most widely known, the rear-engined GM [[Chevrolet Corvair]], is covered in the first chapter. It relates to the first (1960–1964) models that had a [[Swing axle|swing-axle suspension]] design which was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. In substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar), Corvairs required [[tire]] pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=CSERE|first=CSABA|title=General Motors Celebrates a 100-Year History of Technological Breakthroughs|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs|magazine=Car and Driver|date=September 2008|accessdate=March 20, 2013|archive-date=February 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225090611/http://www.caranddriver.com/columns/general-motors-celebrates-a-100-year-history-of-technological-breakthroughs|url-status=live}}</ref>

In early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'', alleged that GM had tried to discredit [[Ralph Nader]], hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits—if it ever gets built |date=December 2005 |publisher=LegalAffairs.org |access-date=July 4, 2014 |archive-date=March 31, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331074458/http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=May 7, 2005 |work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.htm |title=President Dwight D.

General Motors Corp.'', 307 N.Y.S.2d 647 (N.Y. 1970)</ref> Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.

A 1972 safety commission report conducted by [[Texas A&M University]] concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations.<ref name="John Braithwaite 1983. p. 30">{{cite book|first1=Brent |last1=Fisse |first2=John |last2=Braithwaite |title=The Impact of Publicity on Corporate Offenders |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1983 |page=30 |isbn=978-0-87395-732-8}}</ref> The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] testing from the previous year. NHTSA had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars — a [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]], [[Plymouth Valiant]], [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and [[Renault Dauphine]] — along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling.<ref>{{cite journal|author=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration |title=PB 211-015: Evaluation of the 1960–1963 Corvair Handling and Stability|date=July 1972 |publisher=National Technical Information Service}}</ref> NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests [...] the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.

Former GM executive [[John DeLorean]] asserted, in his book ''On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors'', that Nader's criticisms were valid.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Z.|last=DeLorean|authorlink=John DeLorean|title=On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors|page=[https://archive.org/details/oncleardayyoucan00delo/page/n66 51]|publisher=Avon|year=1980|isbn=9780380517220|url=https://archive.org/details/oncleardayyoucan00delo|url-access=registration}}</ref>

Journalist [[David E. Davis]], in a 2009 article in ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'', noted that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous, [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and [[Volkswagen]] all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era.<ref>{{cite journal |title=American Driver: The Late Ralph Nader |first=David E. |last=Davis, Jr. |journal=Automobile |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.automobilemag.com/features/columns/0502_ralph_nader/ |accessdate=August 16, 2014 |archive-date=May 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063818/http://www.automobilemag.com/features/columns/0502_ralph_nader/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Ignition switch recall===

{{Main|General Motors ignition switch recalls}}

In May 2014 the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches.<ref>{{cite news|title = GM compensation fund completes review with 124 deaths|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/08/24/gm-ignition-fund-completes-review/32287697/|accessdate = April 4, 2017|archive-date = March 9, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170309023749/http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2015/08/24/gm-ignition-fund-completes-review/32287697/|url-status = live}}</ref> The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose.<ref name="GMfined">{{cite news|title=GM fined $35mn for delays in recalling faulty cars|url=http://www.detroitstar.com/index.php/sid/222063699/scat/3d33b780d0e24349/ht/GM-fined-35mn-for-delays-in-recalling-faulty-cars|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140517211355/http://www.detroitstar.com/index.php/sid/222063699/scat/3d33b780d0e24349/ht/GM-fined-35mn-for-delays-in-recalling-faulty-cars|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 17, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2014|newspaper=Detroit Star}}</ref> General Motors are also facing 79 customer lawsuits asking for as much as $10 billion for economic losses attributed to the recall.<ref name="GMlawsuits">{{cite news|title=GM ignition lawsuits seek up to $10B for 'economic loss' |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140520/AUTO0103/305200055 |accessdate=June 6, 2014 |newspaper=The Detroit News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521015333/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140520/AUTO0103/305200055 |archivedate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice.
