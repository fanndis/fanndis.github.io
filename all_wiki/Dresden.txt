It is the [[List of cities in Germany by population|12th most populous city]] of Germany, the fourth largest by area (following only [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]]), and the third most populous city in the area of former [[East Germany]], following only ([[East Berlin|East]]) Berlin and Leipzig. Dresden's urban area comprises the towns of [[Freital]], [[Pirna]], [[Radebeul]], [[Meissen]] and [[Coswig, Saxony|Coswig]] and has around 790,000 inhabitants.<ref name="citypopulation_urban">{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/en/germany/urbanareas/|author=citypopulation.de quoting Federal Statistics Office|title=Germany: Urban Areas|access-date=2020-06-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603133151/http://citypopulation.de/en/germany/urbanareas/|archive-date=2020-06-03|url-status=live}}</ref> The Dresden metropolitan area has approximately 1.34 million inhabitants.<ref name="eurostat_metro">{{cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=met_pjanaggr3&lang=en|title=Population on 1 January by broad age group, sex and metropolitan regions|publisher=Eurostat|access-date=2020-06-03}}</ref>

Dresden is the second largest city on the [[River Elbe]] after Hamburg.{{efn|Dresden is actually the third largest city on the [[River Vltava]], following Hamburg and [[Prague]], because above the confluence of Vltava and Elbe, the Vltava is longer and carries more water than the Elbe.}} Most of the city's population lives in the [[Dresden Basin|Elbe Valley]], but a large, albeit very sparsely populated area of the city east of the Elbe lies in the [[West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands]] (the westernmost part of the [[Sudetes]]) and thus in [[Lusatia]], while many boroughs west of the Elbe lie in the [[Ore Mountain Foreland|foreland]] of the [[Ore Mountains]] as well as in the valleys of the rivers rising there and flowing through Dresden, the longest of which are the [[Weißeritz]] and the [[Lockwitzbach]].

The name of the city as well as the names of most of its boroughs and rivers are of [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic]] origin. Dresden is the second largest city in the [[Thuringian]]-[[Upper Saxon]] dialect area, following only Leipzig. The [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] language area begins east of the city, in Lusatia.

Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the [[Prince-Elector|Electors]] and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Kings of Saxony]], who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor, and was once by [[personal union]] the family seat of [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish monarchs]]. The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its [[baroque]] and [[rococo]] city centre. The controversial [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|American and British bombing of Dresden in World War II]] towards the end of the war killed approximately 25,000 people, many of whom were civilians, and destroyed the entire city centre. After the war, restoration work has helped to reconstruct parts of the historic inner city.

Since [[German reunification]] in 1990, Dresden has again become a cultural, educational and political centre of Germany and Europe. The [[Dresden University of Technology]] is one of the 10 largest universities in Germany and part of the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]]. The economy of Dresden and its agglomeration is one of the most dynamic in Germany and ranks first in Saxony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort-dresden.php|title=Wirtschaftsstandort|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2019-09-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200206045800/https://www.dresden.de/de/wirtschaft/wirtschaftsstandort-dresden.php|archive-date=6 February 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is dominated by [[High tech|high-tech branches]], often called “Silicon Saxony”.

Built in the 18th century, the church was destroyed during World War II. The remaining ruins were left for 50 years as a war memorial, before being rebuilt between 1994 and 2005. Other famous landmarks include the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]], the [[Semperoper]] and the [[Dresden Castle]]. Furthermore, the city is home to the renowned [[Dresden State Art Collections]], originating from the collections of the Saxon electors in the 16th century. Dresden’s [[Striezelmarkt]] is one of the largest [[Christmas market]]s in Germany and is considered the first genuine Christmas market in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.german-way.com/history-and-culture/holidays-and-celebrations/christmas/christmas-markets-in-germany/|title=Christmas Markets in Germany and Europe|website=The German Way & More|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030102250/https://www.german-way.com/history-and-culture/holidays-and-celebrations/christmas/christmas-markets-in-germany/|archive-date=30 October 2019|access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> Nearby sights include the National Park of [[Saxon Switzerland]], the [[Ore Mountains]] and the countryside around [[Elbe Valley]] and [[Moritzburg Castle]].

Its name etymologically derives from Old Sorbian ''Drežďany'', meaning ''people of the forest''. Dresden later evolved into the capital of [[Saxony]].

===Early history===
{{expand section|the help of German wikipedia article|date=March 2015}}
[[File:dresden 1521.jpg|thumb|Dresden in 1521]]
Around the late 12th century, a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement called ''Drežďany''<ref name="Löffler">Fritz Löffler, ''Das alte Dresden'', Leipzig 1982, p.20</ref> (meaning either "woods" or "lowland forest-dweller"<ref>[[Ernst Eichler (Linguist)|Ernst Eichler]] und [[Hans Walther (Onomastiker)|Hans Walther]]: ''Sachsen.

Another settlement existed on the northern bank, but its Slavic name is unknown. It was known as ''Antiqua Dresdin'' by 1350, and later as Altendresden,<ref name="Löffler"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/media/pdf/infoblaetter/historie_altendresden.pdf?PHPSESSID=3b1a560f5b42d55b28790331bf486b97|title=Geschichtlicher Hintergrund des Jubiläums - 600 Jahre Stadtrecht Altendresden|language=de|website=dresden.de}}{{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref> both literally "old Dresden". [[Dietrich, Margrave of Meissen]], chose Dresden as his interim residence in 1206, as documented in a record calling the place "Civitas Dresdene".

After 1270, Dresden became the capital of the margraviate. It was given to Friedrich Clem after death of [[Henry III, Margrave of Meissen|Henry the Illustrious]] in 1288. It was taken by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1316 and was restored to the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] dynasty after the death of [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Valdemar the Great]] in 1319. From 1485, it was the seat of the dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], and from 1547 the [[Prince-elector|electors]] as well.

During the reign of Kings Augustus II the Strong and [[Augustus III of Poland]] most of the city's [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] landmarks were built. These include the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger Royal Palace]], the [[Japanisches Palais|Japanese Palace]], the [[Taschenbergpalais]], the [[Pillnitz Castle]] and the two landmark churches: the Catholic [[Dresden Cathedral|Hofkirche]] and the Lutheran [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]]. In addition, significant art collections and museums were founded. Notable examples include the [[Dresden Porcelain Collection]], the [[Kupferstich-Kabinett, Dresden|Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs]], the [[Grünes Gewölbe]] and the [[Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon]].

In 1726 there was a riot for two days after a Protestant clergyman was killed by a soldier who had recently converted from Catholicism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hl4vDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT366|title=A Magnificent Faith: Art and Identity in Lutheran German|last=Heal|first=Bridget|isbn=9780192522405|date=4 August 2017}}</ref> In 1745, the [[Treaty of Dresden]] between Prussia, Saxony, and Austria ended the [[Second Silesian War]].

[[Friedrich Schiller]] completed his ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' (the literary base of the [[European anthem]]) in Dresden in 1785.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.friedrich-schiller-archiv.de/briefe-schillers/an-georg-goeschen/schiller-an-georg-goeschen-29-november-1785/ |title=Schiller an Georg Göschen, 29.

===19th and early 20th century===
[[File:Brodowski Napoleon Elbe.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon]] Crossing the [[Elbe]]'' by [[Józef Brodowski the Younger|Józef Brodowski]] (1895)]]
In 1806, Dresden became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] established by [[Napoleon]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] the French Emperor made it a [[Headquarters|base of operations]], winning there the [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August 1813. As a result of the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Saxony became part of the [[German Confederation]] in 1815. Following the Polish uprisings of [[November Uprising|1831]], [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|1848]] and [[January Uprising|1863]] many Poles fled to Dresden, among others composer [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Dresden itself was a centre of the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|German Revolutions]] in 1848 with the [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]], which cost human lives and damaged the historic town of Dresden.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The uprising forced [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] to flee from Dresden, but he soon after regained control over the city with the help of Prussia. In 1852, the population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants, making it one of the biggest cities within the German Confederation.

As the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, Dresden became part of the newly founded [[German Empire]] in 1871. In the following years, the city became a major centre of economy, including [[motor car]] production, food processing, banking and the manufacture of [[medical equipment]]. In the early 20th century, Dresden was particularly well known for its camera works and its cigarette factories. During [[World War I]], the city did not suffer any war damage, but lost many of its inhabitants. Between 1918 and 1934, Dresden was the capital of the first Free State of Saxony as well as a cultural and economic centre of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The city was also a centre of European [[modern art]] until 1933.

During the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, a large military facility called [[Albertstadt]] was built.<ref>Rüdiger Nern, Erich Sachße, Bert Wawrzinek. ''Die Dresdner Albertstadt''. Dresden, 1994; ''Albertstadt&nbsp;– sämtliche Militärbauten in Dresden''. Dresden, 1880</ref> It had a capacity of up to 20,000 [[Soldier|military personnel]] at the beginning of the [[First World War]]. The garrison saw only limited use between 1918 and 1934, but was then reactivated in preparation for the [[Second World War]].

Its usefulness was limited by attacks on [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|13–15 February]] and 17 April 1945, the former of which destroyed large areas of the city. However, the garrison itself was not specifically targeted.<ref name="USAFHSO_Analysis">{{cite web|url=http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm|title=Historical Analysis of the 14–15 February 1945 Bombings of Dresden|publisher=[[United States Air Force|Air Force Historical Studies Office]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817084455/http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/PopTopics/dresden.htm|archive-date=17 August 2010}} including a list of all bombings on the railway network (especially towards Bohemia).</ref><ref>Bergander, Götz.

The Albertstadt garrison became the headquarters of the [[Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army]] in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]] after the war. Apart from the [[German Army|German army]] officers' school (''Offizierschule des Heeres''), there have been no more [[military unit]]s in Dresden since the army merger during German reunification, and the withdrawal of Soviet forces in 1992. Nowadays, the Bundeswehr operates the [[Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr|Military History Museum]] of the Federal Republic of Germany in the former Albertstadt garrison.

After the Second World War, Dresden became a major industrial centre in the [[German Democratic Republic]] (former East Germany) with a great deal of research infrastructure. It was the centre of [[Bezirk Dresden]] (Dresden District) between 1952 and 1990. Many of the city's important historic buildings were reconstructed, including the [[Semper Opera House]] and the [[Zwinger Palace]], although the city leaders chose to rebuild large areas of the city in a "socialist modern" style, partly for economic reasons, but also to break away from the city's past as the royal capital of Saxony and a stronghold of the German bourgeoisie. Some of the ruins of churches, royal buildings and palaces, such as the Gothic [[Sophienkirche]], the [[Alberttheater]] and the [[Wackerbarth-Palais]], were razed by the Soviet and East German authorities in the 1950s and 1960s rather than being repaired. Compared to [[West Germany]], the majority of historic buildings were saved.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

From 1985 to 1990, the future [[President of the Russian Federation|President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]], was stationed in Dresden by the [[KGB]], where he worked for [[Lazar Matveev]], the senior [[KGB]] liaison officer there. On 3 October 1989 (the so-called "battle of Dresden"), a convoy of trains carrying East German refugees from [[Prague]] passed through Dresden on its way to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Local activists and residents joined in the growing [[civil disobedience]] movement spreading across the German Democratic Republic, by staging demonstrations and demanding the removal of the communist government.

===Post-reunification===
[[File:Sonnedd.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Frauenkirche, a few years after its reconsecration]]

Dresden has experienced dramatic changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s. The city still bears many wounds from the [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]] of 1945, but it has undergone significant reconstruction in recent decades. Restoration of the Dresden Frauenkirche, a Lutheran church, the rebuilding of which was started after the reunification of Germany in 1994, was completed in 2005, a year before Dresden's 800th anniversary, notably by privately raised funds. The gold cross on the top of the church was funded officially by "the British people and the House of Windsor". The [[urban renewal]] process, which includes the reconstruction of the area around the [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt square]] on which the Frauenkirche is situated, will continue for many decades, but public and government interest remains high, and there are numerous large projects underway—both historic reconstructions and modern plans—that will continue the city's recent architectural renaissance.

Dresden remains a major cultural centre of historical memory, owing to the city's destruction in World War II. Each year on 13 February, the anniversary of the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|British and American fire-bombing raid]] that destroyed most of the city, tens of thousands of demonstrators gather to commemorate the event. Since reunification, the ceremony has taken on a more neutral and pacifist tone (after being used more politically during the [[Cold War]]). Beginning in 1999, right-wing [[Neo-Nazi]] [[White Nationalism|white nationalist]] groups have organised demonstrations in Dresden that have been among the largest of their type in the post-war [[history of Germany]]. Each year around the anniversary of the city's destruction, people convene in the memory of those who died in the fire-bombing.

The completion of the reconstructed Dresden Frauenkirche in 2005 marked the first step in rebuilding the Neumarkt area. The areas around the square have been divided into 8 "quarters", with each being rebuilt as a separate project, the majority of buildings to be rebuilt either to the original structure or at least with a facade similar to the original. The quarters I, II, IV, V, VI and VIII have since been completed, with quarter III and quarter VII still partly under construction in 2020.

In 2002, torrential rains caused the [[Elbe]] to flood {{convert|9|m}} above its normal height, i.e., even higher than the old record height from 1845, damaging many landmarks (see [[2002 European floods]]). The destruction from this "millennium flood" is no longer visible, due to the speed of reconstruction.

[[File:Basteibrücke morgens (Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|right|[[Saxon Switzerland]] a few kilometres outside of Dresden]]
[[File:Pillnitz königlicher Weinberg (04-2).jpg|thumb|right|View over [[Dresden Basin]]]]
Dresden lies on both banks of the [[Elbe]], mostly in the [[Dresden Basin]], with the further reaches of the eastern [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]] to the south, the steep slope of the [[Lusatia]]n granitic crust to the north, and the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] to the east at an altitude of about {{convert|113|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Triebenberg is the highest point in Dresden at {{convert|384|m|ft|abbr=off}}.<ref name="basicGeoData">Dresden.de: [http://www.dresden.de/en/02/06/c_01.php Location, area, geographical data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506182506/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/06/c_01.php|date=6 May 2008}}</ref>

With a pleasant location and a mild climate on the Elbe, as well as Baroque-style architecture and numerous world-renowned museums and art collections, Dresden has been called "Elbflorenz" ([[Florence]] of the Elbe).
The incorporation of neighbouring [[Types of rural communities|rural communities]] over the past 60 years has made Dresden the fourth largest [[Urban districts of Germany|urban district]] by area in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg and [[Cologne]].<ref name="cityList">[[List of cities in Germany with more than 100,000 inhabitants]]</ref>

===Nature===
Dresden is one of the greenest cities in all of Europe, with 62% of the city being green areas and forests.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.dresden.de/de/stadtraum/umwelt/gruenes-dresden.php |title=Grünes Dresden |website=dresden.de |language=de |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref> The [[Dresden Heath]] (''Dresdner Heide'') to the north is a forest 50&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in size.

One important part of that landscape is the Elbe meadows, which cross the city in a 20 kilometre swath. [[Saxon Switzerland]] is located south-east of the city.

===Climate===
Like many places in the eastern parts of Germany, Dresden has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with significant continental influences due to its inland location. The summers are warm, averaging 19.0&nbsp;°C (66.2&nbsp;°F) in July. The winters are slightly colder than the German average, with a January average temperature of {{convert|0.1|°C|2|abbr=on}}, just preventing it from being a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''). The driest months are February, March and April, with precipitation of around {{convert|40|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The wettest months are July and August, with more than {{convert|80|mm|1|abbr=on}} per month.

The microclimate in the [[Elbe valley]] differs from that on the slopes and in the higher areas, where the Dresden district [[Klotzsche]], at 227 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]], hosts the Dresden [[weather station]]. The weather in Klotzsche is {{convert|1|to|3|C-change|F-change|1|abbr=on}} colder than in the [[inner city]] at 112 metres [[above mean sea level|above sea level]].

===Flood protection===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
Because of its location on the banks of the Elbe, into which some water sources from the Ore Mountains flow, flood protection is important. Large areas are kept free of buildings to provide a flood plain. Two additional trenches, about 50 metres wide, have been built to keep the inner city free of water from the Elbe, by dissipating the water downstream through the inner city's gorge portion. Flood regulation systems like [[detention basin]]s and [[water reservoir]]s are almost all outside the [[Urban area|city area]].

The [[Weißeritz]], normally a rather small river, suddenly ran directly into the main station of Dresden during the [[2002 European floods]]. This was largely because the river returned to its former route; it had been diverted so that a railway could run along the river bed.

Many locations and areas need to be protected by walls and sheet pilings during floods. A number of districts become waterlogged if the Elbe overflows across some of its former floodplains.

===City structuring===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Dresden is a spacious city. Its districts differ in their structure and appearance. Many parts still contain an old village core, while some quarters are almost completely preserved as rural settings. Other characteristic kinds of urban areas are the historic outskirts of the city, and the former suburbs with scattered housing. During the German Democratic Republic, many apartment blocks were built. The original parts of the city are almost all in the districts of Altstadt (Old town) and Neustadt (New town). Growing outside the [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the historic outskirts were built in the 18th and 19th century. They were planned and constructed on the orders of the Saxon monarchs and many of them are named after Saxon sovereigns (e.g. [[Friedrichstadt (Dresden)|Friedrichstadt]] and [[Albertstadt]]). Dresden has been divided into ten districts called "Ortsamtsbereich" and nine former boroughs ("Ortschaften") which have been incorporated since 1990.

The population of Dresden grew to 100,000 inhabitants in 1852, making it one of the first German cities after Hamburg and Berlin to reach that number. The population peaked at 649,252 in 1933, and dropped to 368,519 in 1945 because of World War II, during which large residential areas of the city were destroyed. After large incorporations and city restoration, the population grew to 522,532 again between 1946 and 1983.<ref name="demogr1">Dresden: [http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php Einwohnerzahl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912224206/http://dresden.de/de/02/06/c_020_Einwohnerzahl.php|date=12 September 2008}}</ref>

Since [[German reunification]], demographic development has been very unsteady. The city has struggled with migration and suburbanisation. During the 1990s the population increased to 480,000 because of several incorporations, and decreased to 452,827 in 1998. Between 2000 and 2010, the population grew quickly by more than 45,000 inhabitants (about 9.5%) due to a stabilised economy and re-urbanisation.

===Mayor and city council===
{{Main|City Council of Dresden}}
The [[city council]] is the legislative branch of the city government. The council gives orders to the mayor ({{lang-de|Bürgermeister}}) via resolutions and decrees, and thus also has some degree of executive power.<ref>Dresden.de: {{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_04.php|title=City Council|access-date=2009-07-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031703/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_04.php|archive-date=5 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_01.php|title=Dresden.de|access-date=2009-07-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031638/http://www.dresden.de/en/02/c_01.php|archive-date=5 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was [[Herbert Wagner (politician)|Herbert Wagner]] of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2001. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. [[Ingolf Roßberg]] of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) served from 2001 until 2008. He was succeeded by [[Helma Orosz]] (CDU). Since 2015, the mayor has been [[Dirk Hilbert]] (FDP). The most recent mayoral election was held on 7 June 2015, with a runoff held on 5 July, and the results were as follows:

As the capital of Saxony, Dresden is home to the [[Landtag of Saxony|Saxon state parliament]] (''Landtag'')<ref>[http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp Sächsischer Landtag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315111458/http://www.landtag.sachsen.de/slt_online/start_eng.asp|date=15 March 2008}}</ref> and the ministries of the Saxon Government. The controlling [[List of constitutional courts|Constitutional Court]] of Saxony is in Leipzig. The highest Saxon court in civil and [[criminal law]], the Higher Regional Court of Saxony, has its home in Dresden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm|title=Oberlandesgericht Dresden|access-date=2008-02-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102044810/http://www.justiz.sachsen.de/olg/content/47.htm|archive-date=2 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Most of the Saxon state authorities are located in Dresden. Dresden is home to the Regional Commission of the [[Dresden (region)|Dresden Regierungsbezirk]], which is a controlling authority for the Saxon Government. It has jurisdiction over eight [[List of rural districts of Germany|rural districts]], two [[Urban districts of Germany|urban districts]] and the city of Dresden.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Like many cities in Germany, Dresden is also home to a local court, has a trade corporation and a Chamber of Industry and Trade and many subsidiaries of federal agencies (such as the Federal Labour Office or the [[Technisches Hilfswerk|Federal Agency for Technical Relief]]). It hosts some divisions of the German Customs and the eastern Federal Waterways Directorate.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Dresden is home to a military subdistrict command, but no longer has large military units as it did in the past. Dresden is the traditional location for [[officer (armed forces)|army officer]] schooling in Germany, today carried out in the [[Offizierschule des Heeres]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bundeswehr.de/de/organisation/heer/organisation/ausbildungskommando/offizierschule-des-heeres |title=Offizierschule des Heeres |website=bundeswehr.de |language=de |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref>

===Local affairs===
[[File:Euroluftbild de00028281.JPG|thumb|The [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] is a subject of controversy in Dresden and other parts of Germany]]
Local affairs in Dresden often centre around the [[urban planning|urban development]] of the city and its spaces. Architecture and the design of [[public space|public places]] is a controversial subject. Discussions about the [[Waldschlößchenbrücke]], a bridge under construction across the Elbe, received international attention because of its position across the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The city held a public referendum in 2005 on whether to build the bridge, prior to UNESCO expressing doubts about the compatibility between bridge and heritage. Its construction caused loss of World Heritage site status in 2009.<ref>[[UNESCO]]: [https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/265 World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List]</ref>

In 2006, the city of Dresden sold its publicly [[subsidized housing]] organization, WOBA Dresden GmbH, to the US-based private [[investment company]] [[Fortress Investment Group]]. The city received {{Nowrap|987.1 million}} euro and paid off its remaining loans, making it the first large city in Germany to become debt-free. Opponents of the sale were concerned about Dresden's loss of control over the [[subsidized housing|subsidized housing market]].<ref>Dresden: {{cite web|url=http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040|title=Saleof the WOBA Dresden GmbH|access-date=2007-02-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312023055/http://www.dresden.de/index.html?node=33040|archive-date=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Dresden has been the center of groups and activities of far-right movements.

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Dresden and [[Coventry]] became twins after the Second World War in an act of [[Vergangenheitsbewältigung|reconciliation]], as both had suffered near-total destruction from [[Strategic bombing|massive aerial bombing]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory_record/6210/dresden_germany |title=Coventry's twin towns and cities - Dresden, Germany |website=coventry.gov.uk/ |access-date=2020-06-12}}</ref> Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Rotterdam]].

===Architecture===
Although Dresden is often said to be a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] city, its architecture is influenced by more than one style. Other eras of importance are the [[Renaissance]] and [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], as well as the contemporary styles of [[Modernism]] and [[Postmodernism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sidetracksgermany.wordpress.com/2013/05/04/dresden-architecture/|title=Dresden – Architecture|date=2013-05-04|website=Sidetracks Germany|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>

====Royal household====
[[File:Dresden-Zwinger.courtyard.04.JPG|thumb|[[Zwinger Palace]]]]
The [[Dresden Castle]] was the seat of the [[Royal Household|royal household]] from 1485. The wings of the building have been renewed, built upon and restored many times. Due to this integration of styles, the castle is made up of elements of the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Classicism|Classicist]] styles.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html The History of the Royal Palace] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323094325/http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/residenzschloss/geschichte.html|date=23 March 2006}}</ref>

The [[Zwinger Palace]] is across the road from the castle. It was built on the old stronghold of the city and was converted to a centre for the royal art collections and a place to hold festivals. Its gate by the moat is surmounted by a golden crown.<ref>Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden: [http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html History of the Zwinger and Semperbau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012157/http://www.skd-dresden.de/en/gebaeude/zwinger_mit_semperbau/geschichte.html|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>

Other royal buildings and ensembles:
* [[Brühl's Terrace]] was a gift to [[Heinrich, count von Brühl]], and became an ensemble of buildings above the river Elbe.
* [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] with the [[Pillnitz Castle]] and other castles

====Sacred buildings====
[[File:Canaletto - Dresden seen from the Right Bank of the Elbe, beneath the Augusts Bridge - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Bernardo Bellotto]]'s Dresden included the [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] during construction.]]
The [[Katholische Hofkirche|Hofkirche]] was the church of the royal household. Augustus the Strong, who desired to be [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], converted to Catholicism, as Polish kings had to be Catholic. At that time Dresden was strictly Protestant. Augustus the Strong ordered the building of the Hofkirche, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, to establish a sign of Roman Catholic religious importance in Dresden. The church is the cathedral "Sanctissimae Trinitatis" since 1980. The crypt of the [[Wettin (dynasty)|Wettin Dynasty]] is located within the church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bistum-dresden-meissen.de/32/40/43/index.php|title=Bistum Dresden-Meißen - katholische Kirche|language=de|website=bistum-dresden-meissen.de|access-date=2019-09-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306221223/http://www.bistum-dresden-meissen.de/32/40/43/index.php|archive-date=6 March 2008}}</ref> King Augustus III of Poland is buried in the Cathedral, as one of very few Polish Kings to be buried outside the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Kraków]].

In contrast to the Hofkirche, the Lutheran [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] located at the [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt]] was built almost contemporaneously by the citizens of Dresden. The city's historic Kreuzkirche was reconsecrated in 1388.<ref>Evangelisch-Lutherische Kreuzkirchgemeinde Dresden: [http://www.dresdner-kreuzkirche.de/index_e.html History of the Church of the Holy Cross] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429044130/http://www.dresdner-kreuzkirche.de/index_e.html|date=29 April 2008}}</ref>

There are also other churches in Dresden, for example the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[St. Simeon of the Wonderful Mountain Church]] in the Südvorstadt district.

====Historicism====
[[File:Dresden,Yenidze (11382419176).jpg|thumb|[[Yenidze]]]]
[[Historicism (art)|Historicist]] buildings made their presence felt on the cityscape until the 1920s.

Notable examples of [[Renaissance Revival]] architecture in Dresden include the [[Albertinum]] located at Brühl's Terrace as well as the [[Saxon State Chancellery]] and the [[Saxon State Ministery of Finance]] located on the northern Elbe river banks.

[[Yenidze]] is a former cigarette factory building built in the style of a mosque between 1907 and 1909.

The most recent historicist buildings in Dresden date from the short era of [[Stalinist architecture]] in the 1950s, e.g. at the Altmarkt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/berlin-dresden-leipzig-stalin-architektur-in-der-ddr-a-1221495.html |title=Moskaus kleine Schwestern: Stalins Städte in der DDR |website=DER SPIEGEL |language=de |date=2018-08-31 |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref>

The ''Garden City of [[Hellerau]]'', at that time a suburb of Dresden, was founded in 1909. It was Germany's first [[garden city movement|garden city]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/hellerau |title=Hellerau |website=Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref> In 1911, [[Heinrich Tessenow]] built the [[Festspielhaus Hellerau|Hellerau Festspielhaus]] (festival theatre). Until the outbreak of World War I, Hellerau was a centre for European [[modernism]] with international standing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hellerau.org/en/history/ |title=History |website=hellerau.org |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmf.org/project/festspielhaus-hellerau |title=Festspielhaus Hellerau |website=World Monuments Fund |access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref> In 1950, Hellerau was incorporated into the city of Dresden. Today, the Hellerau reform architecture is recognized as exemplary. In the 1990s, the garden city of Hellerau became a [[conservation area]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Entwurf zur Moderne : Hellerau: Stand Ort Bestimmung ; [Dokumentation der Fachtagung in Hellerau 1995]|date=1996|publisher=Dt.

The [[German Hygiene Museum]] (built 1928-1930) is a signal example of [[modern architecture]] in Dresden in the interwar period. The building is designed in an impressively monumental style, but employs plain façades and simple structures.

Important modernist buildings erected between 1945 and 1990 are the Centrum-Warenhaus (a large [[department store]]), representing the [[international Style (architecture)|international Style]], and the multi-purpose hall [[Kulturpalast (Dresden)|Kulturpalast]].

====Contemporary architecture====
[[File:Dresden-Kristallpalast-nigh.jpg|thumb|The locally controversial UFA-Palast]]
After 1990 and German reunification, new styles emerged. Important contemporary buildings include the [[New Synagogue, Dresden|New Synagogue]], a [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] building with few windows, the [[Transparent Factory]], the Saxon State Parliament and the New Terrace, the UFA-Kristallpalast cinema by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] (one of the biggest buildings of [[Deconstructivism]] in Germany), and the [[Saxon State Library]].

[[Daniel Libeskind]] and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] both modified existing buildings. Foster roofed the main railway station with translucent Teflon-coated synthetics. Libeskind changed the whole structure of the [[Bundeswehr Military History Museum]] by placing a wedge through the historical arsenal building. According to Libeskind's studio, "[t]he façade’s openness and transparency is intended to contrast with the opacity and rigidity of the existing building."<ref name="Libeskind">{{cite web|last=Libeskind|first=Daniel|title=Military History Museum: Dresden, Germany|url=http://daniel-libeskind.com/projects/military-history-museum|work=Studio Daniel Libeskind|access-date=2020-06-04}}</ref>

====Bridges====
Important bridges crossing the Elbe river are the [[Blaues Wunder]] bridge and the [[Augustus Bridge]].

====Statues====
[[Jean-Joseph Vinache]]'s golden [[equestrian statue]] of August the Strong, the ''Goldener Reiter'' (Golden Cavalier), is on the Neustädter Markt square. It shows August at the beginning of the Hauptstraße (Main street) on his way to Warsaw, where he was King of Poland in personal union. Another statue is the memorial of [[Martin Luther]] in front of the Frauenkirche.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g187399-d9984802-Reviews-Martin_Luther_Monument-Dresden_Saxony.html|title=Martin Luther Monument (Dresden) - 2019 All You Need to Know Before You Go (with Photos) - Dresden, Germany|website=TripAdvisor|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>

The Saxon State Opera descends from the opera company of the former electors and Kings of Saxony. Their first opera house was the [[Opernhaus am Taschenberg]], opened in 1667. The [[Opernhaus am Zwinger]] presented opera from 1719 to 1756, when the [[Seven Years' War]] began. The later [[Semperoper]] was completely destroyed during the bombing of Dresden during the second world war. The opera's reconstruction was completed exactly 40 years later, on 13 February 1985. Its musical ensemble is the ''[[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]]'', founded in 1548.<ref>Semperoper: [http://www.semperoper.de/en/staatskapelle/history.html History of the Sächsische Staatskapelle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405053819/http://www.semperoper.de/en/staatskapelle/history.html|date=5 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Staatsschauspiel Dresden|Dresden State Theatre]] runs a number of smaller theatres.

Until enterprises like [[Dresdner Bank]] left Dresden in the communist era to avoid [[nationalisation]], Dresden was one of the most important German cities, an important industrial centre of the German Democratic Republic.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The period of the [[German Democratic Republic|GDR]] until 1990 was characterized by low economic growth in comparison to western German cities. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
In 1990 Dresden had to struggle with the [[economic collapse]] of [[Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]] and the other export markets in Eastern Europe. After reunification enterprises and production sites broke down almost completely as they entered the [[social market economy]], facing competition from the Federal Republic of Germany. After 1990 a completely new [[legal system]] and [[currency]] system was introduced and infrastructure was largely rebuilt with funds from the Federal Republic of Germany. Dresden as a major urban centre has developed much faster and more consistently than most other regions in the former German Democratic Republic.

Between 1990 and 2010 the [[unemployment|unemployment rate]] fluctuated between 13% and 15%, but has decreased significantly ever since. In December 2019 the unemployment rate was 5.3%, the fourth lowest among the 15 largest cities of Germany (after [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Nuremberg]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/Navigation/Statistik/Statistik-nach-Regionen/BA-Gebietsstruktur/Sachsen/Dresden-Nav.html?year_month=201912 |title=Arbeitsmarkt im Überblick - Berichtsmonat Dezember 2019 - Dresden, Agentur für Arbeit |website=Agentur für Arbeit |language=de |access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref> In 2017, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]] of Dresden was 39,134 euros, the highest in Saxony.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.l-iz.de/wirtschaft/metropolregion/2019/08/Auch-beim-BIP-wird-das-Erstarken-der-Dienstleistungs-Leuchttuerme-Leipzig-und-Dresden-sichtbar-291889 |title=Auch beim BIP wird das Erstarken der Dienstleistungs-Leuchttürme Leipzig und Dresden sichtbar |website= Leipziger Internet Zeitung |language=de |access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>

Thanks to the presence of public administration centres, a high density of semi-public research institutes and an extension of publicly funded high technology sectors, the proportion of highly qualified workers Dresden is again among the highest in Germany and by European criteria.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Enterprises===
Three major sectors dominate Dresden's economy:

[[Silicon Saxony]] Saxony's semiconductor industry was built up in 1969. Major enterprises today include [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]'s semiconductor fabrication spin-off [[GlobalFoundries]], [[Infineon Technologies]], [[ZMDI]] and Toppan Photomasks. Their factories attract many suppliers of material and cleanroom technology enterprises to Dresden.

The pharmaceutical sector developed at the end of the 19th century. The 'Sächsisches Serumwerk Dresden' (Saxon Serum Plant, Dresden), owned by [[GlaxoSmithKline]], is a global leader in [[vaccine]] production.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Another traditional pharmaceuticals producer is Arzneimittelwerke Dresden (Pharmaceutical Works, Dresden).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

A third traditional branch is that of mechanical and [[electrical engineering]]. Major employers are the [[Volkswagen]] [[Transparent Factory]], [[Elbe Flugzeugwerke]] (Elbe Aircraft Works), [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[The Linde Group|Linde-KCA-Dresden]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}The tourism industry enjoys high revenue and supports many employees. There are around one hundred bigger hotels in Dresden, many of which cater in the upscale range.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Dresden still has a shortage of corporate headquarters.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Media===
The media in Dresden include two major newspapers of regional record: the ''[[Sächsische Zeitung]]'' (''Saxon Newspaper'', circulation around 228,000) and the ''[[Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten]]'' (''Dresden's Latest News'', circulation around 50,000). Dresden has a broadcasting centre belonging to the [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]].
