{{main|Environment of Iowa}}
[[Image:Landforms of Iowa.jpg|Landforms of Iowa, based on Prior (1991)|thumb]]

Iowa's natural vegetation is [[tallgrass prairie]] and [[savanna]] in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.<ref name=Prior91 /> Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.<ref>Iowa DNR: Iowa's Statewide Land Cover Inventory, [http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landcvr/landcvr.htm Uiowa.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010333/http://www.igsb.uiowa.edu/Browse/landcvr/landcvr.htm |date=May 2, 2009 }}</ref>

The southern part of Iowa is categorized as the [[Central forest-grasslands transition]] ecoregion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Terrestrial ecoregions of North America : a conservation assessment|date=1999|publisher=Island Press|others=Ricketts, Taylor H.|isbn=1-55963-722-6|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=40856986}}</ref> The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the [[Central tall grasslands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/na0805|title=Central tall grasslands {{!}} Ecoregions {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

Iowa has a relatively smooth gradient of varying [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] across the state, with areas in the southeast of the state receiving an average of over {{convert|38|in|cm}} of rain annually, and the northwest of the state receiving less than {{convert|28|in|cm}}.<ref>[http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/pcpn/ia.gif Average Annual Precipitation Iowa, 1961–1990 (GIF File)]—Christopher Daly, Jenny Weisburg</ref> The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal, with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June, owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms, some of which produce hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the {{convert|34.72|in|cm}} of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August, peaking in June.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIA0231 |title=Average Weather for Des Moines, IA—Temperature and Precipitation, Weather.com, Retrieved Jan. 7, 2009 |publisher=Weather.com |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203141541/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIA0231 |archive-date=December 3, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Prehistory==

{{Main|Iowa archaeology|Indians of Iowa}}
[[File:Iowa archaeology edgewater.JPG|thumb|Excavation of the 3,800-year-old [[Edgewater Park Site]]]]

When [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a [[Pleistocene]] glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.<ref name="iaarch" />

More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent [[Woodland period]] saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.<ref name="iaarch" />

The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric [[Oneota]] include the [[Sioux|Dakota]], [[Ho-Chunk]], [[Ioway]], and [[Otoe (tribe)|Otoe]]. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the [[Illiniwek]], [[Meskwaki]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref name="iaarch">Alex, Lynn M.

Iowa was part of a territory known as [[Louisiana (New France)|''La Louisiane'']] or [[Louisiana]], and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indigenous people. The [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century.

After the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]], Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts—the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter.

[[Fort Madison, Iowa|Fort Madison]] was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory.<ref name="mckusick2009" /><ref>Prucha, Francis P.

President [[Martin Van Buren]] appointed [[Robert Lucas (governor)|Robert Lucas]] governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.<ref>''Iowa Official Register'', Volume Number 60, page 314</ref>

Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President [[James K. Polk]] signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.<ref>"Official Encouragement of Immigration to Iowa", Marcus L. Hansen, ''IJHP'', 19 (April 1921):159–95</ref>

Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second [[Iowa State Fair]]s were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at [[Fairfield, Iowa|Fairfield]]. The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held annually since then, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the [[Spanish–American War]] and the [[World's Fair]] being held in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska]]; from 1942 to 1945, due to [[World War II]], as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot; and in 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |title=Iowa State Fair |publisher=Trivia |access-date=December 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130160719/http://iowastatefair.com/about/trivia.php |archive-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Safety|url=http://www.iowastatefair.org/safety/|access-date=2020-10-13|website=Iowa State Fair|language=en}}</ref>

{{Main article|Iowa in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Kirkwoods 1852.jpg|thumb|Jane and [[Samuel J. Kirkwood|Samuel Kirkwood]], 1852]]

Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for [[Abraham Lincoln]], though there was an antiwar "[[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]]" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war.<ref>Lendt, David L. "Iowa and the Copperhead Movement." The Annals of Iowa 40 (1970), 412-427. Available at: https://doi.org/10.17077/0003-4827.7965 Hosted by Iowa Research Online</ref> There were no battles in the state, although the [[Battle of Athens (1861)|Battle of Athens]], Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from [[Croton, Iowa]], and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315">Iowa Official Register, Volume No. 60, page 315</ref>

Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]], its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] surrendered at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]].<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315"/>

They marched on General [[Nathaniel Banks]]' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven [[Iowans]] have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.<ref>Iowa Official Register, Volume No. 60, pages 315–316</ref>

Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals—[[Grenville Mellen Dodge]], [[Samuel R. Curtis]], [[Francis J. Herron]], and [[Frederick Steele]]—and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.<ref name="Iowa Official Register page 315"/>

===Agricultural expansion, 1865–1930===
[[File:Barclay barn 1875.jpg|thumb|Iowa farm, 1875]]

Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860<ref>[https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html "1860 Census: Population of the United States"].

In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war.<ref name="ec-ag" /> In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iowapbs.org/iowapathways/mypath/types-business-and-industry|title=Types of Business and Industry|date=2016-07-25|website=Iowa PBS|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iowapbs.org/iowapathways/mypath/early-industry|title=Early Industry|date=2016-07-25|website=Iowa PBS|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.

===Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985===

The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly.

===Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present===

After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture.

Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]), is feeling the brunt of [[rural flight]], although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as [[Denison, Iowa|Denison]] and [[Storm Lake, Iowa|Storm Lake]], have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/14/books/14grim.html|work=The New York Times|first=William|last=Grimes|title=In This Small Town in Iowa the Future Speaks Spanish|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref>

Another demographic problem for Iowa is the [[brain drain]], in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.<ref>''Iowa Brain Drain'', Iowa Civic Analysis Network, University of Iowa, [http://www.uiowa.edu/~ican/Papers%202006/braindrain122806.pdf Uiowa.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412193400/http://www.uiowa.edu/~ican/Papers%202006/braindrain122806.pdf |date=April 12, 2012 }}</ref>

As a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the [[Iowa General Assembly]]: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor [[Chet Culver]] was defeated in 2010 by Republican [[Terry Branstad]], who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3{{nbsp}}days; eclipsing [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], who served 21 years until 1804.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/14/meet-iowa-gov-terry-branstad-who-as-of-monday-is-americas-longest-serving-governor/|title=Terry Branstad just became the longest serving governor in American history|website=Washington Post|access-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.

===Presidential caucus===
{{Main|Iowa caucuses}}

The state gets considerable attention every four years because the [[Iowa caucus]], gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a [[presidential primary]] election.<ref>{{Cite web |author1=James Q.

===Civil rights===
====Racial equality====

[[File:UnionBlockMtPleasant15.jpg|thumb|The [[Union Block (Mount Pleasant, Iowa)|Union Block]] building, [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], scene of early civil rights and women's rights activities]]

In the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the first decision of the [[Iowa Supreme Court]]—''In Re the Matter of Ralph'',<ref>1 Morris 1 (Iowa 1839)</ref> decided July 1839—the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.<ref name="civil rights">{{cite web|url=http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/Public_Information/Iowa_Courts_History/Civil_Rights/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505082508/http://www.judicial.state.ia.us/Public_Information/Iowa_Courts_History/Civil_Rights/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 5, 2006 |title=Early Civil Rights Cases |publisher=Judicial.state.ia.us |access-date=July 26, 2010 }}</ref> The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban [[Anti-miscegenation laws|miscegenation statutes]] nationwide.<ref name="ChicagoTrib">[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-defending-iowa-web,0,2979128.story Gay marriage and Iowa: Why's everyone so surprised?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429060425/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-defending-iowa-web,0,2979128.story |date=April 29, 2009 }}, [[Chicago Tribune]], April 10, 2009</ref>

The Iowa Supreme Court decided ''Clark v. The board of directors''<ref>24 Iowa 266 (1868)</ref> in 1868, ruling that racially segregated "separate but equal" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before ''[[Brown v.

In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: "All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement."

====Women's rights====

As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/iowa-and-the-19th-amendment.htm|title=Iowa and the 19th Amendment (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> In 1847, the [[University of Iowa]] became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.<ref>About Iowa, [http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html Uiowa.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119042543/http://www.uiowa.edu/homepage/about-UI/index.html |date=November 19, 2012 }}</ref> In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting [[Arabella A.

====LGBT rights====

The state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.
