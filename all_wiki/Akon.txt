==Music career==

===2003–05: Discovery and ''Trouble''===
Music mogul Devyne Stephens, the president of Upfront Megatainment, first heard about Akon when the rapper [[Lil' Zane]] brought him along to Stephens' rehearsal hall, a place that at the time saw talents such as [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] and [[TLC (band)|TLC]] being developed. The relationship between Stephens and Akon began as a friendship and [[mentorship]], with the young artist regularly stopping by to ask for advice, with Stephens eventually signing him to his production company and began grooming him professionally.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 27, 2005 |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6731zE4HA?url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeromeFoster.html |archive-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The songs Akon recorded with Stephens were brought to the attention of [[Universal Motown Records Group|Universal]]'s imprint [[SRC Records]].<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]] SRC A&R [[Knobody|Jerome "Knobody" Foster]] said, "What caught my attention right away was "Lonely", and I said, 'this kid is official – this is a huge record."<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Foster and SRC CEO Steve Rifkind immediately boarded a private plane to Atlanta to meet the young artist.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> Akon knew of Foster's work as producer [[Knobody]] and so there was a mutual respect for one another and the pair hit it off.<ref name="hitquarters.com" />

Akon's solo debut album, ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]'', was released on June 29, 2004. It spawned the singles "[[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]", "[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]", "[[Belly Dancer (Bananza)]]", "[[Pot of Gold (Akon song)|Pot of Gold]]" and "[[Ghetto (Akon song)|Ghetto]]". "Locked Up" reached the number 8 position in the U.S. and number 5 in the UK. "Ghetto" became a radio hit when it was [[remix]]ed by [[DJ Green Lantern]] to include verses from rappers [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] The album is a hybrid of Akon's silky, West African-styled vocals mixed with East Coast and Southern beats. Most of Akon's songs begin with the sound of the clank of a jail cell's door with him uttering the word "Konvict".<ref>{{cite web|last=Loftus|first=Johnny|title=Akon&nbsp;— Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p535592/biography|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

In 2005, he released the single "Lonely" (which samples [[Bobby Vinton]]'s "[[Mr. Lonely (Bobby Vinton song)|Mr. Lonely]]"). The song reached the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in Australia, the UK and Germany. His album also climbed to number one in the UK in April 2005. When music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] had a top ten weekly chart, which was calculated by the number of video requests, Akon's "Lonely" became the longest running single on the top of the chart, spanning over fifteen weeks. Akon was then featured on two other singles, [[P-Money]]'s "Keep on Callin'" off the album ''[[Magic City (P-Money album)|Magic City]]'', and the other with [[New Zealand]] rapper [[Savage (rapper)|Savage]] with the single "[[Moonshine (Savage song)|Moonshine]]", which had become a success in both New Zealand and Australia, reaching number one in the New Zealand charts. A year later in 2005, he made his first critically acclaimed guest appearance on [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]]'s debut album, ''[[Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101]]'', with the song "[[Soul Survivor (Young Jeezy song)|Soul Survivor]]". In December the same year his manager, Robert Montanez, was killed in a shooting after a dispute in [[New Jersey]].

In 2006, Akon and Young Jeezy suggested plans for a collaborative album.<ref>Reid, Shaheem.

On October 5, 2006, Akon broke a record on the Hot 100, as he achieved the largest climb in the chart's 48-year-history with "Smack That" jumping from number 95 to 7. The leap was fueled by its number six debut on [[Hot Digital Songs]] with 67,000 downloads. The record has since been broken several times. "Smack That" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]], but lost to [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[T.I.]]'s "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Akon's "Smack That" receives Grammy nomination|url=http://www.republicrecords.com/akons-smack-that-receives-a-grammy-nomination/|publisher=Republic Records|accessdate=March 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309035847/http://www.republicrecords.com/akons-smack-that-receives-a-grammy-nomination/|archive-date=March 9, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

"[[I Wanna Love You (Akon song)|I Wanna Love You]]", featuring [[Snoop Dogg]], was the second single released in September, it would go on to earn Akon his first number-one single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and Snoop's second. "I Wanna Love You" topped the U.S. charts for two consecutive weeks. In January 2007, a third single "[[Don't Matter]]" which earned him his first solo number one and second consecutive Hot 100 chart topper was released. "[[Mama Africa (song)|Mama Africa]]" was released as a European single in July 2007, making it the fourth overall single from the album. To coincide with the release of the deluxe edition of the album "[[Sorry, Blame It on Me]]" debuted in August 2007 on the Hot 100 at number seven.

In February 2007, Akon launched his clothing line ''Konvict Clothing''. It features urban streetwear including denim jeans, hoodies, T-shirts and hats.

Akon claimed to be close friend with Jackson near the end of Jackson's life in an interview UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning 'Blues & Soul' in October 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/364/out_of_akon_do_big_interviews_grow/ |title=Akon interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' December 2008 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date=December 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229120713/http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/364/out_of_akon_do_big_interviews_grow/ |archive-date=February 29, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In July 2008, a song called "[[Hold My Hand (Michael Jackson and Akon song)|Hold My Hand]]", an R&B duet/collaboration between Michael Jackson and Akon, circulated the internet. It was not included in the track list for ''Freedom'' as Akon previously stated. During an interview with [[Tavis Smiley]], Akon said that Jackson had planned on a high-profile release including a music video until the track had leaked.

He further stated: "As you come in from America, or Europe or anywhere in the diaspora, and you feel like you want to visit Africa, we want Senegal to be your first stop".<ref>{{cite web |last=Okogba |first=Emmanuel |title=Senegal: Singer Akon Plans $6bn City in Senegal Homeland |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/202009020069.html |website=allAfrica.com |publisher=Vanguard |accessdate=September 3, 2020 |language=en |date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

==Television and film==
Akon has confirmed that a reality television show is in the works.

Akon owns a diamond mine in South Africa and denies the existence of [[blood diamond]]s (also known as "conflict diamonds") saying, "I don't believe in conflict diamonds. That's just a movie.

===Legal difficulties===
Akon has stated that he was part of an auto-theft ring and spent four years in prison from 1999 to 2002.

On June 3, 2007, at [[WSPK]]'s KFEST concert at the [[Dutchess Stadium]] in [[Fishkill, New York]], a concert attendee threw an object towards Akon on stage. Akon asked the crowd to identify who threw the object and that he be brought on stage. Security staff grabbed the young man and took him up to the stage. Akon then pulled him up from the crowd and hoisted him across his shoulders. The singer then tossed the attendee back into the crowd from his shoulders.

In 2010, Buddhist groups in Sri Lanka vehemently protested a planned concert by Akon, claiming his music video with Guetta for "[[Sexy Bitch|Sexy Chick]]" insulted [[Buddhism]] because of the Buddha statue that can be seen several times in the background.
