The '''Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] in New Zealand, which since 19 August 2013, allows same-sex couples to legally [[Same-sex marriage in New Zealand|marry]].

The Act was proposed as a [[member's bill]] by MP [[Louisa Wall]] in May 2012, and was drawn from the ballot in July of that year. It passed its third reading in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 17 April 2013, and became law when it received the Royal Assent two days later.

On 14 May 2012, openly lesbian [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] MP [[Louisa Wall]] ([[Manurewa (New Zealand electorate)|Manurewa]]) stated that she would introduce a [[private member's bill|Member's bill]], the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, allowing adult couples of any gender to marry, including same-sex and different sex couples.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6915784/MP-drafting-gay-marriage-bill |title=MP drafting gay marriage bill |first1=John |last1=Hartevelt |first2=Dayna |last2=Levy |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=14 May 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fzLMfd8F?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6915784/MP-drafting-gay-marriage-bill |archivedate=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The bill was submitted to the members' bill ballot on 30 May 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/8/f/4/50HOH_MEMBILL074_1-Marriage-Definition-of-Marriage-Amendment-Bill.htm |title= Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill – Proposed Members' Bills – Legislation |publisher= [[New Zealand Parliament]] |date= 30 May 2012 |accessdate= 18 July 2012}}</ref> Openly gay [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] MP [[Kevin Hague]] (list) also submitted a same-sex marriage bill, the Marriage (Equality) Amendment Bill, to the ballot on 24 June.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Legislation/ProposedBills/0/b/3/50HOH_MEMBILL080_1-Marriage-Equality-Amendment-Bill.htm |title= Marriage (Equality) Amendment Bill – Proposed Members' Bills – Legislation |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 24 June 2012 |accessdate= 18 July 2012}}</ref> Wall and Hague stated that they planned to work together in support of whichever bill came up first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_11881.php|title=Both Hague and Wall's Bills go into ballot|work=[[GayNZ.com]]|date=|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054949/http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/2/article_11881.php|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

== First reading ==

On 29 August 2012, the bill passed its first reading on a [[conscience vote]] with 80 votes in favour, 40 votes against, and one abstention. The vote was originally recorded as 78 votes in favour and three abstentions, due to the National Party [[Whip (politics)|whips]] forgetting to cast proxy votes in favour for John Banks and Peter Dunne (both National Party whips voted against the bill and therefore were in the wrong lobby to cast votes in favour).<ref>{{cite news |title=Marriage bill passes first reading |first1=Kate |last1=Shuttleworth |first2=Audrey |last2=Young |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10830345 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6fzL9Tpyw?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10830345 |archivedate=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="DOM-bill-first-reading">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20120829_00000032/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-—-first |title=Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill – First Reading |publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament |date=29 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314232626/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20120829_00000032/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-first |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Select committee stage ==

The bill was subsequently referred to the Government Administration [[New Zealand House of Representatives#Select Committee stage|Select Committee]] for further consideration and public input.<ref name="DOM-bill-first-reading"/> Public submissions for the bill closed on {{nowrap|26 October 2012}}, with 21,533 written submissions received, not including the six submissions received that were deemed inappropriate or offensive.

The amendments included:
* the insertion of a second clause in Section 29 of the Marriage Act to clarify that marriage celebrants acting on behalf of an organisation (such as a church) would not be compelled to solemnise marriages against the beliefs of that organisation.
* repealing Section 56 of the Marriage Act, which made it an offence to deny or impugn the validity of a legal marriage. Originally inserted to prevent churches from denying the validity of civil marriages, nobody had ever been prosecuted under the section (the fine of which was stated as £100, despite New Zealand decimalising its currency in 1967) and it had been largely superseded by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and Human Rights Act.
* the delay of the commencement of the bill from the day after Royal Assent to four months after Royal Assent to allow the Department of Internal Affairs (who manages births, deaths and marriages in New Zealand) time to implement necessary changes before issuing the first marriage licences. This also allowed time for civil union celebrants who are not already marriage-certified to become so before the first marriages take place.
* Consequential amendments to fourteen other acts and one Regulation. All but one amendment modified context-critical gendered expression (e.g. "husband and wife") to be inclusive of same-sex couples. The single other amendment was to repeal section 30(2) of the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Relationships Registration Act 1995, which prevented birth registrars changing someone's legal gender if the person in question was married - the introduction of same-sex marriage meant this section was no longer needed.

== Second reading ==

The second reading of the bill in Parliament took place on 13 March 2013. During the debate, New Zealand First leader [[Winston Peters]] moved that the second reading motion (''That the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill be read a second time'') be amended to read ''That a referendum be held at the time of the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|next general election]] to decide whether the Marriage Act 1955 should be amended to recognise marriage between 2 people, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.'' The proposed amendment to the motion (Supplementary Order Paper 182) was defeated 83 votes opposed to 33 votes in favour.<ref name="par">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130313_00000036/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-—-second |title=Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill – Second Reading |publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314221916/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130313_00000036/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-second |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As is procedure, Members of Parliament first voted on whether the select committee amendments be accepted before proceeding to the second reading vote. The amendments were agreed to, 66 votes in favour to 21 opposed.<ref name="par" />

== Committee of the Whole House ==

The Committee of the Whole House, where members of parliament debate and vote on the bill clause-by-clause and propose amendments, took place on 27 March 2013.

New Zealand First leader [[Winston Peters]] and independent MP [[Brendan Horan]] introduced two supplementary order papers (SOPs), numbers 187 and 188 which seek to amend the legislation in question and arrange for a binding referendum on the question. These were replicas of two earlier SOPs, numbers 182 and 183, which were debated and defeated during the second reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/members/2013/0187/latest/096be8ed80a42a95.pdf|title=Supplementary Order Paper No 187|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022002212/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/members/2013/0187/latest/096be8ed80a42a95.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/members/2013/0188/latest/096be8ed80a4492e.pdf|title=Supplementary Order Paper No 188|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309152055/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/members/2013/0188/latest/096be8ed80a4492e.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref> On the day of the vote, conservative Labour MP [[William Sio]] moved SOP 202, which sought to uphold the right of individual celebrants to refuse to preside over same-sex weddings, while National MP [[Tim Macindoe]] sought to introduce SOP 203, which would widen the 'right to discriminate' on the basis of service provision to conservative Christian caterers, bakers, wedding photographers, public registrars and others engaged in secular occupations who objected to same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/government/2013/0202/latest/whole.html|title=Supplementary Order Paper No 202|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722055540/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/government/2013/0202/latest/whole.html|archivedate=22 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/government/2013/0203/latest/whole.html |title= Supplementary Order Paper No 203|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722055417/http://www.legislation.govt.nz/sop/government/2013/0203/latest/whole.html|archivedate=22 July 2015}}</ref>

The first two amendments were declared as out of order under Standing Order 298(1);<ref group="nb">Standing Order 298(1) states "A committee of the whole House considers a bill to determine whether the bill properly incorporates the principles or objects of the bill as read a second time by the House". In other words, the Committee could not accept the amendments as they were against what the House voted for at the Second Reading (i.e. turning down a referendum on the issue).</ref> the other two were voted down by the House (SOP 202 by 22 votes to 88, SOP 203 by 36 votes to 80). The bill passed the committee stage 77 votes to 43 – the same as the second reading with the exception that [[Gerry Brownlee]] (National) did not vote and could not cast a [[proxy vote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130327_00000028/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-—-in-committee |title=Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill — In Committee |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=14 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314223412/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130327_00000028/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-in-committee |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8481351/Gay-marriage-bill-could-pass-next-month |title=Gay marriage bill could pass next month |first=Kate |last=Chapman |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=28 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g0onZKWp?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8481351/Gay-marriage-bill-could-pass-next-month |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Initial requests to open the Grand Hall immediately outside the debating chamber to cater for the overflow were declined by the Speaker, leaving potentially over 1000 supporters and opponents to overflow onto the Parliament grounds in forecast rain,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10877767 |title=No room at the gallery |first=Isaac |last=Davison |publisher=The New Zealand Herald |date=16 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g0p0huJv?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10877767 |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but later it was decided to open the [[New Zealand Legislative Council#Legislative Council Chamber|Legislative Council Chamber]] with a video link to cater for an extra 200 people.

The bill passed its third reading, 77 votes in favour to 44 votes opposed - the same as the second reading.<ref name="tvnz" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130417_00000020/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-—-third |title=Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill — Third Reading |publisher=Hansard Office, New Zealand Parliament |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511200841/http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/debates/debates/50HansD_20130417_00000020/marriage-definition-of-marriage-amendment-bill-%E2%80%94-third |archivedate=11 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The only MPs changing their votes were [[David Bennett (New Zealand politician)|David Bennett]] (National, [[Hamilton East (New Zealand electorate)|Hamilton East]]) who opposed the first two readings but voted for the third and final reading; and [[Rino Tirikatene]] (Labour, [[Te Tai Tonga]]) who support the first two readings but not the final one.<ref name="tvnz" />

After presiding Speaker [[Lindsay Tisch]] read out the result of the vote, the public gallery broke into singing "[[Pokarekare Ana]]", a Māori love song (''[[Waiata (Māori)|waiata]]''), later being joined by some MPs on the floor.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/video-waiata-and-celebration-as-bill-passes-2013041722#axzz42pV41jNB|title= Waiata and celebration as bill passes|work=Newshub|first=Lloyd|last=Burr|date=17 April 2013|accessdate=14 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314225608/http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/video-waiata-and-celebration-as-bill-passes-2013041722|archivedate=14 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22184232 |title= New Zealand legalises same-sex marriage |work=[[BBC]] |date=17 April 2013|accessdate=17 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702050336/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22184232|archivedate=2 July 2015}}</ref>

Louisa Wall described the vote as a "World Cup final", and thanked supporters.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/gay-marriage-vote-like-a-world-cup-final--wall-2013041808#axzz42pV41jNB|title= Vote like a 'World Cup final' - Wall|work=Newshub|first=Dan|last=Satherley|date= 18 April 2013|accessdate=14 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314225159/http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/gay-marriage-vote-like-a-world-cup-final--wall-2013041808|archivedate=14  March 2015}}</ref>

During the third reading debate, Building and Construction Minister [[Maurice Williamson]] (National, [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]]) took a five-minute call and gave a jovial speech, pointing out logical fallacies in some of the more aggressive statements by opponents – the last of which he disproved that the bill was cause of the recent drought conditions affecting New Zealand, by pointing out that it was raining in his electorate that morning, complete with a "big gay rainbow". The speech became a YouTube hit, and was viewed hundreds of thousands of times over the next few days, featuring on high-profile news sites like [[The Huffington Post]] and [[Gawker]]. The [[New York Times]] also picked up the story, incorrectly stating that Williamson was "one of New Zealand's only openly gay MPs" (he is actually heterosexual, and married with three adopted children). Williamson said he also received an expenses-paid offer to go on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/maurice-williamson-an-unlikely-gay-icon-2013041909#axzz42pV41jNB|work=Newshub|title=Maurice Williamson: An unlikely gay icon|first=Dan|last=Satherley|date= 19 April 2013|accessdate=14 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314225848/http://www.newshub.co.nz/politics/maurice-williamson-an-unlikely-gay-icon-2013041909|archivedate=14 March 2016}}</ref>

== Royal Assent and commencement ==

The bill received the [[Royal Assent]] from the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], Sir [[Jerry Mateparae]], on 19 April 2013 and became an official Act of Parliament, the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 (2013 No 20).<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/133170/marriage-legislation-becomes-law |title= Legislation to legalise same-sex marriage passed in Parliament this week has become law |work= [[Radio New Zealand]] |date= 19 April 2013 |accessdate= 19 April 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204803/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/133170/marriage-legislation-becomes-law|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The law took effect on 19 August 2013. The Department of Internal Affairs released new application forms for marriages on 12 August 2013, with the added field for each partner's sex, and the option of being listed on the marriage licence and certificate as 'bride', 'bridegroom' or 'partner'. To take into account the three-day stand-down period between the time the marriage licence is applied for and the actual licence being issued, registrars started accepting marriage licence applications on 16 August, allowing licences to be issued and marriages to go ahead on 19 August. Registrars received 31 applications from same-sex couples wishing to marry on 19 August.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10913830 |title=Great day to be gay |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=18 August 2013 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g0qZo26w?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10913830 |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/217286/first-same-sex-couples-marry|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|title= First same-sex couples marry| date= 19 August 2013 |accessdate= 22 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306022535/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/217286/first-same-sex-couples-marry|archivedate=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbnat/2103707089-the-country-s-first-gay-marriages-will-be-held-today|title=Gay marriage becomes a reality|work=[[Newstalk ZB]]|first1= Jacob|last1=Brown|first2=Jenee |last2=Tibshraeny|first3= Alexia |last3=Russell |date=19 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822235818/http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/auckland/news/nbnat/2103707089-the-country-s-first-gay-marriages-will-be-held-today|archivedate=22 August 2013}}</ref>

Overseas-registered same-sex marriages are also legally recognised in New Zealand since 19 August 2013, as long as one of the spouses is a citizen of New Zealand, another [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country or the [[Republic of Ireland]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10878614 |title=Marriage bill leaves a few inequalities to sort out |work=The New Zealand Herald |first=Isaac |last=Davison |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6g0qkVC8u?url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10878614 |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (as with opposite-sex marriages, if neither spouse is a citizen of one of those countries, they must apply to the Family Court to have their marriage fully recognised in New Zealand).
