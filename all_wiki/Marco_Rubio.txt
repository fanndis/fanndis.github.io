In October 2011, newspapers reported that Rubio's previous statements that his parents were forced to leave Cuba in 1959, after Fidel Castro came to power, were embellishments. His parents actually left Cuba in 1956, during the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]]. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', many voters in Florida would be less impressed by his family being economic migrants instead of [[political refugees]] from a communist regime.<ref name="WaPo Exile"/> Rubio responded, saying: "The essence of my family story is why they came to America in the first place, and why they had to stay."<ref name="Rubio">{{cite web |first=Marco |last=Rubio |title=My family's flight from Castro |work=Politico |date=October 21, 2011 |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/66567.html |access-date=February 14, 2013 |archive-date=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112213338/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/66567.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In late 1999, a [[By-election|special election]] was called to fill the seat for the 111th House District in the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing Miami. The seat had been held by Representative Carlos Valdes, who had run for and won an open [[Florida Senate|Florida State Senate]] seat.<ref>{{cite news | first=David | last=CM-Azares | title=Diaz De La Portilla Wins State Senate Seat | url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-12-15/news/9912150159_1_senate-post-state-senate-seat-miami-dade | newspaper=Sun Sentinel | date=December 15, 1999 | access-date=February 14, 2013 | archive-date=September 27, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927113326/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1999-12-15/news/9912150159_1_senate-post-state-senate-seat-miami-dade | url-status=live }}</ref> It was considered a safe Republican seat, so Rubio's main challenge was to win the GOP nomination.

Rubio spent almost nine years in the Florida House of Representatives. Since the Florida legislative session officially lasted only 60 days, he was able to spend about half of each year in Miami, where he worked first at a law firm that specialized in land use and zoning, and later starting in 2004, took a position with [[Broad and Cassel]], a Miami law and lobbying firm, though state law precluded him from engaging in lobbying or introducing legislation on behalf of the firm's clients.<ref name=Mishak /><ref>{{cite web|author1=Hamburger, Tom|author2=Sullivan, Sean|date=June 29, 2015|title=How Marco Rubio turned political star power into a soaring personal income|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-marco-rubio-turned-political-star-power-into-a-soaring-personal-income/2015/06/29/8cdae1aa-13a8-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|access-date=November 7, 2015|archive-date=November 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106183550/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-marco-rubio-turned-political-star-power-into-a-soaring-personal-income/2015/06/29/8cdae1aa-13a8-11e5-9ddc-e3353542100c_story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:Marco Rubio.jpg|thumb|Rubio's official portrait as a State Representative]]
At the time Rubio took his seat in the legislature in [[Tallahassee]] in January 2000, voters in Florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on [[term limits]]. This created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire. According to an article in ''[[National Journal]]'', Rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard, because he was sworn in early due to the special election, and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the GOP leadership.<ref name=Mishak />

====Majority whip and majority leader====
Later in 2000, the [[majority leader]] of the House, [[Mike Fasano (politician)|Mike Fasano]], promoted Rubio to be one of two majority [[whip (politics)|whips]].<ref name=Mishak /> ''National Journal'' described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.<ref name=Mishak />

Fasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on [[redistricting]], which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders.<ref name=Mishak />

In December 2002, Rubio was appointed House majority leader by Speaker [[Johnnie Byrd]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F7DC37DA1706DF7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Dade Hispanics Set to Get Top Posts in House|publisher=Nl.newsbank.com|access-date=September 9, 2012|date=December 10, 2002|archive-date=April 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413132228/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F7DC37DA1706DF7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F832B87CC108EB4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Two S.

According to ''National Journal'', during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a [[centrist]] "who sought out Democrats and groups that don’t typically align with the GOP".<ref name=Mishak /> He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|undocumented immigrants]].<ref name=Mishak /> In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.<ref name=Mishak />

As a state representative, Rubio requested legislative [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]] (called "Community Budget Issue Requests" in Florida), totaling about $145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter.<ref>Sharockman, Aaron.

When he was chosen as future speaker in 2005, Rubio delivered a speech to the House in which he asked members to look in their desks, where they each found a hardcover book titled ''100 Innovative Ideas For Florida’s Future''; but the book was blank because it had not yet been written, and Rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary Floridians.<ref name=Mishak /> In 2006, after traveling around the state and talking with citizens, and compiling their ideas, Rubio published the book.<ref>Rubio, Marco.

Rubio's defenders, and some critics, point out that [[Great Recession|nationwide economic difficulties]] overlapped with much of Rubio's speakership, and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult.<ref name=Mishak />

As Rubio took office as speaker, [[Jeb Bush]] was completing his term as governor, and Bush left office in January 2007. Rubio hired 18 Bush aides, leading capitol insiders to say the speaker's suite was "the governor’s office in exile." An article in ''National Journal'' described Rubio's style as being very different from Bush's; where Bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in Tallahassee, Rubio's style was to delegate certain powers, relinquish others, and invite political rivals into his inner circle.<ref name=Mishak /> As incoming speaker, he decided to open a private dining room for legislators, which he said would give members more privacy, free from being pursued by lobbyists, though the expense led to a public relations problem.<ref name=Mishak />

In 2006, Florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property, in response to the 2005 Supreme Court decision in [[Kelo v. City of New London]] which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under [[eminent domain]]. This state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by Rubio prior to his speakership.<ref name=NR1 />

Jeb Bush was succeeded by [[Charlie Crist]], a moderate Republican who took office in January 2007. Rubio and Crist clashed frequently. Their sharpest clash involved the governor's initiative to expand casino [[Gambling in the United States|gambling]] in Florida. Rubio sued Crist for bypassing the Florida Legislature in order to make a deal with the [[Seminole Tribe]]. The [[Supreme Court of Florida|Florida Supreme Court]] sided with Rubio and blocked the deal.<ref>Deb, Sopan.

Rubio also was a critic of Crist's strategy to fight [[climate change]] through an executive order creating new automobile and utility [[emissions standards]]. Rubio accused Crist of imposing "European-style big government mandates," and the legislature under Rubio's leadership weakened the impact of Crist's climate change initiative.<ref name=Mishak /><ref name="BaconRevolt"/> Rubio said that Crist's approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment, and that a better approach would be to promote [[biofuel]] (e.g. [[ethanol]]), [[solar panel]]s, and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].<ref>Dunkelberger, Lloyd.

Rubio introduced a plan to reduce [[Property tax in the United States|state property taxes]] to 2001 levels (and potentially eliminate them altogether), while increasing [[Sales taxes in the United States|sales taxes]] by 1% to 2.5% to fund schools. The proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by $40–50 billion. His proposal passed the House, but was opposed by Governor Crist and Florida Senate Republicans, who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor. So, Rubio agreed to smaller changes, and Crist's proposal to double the state's [[Homestead exemption|property tax exemption]] from $25,000 to $50,000 (for a tax reduction estimated by Crist to be $33 billion) ultimately passed.<ref name=Mishak /><ref name=NR1>{{cite news |title=When Rubio Was the Man of Florida's House |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416889/when-rubio-was-man-floridas-house-jim-geraghty |access-date=July 23, 2015 |work=National Review |date=April 13, 2015 |last=Geraghty |first=Jim |archive-date=August 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805094331/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416889/when-rubio-was-man-floridas-house-jim-geraghty |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=TB1>{{cite news |title=Marco Rubio's U.S. Senate campaign grew out of his 2007 antitax roots |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/marco-rubios-us-senate-campaign-grew-out-of-his-2007-antitax-roots/1108354 |access-date=May 24, 2012 |newspaper=Tampa Bay Times |date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224101917/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/marco-rubios-us-senate-campaign-grew-out-of-his-2007-antitax-roots/1108354 |archive-date=February 24, 2013 |df=mdy-all |last=Leary|first=Alex}}</ref> Legislators called it the largest tax cut in Florida's history up until then.<ref name=NR1/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bousquet|first1=Steve|title=Confused now?

The risk corridors were intended to be funded by profitable insurers participating in the PPACA. However, since insurer losses have significantly exceeded their profits in the program, the risk corridors have been depleted. His efforts contributed to the inclusion of a provision in the 2014 federal budget which prevented other funding sources from being tapped to replenish the risk corridors.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261244-rubio-budget-win-is-dealing-heavy-blow-to-obamacare | work=The Hill | title=Rubio budget win is dealing heavy blow to ObamaCare | date=November 24, 2015 | last=Ferris | first=Sarah | access-date=February 23, 2016 | archive-date=February 24, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224113505/http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261244-rubio-budget-win-is-dealing-heavy-blow-to-obamacare | url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2015, Rubio and Senator [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]], Republican of Utah, proposed a tax plan which, according to ''The Wall Street Journal'', combined thinking from "old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply siders" and a "breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers" who are concerned with the tax burden on the middle-class. The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, and create a new child tax credit worth up to $2,500 per child. The plan would set the top individual income tax rate at 35%. It also included a proposal to replace the means-tested welfare system, including food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit, with a new "consolidated system of benefits".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/03/13/lee-rubio-plan-gives-life-to-2016-tax-debate/ |title=Lee-Rubio Plan Gives Life to 2016 Tax Debate |last1=King Jr. |first1=Neil |date=March 13, 2015 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

Rubio opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]] ("Obamacare"). On April 27, 2020, the US Supreme Court voted 8–1 to defeat his attempt to undermine the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/04/28/marco-rubios-final-humiliation-supreme-court-stops-gops-seven-year-campaign-against-obamacare/|title=Marco Rubio's final humiliation: Supreme Court stops GOP's seven-year campaign against Obamacare|author=Tesfaye, Sophia|work=Salon|date=April 28, 2020|access-date=September 15, 2020|archive-date=September 15, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915044331/https://www.salon.com/2020/04/28/marco-rubios-final-humiliation-supreme-court-stops-gops-seven-year-campaign-against-obamacare/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Rubio opposed the nomination of [[Merrick Garland]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], saying: “I don’t think we should be moving forward with a nominee in the last year of this president’s term. I would say that even if it was a Republican president.”<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2020-09-19|title=What every Republican senator has said about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-every-republican-senator-has-said-about-filling-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-an-election-year|access-date=2020-10-31|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-us|archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031171254/https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-every-republican-senator-has-said-about-filling-a-supreme-court-vacancy-in-an-election-year|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020, the last year of Republican President Donald Trump's term, Rubio strongly supported the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett.<ref name=":3" />

Rubio was criticized for a tweet he shared in tribute of late civil rights leader and congressman, [[John Lewis]] following his death. In the tweet, Rubio shared a photo of himself shaking hands with [[Elijah Cummings]] (also a civil rights leader and member of congress), having mistaken him for Lewis. Rubio apologized for the mistake later the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Foreman|first=Alison|title=Marco Rubio's John Lewis tribute gaffe is appropriately, savagely mocked|url=https://mashable.com/article/marco-rubio-tribute-meme/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Mashable|language=en|archive-date=July 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200720055339/https://mashable.com/article/marco-rubio-tribute-meme/|url-status=live}}</ref>
