GOProud was founded by [[Christopher R.

In June 2014, it was reported that GOProud had ceased operations and was shutting down as a political committee.<ref>http://capitolfax.com/2014/06/02/rauner-nod-was-goprouds-last-act-before-dissolving/</ref>  After initial denials, the executive director later confirmed that they were "leaving GOProud behind" and that GOProud would be dissolved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bilerico.com/2014/06/goproud_denies_then_admits_it_is_closing_down.php |title=GOProud Denies, Then Admits It Is Closing Down |publisher=The Bilerico Project |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>

==History==
[[Jimmy LaSalvia]] and [[Christopher R. Barron]] co-founded GOProud on April 15, 2009. LaSalvia was the Director of Programs and Policy for the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a gay organization identifying with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ideals. Barron was the Political Director at Log Cabin Republicans before both men decided to leave with hopes of a creating a better organization that dealt with more conservative values. They wanted to focus on the issues of the conservative agenda rather than social issues, the focus of Log Cabin Republicans. Barron and LaSalvia believe that [[same-sex marriage]] is a state issue and therefore wanted an organization that focused on the real conservative agenda.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal | last1 = Zeller | first1 = Shawn | year = 2010 | title = Out But In: New Strategy For Conservative Status | journal = CQ Weekly | volume = 68 | issue = 27| pages = 1610–11 }}</ref> [[Margaret Hoover]], a member of the advisory council, added her opinion into the mix, "GOProud has helped force gays out of the conservative establishment – what I would call the 'conser-va-gentsia' – to take on these self-anointed leaders of social conservatism."<ref>"A New Conservative Agenda." Advocate 1051 (2011): 7–8. Academic Search Premier. Web. 5 Dec. 2011.</ref>

===2010===
[[Conservative Political Action Conference]], an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States invited GOProud to its 2010 conference. The [[Family Research Council]] started a boycott of CPAC over the invitation.<ref>"New GOP Gay Group Promotes Conservative Philosophy." Contemporary Sexuality 45.4 (2011): 9. Academic Search Premier. Web. 1 Dec. 2011.</ref> Groups that followed the FRC in boycotting included the [[Concerned Women for America]], [[American Principles Project]], [[Center for Military Readiness]], [[National Organization for Marriage]] and Liberty Council.<ref>Valerie Richardson, ''The Washington Times''.

Web. 5 Dec. 2011.</ref> These conservative groups worried that adding gay members would weaken the movement.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

During a panel at the 2010 CPAC, Alexander McCobin, co-founder and executive director of [[Students For Liberty]], opened his remarks by thanking the [[American Conservative Union]] for welcoming GOProud as a co-sponsor of the event. Ryan Sorba, chairman of the [[Young Americans for Freedom|California Young Americans for Freedom]] and author of ''The "Born Gay" Hoax'', attempted to derail support for GOProud at CPAC. During his speech at the convention, he condemned GOProud for entering the conference but was eventually booed by the audience.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

===2011===

====Donald Trump's 2011 CPAC speech====

In February 2011, Trump made his first speaking appearance at the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC). His appearance at CPAC was organized by GOProud, in conjunction with GOProud supporter [[Roger Stone]], who was close with Trump.  GOProud pushed for a write-in campaign for Donald Trump at CPAC's presidential straw poll. [[Christopher R. Barron]], co-founder of GOProud who would later not only endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but also launch LGBT for Trump, said he "would love to see Mr. Trump run for president." The speech was later credited with helping to launch his political career within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/donald-trump-first-speech-to-cpac/ Gay conservatives who helped kickstart Trump's GOP career have serious regrets]</ref>

===="Don't ask, don't tell"====
"[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" is a political issue and policy enacted in 1993. This policy allowed homosexuals to serve in the military as long as their sexual orientation was undisclosed. GOProud supported repealing the policy.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2011/02/guess-whos-coming-to-cpac/|title=Guess Who's Coming to CPAC?|publisher=Metroweekly.com |date=February 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> 
GOProud condemned Minnesota Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Advocate.com Editors |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/02/10/GOProud_Slams_Pawlenty_Over_DADT/ |title=GOProud Slams Pawlenty Over DADT |publisher=The Advocate |accessdate=2011-12-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213004107/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/02/10/GOProud_Slams_Pawlenty_Over_DADT/ |archive-date=2011-02-13 }}</ref> and former Pennsylvania Senator [[Rick Santorum]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/23/rick-santorum-dadt-goproud-debate-stephen-hill_n_978033.html |title=Rick Santorum Condemned By Gay Rights Group GOProud For DADT Debate Comments |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2011-09-23|accessdate=2011-12-05 |first=Paige |last=Lavender}}</ref> – both candidates for the Republican nomination for president in 2012 – after they favoured reinstating the policy.

====Fabrizio outing====
Founders LaSalvia, who is also Executive Director, and Barron [[outing|outed]] gay pollster and Perry campaign adviser [[Tony Fabrizio]] over [[Rick Perry]]'s "Strong" campaign ad, citing what they viewed as [[homophobic]] themes in the ad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/tony-fabrizio-rick-perry-pollster-gay_n_1137091.html |title=Tony Fabrizio, Rick Perry's Top Pollster, Is Gay: GOProud Leader |publisher=Huffington Post |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-02-02}}</ref> The ensuing fallout over the outing caused the late conservative media mogul [[Andrew Breitbart]] to resign from GOProud's board. This move has also caused controversy inside the group, with many top members expressing disagreement and disgust over the outing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsy.com/videos/goproud-outs-rick-perry-adviser-after-antigay-ad/ |title=GOProud Outs Rick Perry Adviser After Antigay Ad |publisher=Newsy |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2011-12-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906100421/http://www.newsy.com/videos/goproud-outs-rick-perry-adviser-after-antigay-ad/ |archive-date=2012-09-06 }}</ref>

===2012===

In July 2011, American Conservative Union's board voted to not allow GOProud to co-sponsor the 2012 CPAC event. This led to controversy among the entities who wanted GOProud to sponsor the event.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-08-27|title=Founder of gay Republican group GOProud quits over CPAC dispute|url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-xpm-2014-feb-20-la-pn-cpac-gay-rights-goproud-conservative-20140219-story.html|date=20 February 2014|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Daniel|last=Rothberg}}</ref>

===2013===

====2013 CPAC====
GOProud was once again excluded from sponsoring CPAC in 2013, however this led to some criticism from some, such as [[S. E. Cupp]] and [[Chris Hayes (journalist)|Chris Hayes]], who boycotted attending CPAC that year over the issue.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

====Leadership change====
In April 2013, the two co-founders, executive director Jimmy LaSalvia and senior strategist Chris Barron, sold the GOProud name, a computer, a contact list, and some posters to three former interns,<ref name="thedailybeast1"/> and announced plans to step back from their day-to-day roles with the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/goproud-leaders-stepping-aside-for-someone-else-to-come-in-a |title=GOProud Leaders Stepping Aside For "Someone Else To Come In And Shake Things Up" |publisher=BuzzFeed |date=April 26, 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref>

In July 2013, the organization's Board of Directors announced that their new Leadership team consisted of Ross Hemminger, a former aide to US Senator Scott Brown; and Matthew Bechstein, a public relations consultant from California.

===2014===

====Founders leave GOProud and 2014 CPAC====
In January 2014, Jimmy LaSalvia left GOProud and the Republican party and became an [[Independent (politician)|independent]]. This was due to LaSalvia viewing the Republican Party as too bigoted and closed minded towards LGBT people.<ref name="Left GOProud1">{{cite web |url=http://jimmylasalvia.com/2014/01/13/no-party/ |title=No Party |date=January 13, 2014 |first=Jimmy |last=LaSalvia |accessdate=January 22, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Left GOProud2">{{cite news|author-link = Michelangelo Signorile|first = Michelangelo|last = Signorile|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/20/jimmy-lasalvia-republican-party-_n_4626851.html|title = Jimmy LaSalvia, Former GOProud Founder, On Republican Party's 'Cultural Disease,' Aaron Schock|newspaper = [[The Huffington Post]]|date = 2014-01-20|accessdate = 2014-03-28}}</ref>

In February, founder Chris Barron resigned from GOProud to protest what he called "an unconditional surrender to the forces of bigotry"<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Geidner |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/goproud-founder-chris-barron-leaves-board-over-cpac-flap |title=GOProud Founder Chris Barron Quits Board Over CPAC Flap |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date=2014-02-20 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> after the new leaders, Hemminger and Bechstein, accepted an offer from the organizers of CPAC to allow them to attend the conference as guests, without a booth or other formal presence for GOProud.

====Dissolution====
In June 2014, reports surfaced that the GOProud leadership had decided to dissolve the organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bilerico.com/2014/06/lgbt_republican_group_goproud_to_shut_down.php |title=LGBT Republican Group GOProud to Shut Down |publisher=The Bilerico Project |date=2014-06-01 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>  Executive Director Matthew Bechstein issued a denial of the report, stating that it was untrue and that the organization would continue operating as it had. But the following day he admitted that "I posted what I had to on Facebook so I wouldn't scare our members and thwart our fundraising efforts. I wanted to mitigate a disaster."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bilerico.com/2014/06/goproud_denies_then_admits_it_is_closing_down.php#GdvHhA4j2LdQ3vH3.99 |title=GOProud Denies, Then Admits It Is Closing Down |publisher=The Bilerico Project |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref>  He then stated that GOProud did indeed plan to file dissolution papers with the government.<ref>{{cite news |author=David Badash |url=http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/gay-tea-party-group-goproud-definitely-shutting-down-director-admits-he-lied/news/2014/06/02/88447 |title=Gay Tea Party Group GOProud Definitely Shutting Down – Director Admits He Lied |newspaper=[[The New Civil Rights Movement]] |date=2014-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909062842/http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/gay-tea-party-group-goproud-definitely-shutting-down-director-admits-he-lied/news/2014/06/02/88447 |archive-date=2016-09-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
