=== Rivalry with Prime Minister Borisov ===
[[File:Opening ceremony (38929654984).jpg|thumb|President Rumen Radev (left) and Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]] (right). The two Bulgarian leaders often publicly clash.|alt=|left]]
Since his election into office, Radev has frequently criticised Bulgarian Prime Minister [[Boyko Borisov]], whom Radev views as permitting [[Corruption in Bulgaria|corruption]] through a 'reckless leadership style', as well as attempting to strangle his political opposition. This led Radev to frequently [[veto]] legislative proposals submitted by Borisov's [[GERB]] party to [[Bulgarian Parliament]], issuing a total of 19 vetoes in this first two and a half years of his presidency.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epicenter.bg/article/Radev-za-Borisov-/182667/2/0|title=Радев с тежка критика към Борисов: Безконтролният му стил на управление генерира огромна корупция|last=Епицентър|website=epicenter.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/prezidentyt-sreshtu-subsidiia-ot-1-lv.glas-borisov-mu-otgovori-6096498|title=Радев за субсидия 1 лев на глас: Задушава опозицията|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/bg/%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%BC%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0/a-47210808|title=Две години Радев: какво разбрахме за президента|website=www.dw.com|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.bg/politika/2019/08/09/3948299_prezidentut_radev_se_ochertava_rekordyor_po_nalagane/|title=Президентът Радев се очертава рекордьор по налагане на вето|website=www.dnevnik.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> Borisov, on the other hand, often accused Radev of 'sabotaging the government's work', as well as supporting the opposition [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] during campaign periods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.bg/politics/borisov-se-vazmuti-vsyako-izkazvane-na-radev-e-protiv-upravlenieto.html|title=Борисов се възмути: Всяко изказване на Радев е против управлението|last=news.bg|date=2019-05-09|website=News.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webcafe.bg/newscafe/politika/id_1562940051_Borisov_Radev_opita_da_napravi_predizboren_podarak_na_BSP|title=Борисов: Радев опита да направи предизборен подарък на БСП {{!}} webcafe.bg|website=www.webcafe.bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

In his 2019 [[New Year]]'s address to the Bulgarian People, broadcast on almost all Bulgarian TV channels, Radev stated that he believed that [[Third Borisov Government|Borisov's Government]] had failed in addressing [[Corruption in Bulgaria|corruption]], placed the country in [[economic stagnation]] with price increases and low wages, undermined the fairness of [[Elections in Bulgaria|elections]], as well as 'retreated' from law and justice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.president.bg/speeches-and-statements4773/novogodishno-obrashtenie-na-prezidenta-rumen-radev.html|title=Новогодишно обръщение на президента Румен Радев|website=President.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standartnews.com/balgariya-politika/nedovolstvo-v-novogodishnata-rech-na-prezidenta-381606.html|title=Недоволство в новогодишната реч на президента|website=Недоволство в новогодишната реч на президента - Политика - Стандарт Нюз|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

==== F-16 deal veto ====
[[File:Reuven Rivlin greeting Roman Radev, March 2018 (8651).jpg|thumb|Radev with Israeli President [[Reuven Rivlin]], March 20, 2018]]In June 2019, Radev vetoed a major government contract for the acquisition of several [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcons]] from the [[United States]] at a cost of around 2bln [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]. Radev strongly criticised the deal, accusing the government of [[authoritarianism]] and stated that he believed it had agreed to downgrades in the jets' [[avionics]] and armament, in order to get a lower purchasing price, which he also deemed too high for what they are worth. He added, that as a former [[Aircraft pilot|pilot]] and airforce commander, he didn't believe that the deal was in Bulgaria's best interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/sviat/radev-nalozhi-veto-na-sdelkata-za-f-16-vizhte-zashto-6097919|title=Радев наложи вето на сделката за Ф-16, вижте защо|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bnt.bg/bg/a/prezidentt-radev-opovesti-motivite-si-za-vetoto-vrkhu-dogovora-za-f-16|title=Президентът Радев разясни мотивите си за ветото върху договора за F-16|last=Марков|first=Александър|website=Новини БНТ|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> The pro-government majority in Bulgaria's national assembly overruled Radev's veto and the deal was nonetheless concluded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/ns-othvyrli-vetoto-za-f-16-shte-kupuvame-iztrebitelite-6098022|title=НС отхвърли ветото за Ф-16, ще купуваме изтребителите|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dariknews.bg/novini/bylgariia/otnovo-naprezhenie-sred-upravliavashtite-zaradi-f-16-obzor-2178460|title=Отново напрежение сред управляващите заради F-16 (ОБЗОР) - България|website=dariknews.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

==== Rejection of Geshev as General Prosecutor ====
In November 2019, Radev refused to sign the decree appointing [[Ivan Geshev]] to the post of Chief Public Prosecutor of Bulgaria, following the latter's election to the post by Bulgaria's Supreme Judicial Council. He did not officially declare the motive for his refusal in written form, instead deciding to explain it personally to the media. Radev remarked that Geshev was the only candidate for the post and opined that the single-candidate nature of his election was supported by Borisov's government. He expressed the opinion that Geshev's candidacy had been supported only by government-controlled institutions and not by civic ones, which in his eyes led to a lack of public confidence in the institution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://breaking.bg/novini/%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%8a%d1%82-%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b2-%d0%be%d1%82%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b4%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%87%d0%b8-%d0%b3%d0%b5%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%b2-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b3%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%be%d0%ba%d1%83%d1%80%d0%be%d1%80/|title=Президентът Радев отказа да назначи Гешев за главен прокурор|last=Ганчев|first=Невелин|date=2019-11-07|website=Breaking.bg|language=bg-BG|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faktor.bg/bg/articles/novini-balgariya-r-radev-otkaza-da-podpishe-ukaz-za-naznachavaneto-na-geshev-za-glaven-prokuror|title=Радев отказа да подпише указ за назначаването на Гешев за главен прокурор|website=Фактор|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.lex.bg/%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%8a%d1%82-%d0%be%d1%82%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b4%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%bf%d0%b8%d1%88%d0%b5-%d1%83%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7-%d0%b7%d0%b0/|title=Президентът отказа да подпише указ за назначаването на Иван Гешев за главен прокурор|date=2019-11-07|website=Lex.bg News|language=bg-BG|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref> The Supreme Judicial Council refused to revise their decision and voted in favour of Geshev a second time, which triggred a constitutional requirement for Radev as President to sign the decree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapool.bg/geshev-e-povtorno-izbran-za-glaven-prokuror-sled-skandali-obvineniya-i-zaplahi-na-hod-e-prezidentat-news300230.html|title=Гешев е повторно избран за главен прокурор след скандали, обвинения и заплахи.

===== Wiretapping scandal =====
The relations between Radev and the newly appointed General Prosecutor quickly soured, as Geshev released what he stated was a [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] of Radev discussing his involvement in alleged criminal activities. Geshev further appealed to the [[Constitutional Court of Bulgaria]] to have Radev's [[legal immunity]] revoked. The general prosecutor's actions backfired in the eyes of the Bulgarian people and were widely viewed as an attempt to suppress and censor the president - either as 'revenge' for the President's initial veto of Geshev's appointment, or as a preparation for a move to remove Radev from his post as President.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellinews.com/conflict-between-bulgaria-s-president-chief-prosecutor-escalates-after-incriminating-wiretaps-released-175550/|title=Conflict between Bulgaria's president, chief prosecutor escalates after incriminating wiretaps released {{!}} bne IntelliNews|date=2020-01-29|website=www.intellinews.com|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://btvnovinite.bg/bulgaria/podslushani-razgovori-konfliktat-mezhdu-radev-i-geshev-navleze-v-nova-faza-obzor.html|title=Подслушани разговори: Конфликтът между Радев и Гешев навлезе в нова фаза (ОБЗОР)|website=bTV Новините|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In response, Radev accused Geshev's prosecution of being controlled by Borisov's government, whom he accused of using both the prosecution, the secret services and the [[National Police Service (Bulgaria)|National Police Service]] to crush dissent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bta.bg/en/c/DF/id/2152694|title=President Radev: Prime Minister Borissov Uses Services for His Political Purposes|website=www.bta.bg|language=en-EN|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>

Borisov swore that he hadn't ordered Radev to be wiretapped,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/8199036|title=Борисов изненада Радев, подаде му ръка, вижте (Видео, снимки)|website=www.24chasa.bg|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> but Radev doubled down - noting that the agency responsible for wiretapping in Bulgaria, the [[State Agency for National Security]], was directly responsible to the government and the prime minister. He further questioned the motives as to why it appeared to him as though the general prosecutor "saw crime and corruption in everything, except for the council of ministers".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnr.bg/en/post/101227277/president-radev-asks-why-bulgarias-prosecutor-general-sees-crime-and-corruption-everywhere-but-not-in-the-council-of-ministers|title=President Radev asks why Bulgaria's Prosecutor General sees crime and corruption everywhere but not in the Council of Ministers|website=www.bnr.bg|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>

==== Declaration of no confidence ====
On 4 February 2020, Radev announced that he had formally withdrawn [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] in Borisov's government. He pointed out that there was, in his opinion, a strong crisis in the governance of all levels, a lack of will to reform and fight corruption, and a state of morally-questionable lawlessness in the country. Borisov accused Radev of trying to "take over" the country and stated that his government did not depend on Radev for confidence, adding that he believed the Presidency to be a useless post, holding only 'symbolic councils', which he asserted never decided anything.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://balkaneu.com/bulgaria-clash-of-institutions-for-radev-and-borissov/|title=Bulgaria: Clash of institutions for Radev and Borissov|date=2020-02-04|website=Independent Balkan News Agency|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://europost.eu/en/a/view/pm-borissov-president-s-statement-disunite-the-nation-27229|title=PM Borissov: President's statement disunites the nation|website=europost.eu|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>

==== Coronavirus response conflict ====
After the start of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria]], Radev and Borisov's government initially appeared to thaw their relations for the sake of national unity during a time of crisis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnes.bg/politika/2020/03/14/borisov-i-radev-obsydili-situaciiata-s-koronavirusa-u-nas.442210|title=Борисов и Радев обсъдили ситуацията с коронавируса у нас {{!}} Dnes.bg|website=www.dnes.bg|language=bg|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> This détente, however, was not to last - the two entered into another conflict shortly thereafter, with Radev partially vetoing a law passed by the Bulgarian government imposing additional measures in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. Radev objected to a paragraph criminalizing the spread of "fake news" with a fine of up to 5,000 euros. Surprisingly, Radev also vetoed a paragraph added on the insistence of the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]], which was supposed to impose [[price controls]] on essential goods. The veto sparked anger in Borisov, who accused Radev of populism and political opportunism. Despite this, Borisov ordered his parliamentary group to accept the veto on the two paragraphs - removing both the fake news fine and the socialist-added price control paragraphs from the final version of the law. The amended bill, however, still featured a paragraph which obligated telecom providers to track and store their user's data for up to 6 months and provide it upon request of the authorities, with the stated goal of tracking the movements quarantined citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Bulgaria/Bulgaria-if-coronavirus-tests-freedom-of-expression-200377|title=Bulgaria, if coronavirus tests freedom of expression|last=Caucaso|first=Osservatorio Balcani e|website=Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso|language=it|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>

The two continued to clash over the coming days, with Radev frequently criticising the government for its handling of the state of emergency and accusing it of [[Quoting out of context|quote mining]] the [[World Health Organization]] for political gains. In reply, Borisov accused Radev of sabotaging the state of emergency and compared Radev to a "dirty old hag of a mother-in-law, the nasty kind", expressing bewilderment at "how Radev was able to make [political] inflammatory statements on the day, in which his own [Radev's] father had passed away". Radev concluded, however, that the conflict was "only in Borisov's head", stating that he had never called for the state of the emergency to be lifted and merely disagreed with the government's handling of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurocom.bg/new/radev-nikoga-ne-sm-kazval-da-padnat-ogranicheniyata-tozi-spor-e-samo-v-glavata-na-borisov|title=Радев: Никога не съм казвал да паднат ограниченията, този спор е само в главата на Борисов|last=Евроком|first=Телевизия|website=Телевизия Евроком|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2020/04/03/4050128_borisov_prezidentut_govori_nelepici_da_naloji_veto_na/|title=Борисов: Президентът говори нелепици, да наложи вето на извънредното положение|website=www.dnevnik.bg|language=bg|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>
==== Borisov photo scandal and drone controversy ====
In June 2020, photographs emerged that purported to show what appeared to be Prime Minister Borisov laying half-naked on a bed, next to a nightstand featuring a handgun and stacks of [[euro]] banknotes. Borisov confirmed that the room in which the photos were taken was his, but denied the gun and money, stating that the images could have been manipulated. Borisov accused President Radev of flying a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|consumer drone]] into his residence in order to take the pictures. He also accused former Ombudswoman [[Maya Manolova]], TV star [[Slavi Trifonov]] and his own former second in command [[Tsvetan Tsvetanov]] (who had just left and condemned the ruling party) of involvement in a plot to take photos of him while he was sleeping in a "KGB-Style" [[kompromat]] operation. Radev condemned the leaks and called it an "insane" invasion of the prime minister's privacy. He added that he owns a drone, but that the accusation that he personally piloted it into the prime minister's residence to take pictures was part of Borisov's "fantasy and paranoia".<ref>{{Cite web|date=18 June 2020|title=A Gun on a Nightstand and Wads of Cash Escalate Bulgarian Feud|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-18/a-gun-on-a-nightstand-and-wads-of-cash-escalate-bulgarian-feud|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=Gotev|first1=Georgi|last2=Nikolov|first2=Krassen|date=2020-06-18|title=Borissov fends off 'kompromats', says will sleep with a gun|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/borissov-fends-off-kompromats-says-will-sleep-with-a-gun/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=www.euractiv.com|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Dzhambazova|first1=Boryana|last2=Kingsley|first2=Patrick|date=2020-07-19|title=Showdown on Beach in Bulgaria Balloons Into Political Crisis|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/world/europe/bulgaria-protests.html|access-date=2020-07-20|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-18|title=Bedroom Photos Leave Bulgarian Prime Minister Red-faced|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/06/18/bulgarian-prime-minister-enters-a-survival-mode/|access-date=2020-07-20|website=Balkan Insight|language=en-US}}</ref>
==== Arrest of advisors and anti-government protests ====
{{Main|2020 Bulgarian protests}}

In July 2020, agents of Chief Prosecutor Geshev entered the Presidency and detained several of the President's advisors. This, alongside the photo scandal and an incident on a Burgas beach significantly impacted the credibility Borisov's government, leading to the beginning of [[2020 Bulgarian protests|large-scale anti-government protests]], which Radev openly supported. Radev made a televised address to the nation, in which he demanded that both the entire government and the chief prosecutor resign.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-11|title=Bulgaria: PM Borissov and government urged to resign by president|url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/11/bulgaria-president-calls-for-borissov-and-government-to-resign-amid-anti-corruption-protes|access-date=2020-07-23|website=euronews|language=en}}</ref> 
=== Foreign Policy ===
[[File:Vladimir Putin and Rumen Radev (2018-05-22) 03.jpg|thumb|Radev with Vladimir Putin in Sochi, May 22, 2018|left]]In February 2017, Radev condemned and called for an end to the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|EU sanctions against Russia]], while at the same time describing the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] as a "violation of international law".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/radev-sankciite-sreshtu-rusiia-ne-pomagat-samo-vrediat-6065604|title=Радев повтори: Санкциите срещу Русия не помагат, само вредят|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

On 17 March 2017, Radev condemned as 'absolutely unacceptable' what he described as a Turkish intervention in Bulgaria's [[2017 Bulgarian parliamentary election|2017 parliamentary election]] after the Turkish ambassador to Bulgaria was found to have appeared in a campaign clip for one of Bulgaria's political parties and after Turkish Social Affairs minister was found to have agitated and offer incentives for [[Bulgarian Turks in Turkey]] to cross the border in an organized voting campaign and vote for the same party. Radev stated that he had referred the matter to the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/politika/rumen-radev-namesata-na-turciia-e-nedopustima-6066805|title=Румен Радев: Намесата на Турция е абсолютно недопустима|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref> He met with Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] several months later in July, following which he described Turkey as an "important neighbour, partner and ally", while at the same time stating that this status hinged on Turkey's respect for Bulgaria's  "internal political process, regarding Bulgaria's political parties and electoral system". He also became the only EU [[head of state]] to attend Erdogan's inauguration, stating that his mandate was not given to him by either the [[European Commission]] or the Bulgarian Government, but by the Bulgarian people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.president.bg/news4525/rumen-radev-turkey-is-bulgarias-important-neighbor-partner-and-ally-and-it-is-essential-for-our-bilateral-relations-that-we-do-not-leave-unsolved-problems.html|title=Румен Радев: Турция е важен съсед, партньор и съюзник на България и за нашите двустранни отношения е важно да не оставяме нерешени въпроси|website=President.bg|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>


On 24 January 2018, Radev condemned the [[Operation Olive Branch|Turkish invasion of northern Syria]] aimed at ousting U.S.-backed [[People's Protection Units|Syrian Kurds]] from the enclave of [[Afrin, Syria|Afrin]], and insisted that the European Union should intervene to stop it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ahvalnews.com/bulgaria-turkey/bulgarian-president-calls-eu-intervention-against-turkish-syria-incursion |title=Bulgarian President calls for EU intervention against Turkish Syria incursion – Ahval |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.artigercek.com/bulgaristan-dan-ab-ye-afrin-e-acil-mudahale-cagrisi |title=Bulgaristan'dan AB'ye: Afrin'e acil müdahale edin |website=Arti Gerçek |accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>[[File:Rumen Radev and Desislava Radeva in Musée d'Orsay.jpg|thumb|213x213px|Radev with his wife [[Desislava Radeva]]]]In April 2018, he criticised the [[2018 missile strikes against Syria]], instead calling for "less weapons and more dialogue".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bnt.bg/bg/a/radev-za-siriya-ksns-situatsiyata-v-stranata-i-svoya-partiya|title=Президентът Радев се изказа критично за ударите в Сирия|last=Александрова|first=Вера|website=Новини БНТ|language=bg|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dariknews.bg/novini/bylgariia/rumen-radev-prizova-za-po-malko-oryzhiia-i-poveche-dialog-2091141|title=Румен Радев призова за "по-малко оръжия и повече диалог" - България|website=dariknews.bg|language=bg|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

In February 2019, Radev condemned the [[Third Borisov Government|Bulgarian Government]]'s recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader [[Juan Guaidó]] as Interim [[President of Venezuela]] during the [[2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis]], adding that he believed the government had overstepped its authority in recognizing the opposition leader as Interim President. Radev further criticised the EU's recognition of Guaido, urging both the country and the EU to remain neutral and refrain from recognizing Guaido, as he viewed such recognition as imposing an [[ultimatum]], which he deemed would only aggravate the crisis in Venezuela.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapool.bg/radev-poiska-bulgaria-da-ne-podkrepya-opozitsiyata-vav-venetsuela-news289452.html|title=Радев поиска България да не подкрепя опозицията във Венецуела|website=Mediapool.bg|language=bg-BG|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vesti.bg/bulgaria/radev-atakuva-borisov-sravni-bylgariia-s-venecuela-6091831|title=Радев атакува Борисов, сравни България с Венецуела|website=Vesti.bg|language=bg|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>

Radev has enjoyed positive approval ratings for the vast majority of his presidency.

==Family and personal life==
Radev joined the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] in the 1980s. He later stated that his primary reason for joining the party had been so that he would be deployed to fly in a [[Supersonic aircraft|supersonic jet]], but also added that he was not ashamed of his past and was proud of the things he did. He left the party in 1990, when a newly enacted law forbade members of the country's armed forces from being members of political parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trud.bg/%d0%b3%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d1%80%d1%83%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b2-%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%82-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82/|title=Ген.
