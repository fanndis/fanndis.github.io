'''Feminine hygiene''' products are [[personal care]] products used during [[menstruation]], [[vaginal discharge]], and other bodily functions related to the [[vulva]] and [[vagina]]. Those products that are used during menstruation may also be called '''menstrual hygiene products'''. Products used may include [[sanitary napkin]]s ([[American English]]) or sanitary towels ([[British English]]), [[tampon]]s, [[pantyliner]]s, [[menstrual cups]], and [[period panties]]. Feminine hygiene products also include products meant to cleanse the vulva or vagina, such as [[douche|douches]], [[feminine wipe]]s, and soap. Feminine hygiene products that are meant to cleanse may lead to allergic reaction and irritation, as the vagina naturally flushes out bacteria.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Feeling Fresh|url=https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/feminine-hygiene.html|access-date=2018-11-07|website=kidshealth.org}}</ref> Many health professionals advise against douching because it can change the balance of vaginal flora and acidity.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-02-21|title=Douching {{!}} Womenshealth.gov|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/douching|access-date=2018-11-07|website=womenshealth.gov}}</ref>

Feminine hygiene products are either [[disposable]] or [[reuse|reusable]]. Sanitary napkins, tampons, and pantyliners are disposable feminine hygiene products. Menstrual cups, cloth menstrual pads, period panties, and sponges are reusable feminine hygiene products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nicole|first=Wendee|date=March 2014|title=A Question for Women's Health: Chemicals in Feminine Hygiene Products and Personal Lubricants |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=122 |issue=3|pages=A70–A75|doi=10.1289/ehp.122-A70|pmc=3948026|pmid=24583634}}</ref>

==Society and culture==
{{Main|Culture and menstruation}}

In low-income countries, women's choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms.<ref>UNESCO (2014). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2213 Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management - Good Policy and Practice in health Education - Booklet 9]. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris, France, p. 32</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kaur|first=Rajanbir|last2=Kaur|first2=Kanwaljit|last3=Kaur|first3=Rajinder|date=2018|title=Menstrual Hygiene, Management, and Waste Disposal: Practices and Challenges Faced by Girls/Women of Developing Countries|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|volume=2018|pages=1730964|doi=10.1155/2018/1730964|issn=1687-9805|pmc=5838436|pmid=29675047}}</ref>

===Costs and tax===
{{see|Tampon tax}}
[[File:Menstrual hygiene product dispenser.jpg|thumb|Menstrual hygiene product dispenser ]]
Tampon tax is a shorthand for sales tax charged on tampons, pads, and menstrual cups. The cost of these commercial products for menstrual management is considered to be unacceptably high for many low-income women. At least half a million women across the world do not have enough money to adequately afford these products. This can result in missing school or even dropping out. In some jurisdictions similar necessities like medical devices and toilet paper are not taxed. Several initiatives worldwide advocate to eliminate the tax all together. In some countries, such petitions have already been successful (for example parts of the UK and the United States).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/could-this-be-the-first-country-to-end-period-poverty/ar-AAw1fu4|title=Could this be the first country to end 'period poverty'?|work=www.msn.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053428/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/could-this-be-the-first-country-to-end-period-poverty/ar-AAw1fu4|archive-date=19 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax|author=Nosheena Mobarik|date=3 October 2018|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15}}</ref>

===Access to products in prisons===
The Federal bureau of Prisons in the [[United States]] announced that women in its facilities would be guaranteed free menstrual pads and tampons. In section 411 of the First Step Act which was passed on May 22, 2018 states, "The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall make the healthcare products described in subsection (c) available to prisoners for free, in a quantity that is appropriate to the healthcare needs of each prisoner".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5682/text#toc-H2AA5480F32E04078BF96E84FE829FB76|title=Text - H.R.5682 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): FIRST STEP Act|date=2018-05-23}}</ref>

=== Other social views ===
{{See also|Virginity test}}
For those with [[autism]], using pads before menstruation begins may help reduce sensory issues associated with menstrual hygiene products. Prior education and practice may help familiarize an individual with body changes and the process of using products associated with menstruation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=101 Tips for the Parents of Girls with Autism : the Most Crucial Things You Need to Know About Diagnosis, Doctors, Schools, Taxes, Vaccinations, Babysitters, Treatment, Food, Self-Care, and More.|last=Lyons, Tony.|isbn=9781629148427|oclc=1054370720|date = 2015-04-14}}</ref> 

Menstruation may occur despite paralyzation; product use depends on the individual's personal preference.<ref name=":72">Farrell, Kate, et al. ''Period: Twelve Voices Tell the Bloody Truth''. Feiwel and Friends, an Imprint of Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC, 2018.</ref> 

Some girls and women may view tampons and menstrual cups as affecting their [[virginity]] even though they have not engaged in [[sexual intercourse]].<ref name=":36">{{Cite book|title=The V book : a doctor's guide to complete vulvovaginal health|last=Stewart, Elizabeth Gunther.|date=2002|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780307492449|oclc=773813783}}</ref>
