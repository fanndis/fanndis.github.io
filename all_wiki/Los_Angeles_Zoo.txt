The '''Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens''' is a {{convert|133|acre|adj=on}} [[zoo]] founded in 1966 and located in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The city of Los Angeles owns the entire zoo, its land and facilities, and the animals. Animal care, grounds maintenance, construction, education, public information, and administrative staff are city employees. As of June 2019, [[Denise Verret|Denise M. Verret]] serves as the zoo's director,  the first female [[African American]] director of an [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]-accredited institution.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2019/07/07/meet-the-la-zoos-new-director/</ref>

==History==

The first zoo, called the [[Griffith Park Zoo]], opened in 1912 and was located about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} south of the current zoo site until it was closed in August 1966.<ref name=history/> Remnants of the original zoo remain. The site of the current zoo was formerly the location of [[Rodger Young Village]], which was itself built on the land which had been used for the Griffith Park Aerodrome.

The zoo opened in its present location on November 28, 1966.<ref name=history/>

By the early 1990s, the zoo's infrastructure was deteriorating. In January 1992, a ten-inch water pipe burst, leaving half of the zoo without water. The next day, city officials passed a $300 million master plan that had been recently drafted to deal with the infrastructure problems and inadequate exhibits.<ref name=renovation/> The zoo nearly lost its accreditation in 1995 because of deplorable conditions; however it rebounded under a new director.<ref name=ABC2000>[https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=94673 L.A. Zoo Wrestles WIth Gorilla Escapes], ABC News, December 18, 2000, accessed April 13, 2013.</ref>

In 1998, the zoo opened [[Common chimpanzee|Chimpanzee]]s of the Mahale Mountains, followed by Red Ape RainForest in 2000, the Komodo Dragon Exhibit, the Winnick Family Children Zoo in 2001, the Entry Plaza, Children's Discovery Center and Sea Lion Cliffs (now Sea Life Cliffs) in 2005, Campo Gorilla Reserve in November 2007, Elephants of Asia in the winter of 2010, and the LAIR (Living Amphibians, Invertebrates, and Reptiles) in 2012.<ref name="zoo_about"/>

On June 26, 2012, a chimpanzee infant baby, born to Gracie, a member of a 15-chimpanzee tribe (one of the largest chimpanzee tribes of any North American zoo), was mauled to death by an adult male chimpanzee. The zoo said this event was totally unexpected, although it also stated that acts of aggression by male chimpanzees (toward humans, or toward a rival male chimpanzee over territory or a desired female) are always a possibility—indeed, there have been several well-known cases of male chimpanzee aggression in recent years. Gracie was allowed to keep her baby overnight to grieve, and counseling was being offered to staff (none had witnessed the event), and to the visitors who had seen the event. It is reexamining its policy of how it introduces baby chimpanzees to the tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/27/12437949-adult-chimp-mauls-baby-chimp-to-death-in-front-of-los-angeles-zoo-visitors?lite |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628194855/http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/27/12437949-adult-chimp-mauls-baby-chimp-to-death-in-front-of-los-angeles-zoo-visitors?lite |archivedate=June 28, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Escapes===
The Los Angeles Zoo has had a number of notable escaped animals over the years. A particular spate of escapes took place during the late 1990s and early 2000s when, in half a decade, at least 35 animals escaped the zoo including zebras, chimps, kangaroos and antelopes.<ref name=Time-Evelyn>Josh Sanburn, [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2041628_2041646_2041657,00.html Evelyn the Gorilla, Los Angeles], ''Time'', March 30, 2011, accessed April 13, 2013.</ref>

Evelyn, the gorilla, escaped her enclosure approximately five times. In one widely covered incident, she used some overgrown vines to pull herself out of her exhibit. She then had full run of the zoo for an hour as TV-news copters hovered overhead and visitors were evacuated before she was tranquilized.<ref name=Time-Evelyn/> In a prior incident, she hopped on the back of another gorilla, Jim, to make her escape (Jim had also previously escaped). Part of the problem was the gorilla habitat was originally intended to house bears.<ref name=ABC2000/> The situation was relieved by the opening of the specially designed Campo Gorilla Reserve in 2007.

In 1979, Virginia, the wolf, escaped the zoo multiple times by ascending trees, climbing fences, and walking along branches until she could escape. At one time she eluded capture for a month by hiding in Griffith Park. It is unclear whether Virginia was ever recaptured.<ref name=Time-Virginia>Josh Sanburn, [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2041628_2041646_2041654,00.html Virginia the Wolf, Los Angeles], ''Time'', March 30, 2011, accessed April 13, 2013.</ref>

In 2014, a bighorn sheep escaped from its enclosure, and ultimately the zoo itself. It was struck by a car approximately three hours later, and subsequently died.<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Los Angeles Zoo Red Ape Rain Forest Creek.jpg|thumb|right|alt=See accompanying text.|Three Bornean orangutans rest amongst bamboo sway poles and a creek.]]
Red Ape Rain Forest, a recreation of a [[Southeast Asia]]n jungle, opened in 2000 and houses [[Bornean orangutan]]s. The {{convert|6000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} mesh enclosure, which has openings for the guest path to go through, is shaped like a horizontal [[torus|donut]] and back-dropped by [[hibiscus]], [[bamboo]], and [[rubber tree]]s. The apes can climb on artificial sway poles, branches, and vines placed throughout the exhibit or wade in a shallow stream. Visitors enter the exhibit through an Indonesian pagoda, continue over the stream on a deck bridge, and arrive at a small pavilion with a glass viewing window. The path next leads to a large central deck where guests can view the entirety of the surrounding exhibit. Afterwards, guests proceed to an interpretive area with traditional Indonesian folklore and exit the exhibit area through another pagoda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joncoedesign.com/zoo/laz_ape.htm |title=Red Apes of the Rainforest |publisher=Jon Coe Design |work=joncoedesign.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321041814/http://www.joncoedesign.com/zoo/laz_ape.htm |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lazoo.org/redape/description.html |title=Red Apes of the Rain Forest |last=Coe |first=Jon |year=1997 |website=lazoo.org |publisher=Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210052901/http://lazoo.org/redape/description.html |archivedate=February 10, 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lazoo.org/whatsnewfiles/orangbreak.html |title=Los Angeles Zoo Kicks Off Construction of New $5 Million Orangutan Habitat |date=May 24, 1999 |website=lazoo.org |publisher=Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000617030918/http://lazoo.org/whatsnewfiles/orangbreak.html |archivedate=June 17, 2000 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Conservation==
The Los Angeles Zoo has been successful in its breeding program of the rare [[California condor]], helping to grow the number of condors in the world from a low of 22 in the 1980s to over 430 today.<ref name=conservation/> It is one of the few zoos worldwide to have the [[mountain tapir]], and is the only zoo outside of [[Peru]] and [[Brazil]] to house the [[red uakari]]. <ref>https://zooscape.lazoo.org/2019/09/01/remembering-inti/</ref> It was one of the first zoos to successfully breed [[echidnas]] and gave birth to the first [[Coquerel's sifaka]] outside of Madagascar, the sifaka's native homeland.

==Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association==
The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA) was created in 1963 and is a nonprofit corporation created to support the Los Angeles Zoo in its mission to nurture wildlife and enrich the human experience. GLAZA's primary responsibility is to seek and provide financial support for the zoo's programs and capital projects. GLAZA also provides support through membership, organizing special events and travel programs, producing award-winning publications, coordinating one of the largest zoo volunteer programs in the country, administering the contract for visitor services concessions within the zoo, and supporting community relations, and public relations.<ref name="glaza"/>

==Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center==
Named after philanthropists Robert and Suzanne Gottlieb, the Gottlieb Animal Health and Conservation Center is a {{convert|33589|sqft|-2|adj=on}} facility situated in a restricted area in the upper reaches of the zoo. Among other features, it includes a state-of-the-art intensive care unit, an on-site commissary, a surgical suite with observation area, and research facilities. In 2007 the facility handled 853 medical cases. The smallest patient treated was a spider tortoise (0.08&nbsp;kg) and the largest was an Asian elephant (4,826&nbsp;kg).
