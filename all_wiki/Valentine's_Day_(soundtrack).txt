'''''Valentine's Day Soundtrack''''' is the official [[soundtrack]] to the 2010 film ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]'', released on February 9, 2010 via [[Big Machine Records]]. The album includes contributions from [[country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop artists]], including Big Machine artists [[Taylor Swift]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Steel Magnolia]].

==Content==
"[[Keep On Lovin' You]]" was recorded by [[Steel Magnolia]], the second-season winners of the talent show ''[[Can You Duet]]'', on its [[Steel Magnolia — EP|self-titled]] debut [[extended play]]. The song has reached Top 10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts.

[[Taylor Swift]] has two cuts: "[[Jump then Fall]]" and "[[Today Was a Fairytale]]," both of which had previously been released as digital singles. [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]'s "[[Stay Here Forever]]" was also released to country radio in advance of the album's release.

==Critical reception==
Jessica Phillips of ''[[Country Weekly]]'' gave the soundtrack three stars out of five, saying that "no sound track about love is complete without country music" and praising the cuts by Swift, Jewel and Steel Magnolia, but adding that it "could have mined a little deeper into country music's rich vault."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jessica|date=8 March 2010|title=Album reviews|journal=Country Weekly|volume=17|issue=10|page=54|issn=1074-3235}}</ref>
