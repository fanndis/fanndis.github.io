The '''London Borough of Merton''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-LBMerton.ogg|ˈ|m|ɜ|t|ə|n}}) is a [[London borough|borough]] in south-west [[London]], [[England]].

The borough was formed under the [[London Government Act 1963]] in 1965 by the merger of the [[Municipal Borough of Mitcham]], the [[Municipal Borough of Wimbledon]] and the [[Merton and Morden Urban District]], all formerly within [[Surrey]]. The main commercial centres in Merton are [[Mitcham]], [[Morden]] and [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], of which Wimbledon is the largest. Other smaller centres include [[Raynes Park]], [[Colliers Wood]], [[South Wimbledon]], [[Wimbledon Park]] and [[Pollards Hill]]. The borough is the host of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tournament]], one of [[tennis]]'s [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] competitions.

The borough derives its name from the historic parish of [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]] which was centred on the area now known as [[South Wimbledon]].  Merton was chosen as an acceptable compromise, following a dispute between Wimbledon and [[Mitcham]] over the new borough's name. The local authority is [[Merton London Borough Council]], which is based in [[Morden]].

==Merton Borough Council==
[[File:Merton_London_UK_labelled_ward_map_2002.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Merton since 2002]]
{{main|Merton London Borough Council}}
The May 2014 local government elections saw the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] win an overall majority, following the gain of seven seats from the Conservative Party, and one from UKIP. This followed four years as a minority administration. The current council has a Labour majority and its composition is:

* Labour: 34
* Conservatives: 17
* Liberal Democrats: 6
* Merton Park Residents: 3

==Mayors==
At the Annual Council Meeting, a ceremonial mayor is elected to serve for a year. At the same time, it elects a deputy mayor to serve alongside the mayor. Since 1978, each Mayor must also be an elected councillor. Cllr Janice Howard who is a Conservative councillor for Wimbledon Park ward is currently the Mayor and Cllr Edward Foley, Merton Park Resident councillor from Merton Park ward is her deputy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.merton.gov.uk/council/mayor.htm | title=The Mayor of Merton | publisher=[[Merton London Borough Council]]}}</ref>

==Media==
A lot of filming for former [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] police drama ''[[The Bill]]'' took place in Merton, particularly in the districts of [[Mitcham]] and [[Colliers Wood]]. The set of [[Sun Hill (The Bill)|Sun Hill]] police station was also located in the Borough. Ray Austin, born at 9 Abbey Rd Merton on the 5 December 1932, is an English television and film director, television writer, novelist and former stunt performer and actor who worked in both the United Kingdom and the United States. He filmed episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' in and around Merton. He served as director on episodes of some 150 programs between 1968 and 2010.

The main local newspaper in Merton is the ''Wimbledon Times'' (recently changed name from Wimbledon Guardian). This newspaper was founded in 1977 by a former Conservative councillor on Merton Council, but since then the paper has been sold on and it is now widely published in different editions across South London. The newspaper is available free, though there is a charge if bought from a newsagent. It is published each Friday.

In March 2011, the main forms of transport that residents used to travel to work were: driving a car or van, 19.2% of all residents aged 16–74; underground, metro, light rail, tram, 13.0%; train, 13.0%; bus, minibus or coach, 7.5%; on foot, 5.0%; work mainly at or from home, 3.4%; bicycle, 2.4%.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Census: QS701EW Method of travel to work, local authorities in England and Wales|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-and-quick-statistics-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-qs701ew.xls|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=23 November 2013}} Percentages are of all residents aged 16–74 including those not in employment. Respondents could only pick one mode, specified as the journey’s longest part by distance.</ref>

==Demographics and social conditions==
In 2001, the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|census]] recorded that 25% of the population of the borough was from an [[ethnic minority]]. The highest ethnic populations were recorded in wards in the east of the borough in [[Mitcham]], [[Eastfields]] and [[Pollards Hill]]. The percentage of population from ethnic minorities is predicted to rise across the borough within the next decade.

A 2017 report by [https://www.trustforlondon.org.uk Trust for London] and the [https://www.npi.org.uk New Policy Institute] found that Merton has a poverty rate of 20%, which is the 7th lowest rate in London. It also found that the level of pay inequality in Merton is lower than in any other borough, except neighbouring Croydon.<ref name="auto1"/>

According to the council's comparative assessment of wards made in 2004, the most deprived wards within the borough were in the south and east where unemployment rates, educational attainment and the quality of health were worst. The most affluent wards were in the north and west of the borough.

Comparative crime rates appear to be unrelated to the deprivation ranking of wards. The wards containing [[Mitcham|Mitcham town centre]] and the [[St Helier, London|St Helier Estate]] are ranked highest for crime within Merton with the wards containing the commercial shopping centres of [[Colliers Wood]] and [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] also featuring high in the ranking.

The constituency area of [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] is an affluent area of [[London]] with a high proportion of city workers, while [[Mitcham and Morden]] is relatively deprived by comparison, which explains the geographical split of political representation of the borough at both national and local elections.

Merton currently operates a Police Cadet scheme under the Metropolitan Police Service.

===Wimbledon tennis tournament===
Each year [[The Championships, Wimbledon]], better known as simply Wimbledon, one of the four tennis [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments (along with the [[US Open (tennis)|US]], [[French Open (tennis)|French]] and [[Australian Open]]s) is held at the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] in Church Road [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. The event takes place over a fortnight at the end of June and beginning of July and is the largest annual sporting event to take place in the [[United Kingdom]] with over 200,000 visitors during the Wimbledon fortnight.

===Football===
The borough gained a football team in 1889 when [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon Old Centrals]] were founded, and were soon a member of the local football leagues.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.historicaldons.com/1889.htm | title=1889 to 1899 | work=Memories of The Dons | publisher=historicaldons.com | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206062036/http://www.historicaldons.com/1889.htm | archivedate=6 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club later adopted the title ''Wimbledon FC'' and moved into a new stadium at [[Plough Lane (1912–98)|Plough Lane]] in 1912, where it would spend the next 79 years. As the 20th century wore on, the club enjoyed considerable success in non-league football.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oldgrounds.co.uk/plough_lane_wibledon.htm | title=Plough Lane – Wimbledon | publisher=Old Football Grounds | website=[[Wayback Machine]]}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The club was elected to the [[Football League]] in 1977<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldons.com/1970.htm |title=1970 to 1979 |work=Memories of The Dons |publisher=historicaldons.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002745/http://historicaldons.com/1970.htm |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}</ref> and enjoyed a great run of success when began in 1983 with the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] title, and saw them reach the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1986 – a mere nine years after joining the Football League. They quickly established themselves in the highest division of English football, and as clear underdogs, pulled off a shock win in the [[1988 FA Cup Final]] against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Football in England|England's]] most successful and dominant club side in Europe during that era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm |title=1980 to 1989 |work=Memories of The Dons |publisher=historicaldons.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930110421/http://historicaldons.com/1980.htm |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}</ref> They were founder members of the [[FA Premier League]] in 1992<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9223993.stm | title=The second coming of Wimbledon | website=[[BBC Online|BBC Sport – Football]] | date=25 November 2010}}</ref> and survived at that level until 2000, before relocating to [[Milton Keynes]], some 70 miles away in [[Buckinghamshire]], in a controversial move in 2003, being rebranded as [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in 2004. The club had left its Plough Lane stadium in 1991 to ground-share with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]], with numerous plans to build a new stadium in a number of different locations (including back in London and even in [[Dublin]] or [[Cardiff]]) being considered over the following decade before the club's owners chose Milton Keynes as their destination.

However, a new Wimbledon club – [[AFC Wimbledon]] – was formed to represent the local area in 2002 by fans of the original club after the move to Milton Keynes was given the go-ahead. The new Wimbledon club's progress was rapid, and after just nine years in existence they won promotion to the Football League in 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13418508.stm | title=AFC Wimbledon 0-0 Luton Town (4-3 on pens) | website=[[BBC Online|BBC Sport – Football]] | date=21 May 2011}}</ref> The club currently plays at Kingsmeadow Stadium, the home of [[Kingstonian F.C.]], but in 2016 it gained permission to build a [[New Plough Lane|new stadium]] back on Plough Lane, using the former Greyhound Stadium around a hundred yards from its old stadium site and still within in the London Borough of Merton. In 2018 the final agreements were signed off and demolition work started on the site (for both stadium and 600 flats) in April 2018. Building is expected to be completed for the 2020–21 season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/article/summary-of-dtb-meeting-828310.aspx | title=New stadium update featured on the agenda}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/club/new-stadium/ | title=New stadium update}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=8 July 2019 |title=Home Sweet Home |url=https://www.afcwimbledon.co.uk/news/2019/july/home-sweet-home/ |publisher=[[AFC Wimbledon]] |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>

The borough also has five [[non-League football]] clubs: [[Colliers Wood United F.C.]] who play at Wibbandune Sports Ground; [[Raynes Park Vale F.C.]] who play at Prince George's Fields; [[Tooting & Mitcham United F.C.]] who play at Imperial Fields, Morden; and Merton Forest F.C who also play at Prince George's Fields and a Celebrity Fundraising Football team – [http://www.CelebFC.co.uk Celeb FC] who play all over the UK without charge for small UK charities.
