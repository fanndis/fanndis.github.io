== Early life and education ==
The son of a builder, Triguboff was born in [[Dalian]] (Darien at the time), [[Liaoning]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] on 3 March 1933, the son of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jews]] (Moshe and Frida) who fled to northeastern China after the rise of Lenin.<ref name=Ehrlich>{{cite book |author1=Encel, Sol |author2=Rutland, Suzanne D. |chapter=Australian Jewry |editor=Ehrlich, M.

He later graduated with a degree in [[textiles]] from the [[University of Leeds]] in England, before working in textile businesses in Israel and South Africa.<ref name="ftmeritonsharrytriguboffonbeing">{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Jamie|title=Meriton's Harry Triguboff on being Australia's second-richest man|url=https://www.ft.com/content/ea9f603c-33e9-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3|accessdate=20 August 2017|work=Financial Times|date=20 August 2017}}</ref>

He returned to Australia in 1950 and became an Australian [[citizenship|citizen]] in 1961. He did a variety of odd jobs, including running a taxi fleet and owning a milk round in [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]]. He tried selling real estate and worked as an assistant to a lecturer at university but wasn't so successful at either. He then bought some land in [[Roseville, New South Wales|Roseville]] and hired a builder to begin building his house. The builder repeatedly let him down, so Triguboff threw him out and finished the job himself, learning from his mistakes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2000/02/27/the-crikey-rich-list/ |title=How to say I or me 77 times in explaining how I became a billionare |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 May 1997 |publisher=reproduced at The Crikey Rich List, 27 February 2000}}</ref>

==Career==

===Meriton Apartment===

From the experience gained in his  initial development, Triguboff bought his second block of land in 1963, this time in Smith Street, [[Tempe, New South Wales|Tempe]], and began building a block of eight units with a partner.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Triguboff |first=Harry |interviewer=Tyron Hyde |title=Interview with Harry Triguboff |url=http://www.washingtonbrown.com.au/property-news/Meriton |type=Interview: edited transcript |work=Domain |publisher=reproduced at the Washington Brown Group |date=1 August 2006 |accessdate=23 February 2012 }}</ref> He made a profit, which led to a second development in 1968 in [[Gladesville, New South Wales|Gladesville]]. At Meriton Street, Triguboff built a block of 18 units which provided the name of the company he registered in developers.

Triguboff is the managing director of Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd. {{as of|2015}} Meriton had built more than 55,000 residential [[townhouse#Asia, Australia, and South Africa|townhouses]] and [[apartment#Australia|apartments]] since its creation in 1963,<ref name="Forbes-2015"/> making it Australia's biggest residential property developer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/politics/priest-david-cappo-calls-for-rethink-on-housing-the-homeless/story-e6frgczf-1225816764169 | first=Pia |last=Akerman |title=Priest David Cappo calls for rethink on housing the homeless |work=The Australian |date=7 January 2010}}</ref> In 2010, Meriton was said to develop an average of 1,000 apartments per year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/sydney-residential-projects-of-1bn-in-play/story-e6frg9gx-1225839326469 |first=Bridget |last=Carter |title=Sydney residential projects of bn in play |work=The Australian |date=11 March 2010}}</ref> {{as of|2015}}, the average exceeds 3,000 per annum.<ref name="Forbes-2015"/> In particular, Triguboff has concentrated on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] and Brisbane in [[Queensland]], and [[City of Sydney|Sydney's central business district]], building more apartments than any other Australian residential developer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/property/triguboffs-meriton-tops-hias-building-starts-table/story-fn9656lz-1226726760392 |title=Triguboff's Meriton tops HIA's building starts table/ |work=[[The Australian]] |date=25 September 2013 }}</ref> He is a proponent that the population of Australia should grow to reach 100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/triguboff-and-the-new-great-australian-dream-20101123-1868h.html | title=Triguboff and the new Great Australian Dream | date=24 November 2010 | newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald | agency=Bloomberg News | accessdate=11 June 2015 }}</ref>

In 2004, Meriton completed the construction of [[World Tower]], Sydney's tallest residential apartment building. During 2012, Meriton and the owners' corporation became embroiled in a long running court dispute over major building defects and alleged breaches of their contract, with maintenance issues worth more than A$1&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/1m-claim-for-defects-at-world-square-site-20130106-2cb67.html|title=$1m claim for defects at World Square site|author=Tan, Su-Lin|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=22 May 2013|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> Part of the issue related to Meriton, the original builder, being locked out of the development.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/meritons-war-of-world-tower-20130104-2c8xn.html | title=Meriton's war of World Tower | date=5 January 2013 | newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald | first=Su-Lin | last=Tan | accessdate=16 May 2015 }}</ref> By 2015, He had built approximately 55,000 residential townhouses and apartments.

Triguboff donates heavily to political parties and uses his influence to seek policy changes. In August 2010, he proposed that the federal government should insist on [[Reserve Bank of Australia|Reserve Bank]] interest rates being dropped to improve housing affordability.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/meritons-harry-triguboff-calls-for-new-poll-rate-cuts/story-e6frg6nf-1225910633856 |title=Meriton's Harry Triguboff calls for new poll, rate cuts |work=The Australian |author=Kitney, Damon |date=27 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011 }}</ref>
