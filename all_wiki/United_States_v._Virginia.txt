'''''United States v. Virginia''''', 518 U.S. 515 (1996), is a [[List of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark case]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down the long-standing [[Men's college|male-only admission policy]] of the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI) in a 7–1 decision. Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], whose son was enrolled at VMI at the time, [[Judicial disqualification|recused himself]].<ref name=strum />

== Majority decision ==
Writing for the majority, Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] stated that because [[Virginia Military Institute|VMI]] failed to show "exceedingly persuasive justification" for its sex-based [[University and college admissions|admissions]] policy, it violated the [[Equal Protection Clause|Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause]]. In an attempt to satisfy equal protection requirements, the state of [[Virginia]] had proposed a parallel program for [[women]], called the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), located at [[Mary Baldwin College]], a private [[liberal arts]] [[women's college]].<ref name=strum>{{cite book | title = Women in the Barracks: The Vmi Case and Equal Rights | author = Philippa Strum | publisher = University Press of Kansas | date = 2002 | isbn = 0-7006-1164-9 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/womeninbarracksv0000stru }}</ref>

However, Justice Ginsburg found that the VWIL would not provide women with the same type of rigorous [[military]] training, facilities, [[Course (education)|courses]], [[Teacher|faculty]], financial opportunities, and/or [[alumni]] reputation and connections that VMI affords male [[cadets]], a decision evocative of ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'', when the Court ruled in 1950 that segregated law schools in [[Texas]] were unconstitutional, since a newly formed black law school clearly did not provide the same benefits to its students as the state's prestigious and long-maintained white law school.<ref name=strum /> In her opinion, she stated that "The VWIL program is a pale shadow of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence."<ref name="supreme.justia.com"/>

=== Rehnquist concurrence ===
Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a concurrence agreeing to strike down the male-only admissions policy of the [[Virginia Military Institute]], as violative of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Equal Protection Clause]].<ref name="supreme.justia.com">{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/518/515/case.html|title=United States v. Virginia :: 518 U.S. 515 (1996) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law}}</ref> However, he declined to join the majority opinion's basis for using the Fourteenth Amendment, writing: "Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation."<ref name="supreme.justia.com"/> This rationale supported separate but equal facilities separated on the basis of sex: "it is not the 'exclusion of women' that violates the Equal Protection Clause, but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing any—much less a comparable—institution for women ... It would be a sufficient remedy, I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of education and were of the same overall caliber."<ref name="supreme.justia.com"/>

===Scalia dissent===
Justice [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia's]] lone dissent argued that the standard applied by the majority was closer to a [[strict scrutiny]] standard than the [[intermediate scrutiny]] standard applied to previous cases involving equal protection based on sex. Notably, however, the opinion for the Court eschewed either standard; its language did not comport with the "important governmental interest" formula used in prior intermediate scrutiny cases. Scalia argued that "if the question of the applicable standard of review for sex-based classifications were to be regarded as an appropriate subject for reconsideration, the stronger argument would be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it to rational-basis review."<ref name=strum />

Scalia made sure to provide Ginsburg with a copy of his dissent as quickly as he could, in order for her to better respond to it in her majority opinion.<ref name="nyt-senior">{{cite web |last1=Senior |first1=Jennifer |title=The Ginsburg-Scalia Act Was Not a Farce |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/opinion/ruth-bader-ginsburg-antonin-scalia.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=22 September 2020 |date=September 22, 2020}}</ref> Ginsburg later recalled that Scalia "absolutely ruined my weekend, but my opinion is ever so much better because of his stinging dissent".<ref name="wp-carmon">{{cite web |last1=Carmon |first1=Irin |title=What made the friendship between Scalia and Ginsburg work |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/02/13/what-made-scalia-and-ginsburgs-friendship-work/ |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 September 2020 |date=February 13, 2016}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
With the VMI decision, the high court effectively struck down any law which, as Justice Ginsburg wrote, "denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature &mdash; equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society."<ref name="supreme.justia.com"/>

Following the ruling, VMI contemplated going private to exempt itself from the 14th Amendment, and thus this ruling. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] warned the school that it would withdraw all [[ROTC]] programs from the school if this privatization took place. As a result of the DOD action, Congress amended {{usc|10|2111a}}, to prohibit the military from withdrawing or diminishing any ROTC program at one of the six [[senior military college]]s, including VMI.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2111a- | title = United States Code § 2111a. Support for senior military colleges | accessdate = 13 August 2011}}</ref>  However, VMI's Board of Visitors had already voted 9–8 to admit women and did not revisit the issue after the law was amended.<ref name=strum />

VMI was the last all-male public university in the United States.<ref name=strum /> ''United States v. Virginia'' is now a seminal case discussed in most Constitutional Law classes, which most students take during their first year of law school.{{cn|date=April 2020}}
