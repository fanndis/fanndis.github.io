"'''Sine from Above'''" is a song by American singer [[Lady Gaga]] and English singer [[Elton John]] from the former's sixth studio album, ''[[Chromatica]]'' (2020). It is included as the album's fourteenth track, and is preceded by a [[String section|string arrangement]], "Chromatica III", which leads right into the beginning of the song. It was produced  by [[BloodPop]], [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]], Liohn and Johannes Klahr, and had a wide array of songwriters involved. It is an [[electronica]]-influenced electropop song with a [[Drum and bass|drum n' bass]] breakdown, and lyrically it talks about the healing power of music. Several [[Music journalism|music critics]] found "Sine from Above" a standout track from the album and appreciated its experimental nature, while some others were critical of the breakdown of the song.

== Background  ==
"Sine from Above" marks the second studio based collaboration between Gaga and John, following their duet "Hello, Hello", which appeared in the 2011 animated film ''[[Gnomeo & Juliet]]''.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9391544/lady-gaga-elton-john-friendship-timeline |title=A Timeline of Lady Gaga & Elton John's Decade-Long Friendship |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |last=Mamo |first=Heran |date=May 27, 2020 |accessdate=June 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200605150150/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9391544/lady-gaga-elton-john-friendship-timeline |archive-date=June 5, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The duo also performed together on numerous occasions, including the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], where they performed a [[List of musical medleys|medley]] of Gaga's "[[Speechless (Lady Gaga song)|Speechless]]" and John's "[[Your Song]]", and the ''[[Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular]]'' television special, where they performed "[[Bennie and the Jets]]" and "[[Artpop (song)|Artpop]]".<ref name="billboard1"/> Gaga later professionally recorded John's "Your Song" for the 2018 tribute album ''[[Revamp & Restoration#Revamp|Revamp: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hear Lady Gaga's Powerful Take on Elton John's 'Your Song' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-lady-gagas-powerful-take-on-elton-johns-your-song-629549/ |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |date=March 30, 2018 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |language=en-US|access-date=May 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617201349/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hear-lady-gagas-powerful-take-on-elton-johns-your-song-629549/|archive-date=June 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Gaga and John developed a long-time friendship, and Gaga referred to him as her "mentor for a long time".<ref name="billboard1"/> In an interview with [[Beats 1]]'s [[Zane Lowe]], Gaga talked about her work with John on "Sine from Above", and explained how he played a significant role in her road to recovery:
{{blockquote|Elton's always really challenged me to take care of my artistry and to really take care of myself. And I really, really honour that about him. He is so, so uniquely special.

== Recording and composition ==
[[File:Lady Gaga and Elton John in 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|Co-producer [[Axwell]] came up with the idea of creating the song as a duet between Lady Gaga and Elton John (both ''pictured'').]]
Producer [[Axwell]] talked about how the song came about in an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', stating: "I had this old song we worked on, like, seven years ago with Elton John. We tried working on it and we couldn't really get it where we wanted it. It was also kind of hard to get ahold of Elton John. I had this on my computer and was like, 'Wait a minute. Lady Gaga and Elton John are buddies.'" Axwell then sent the demo to Gaga and co-producer [[BloodPop]] who loved the track and decided to record it for Gaga's ''[[Chromatica]]'' album as a collaboration with John.<ref name="NME" /> He later added that the song was initially "a more chilled out, piano, acoustic thing. You can still hear that in the verses, and [the final version has] the same chord progression."<ref name= "EWproduction">{{Cite web |title=Lady Gaga's 'Chromatica' team reveals the history and future of her new era |url=https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|access-date=June 12, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=EN |first=Joey |last=Nolfi|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200613100924/https://ew.com/music/lady-gaga-chromatica-behind-the-scenes/|archive-date=June 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Talking about the recording of the song, co-producer [[Burns (musician)|Burns]] also explained that Elton was on tour in Australia when they were in the process of finishing the song. As they had a close deadline to finish everything, the recording sessions took place via Skype, with Elton in a studio in Australia and the rest of them in Los Angeles.<ref name= "EWproduction"/>

"Sine from Above" is one of the three songs on the ''Chromatica'' album which are preceded by an orchestral interlude, transitioning directly into the track, as Gaga wanted to emphasize the "cinematic" feeling of the record and felt that it had distinct acts.<ref name= "EWproduction"/> The preceding interlude, "Chromatica III" was composed by musician [[Morgan Kibby]], who assembled a 26-person orchestra to record the [[String section|string arrangement]].<ref name= "EWproduction"/> Talking about the creating process, Kibby said:
{{blockquote|"Chromatica III" started out as an arrangement under "Sine From Above". When we soloed the strings, BloodPop had the instinct that it should live as a distinct moment, so it became our foundation for "Chromatica III". After we parsed out part of the arrangement we all loved, he and Gaga, I believe, added the sounds of rain. The key piece of "III" for the strings was definitely the long note that sweeps and swells to honor the concept of a sine wave, and I think the additional production serves to highlight that idea.<ref name= "EWproduction"/>}}

While reviewing the album, Patrick Gomez of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called the piece an "unexpected highlight", and compared it to a [[Hans Zimmer]] score.<ref name="avc"/> "Chromatica III" was later featured in the music video for the song "[[911 (Lady Gaga song)|911]]", playing in the background in a scene which shows Gaga crying after being involved in a car accident.<ref name="Mier">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-drops-very-personal-911-short-film/|last=Mier|first=Tomás|date=September 18, 2020|title=Lady Gaga Drops 'Very Personal' '911' Video About Her Mental Health: 'It's the Poetry of Pain'|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=September 19, 2020|archive-url=http://archive.today/2020.09.19-143028/https://people.com/music/lady-gaga-dark-place-depression-making-chromatica/|archive-date=September 19, 2020}}</ref>
