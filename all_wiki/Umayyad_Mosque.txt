The '''Umayyad Mosque''' ({{lang-ar|الجامع الأموي}}), also known as the '''Great Mosque of Damascus''' ({{lang-ar|جامع بني أمية الكبير|Jāmiʻ Banī Umayyah al-Kabīr}}), located in the old city of [[Damascus]], is one of the largest and oldest [[mosque]]s in the world. The mosque is also important in Islam because of its historical and eschatological reports and events associated with the mosque.

After the [[Siege of Damascus (634)|Muslim conquest of Damascus]] in 634, the mosque was built on the site of a Christian basilica dedicated to [[John the Baptist#Islam|John the Baptist]], honored as a [[prophet]] by Christians and Muslims. A legend dating to the sixth century holds that the building contains the head of John the Baptist.<ref name="Burns, 2005, p. 88">Burns, 2005, p .88.</ref> Two shrines commemorating [[Husayn ibn Ali]] ({{lang-ar|مقام الحسين}}), whose martyrdom is frequently compared to that of John the Baptist<ref name=thesis>{{Cite journal|first1=Daniella|last1=Talmon-Heller|first2=Benjamin|last2=Kedar|first3=Yitzhak|last3=Reiter|date=Jan 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200512010853/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniella_Talmon-Heller/publication/301537484_Vicissitudes_of_a_Holy_Place_Construction_Destruction_and_Commemoration_of_Mashhad_Husayn_in_Ascalon/links/5cddc4d492851c4eaba685d8/Vicissitudes-of-a-Holy-Place-Construction-Destruction-and-Commemoration-of-Mashhad-Husayn-in-Ascalon.pdf|archive-date=12 May 2020|title=Vicissitudes of a Holy Place: Construction, Destruction and Commemoration of Mashhad Ḥusayn in Ascalon|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301537484|journal=Der Islam|volume=93|doi=10.1515/islam-2016-0008|pages=11-13,28-34}}</ref> and [[Jesus Christ]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Prophet Eesa (Jesus) |url=https://www.thedawoodibohras.com/2017/08/10/the-prophet-eesa-jesus-2/|date=10 Aug 2018 |website=thedawoodibohras.com |archive-date=19 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719185006/https://www.thedawoodibohras.com/2017/08/10/the-prophet-eesa-jesus-2/}}</ref> exist within the building premises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2014/03/husseins-head-and-importance-of-cultural-heritage/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200517142125/https://www.asor.org/anetoday/2014/03/husseins-head-and-importance-of-cultural-heritage/|archive-date=17 May 2020|title=Hussein's Head and Importance of Cultural Heritage|work=American School of Oriental Research|author=Michael Press|date=March 2014|access-date=17 May 2020}}</ref> The mosque is also believed by Muslims to be the place where [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] will return at the [[End time|End of Days]].

==History==

===Pre-Islamic period===
{{main|Temple of Jupiter, Damascus}}
The site is attested for as a place of worship since the [[Iron Age]]. [[Damascus]] was the capital of the [[Arameans|Aramaean]] state [[Aram-Damascus]] and a large temple dedicated to the cult of [[Hadad|Hadad-Ramman]], the god of thunderstorms and rain, was erected at the site of the present-day Umayyad Mosque. One stone remains from the Aramaean temple, dated to the rule of [[Hazael|King Hazael]], and is currently on display in the [[National Museum of Damascus]].<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 16.</ref>

The Temple of Hadad-Ramman continued to serve a central role in the city, and when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered Damascus in 64 BCE, they assimilated Hadad with their own god of thunder, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].<ref name="Burns40">Burns, 2005, p. 40.</ref> Thus, they engaged in a project to reconfigure and expand the temple under the direction of Damascus-born architect [[Apollodorus of Damascus|Apollodorus]], who created and executed the new design.<ref>Calcani and Abdulkarim, 2003, p. 28.</ref>

This new [[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus]] became the center of the [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|Imperial cult of Jupiter]] and was served as a response to the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 65.</ref> The Temple of Jupiter would attain further additions during the early period of Roman rule of the city, mostly initiated by high priests who collected contributions from the wealthy citizens of Damascus.<ref name="Burns62">Burns, 2005, p. 62.</ref> The eastern gateway of the courtyard was expanded during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]] (r. 193–211 CE).<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 72.</ref> By the fourth century CE, the temple was especially renowned for its size and beauty. It was separated from the city by two sets of walls. The first, wider wall spanned a wide area that included a market, and the second wall surrounded the actual sanctuary of Jupiter. It was the largest temple in [[Roman Syria]].<ref>Bowersock and Brown, 2001, pp. 47-48.</ref>

Towards the end of the 4th century, in 391, the Temple of Jupiter was converted into a [[cathedral]] by the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–395). During its transformation into a Christian cathedral, it was not immediately dedicated to John the Baptist; this was a later association, which came about in the sixth century. Legend had it that Saint John's head was buried there.<ref name="Burns, 2005, p. 88"/> It served as the seat of the Bishop of Damascus, who ranked second within the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]] after the patriarch himself.<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 72.</ref>

===Establishment and Construction===
[[File:Umayyad Mosque night.jpg|thumb|left|The Umayyad Mosque at night]]
Damascus was [[Siege of Damascus (634)|captured]] by [[Rashidun army|Muslim Arab forces]] led by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] in 634. In 661, the [[Islamic Caliphate]] came under the rule of the [[Umayyad dynasty]], which chose Damascus to be the administrative capital of the [[Muslim world]]. The sixth Umayyad [[caliph]], [[al-Walid I]] (r. 705–715), commissioned the construction of a mosque on the site of the [[Byzantine]] cathedral in 706.<ref>Grafman and Rosen-Ayalon, 1999, p. 7.</ref> Prior to this, the cathedral was still in use by the local Christians, but a prayer room (''musalla'') for [[Muslim]]s had been constructed on the southeastern part of the building. Al-Walid, who personally supervised the project, had most of the cathedral, including the ''musalla'', demolished. The construction of the mosque completely altered the layout of the building. While the church (and the temples before it) had the main building located at the centre of the rectangular enclosure, the mosque's prayer hall is placed against its south wall. The architect recycled the columns and arcades of the church, dismantling and repositioning them in the new structure. The new house of worship was meant to serve as a large [[congregational mosque]] for the citizens of Damascus and as a tribute to the city. In response to Christian protest at the move, al-Walid ordered all the other confiscated churches in the city to be returned to the Christians as compensation. The mosque was completed in 715, shortly after al-Walid's death, by his successor, [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 715–717).<ref name="Flood2"/><ref>Rudolff, 2006, p. 177.</ref><ref name="Kamiya">{{cite web |title=Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria |author=Takeo Kamiya |work=Eurasia News|date=2004 |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/arc/ind/2_meisaku/32_damascus/dam_eng.htm |access-date=31 December 2015}}</ref>

According to 10th-century [[Persia]]n historian [[Ibn al-Faqih]], somewhere between 600,000 and 1,000,000 [[Gold Dinar|dinar]]s were spent on the project. [[Copts|Coptic]] craftsmen as well as Persian, [[India]]n, [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] laborers provided the bulk of the labor force which consisted of 12,000 people.<ref name="Flood2">Flood, 2001, p. 2.</ref><ref>Wolff, 2007, p. 57.</ref> Byzantine artisans were employed to create the mosaics, still visible, which depict landscapes and buildings in a characteristic late Roman style.<ref>Rosenwein, Barbara H.

[[File:Dome of the Clocks, Umayyad Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|The Dome of the Clock was built in 780]]

===Abbasid and Fatimid era===
Following the [[Abbasid Revolution|uprising that ended Umayyad rule]] in 750, the [[Abbasid dynasty]] came to power and moved the capital of the Caliphate to [[Baghdad]]. Apart from the attention given for strategic and commercial purposes, the Abbasids had no interest in Damascus. Thus, the Umayyad Mosque reportedly suffered under their rule, with little recorded building activity between the 8th and 10th centuries.<ref name="Flood124-6"/> However, the Abbasids did consider the mosque to be a major symbol of [[Islam]]'s triumph, and thus it was spared the systematic eradication of the Umayyad legacy in the city.<ref name="Burns131-2"/> The Abbasid governor of Damascus, [[Al-Fadl ibn Salih|al-Fadl ibn Salih ibn Ali]], built the so-called Dome of the Clock{{dubious|Was there any time-measuring device there in 780? Or is it a much later name? See clock of Muhammad al-Sa'ati (12th century!) at Clocks Tower. So 400 years later. The almost contemporary water clock sent by Harun to Charlemagne was not a large tower-appropriate clock either.|date=December 2015}} in the eastern section of the mosque in 780.<ref>Rudolff, 2006, p.178.</ref> Nine years later, he initiated the construction of the [[Qubbat al-Khazna|Dome of the Treasury]] with the purpose of housing the mosque's funds.<ref name="Burns131-2">Burns, 2005, pp.131–132.</ref> The 9th-century [[Arab]] geographer, [[al-Muqaddasi]], credited the Abbasids for building the northern [[minaret]] (''Madhanat al-'Arous''; "Minaret of the Bride") of the mosque in 831 during the reign of the caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] (r. 813–833).<ref name="Flood124-6"/><ref name="Burns131-2"/> This was accompanied by al-Ma'mun's removal and replacement of Umayyad inscriptions in the mosque.<ref name="Flood124-6">Flood, 2001, pp.124–126.

[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Dome of the Treasury211099.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Qubbat al-Khazna|Dome of the Treasury]] was built in 789]]

By the early 10th century, a monumental [[clock]]{{dubious|Same as above at "Clocks Tower: very early! Maybe a sundial? Describe, indicate a good source.|date=December 2015}} had been installed by the entrance in the western part of the southern wall of the mosque (''Bāb al-Ziyāda''.) This clock seems to have stopped functioning by the middle of the 12th century.<ref>Flood, 2001, p. 121.</ref> Abbasid rule over [[al-Sham|Syria]] began crumbling during the early 10th century, and in the decades that followed, it came under the control of autonomous realms who were only nominally under Abbasid authority. The [[Fatimids]] of [[Egypt]], who adhered to [[Shia Islam]], conquered Damascus in 970, but few recorded improvements of the mosque were undertaken by the new rulers. The Umayyad Mosque's prestige allowed the residents of Damascus to establish the city as a center for [[Sunni]] intellectualism, enabling them to maintain relative independence from Fatimid religious authority.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 139.</ref> In 1069, large sections of the mosque, particularly the northern wall, were destroyed in a fire as a result of an uprising by the city's residents against the Fatimid's [[Berber people|Berber]] army who were garrisoned there.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 140.</ref>

===Seljuk and Ayyubid era===
The Sunni Muslim [[Seljuk Turks]] gained control of the city in 1078 and restored the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Seljuk king [[Tutush]] (r. 1079–1095) initiated the repair of damage caused by the 1069 fire.<ref name="Burns142"/> In 1082, his vizier, [[Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn Fadl]], had the central [[dome]] restored in a more spectacular form;<ref>Flood, 1997, p. 73.</ref> the two piers supporting it were reinforced and the original Umayyad mosaics of the northern inner [[façade]] were renewed. The northern ''[[Riwaq (arcade)|riwaq]]'' ("portico") was rebuilt in 1089.<ref name="Burns142">Burns, 2005, pp. 141–142.</ref> The Seljuk [[atabeg]] of Damascus, [[Toghtekin]] (r. 1104–1128), repaired the northern wall in 1110 and two inscribed panels located above its doorways were dedicated to him.<ref>Burns, 2005, pp. 148–149</ref> In 1113, the Seljuk atabeg of [[Mosul]], [[Mawdud|Sharaf al-Din Mawdud]] (r. 1109–1113), was assassinated in the Umayyad Mosque.<ref>Burns, 2005, p.147.</ref> As the conflict between Damascus and the [[Crusader states|Crusaders]] intensified in the mid-12th century, the mosque was used as a principal rallying point calling on Muslims to defend the city and return [[Jerusalem]] to Muslim hands. Prominent [[imam]]s, including [[Ibn 'Asakir]], preached a spiritual struggle ''[[jihad]]'' (" in Arabic the word means  struggle/Strive") and when the Crusaders advanced towards Damascus in 1148, the city's residents heeded their calls; the Crusader army withdrew as a result of their resistance.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 157.</ref>

During the reign of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], which began in 1154, a second monumental clock, the [[Jayrun Water Clock]], was built on his personal orders.<ref>Flood, 2001, p. 114.</ref> It was constructed outside the eastern entrance to the mosque (''Bab Jayrun'') by architect Muhammad al-Sa'āti, was rebuilt by al-Sa'ati following a fire in 1167 and was eventually repaired by his son, Ridwan, in the early 13th century. It may have survived into the 14th century.<ref>Flood, 2001, pp. 117–118.</ref> The Arab geographer [[al-Idrisi]] visited the mosque in 1154.<ref name="Burns131-2"/>

Damascus witnessed the establishment of several religious institutions under the Ayyubids, but the Umayyad Mosque retained its place as the center of religious life in the city. Muslim traveler [[Ibn Jubayr]] described the mosque as containing many different ''[[zawiya (institution)|zawaya]]'' for religious and Quranic studies. In 1173, the northern wall of the mosque was damaged again by fire and was rebuilt by the Ayyubid sultan, [[Saladin]] (r. 1174–1193), along with the Minaret of the Bride,<ref>Burns, 2005, pp. 176–177</ref> which had been destroyed in the 1069 fire.<ref name="Burns131-2"/> During the internal feuds between later Ayyubid princes, the city was dealt a great deal of damage, and the mosque's eastern minaret—known as the "Minaret of Jesus"—was destroyed at the hands of [[as-Salih Ayyub]] while besieging [[As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus|as-Salih Ismail]] in 1245.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 187</ref> The minaret was later rebuilt with little decoration.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 189</ref> Saladin, along with many of his successors, were buried around the Umayyad Mosque.<ref>Burns, 2005, p. 190</ref>

===Mamluk rule===
[[File:Minaret of Qayt Bey, Umayyad Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Minaret of Qaitbay was constructed in 1488 on the orders of [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Qaitbay]] ]]

The Mongols, under the leadership of [[Kitbuqa]], in alliance with Crusader forces, captured Damascus from the Ayyubids in 1260. [[Bohemond VI of Antioch]], a leading general in the invasion, ordered [[Mass (liturgy)|Catholic Mass]] to be performed in the Umayyad Mosque.<ref>Zaimeche, 2005, p. 22.</ref> However, the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], led by [[Qutuz]] and [[Baibars]], wrested control of the city later in the same year. In 1270, Baibars, by now the Mamluk sultan, ordered extensive restorations to the mosque, particularly its marble, mosaics and gildings. According to Baibars' biographer, [[Ibn Shaddad]], the restorations cost the sultan a sum of 20,000 dinars. Among the largest mosaic fragments restored was a {{convert|34.5|by|7.3|m}} segment in the western portico called the "Barada panel".<ref name=Walker36-37>Walker, 2004, p. 36-37.</ref> The mosaics that decorated the mosque were a specific target of the restoration project and they had a major influence on [[Mamluk architecture]] in Syria and Egypt.<ref name="Flood67">Flood, 1997, p. 67.</ref>

In 1285, the Muslim scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]] started teaching Qur'an [[exegesis]] in the mosque. When the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khan Mongols]] under [[Ghazan]] invaded the city in 1300, Ibn Taymiyya preached ''jihad'', urging the citizens of Damascus to resist their occupation. The Mamluks under [[Qalawun]] drove out the Mongols later that year.<ref>Zaimeche, 2005, p. 17.</ref> When Qalawun's forces entered the city, the Mongols attempted to station several catapults in the Umayyad Mosque because the Mamluks had started fires around the [[Citadel of Damascus|citadel]] to prevent Mongol access to it. The attempt failed as the Mamluks proceeded to burn the catapults before they were placed in the mosque.<ref>Winter and Levanoni, 2004, p. 33.</ref>

The Mamluk Viceroy of Syria, [[Tankiz]], carried out restoration work in the mosque in 1326–28. He reassembled the mosaics on the ''[[qibla]]'' wall and replaced all the marble tiles in the prayer hall. Mamluk sultan [[al-Nasir Muhammad]] also undertook major restoration work for the mosque in 1328. He demolished and completely rebuilt the unstable ''qibla'' wall and moved the Bab al-Ziyadah gate to the east.<ref name=Walker36-37/> Much of that work was damaged during a fire that burned the mosque in 1339.<ref name="Flood67"/> [[Islamic art]] expert, Finbarr B. Flood, describes the [[Bahri Mamluks]]' attitude towards the mosque as an "obsessive interest" and their efforts at maintaining, repairing and restoring the mosque were unparalleled in any other period of Muslim rule.<ref>Flood, 1997, p. 72.</ref> Arab astronomer [[Ibn al-Shatir]] worked as the chief ''[[muwaqqit]]'' ("religious [[timekeeper]]") and the chief ''[[muezzin]]'' at the Umayyad Mosque from 1332 until his death in 1376.<ref>Charette, 2003, p. 16.</ref> He erected a large [[sundial]] on the mosque's northern minaret in 1371, now lost, more recently a replica was installed in its place.<ref name="MadainShatir">{{cite web |title=ibn Shatir's Sundial at Umayyad Mosque |url=https://madainproject.com/ibn_shatir_sundial |website=Madain Project |access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref><ref>Selin, 1997, p. 413.</ref> The Minaret of Jesus was burnt down in a fire in 1392.<ref>Brinner, 1963, p. 155.</ref>

[[Timur]] [[Siege of Damascus (1400)|besieged Damascus]] in 1400. He ordered the burning of the city on March 17, 1401, and the fire ravaged the Umayyad Mosque. The eastern minaret was reduced to rubble, and the central dome collapsed.<ref>Ibn Khaldun; Fischel, 1952, p. 97.</ref> A southwestern minaret was added to the mosque in 1488 during the reign of Mamluk sultan [[Qaitbay]].<ref>Ring, Salkin, La Boda, p. 208.</ref>

The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s under [[Selim I]] [[Battle of Marj Dabiq|conquered]] Damascus from the Mamluks in 1516. The first [[Friday prayer]] performed in Selim's name in the Umayyad Mosque was attended by the sultan himself.<ref>Van Leeuwen, p. 95.</ref><ref>Finkel, p. 109.</ref> The Ottomans used an endowment system (''[[waqf]]'') for religious sites as a means to link the local population with the central authority. The ''waqf'' of the Umayyad Mosque was the largest in the city, employing 596 people. Supervisory and clerical positions were reserved for Ottoman officials while religious offices were held mostly by members of the local '''[[ulema]]''.<ref>Kafescioǧlu, 1999, p. 78.</ref> Although the ''awqaf'' (plural form of "''waqf''") were taxed, the ''waqf'' of the Umayyad Mosque was not.<ref>Van Leeuwen, p. 112.</ref> In 1518, the Ottoman governor of Damascus and supervisor of the mosque's ''waqf'', [[Janbirdi al-Ghazali]], had the mosque repaired and redecorated as part of his architectural reconstruction program for the city.<ref>Van Leeuwen, p. 141.</ref>

Prominent [[Sufi]] scholar [[Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi]] taught regularly at the Umayyad Mosque starting in 1661.<ref>Dumper and Stanley, p. 123.</ref>

The mosque's extensive mosaics and its marble panelling were once again ravaged by fire in 1893, and had to be restored.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703571704575340833854939358 |title=A Glittering Crossroads |author=Christian C.

A laborer engaging in repair work accidentally started the fire when he was smoking his ''[[nargila]]'' (water pipe). The Ottomans fully restored the mosque, but largely maintained the original structure.<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 90.</ref>

Until 1899 the mosque's library included the "very old" [[Qubbat al-Khazna]] collection;<ref>{{Citation |publisher = Garland Pub. |isbn = 0824057872 |ol = 1397830M |location = New York |chapter =Islamic Libraries to 1920 |author=M.

It is the burial place of first three martyrs of the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons, who were Navy Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Bahriye Yüzbaşısı) Fethi Bey and his navigator, Artillery First Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Topçu Mülazım-ı Ula) Sadık Bey and The second team's member Artillery Second Lieutenant (Ottoman Turkish: Topçu Mülazım-ı Saniye) Nuri Bey. These officers were on a mission of the Istanbul-Cairo expedition of 1914.

===Modern era===

The Umayyad Mosque underwent major restorations in 1929 during the [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]] over Syria and in 1954 and 1963 under the [[Syrian Republic (1946–63)|Syrian Republic]].<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 91.</ref>

In the 1980s and in the early 1990s, [[President of Syria|Syrian president]] [[Hafez al-Assad]] ordered a wide-scale renovation of the mosque.<ref>Cooke, p. 12.</ref> The methods and concepts of al-Assad's restoration project were heavily criticized by [[UNESCO]],{{clarify|some detail on what these questionable methods were is needed|date=September 2012}} but the general approach in Syria was that the mosque was more of a symbolic monument rather than a historical one and thus, its renovation could only enhance the mosque's symbolism.<ref>Rudolff, 2006, p. 194.</ref>

In 2001 Pope [[John Paul II]] visited the mosque, primarily to visit the relics of John the Baptist. It was the first time a pope paid a visit to a mosque.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1315190.stm | work=BBC News | title=Inside the Umayyad mosque | date=2001-05-06 |first = Barbara|last = Platt}}</ref>

On March 15, 2011, the first significant protests related to the [[Syrian civil war]] began at the Umayyad Mosque when 40–50 worshipers gathered outside the complex and chanted pro-democracy slogans. Syrian security forces swiftly quelled the protests and have since cordoned off the area during [[Friday prayers]] to prevent large-scale demonstrations.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113151834383782.html Protesters stage rare demo in Syria].

==Architecture==

===Courtyard and sanctuary===
[[File:Damascus, Umayyad Mosque (6368698875).jpg|thumb|Umayyad Mosque's Courtyard at night, view towards north-west with the Minaret of the Bride to the right.]]
[[File:Flickr - jemasmith - Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, Detail..jpg|thumb|Stone relief with [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]] of tendrils, [[palmette]]s and half-palmettes in the Umayyad Mosque]]
The ground plan of the Umayyad Mosque is rectangular in shape and measures {{convert|97|m|ft|sp=us}} by {{convert|156|m|ft|sp=us}}. A large [[sahn|courtyard]] occupies the northern part of the mosque complex, while the ''[[haram]]'' ("sanctuary") covers the southern part. The courtyard is enclosed by four exterior walls. The level of the stone pavement had become uneven over time due to several repairs throughout the mosque's history, but recent work on the courtyard has restored it to its consistent Umayyad-era levels. [[Arcade (architecture)|Arcade]]s (''[[Riwaq (arcade)|riwaq]]'') surround the courtyard supported by alternating stone columns and piers. There is one pier in between every two columns. Because the northern part of the courtyard had been destroyed in [[Near East earthquakes of 1759|an earthquake in 1759]], the arcade is not consistent; when the northern wall was rebuilt the columns that were supporting it were not.<ref name="Archnet">[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7161 Umayyad Mosque Profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120062239/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7161 |date=2010-11-20 }}. Archnet Digital Library.</ref>

Three arcades make up the interior space of the sanctuary. They are parallel to the direction of prayer which is towards [[Mecca]] in modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]]. The arcades are supported by two rows of stone [[Corinthian order|Corinthian column]]s. Each of the arcades contain two levels. The first level consists of large semi-circular [[arch]]es, while the second level is made up of double arches. This pattern is the same repeated by the arcades of the courtyard. The three interior arcades intersect in the center of the sanctuary with a larger, higher arcade that is perpendicular to the ''[[qibla]]'' ("direction of prayer") wall and faces the ''[[mihrab]]'' ([[Niche (architecture)|niche]] in the wall which indicates the ''qibla'') and the ''[[minbar]]'' ("[[pulpit]]").<ref name="Archnet"/> The central transept divides the arcades into two halves each with eleven arches. The entire sanctuary measures {{convert|136|m|ft|sp=us}} by {{convert|37|m|ft|sp=us}} and takes up the southern half of the mosque complex.<ref name="Grafman8">Grafman and Ayalon, 1999, p. 8.</ref>

Four ''mihrabs'' line the sanctuary's rear wall, the main one being the Great Mihrab which is located roughly at the center of the wall. The Mihrab of the Companions of the Prophet (named after the ''[[Sahaba]]'') is situated in the eastern half. According to ancient Muslim engineer [[Musa ibn Shakir]], the latter ''mihrab'' was built during the mosque's initial construction and it became the third niche-formed ''mihrab'' in Islam's history.<ref name="Grafman8"/>

===Domes===
There are three known domes inside the Umayyad Mosque complex.<ref name="madaindomes">{{cite web |title=Domes of the Umayyad Mosque |url=https://madainproject.com/domes_(umayyad_mosque) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426122807/https://madainproject.com/domes_(umayyad_mosque) |archive-date=26 April 2020 |website=Madain Project |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> The largest dome of the mosque is known as the "Dome of the Eagle" (''Qubbat an-Nisr'') and located atop the center of the prayer hall.<ref name="madaineagle">{{cite web |title=Dome of the Eagle (''Qubbat ul-Nisr'') |url=https://madainproject.com/dome_of_the_eagle_(umayyad_mosque) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426123020/https://madainproject.com/dome_of_the_eagle_(umayyad_mosque) |archive-date=26 April 2020 |website=Madain Project |access-date=26 April 2020}}</ref> The original wooden dome was replaced by one built of stone following the 1893 fire. It receives its name because it is thought to resemble an eagle, with the dome itself being the eagle's head while the eastern and western flanks of the prayer hall represent the wings.<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 94.</ref> With a height of {{convert|36|m|ft|sp=us}}, the dome rests on an octagonal substructure with two arched windows on each of its sides. It is supported by the central interior arcade and has openings along its parameter.<ref name="Archnet"/>

===Minarets===

Within the Umayyad Mosque complex are three [[minaret]]s. The Minaret of Jesus (''Madhanat Isa'') on south-east corner, second on the south-western corner is the "Minaret of Qaitbay" (''Madhanat al-Gharbiyya'') and the third, the Minaret of the Bride (''Madhanat al-Arus''), is located along the northern wall.

==== Minaret of the Bride ====
[[File:Minaret of the Bride, Umayyad Mosque 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Minaret of the Bride was the first minaret built for the mosque]]
The Minaret of the Bride (''Madhanat al-Arus'') was the first one built and is located on the mosque's northern wall. The exact year of the minaret's original construction is unknown.<ref name="Burns131-2"/> The bottom part of the minaret most likely dates back to the Abbasid era in the 9th century.<ref name="Burns131-2"/><ref>Darke, 2010, p. 92.</ref> While it is possible that the Umayyads built it, there is no indication that a minaret on the northern wall was a part of Caliph [[Al-Walid I|al-Walid]]'s initial concept. Geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] visited the minaret in 985 when Damascus was under Abbasid control and described it as "recently built." The upper segment was constructed in 1174.<ref name="Burns131-2"/> This minaret is used by the ''[[muezzin]]'' for the call to prayer (''[[adhan]]'') and there is a spiral staircase of 160 stone steps that lead to the ''muezzin'''s calling position.<ref name="AAA">American architect and architecture, 1894, p. 58.</ref>

The Minaret of the Bride is divided into two sections; the main tower and the spire which are separated by a [[lead]] roof. The oldest part of the minaret, or the main tower, is square in shape, has four galleries,<ref name="AAA"/> and consists of two different forms of [[masonry]]; the base consists of large blocks, while the upper section is built of dressed stone. There are two light openings near the top of the main tower, before the roof, with horseshoe arches and cubical capitals enclosed in a single arch. A smaller arched corbel is located below these openings.<ref>Rivoira, 1918, p. 92.</ref> According to local legend, the minaret is named after the daughter of the merchant who provided the lead for the minaret's roof who was married to Syria's ruler at the time. Attached to the Minaret of the Bride is the 18th-century replica of the 14th-century sundial built by [[Ibn al-Shatir]].<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 92.</ref>

==== Minaret of Isa ====
[[File:Minaret of Jesus, Omayyad Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Minaret of Jesus ('Isa) is the mosque's tallest minaret]]
The Minaret of Jesus ([[Arabic]]: <big>مئذنة عيسى</big>, ''Mi'dhanah ′Isa''), located on the southeast corner of the mosque complex, is around {{convert|77|m|ft|sp=us}} in height and the tallest of the three minarets.<ref>[[Palestine Exploration Fund]], p. 292.</ref><ref name="Mannheim91"/> Some sources claim it was originally built by the Abbasids in the 9th century,<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 92.</ref> while other sources attribute the original structure to the Umayyads. The main body of the current minaret was built by the Ayyubids in 1247, but the upper section was constructed by the Ottomans.<ref name="Mannheim91"/> The main body of the minaret is square-shaped and the [[spire]] is octagonal. It tapers to a point and is surmounted by a crescent (as are the other two minarets.) Two covered galleries are situated in the main body and two open galleries are located on the spire.<ref name="AAA"/> Islamic belief holds that [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] will descend from heaven before the [[Day of Judgement]] to confront the [[Antichrist]]. According to local Damascene tradition, relating from [[Hadith]] of [[Muhammad]] about the ''Qiyamah'',<ref name="MadainMinaretJesus">{{cite web |title=Minaret of Isa |url=https://madainproject.com/minaret_of_isa_(umayyad_mosque) |website=Madain Project |access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref> he will reach earth via the Minaret of Jesus, hence its name.<ref name="Mannheim91"/> [[Ibn Kathir]], a prominent 14th-century Muslim scholar, backed this notion.<ref>Kamal al-Din, 2002, p. 102.</ref>

==== Minaret of Qaitbay ====

The Western Minaret ([[Arabic]]: <big>مئذنة الغربيّة</big>, ''Mi'dhanatu 'l-Gharbiyyah'') is also known as the "Minaret of Qaitbay" as it was built by Mamluk sultan Qaitbay in 1488.<ref>Darke, 2010, p. 92.</ref> The Western Minaret displays strong Islamic-era Egyptian architectural influence typical of the Mamluk period.<ref name="Mannheim91">Mannheim, 2001, p. 91.</ref> The minaret is octagonal in shape and is built in receding sections with three galleries.<ref name="AAA"/> It is generally believed that both the Minaret of Jesus and the Western Minaret were built on the foundation of [[Ancient Roman]] towers (''temenos''), but some scholars{{who|date=September 2012}} find this to be questionable because of the absence of corner towers in other former Roman temples.<ref name="Mannheim91"/>

===Influence on mosque architecture===
The Umayyad Mosque is one of the few early mosques in the world to have maintained the same general structure and architectural features since its initial construction in the early 8th century and its Umayyad character has not been significantly altered. Since its establishment, the mosque has served as a model for congregational mosque architecture in Syria as well as globally. According to art historian, Finnbar Barry Flood, "the construction of the Damascus mosque not only irrevocably altered the urban landscape of the city, inscribing upon it a permanent affirmation of Muslim hegemony, but by giving the Syrian congregational mosque its definitive form it also transformed the subsequent history of the mosque in general."<ref>Rudolff, 2006, p. 214.</ref> Examples of the Umayyad Mosque's ground plan being used as a prototype for other mosques in the region include the [[al-Azhar Mosque]] and [[Mosque of al-Zahir Baybars|Baybars Mosque]] in [[Cairo]], the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], and the [[Bursa Grand Mosque]] and [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Turkey]].<ref>Rudolff, 2006, pp. 214-215.</ref>

==Religious significance==

The Umayyad Mosque holds great significance to [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] Muslims, as this was the destination of the ladies and children of the [[Ahl al-Bayt|family of Muhammad]], made to walk here from [[Iraq]], following the [[Battle of Karbala]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Nafasul Mahmoom |last=Qummi |first=Shaykh Abbas |year=2005 |publisher=Ansariyan Publications |location=Qum |page=362}}</ref> Furthermore, it was the place where they were imprisoned for 60 days.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nafasul Mahmoom |page=368}}</ref>

The following are structures found within the Mosque that bear great importance:

'''West Side:'''
* The entrance gate (known as ''"Bāb as-Sā'at"'') &mdash; The door marks the location where the prisoners of Karbalā were made to stand for 72 hours before being brought inside.<ref name="gate">{{cite book |title=Nafasul Mahmoom |page=367}}</ref> During this time, [[Yazid I|Yazīd I]] had the town and his palace decorated for their arrival.,<ref name="gate"/>

[[File:Shrine of John the Baptist, Great Umayyid Mosque, Damascus.jpg |thumb|right|Shrine purportedly housing the head of Prophet Yahya (John the Baptist).]]

'''South Wing (main hall):'''
* Shrine of John the Baptist ({{lang-ar|Yahyā}}) &mdash; According to [[Al-Suyuti]], Ibrahim stated that since the creation of the world<ref>Tafseer Durre Manthur Vol.6, p. &nbsp;30-31.</ref> the Heavens and the Earth wept only for two people: Yahya and [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of Muhammad<ref name="yahya">Tafseer Ibn Katheer, vol.9, p. 163, published in Egypt. Tafseer Durre Manthur Vol.6, p. 30-31.</ref>
* A white pulpit &mdash; Marks the place where [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]] addressed the court of Yazīd after being brought from Karbalā<ref>{{cite book |title=Nafasul Mahmoom |page=381}}</ref>
* Raised floor (in front of the pulpit) &mdash; Marks the location where all the ladies and children (the household of [[Muhammad]]) were made to stand in the presence of Yazīd
* Wooden balcony (directly opposite the raised floor)&nbsp;– Marks the location where Yazīd sat in the court.
