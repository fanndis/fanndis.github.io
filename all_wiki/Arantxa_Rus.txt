===Notes===
* <sup>{{note label|Doha/Dubai|1|1}}</sup> The first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] event of the year has switched back and forth between the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[Qatar Total Open]] since 2009. Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009–2011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status. The two tournaments have since alternated status every year.
*<sup>{{note label|Tokyo/Wuhan|2|2}}</sup> In 2014, the [[Toray Pan Pacific Open]] was downgraded to a Premier event and replaced by the [[Wuhan Open]].
