They first took references from director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] regarding the set and lighting designs. The team then started with eight full racks of clothing, between 200 and 300 dresses, and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show, along with its accessories. Designers used for the costumes include [[Roberto Cavalli]], Michael Costello, Mathieu Mirano, [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]] as well as David Samuel Menkes, who created the leather jumpsuit. Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns, belted in the middle. Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too tight in Gaga's abdomen area, since it would have been difficult for her to sing. Sandals were provided by Brian Atwood, [[Stuart Weitzman]] and [[Sophia Webster]], while a pair of boots were designed by [[Giuseppe Zanotti]]. They created custom made shoes which made Gaga appear tall and move freely in the long gowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/lady-gaga-slideshow-of-costumes-for-cheek-to-cheek-and-stylist-interview/3542/|title=The Looks of Lady Gaga.

Jesse Lawrence from ''[[Forbes]]'' reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary. He also noted that the concerts had a much higher ticket price than the average, especially in the [[secondary market]]s. The first two dates were sold out immediately, with a high demand hence secondary market average price for New Year's Eve performance at The Chelsea was above $1,000 with a $329 get-in price for a limited quantity of tickets.<ref name="ticket"/> The end-of-the-year concert was the most expensive show at Las Vegas, with tickets averaging at $647.58 and the get-in price starting at $239.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/12/23/for-new-years-eve-concerts-las-vegas-leads-the-pack-with-top-ticket-prices/|title=For New Year's Eve Concerts, Las Vegas Leads The Pack With Top Ticket Prices|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2015|work=[[Forbes]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109023023/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/12/23/for-new-years-eve-concerts-las-vegas-leads-the-pack-with-top-ticket-prices/|archivedate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> For The Wiltern, ticket price was average $297.64 over a few hundred available tickets. Again, for the New York shows, all except the front row seats were sold out, leading to a third date being added on June 22, 2015. A similar situation occurred when tickets went on sale for their concert of June 8 at Royal Albert Hall in London, leading to an additional date to be added for June 9.<ref name="ticket">{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/11/04/high-demand-for-tony-bennett-and-lady-gaga-tickets-lead-to-more-dates-high-secondary-market-prices/|title=High Demand For Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga Tickets Lead To More Dates, High Secondary Market Prices|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2015|work=Forbes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107130730/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/11/04/high-demand-for-tony-bennett-and-lady-gaga-tickets-lead-to-more-dates-high-secondary-market-prices/|archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref> Tickets for June 26–27 shows at the [[Ravinia Festival]] also sold out before them being available for general public.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/04/27/728845/10130993/en/MEDIA-ALERT-BENNETT-GAGA-TICKETS-ALREADY-GONE-AS-RAVINIA-OPENS-SALES-TO-THE-PUBLIC.html|title=Media Alert: Bennett/Gaga Tickets Already Gone As Ravinia Opens Sales To The Public|date=April 27, 2015|accessdate=June 13, 2015|agency=[[GlobeNewswire]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615020217/http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/04/27/728845/10130993/en/MEDIA-ALERT-BENNETT-GAGA-TICKETS-ALREADY-GONE-AS-RAVINIA-OPENS-SALES-TO-THE-PUBLIC.html|archivedate=June 15, 2015}}</ref>

In another article on ''Forbes'', Lawrence wrote that there was a "massive" demand for tickets on the secondary market for Radio City Music Hall's shows. According to [[TiqIQ]], the average secondary price was $380.83 with cheapest ones at $143, being the most expensive tickets on the tour in the United States. The total average was up by 50.5% throughout the 24 dates in the country, at $252.91. He also wrote about the show at Borgata Events Center in Atlantic City, which had tickets averaging $406.90 and the get-in price listed at $220.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2015/06/19/tony-bennett-and-lady-gagas-radio-city-music-hall-residency-averaging-380-ticket-on-resale-market/|title=Tony Bennett And Lady Gaga's Radio City Music Hall Residency Averaging $380 Ticket On Resale Market|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=June 20, 2015|work=Forbes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621063925/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2015/06/19/tony-bennett-and-lady-gagas-radio-city-music-hall-residency-averaging-380-ticket-on-resale-market/|archivedate=June 21, 2015}}</ref> As it approached the final dates of the tour, there were more sold-out shows, with the average prices on the remaining dates and seats at $213.58.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2015/07/22/lady-gaga-and-tony-bennett-tickets-still-strong-as-cheek-to-cheek-tour-approaches-finale/|title=Lady Gaga And Tony Bennett Tickets Still Strong As Cheek to Cheek Tour Approaches Finale|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=July 25, 2015|work=Forbes|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724222451/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2015/07/22/lady-gaga-and-tony-bennett-tickets-still-strong-as-cheek-to-cheek-tour-approaches-finale/|archivedate=July 24, 2015}}</ref> The ''[[Pollstar]]'' 2015 Mid-Year Top 100 Worldwide Tour list revealed Cheek to Cheek Tour as the 69th highest grosser, with a total of $13.1 million from 13 shows, and a total of 146,795 in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/Charts2015/2015MidYearTop100WorldwideTours.pdf|title=Pollstar 2015 Mid-Year Top 100 Worldwide Tour|accessdate=July 13, 2015|work=[[Pollstar]]|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075458/http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/Charts2015/2015MidYearTop100WorldwideTours.pdf|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the end of 2015, the tour placed at number 71 on the ''[[Pollstar]]'' "2015 Year-End Top 200 North American Tours" list, grossing $15.3 million from 27 shows with a total attendance of 176,267.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2015/2015YearEndTop200NorthAmericanTours.pdf|title=Pollstar 2015 Year-End Top 200 North American Tours|work=[[Pollstar]]|format=PDF|accessdate=January 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202085938/http://www.pollstarpro.com/files/charts2015/2015YearEndTop200NorthAmericanTours.pdf|archive-date=February 2, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
