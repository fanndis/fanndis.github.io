===Career===
In 1973–1984 Ivan Vakarchuk was working at the Lviv branch of the Institute for Theoretical Physics affiliated with the UkrSSR Academy of Sciences (now is the Institute of Condensed Matter Physics of National Academy of Sciences) as junior [[research fellow]], senior researcher and head of [[Quantum statistics|Quantum Statistics]] department.<br />
Since 1984 he's been performing the duties of Professor, head of department of [[Theoretical Physics]] at [[Lviv University|Lviv State Ivan Franko University]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.rudenko.kiev.ua/persons/vakarchuk Вакарчук Иван.

===Achievements in science===

Ivan Vakarchuk has the rank of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor, PhD with the thesis: "Application of the method of displacements and collective variables in the study of interacting Bose particles near absolute zero" (Institute for Theoretical Physics, Academy of Sciences of [[Ukrainian SSR|USSR]], 1974) doctoral thesis on "Microscopic theory of Bose liquid" (Institute for Theoretical Physics, USSR Academy of Sciences, 1980).

A distinctive feature of professor Ivan Vakarchuk was the amplitude of his scientific interests: physics of quantum liquids, theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, physics of disordered systems, magnetic systems, physics, mathematical methods in theoretical physics, fundamental problems of quantum mechanics and quantum computer sciences, geophysics, general relativity theory, cosmology, philosophy of science. In each of these fields he proposed new original approaches to the study of various physical phenomena and processes. The amplitude of his scientific interests allowed him to apply methods, which he invented to study different phenomena.

Ivan Vakarchuk paid particular attention to the latest achievements in science and philosophy of science issues, including the relationship between research methods of natural sciences and humanities, identifying common math mechanisms that "manage" the processes occurring in the humanitarian and social spheres.<br />
He is the author of over 240 scientific papers, and author of the books  "Lectures on General Relativity" (1991), "Quantum Mechanics" (1998, 2004, 2007, 2012) "Introduction to the many-body problem" (1999) and "The Theory of Stellar Spectra" (2003).<ref>[http://www.ktf.franko.lviv.ua/cgi-bin/select.cgi?%C2%E0%EA%E0%F0%F7%F3%EA%20%B2.|%C2%E0%EA%E0%F0%F7%F3%EA%20%C8.|Vakarchuk%20I.|Wakarczuk%20I.
