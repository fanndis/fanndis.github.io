==Conception and recording==
"Beautiful Liar" was written by [[Stargate (production team)|Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen]], [[Amanda Ghost]], [[Ian Dench]], and Beyoncé. It was produced by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé.<ref name="booklet"/> Eriksen told ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', "This song is very simple. Most of the time we have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example."<ref name="sound">{{Cite web|accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may10/articles/stargate.htm |title=The Stargate Writing & Production Team |work=[[Sound on Sound]] |publisher=SOS Publications Group |date=May 31, 2010 |first=Paul |last=Tingen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65s5XjjIC?url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may10/articles/stargate.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2012 }}</ref> The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, [[Tyran Smith]], who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé.<ref name="sound"/> Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song.<ref name="sound"/> The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote a significant part of the lyrics and the melody.<ref name="sound"/>

The music video for "Beautiful Liar" was directed by [[Jake Nava]], who directed several of Beyoncé's other videos.

The first half of the video features Beyoncé and Shakira in separate scenes. It begins with the women's faces masked by smoke. As the video progresses they are featured against several different backgrounds, including dawn (Beyoncé) and dusk (Shakira); sheets blown in the wind; bamboo covered with [[Cattleya|yellow orchids]]; a room with blue neon lighting and [[Avestan language|Avestan]] writing on the walls; and a background of stormy weather. Slow dance moves and belly dancing, during a breakdown after the bridge, are featured throughout the video.
