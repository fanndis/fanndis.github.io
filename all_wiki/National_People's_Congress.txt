{{Politics of China |expanded = Legislative }}

The '''National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China''', normally referred to as the '''National People's Congress''' (usually abbreviated '''NPC'''), is the highest organ of state power and the national legislature of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. With 2,980 members in 2018, it is the largest parliamentary body in the world. The National People's Congress meets in full session for roughly two weeks each year and votes on important pieces of legislation. Members are considered to be part-time legislators and are not paid.

The majority of the power of the NPC is exercised by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC), which consists of about 170 legislators and meets in continuous session, when the full session of the NPC is not held. Members of the National People's Congress are allowed to simultaneously hold seats in other bodies of government and the party and the NPC typically includes all of the senior officials in Chinese politics. By contrast, members of the NPCSC are not allowed to simultaneously hold positions in executive or judicial posts.

Under [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's Constitution]], the NPC is structured as a [[unicameral]] legislature, with the ''[[de jure]]'' power to legislate and oversee the operations of the government, the supreme court, special committees, the supreme procuratorate, the central military commission and elect the major officers of state. Western media sources commonly describe the NPC as a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamping body]] although at the turn of the century some academics asserted that the NPC had then begun to emerge as an influential force in Chinese politics. 

The NPC is elected for a term of five years. It holds annual sessions every spring, usually lasting from 10 to 14 days, in the [[Great Hall of the People]] on the west side of [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing. The NPC's sessions are usually timed to occur with the meetings of the National Committee of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC), a consultative body whose members represent various social groups. As the NPC and the CPPCC are the main deliberative bodies of China, they are often referred to as the [[Lianghui]] (Two Sessions).

According to the NPC, its annual meetings provide an opportunity for the officers of state to review past policies and to present future plans to the nation.

== History ==
{{main|National Assembly (Republic of China)|Legislative Yuan}}

=== Republican era ===
Calls for a National Assembly were part of the platform of the [[Tongmenghui|revolutionaries]] who ultimately overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]]. In response, the Qing dynasty formed the [[Advisory Council (Qing dynasty)|first assembly]] in 1910, but it was virtually powerless and intended only as an advisory body.

Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], [[1912 Republic of China National Assembly election|national elections]] yielded the [[bicameral]] 1913 National Assembly, but significantly less than one percent voted due to gender, property, tax, residential, and literacy requirements. It was not a single nationwide election but a series of local elections that began in December 1912 with most concluding in January 1913. The poll was indirect, as voters chose [[electoral college|electors]] who picked the delegates, in some cases leading to instances of bribery. The Senate was elected by the provincial assemblies. The president had to pick the 64 members representing [[Tibet (1912-1951)|Tibet]], [[Mongolia (1911-1924)|Outer Mongolia]], and [[Overseas Chinese]] for practical reasons. However, these elections had the participation of over 300 civic groups and were the most competitive nationwide elections in the history of China.

The election results gave a clear plurality for the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), which won 392 of the 870 seats, but there was confusion as many candidates were members in several parties concurrently. Several switched parties after the election, giving the Kuomintang 438 seats. By order of seats, the [[Republican Party (China)|Republican]], [[Unity Party (China)|Unity]], and [[Democratic Party (1912)|Democratic]] (formerly Constitutionalist) parties later merged into the [[Progressive Party (China)|Progressive Party]] under [[Liang Qichao]].

After the death of [[Yuan Shikai]], the National Assembly reconvened on 1 August 1916 under the pretext that its three-year term had been suspended and had not expired, but President [[Li Yuanhong]] was forced to disband it due to the [[Manchu Restoration]] on 1 June 1917. 130 members (mostly Kuomintang) moved to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Guangzhou) where they held an "extraordinary session" on 25 August under a [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|rival government]] led by [[Sun Yat-sen]], and another 120 quickly followed. After the [[Old Guangxi Clique]] became disruptive, the assembly temporarily moved to [[Kunming]] and later [[Chongqing|Chungking]] (Chongqing) under [[Tang Jiyao]]'s protection until Guangzhou was liberated. Lacking a quorum, they selected new members in 1919.

The original Legislative Yuan was formed in the original capital of [[Nanjing|Nanking]] (Nanjing) after the completion of the [[Northern Expedition]]. Its 51 members were appointed to a term of two years. The 4th Legislative Yuan under this period had its members expanded to 194, and its term in office was extended to 14 years because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45). According to KMT political theory, these first four sessions marked the period of [[political tutelage]].

The current [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] came into effect on 25 December 1947, and the first Legislative session convened in Nanking on 18 May 1948, with 760 members. Under the constitution, the main duty of the National Assembly was to elect the President and Vice President for terms of six years.  It also had the right to recall the President and Vice President if they failed to fulfill their political responsibilities. According to "National Assembly Duties Act," the National Assembly could amend the constitution with a two-thirds majority, with at least three-quarters membership present. It could also change territorial boundaries. In addition to the National Assembly? it has two chambers of parliament that are elected. Governmental organs of the constitution follow the outline proposed by [[Sun Yat-sen]] and supported by the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party), while also incorporating the opinions of the [[federalism]] supported [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] in the 1940s. The [[separation of powers]] was designed by [[Carsun Chang]], a founding member of the [[China Democratic League]].

* '''[[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]]''' ({{lang|zh-tw|國民大會}}) — [[Direct election|Directly elected]] by the people within a [[Counties of China|county]]. It represented the entire nation and exercised the political rights thereof. It elected the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and has the power to amend the constitution, but its legislative functions were considered "reserve" powers that were meant to be exercised on an ad-hoc basis.
* '''[[Legislative Yuan]]''' ({{lang|zh-tw|立法院}}) — [[Direct election|Directly elected]] by the people within a [[Provinces of China|province]]. It is the principal and standing legislative body. It approves the [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] and supervises the [[Executive Yuan]] (the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]).
* '''[[Control Yuan]]''' ({{lang|zh-tw|監察院}}) — [[Indirect election|Indirectly elected]] by the [[Provinces of China|provincial]] legislatures. It is the [[government performance auditing]] body and approves the grand justices of the [[Judicial Yuan]] (the [[Constitutional court]]) and the commission members of the [[Examination Yuan]] (the [[Civil service commission]]).

As the mechanism is significantly different from the Western [[separation of powers|''trias politica'']], the grand justices has an interpretation which ruled that these three organs all bear characteristics equivalent to a "[[parliament]]".<ref>[https://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/EN/p03_01.asp?expno=76 J.Y. Interpretation No. 76]</ref>

However, the [[government of the Republic of China]] lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949 and retreated to [[Taiwan]]. A set of [[Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion|temporary provisions]] were passed by the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] to gather more powers to the [[President of the Republic of China|President]] and limit the functions of the tricameral parliament. Members of the tricameral parliament elected in [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]] in 1947 and 1948 were transplanted to [[Taipei]]. On 24 February 1950, 380 members convened at the Sun Yat-sen Hall in Taipei and kept serving without reelection until 1991.

After a series of [[constitutional amendment]]s in the 1990s in [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan]], the new [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution]] have changed the [[Legislative Yuan]] to a [[Unicameralism|unicameral parliament]].

=== People's Republic ===
{{main|Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference}}
The Conference dated prior to the existence of the [[People's Republic of China]]. During negotiations between the [[Communist Party of China]] and the [[Kuomintang]] in 1945, the two parties agreed to open multiparty talks on post-[[World War II]] political reforms via a Political Consultative Conference. This was included in the [[Double Tenth Agreement]]. This agreement was implemented by the Kuomintang's [[National Government of the Republic of China]], who organised the first Political Consultative Assembly from January 10–31, 1946. Representatives of the [[Kuomintang]], [[Communist Party of China]], [[Chinese Youth Party]], and [[China Democratic League]], as well as independent delegates, attended the conference in [[Chongqing|Chungking]].

A second Political Consultative Conference took place in September 1949, inviting delegates from various friendly parties to attend and discuss the establishment of a new state. This conference was then renamed the People's Political Consultative Conference. The first conference approved the [[The Common Program (1949)|Common Program]], which served as the ''de facto'' [[constitution]] for the next five years. The conference approved the new national anthem, flag, capital city, and state name, and elected the first government of the [[People's Republic of China]]. In effect, the first People's Political Consultative Conference served as a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]]. It was a ''de facto'' legislature of the PRC during the first five years of existence.

In 1954, the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]] transferred this function to the National People's Congress.

== Powers and duties ==
Under the constitution, the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China, and all four PRC constitutions have vested it with great lawmaking powers. Most Western media have characterized the NPC as a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for decisions already made by the state's executive organs and the [[Communist Party of China]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How China is ruled: National People's Congress|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/government/html/7.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017053542/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/in_depth/china_politics/government/html/7.stm|archive-date=17 October 2007|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-xi-analysis/nothing-to-see-but-comfort-for-xi-at-chinas-annual-parliament-idUSKBN16M1U3|title=Nothing to see but comfort for Xi at China's annual parliament|date=16 March 2017|access-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063039/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-xi-analysis/nothing-to-see-but-comfort-for-xi-at-chinas-annual-parliament-idUSKBN16M1U3|archive-date=5 March 2018|agency=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/china-parliament-billionaires.html|title=China's Parliament Is a Growing Billionaires' Club|last=Wee|first=Sui-Lee|date=1 March 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303211107/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/china-parliament-billionaires.html|archive-date=3 March 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/03/05/at-chinas-rubber-stamp-parliament-real-stamps-are-all-the-rage/|title=At China's Rubber-Stamp Parliament, Real Stamps Are All the Rage|last=Chen|first=Te-Ping|date=5 March 2016|website=WSJ|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305072347/https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/03/05/at-chinas-rubber-stamp-parliament-real-stamps-are-all-the-rage/|archive-date=5 March 2018|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref> One of its members, Hu Xiaoyan, told the BBC in 2009 that she has no power to help her constituents.

There are mainly four functions and powers of the NPC:<ref>{{cite web |title=Functions and Powers of the National People's Congress |url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Organization/2007-11/15/content_1373013.htm |website=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China |publisher=The National People's Congress |accessdate=29 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218022817/http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Organization/2007-11/15/content_1373013.htm |archive-date=18 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===To amend the Constitution and oversee its enforcement===

Only the NPC has the power to amend the Constitution. Amendments to the Constitution must be proposed by the NPC Standing Committee or 1/5 or more of the NPC deputies. In order for the Amendments to become effective, they must be passed by 2/3 majority vote of all deputies. In contrast with other jurisdictions by which constitutional enforcement is considered a judicial power, in Chinese political theory, constitutional enforcement is considered a legislative power, and Chinese courts do not have the authority to determine constitutionality of legislation or administrative measures. Challenges to constitutionality have therefore become the responsibility of the National People's Congress which has a recording and review mechanism for constitutional issues<ref name="npcobserver.com">{{Cite web | url=https://npcobserver.com/2018/01/19/recording-review-an-introduction-to-constitutional-review-with-chinese-characteristics/ |title = Recording & Review: An Introduction to Constitutional Review with Chinese Characteristics|date = 19 January 2018}}</ref>

===To enact and amend basic law===
To enact and amend basic law governing criminal offences, civil affairs, state organs and other matters.

===To elect and appoint members to the central state organs===

The NPC elects the [[President of the People's Republic of China]] and the [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China]]. The NPC also appoints the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and many other crucial officials to the central state organs. The NPC has the power to remove the above-mentioned officials from the office. The NPC also elects the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, Secretary-General and other members of its Standing Committee. In the performance of its electoral responsibilities, the NPC acts as a defacto [[electoral college]] for the elections to the offices of the President and Vice President. During the first general plenary session of a new term of the Congress, all its deputies regardless of their representation as provincial or sectoral deputies serve as electors of the offices of the presidency and vice presidency. If the President or Vice President has been impeached by a majority vote of Congress, resigns or dies in office, the NPC, thru the NPCSC, orders a special general plenary to be convened for the election to either office. If both offices are vacant during their terms of office, the procedure of its deputy-electors to elect new office holders is the same as in a usual first general plenary session.

===To determine major state issues===

This includes examining and approving the report on the plan for national economic and social development and on its implementation, report and central budget, and more. The establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Macao Special Administrative Region, Hainan Province and Chongqing Municipality and the building of the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River were all decided by the NPC.

The drafting process of NPC legislation is governed by the ''Organic Law of the NPC'' (1982) and the ''NPC Procedural Rules'' (1989). It begins with a small group, often of outside experts, who begin a draft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Over time, this draft is considered by larger and larger groups, with an attempt made to maintain consensus at each step of the process.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} By the time the full NPC or NPCSC meets to consider the legislation, the major substantive elements of the draft legislation have largely been agreed to.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} However, minor wording changes to the draft are often made at this stage. The process ends with a formal vote by the Standing Committee of the NPC or by the NPC in a plenary session.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}However, it is not completely without influence. It functions as a forum in which legislative proposals are drafted and debated with input from different parts of the government and outside technical experts. However, there are a wide range of issues for which there is no consensus within the Party and over which different parts of the party or government have different opinions. Over these issues the NPC has often become a forum for debating ideas and for achieving consensus.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In practice, although the final votes on laws of the NPC often return a high affirmative vote, a great deal of legislative activity occurs in determining the content of the legislation to be voted on. A major bill such as the Securities Law can take years to draft, and a bill sometimes will not be put before a final vote if there is significant opposition to the measure.<ref>{{cite report |author=Stephen Green |date=2003 |url=http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/3073_npcandthesecuritieslaw.pdf |title=Drafting the Securities Law: The role of the National People’s Congress in creating China’s new market economy |publisher=Cambridge University |accessdate=25 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714024016/http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/3073_npcandthesecuritieslaw.pdf |archive-date=14 July 2011 }}</ref>

One important constitutional principle which is stated in Article 8 of the [[Legislation Law of the People's Republic of China]] is that an action can become a crime only as a consequence of a law passed by the full NPC and that other organs of the Chinese government do not have the power to criminalize activity. This principle was used to overturn police regulations on [[custody and repatriation]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and has been used to call into question the legality of [[re-education through labor]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}In practice, there is no mechanism to verify constitutionality of statute laws, meaning that local administrations could bypass the constitution through [[Administrative law]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Legislative process ==
The legislative process of the NPC works according to a five-year work plan drafted by the Legislative Affairs Committee<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://npcobserver.com/2018/06/25/scholarship-highlight-the-npcsc-legislative-affairs-commission-and-its-invisible-legislators/|title = Scholarship Highlight: The NPCSC Legislative Affairs Commission and Its "Invisible Legislators"|date = 25 June 2018|access-date = 6 March 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190306234909/https://npcobserver.com/2018/06/25/scholarship-highlight-the-npcsc-legislative-affairs-commission-and-its-invisible-legislators/|archive-date = 6 March 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>  Within the work plan, a specific piece of legislative is drafted by a group of legislators or administrative agencies within the State Council, these proposals are collected into a yearly agenda which outlines the work of the NPC in a particular year.<ref name="uschina.org"/> This is followed by consultation by experts and approving in principle by the Communist Party.  Afterwards, the legislation undergoes three readings and public consultation. The final approval is done in a plenary session in which by convention the vote is near unanimous.<ref name="uschina.org"/>

The NPC had never rejected a government bill until 1986, during the Bankruptcy Law proceedings, wherein a revised bill was passed in the same session. An outright rejection without a revised version being passed occurred in 2000 when a Highway Law was rejected, the first occurrence in sixty years of history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cefc.com.hk/uf/file/CabestanA99.pdf|title=CEFC - China Perspectives|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043813/http://www.cefc.com.hk/uf/file/CabestanA99.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2019|access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref> Moreover, in 2015, the NPC refused to pass a package of bills proposed by the State Council, insisting that each bill require a separate vote and revision process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/China_Monitor_No_37_National%20People%E2%80%99s%20Congress_EN.pdf|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306234755/https://www.merics.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/China_Monitor_No_37_National%20People%E2%80%99s%20Congress_EN.pdf|archive-date=6 March 2019|access-date=6 March 2019}}</ref> The time for legislation can be as short as six months, or as long as 15 years for controversial legislation such as the Anti-Monopoly Law.<ref name="uschina.org"/>

== Proceedings ==
The NPC meets for about two weeks each year at the same time as the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], usually in the Spring. The combined sessions have been known as the ''two meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/stateStructure/node_3826.htm|title=State Structure of the People's Republic of China|website=中国人大网|publisher=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025175802/http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/stateStructure/node_3826.htm|archive-date=25 October 2016|accessdate=29 September 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43239646 China's 'two sessions': Economics, environment and Xi's power] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922001341/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43239646|date=22 September 2018}}''BBC''</ref>'' Between these sessions, power is exercised by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] which contains about 150 members.

The sessions have become media events because it is at the plenary sessions that the Chinese leadership produces work reports. Although the NPC has thus far never failed to approve a work report or candidate nominated by the Party, these votes are no longer unanimous. It is considered extremely embarrassing for the approval vote to fall below 70%, which occurred several times in the mid-1990s. More recently, work reports have been vetted with NPC delegates beforehand to avoid this embarrassment.

In addition, during NPC sessions the Chinese leadership holds press conferences with foreign reporters, and this is one of the few opportunities Western reporters have of asking unscripted questions of the Chinese leadership.

A major bill often takes years to draft, and a bill sometimes will not be put before a final vote if there is significant opposition to the measure. An example of this is the [[Property Law of the People's Republic of China]] which was withdrawn from the 2006 legislative agenda after objections that the law did not do enough to protect state property. China's laws are usually submitted for approval after at most three reviews at the NPC Standing Committee. However, the debate of the Property Law has spanned nine years, receiving a record seven reviews at the NPC Standing Committee and stirring hot debates across the country. The long-awaited and highly contested Property Law was finally approved at the Fifth Session of the Tenth National People's Congress (NPC) on 16 March 2007. Among the 2,889 deputies attending the closing session, 2,799 voted for it, 52 against it, 37 abstained and one didn't vote.

==Election and membership==
The NPC consists of about 2,980 delegates in 2018, making it the largest parliamentary body in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/mod-general.asp|title=IPU PARLINE Database: General Information|author=International Parliamentary Union|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806150648/http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/mod-general.asp|archive-date=6 August 2017|accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref>  Delegates to the National People's Congress are elected for five-year terms via a multi-tiered representative [[Elections in the People's Republic of China|electoral system]]. Delegates are elected by the provincial people's assemblies, who in turn are elected by lower level assemblies, and so on through a series of tiers to the local people's assemblies which are directly elected by the [[Constituency|electorate]].

There is a limit on the number of candidates in proportion to the number of seats available. At the national level, for example, a maximum of 110 candidates are allowed per 100 seats; at the provincial level, this ratio is 120 candidates per 100 seats. This ratio increases for each lower level of people's assemblies, until the lowest level, the village level, has no limit on the number of candidates for each seat.{{citation needed|reason= The lowest level of People's Congress in at Township level|date=April 2019}} However, the Congress website says "In an indirect election, the number of candidates should exceed the number to be elected by 20% to 50%."  The requirement that there be more candidates than seats contrasts with Soviet procedure in which the number of candidates were identical to the number of seats.

===Hong Kong and Macau delegations===
[[Hong Kong]] has had a separate delegation since the 9th NPC in 1998, and [[Macau]] since the 10th NPC in 2003. The delegates from Hong Kong and Macau are elected via an [[electoral college]] rather than by popular vote, but do include significant political figures who are residing in the regions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2139/ssrn.958845 |title=Of Iron or Rubber?: People's Deputies of Hong Kong to the National People's Congress |year=2007 |last1=Fu |first1=Hualing |last2=Choy |first2=D. W }}</ref>   The electoral colleges which elect Hong Kong and Macau NPC members are largely similar in composition to the bodies which elect the chief executives of those regions. In order to stand for election, the candidate must be validated by the Presidium of the electoral college and must agree to uphold the constitution of the PRC and the Basic Law.  Each elector can vote for the number of seats from the qualified nominees.

Under the one country, two systems policy, the Communist Party of China does not operate in Hong Kong or Macau, and none of the delegates from Hong Kong and Macau are formally affiliated with the CCP.  However, the electoral committee which elects the Hong Kong and Macau delegates are mainly supporters of the pro-Beijing pan-establishment camp, and so far, all of the candidates that have been elected from Hong Kong and Macau are from the pro-Beijing pan-establishment camp.

In contrast to Mainland China where political opposition parties are not allowed, the political opposition controls about one quarter of the electoral college, opposition candidates have been allowed to run for NPC seats, although no opposition candidate has ever been elected.  In the [[2017 National People's Congress election in Hong Kong|most recent election in 2017]], the pan-democrats opposition declined to endorse candidates because they believed that constitutional changes made getting a seat useless.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2119386/hong-kong-pan-dems-snub-election-run-deputies-chinas-npc| title=Pan-dems to snub election run for NPC deputies after change in rules| date=10 November 2017| access-date=7 March 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002920/https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2119386/hong-kong-pan-dems-snub-election-run-deputies-chinas-npc| archive-date=8 March 2019| url-status=live}}</ref>  In this election, the Presidium refused to allow the candidacy of several Occupy and pro-independence candidates on the grounds that they refused to sign the electoral form pledging to uphold the constitution and the Basic Law.  However, the Presidium did allow the candidacy of several moderate pan-democratic figures who were unable to be elected.

Although the pan-democratic opposition in Hong Kong does not have enough votes to elect an opposition candidate, they have expressed the belief that they have enough seats to influence which pro-Beijing figures can get elected.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20171123-presidium-formed-for-dec-9-election-of-hong-kong-npc-deputies/| title=Presidium formed for Dec. 19 election of Hong Kong NPC deputies| date=23 November 2017| access-date=7 March 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307173856/http://www.ejinsight.com/20171123-presidium-formed-for-dec-9-election-of-hong-kong-npc-deputies/| archive-date=7 March 2019| url-status=live}}</ref>

The current method of electing SAR delegations began after the handovers of sovereignty to the PRC. Between 1975 and the handovers, both Hong Kong and Macau were represented by delegations elected by the [[Guangdong]] Provincial Congress.

===Taiwan delegation===
The NPC has included a "[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan]]" delegation since the 4th NPC in 1975, in line with the PRC's position that Taiwan is a province of China. Prior to the 2000s, the Taiwan delegates in the NPC were mostly Taiwanese members of the Chinese Communist Party who fled Taiwan after 1947. They are now either deceased or extremely old, and in the last three Congresses, only one of the "Taiwan" delegates was actually born in Taiwan (Chen Yunying, wife of economist [[Justin Yifu Lin]]); the remainder are "second-generation Taiwan compatriots", whose parents or grandparents came from Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web

===People's Liberation Army delegation===
The [[People's Liberation Army]] has had a large delegation since the founding of the NPC, making up anywhere from 4 percent of the total delegates (3rd NPC), to 17 percent (4th NPC). Since the 5th NPC, it has usually held about 9 percent of the total delegate seats, and is consistently the largest delegation in the NPC.

===Ethnic Minorities and Overseas Chinese delegates===
For the first three NPCs, there was a special delegation for returned [[overseas Chinese]], but this was eliminated starting in the 4th NPC, and although overseas Chinese remain a recognized group in the NPC, they are now scattered among the various delegations. The PRC also recognizes 55 minority ethnic groups in China, and there is at least one delegate belonging to each of these groups in the current (12th) NPC.<ref>{{cite web

==Relationship with the ruling Communist Party of China==

Under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]], the [[Communist Party of China]] is guaranteed a leadership role, and the National People's Congress therefore does not serve as a forum of debate between government and opposition parties as is the case with Western parliaments. At the same time, the Constitution makes the Party subordinate to laws passed by the National People's Congress, and the NPC has been the forum for debates and conflict resolution between different interest groups. The Communist Party maintains control over the NPC by controlling delegate selection, maintaining control over the legislative agenda, and controlling the constitutional amendment process.

The ruling [[Communist Party of China]] maintains control over the composition of people's congresses at various levels, especially the National People's Congress.<ref>{{cite web | last=Truex | first=Rory | title=China’s National People’s Congress is meeting this week.

The structure of the tiered electoral system makes it difficult for a candidate to become a member of the higher level people's assemblies without the support from politicians in the lower tier, while at the same time making it impossible for the party bureaucracy to completely control the election process.

One such mechanism is the limit on the number of candidates in proportion to the number of seats available.<ref name="isdp.eu">{{cite web |url=http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/2017/10/China-Party-Congress-Backgrounder.pdf |title=National Congress of the Communist Party |date=2017 |website=isdp.eu |format=PDF |access-date=2020-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404202220/http://isdp.eu/content/uploads/2017/10/China-Party-Congress-Backgrounder.pdf |archive-date=4 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> At the national level, for example, a maximum of 110 candidates are allowed per 100 seats; at the provincial level, this ratio is 120 candidates per 100 seats. This ratio increases for each lower level of people's congresses, until the lowest level, the village level, has no limit on the number of candidates for each seat. However, the Congress website says "In an indirect election, the number of candidates should exceed the number to be elected by 20% to 50%."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/about/2007-11/20/content_1373251.htm|title=The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China|website=www.npc.gov.cn|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505212226/http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/about/2007-11/20/content_1373251.htm|archive-date=5 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The practice of having more candidates than seats for NPC delegate positions has become standard, and it is different from Soviet practice in which all delegates positions were selected by the Party center.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0261-3794(90)90043-8 |title=The elections to the USSR congress of people's deputies March 1989 |journal=Electoral Studies |volume=9 |pages=59–66 |year=1990 |last1=White |first1=Stephen }}</ref> Although the limits on member selection allows the Party leadership to block candidates it considers unacceptable, it also causes unpopular candidates to be removed in the electoral process. Direct and explicit challenges to the rule of the Communist Party are not tolerated, but are unlikely in any event due to the control the party center has on delegate selection.

Furthermore, the constitution of the National People's Congress provides for most of its power to be exercised on a day-to-day basis by its Standing Committee.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Tony |last1=Saich |date=November 2015 |title=The National People's Congress: Functions and Membership |url=https://ash.harvard.edu/links/national-people%E2%80%99s-congress-functions-and-membership |publisher=[[Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation]] |access-date=9 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306234829/https://ash.harvard.edu/links/national-people%E2%80%99s-congress-functions-and-membership |archive-date=6 March 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Due to its overwhelming majority in the Congress, the Communist Party has total control over the composition of the Standing Committee, thereby allowing it to control actions of the National People's Congress.  However, the Communist Party uses the National People's Congress as a mechanism to coordinate different interests, weigh different strategies and incorporate these views into draft legislation.<ref>[https://www.merics.org/sites/default/files/2017-09/China_Monitor_No_37_National People’s Congress_EN.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2020}}</ref>

Although Party approval is in effect essential for membership in the NPC, approximately a third of the seats are by convention reserved for non-Communist Party members. This includes technical experts and members of the smaller allied parties.<ref name="isdp.eu"/> While these members do provide technical expertise and a somewhat greater diversity of views, they do not function as a political opposition.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://qz.com/1221265/chinas-annual-communist-party-gathering-welcomes-a-handful-of-new-tech-tycoons/ | title=China's annual Communist Party shindig is welcoming a handful of new tech tycoons | access-date=4 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404201409/https://qz.com/1221265/chinas-annual-communist-party-gathering-welcomes-a-handful-of-new-tech-tycoons/ | archive-date=4 April 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Role of Communist Party in Legislative Process ===
{{See also|Role of the Chinese Communist Party in lawmaking}}
Under Chinese law, the Communist Party is barred from directly introducing legislation into the NPC<ref name="uschina.org"/> although the Party can ask that government ministries or individual members introduce legislation on behalf of the Party.  The primary role of the Communist Party in the legislative process largely is exercised during the drafting phase of the legislation.  Before the NPC considers legislation, there are working groups which study the proposed topic, and it is necessary for the Party leadership to agree "in principle" to any legislative changes.  This process overlaps with the early drafting phase as particularly controversial or sensitive issues requires approval and consensus from the Party leadership.<ref name="uschina.org"/>

=== Role of the Communist Party in Constitutional Amendments ===
The Communist Party leadership plays a particularly large role in the approval of constitutional amendments.  In contrast to ordinary legislation, which the Communist Party leadership approves the legislation in principle, and in which the legislation is then introduced by government ministers or individual National People's Congress members, constitutional amendments are drafted and debated within the Communist Party, approved by the Central Committee of the Party and then presented to the National People's Congress.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web| url=https://npcobserver.com/2017/12/27/explainer-china-to-amend-the-constitution-for-the-fifth-time/| title=Explainer: China to Amend the Constitution for the Fifth Time (UPDATED)| date=28 December 2017| access-date=9 March 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019143037/https://npcobserver.com/2017/12/27/explainer-china-to-amend-the-constitution-for-the-fifth-time/| archive-date=19 October 2019| url-status=live}}</ref>  In contrast to ordinary legislation, in which the process is largely directed by the Legislation Law, the process for constitutional revision is largely described by Party documents.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  Unlike ordinary legislation in which the NPC routinely makes extensive revisions to legislative proposals which have been introduced to it, the changes to constitutional amendments from the draft approved by the party have been minor.

== Relationship with local governments ==
In addition to passing legislation, the NPCSC interacts with local governments through its constitutional review process.  In contrast to most Western nations, constitutional review is considered a legislative function and not a judicial one, and Chinese courts are not allowed to examine the constitutionality of legislation.  The NPC has created a set of institutions which monitor local administrative measures for constitutionality.<ref name="npcobserver.com"/>  Typically, the Legislative Affairs Committee will review legislation for constitutionality and then inform the enacting agencies of its findings, and rely on the enacting agency to reverse its decision.  Although the NPC has the legal authority to annul unconstitutional legislation by a local government, it has never used that power.<ref name="npcobserver.com"/>
