'''Performance art''' is an artwork or art exhibition created through actions executed by the artist or other participants. It may be live, through documentation, spontaneously or written, presented to a public in a [[Fine Arts]] context, traditionally interdisciplinary.<ref name="Tate Modern">{{cite web|title=Performance Art|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/performance-art|publisher=Tate Modern|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> Also known as ''artistic action'', it has been developed through the years as a genre of its own in which art is presented live. It had an important and fundamental role in 20th century avant garde art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Performance Art Movement Overview|url=https://www.theartstory.org/movement/performance-art/|publisher=The Art Story|access-date=May 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Media & Performance|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/media-and-performance-art/|publisher=Moma Museo of Modern Art|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>

It involves four basic elements: time, space, body, and presence of the artist, and the relation between the creator and the public. The actions, generally developed in art galleries and museums, can take place in the street, any kind of setting or space and during any time period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.celarg.org/int/archivos/taylor_estudios_avanzados_de_performance.pdf|title=Estudios avanzados de performance|last=Taylor y Fuentes|first=Diana y Macela|date=2011|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref> Its goal is to generate a reaction, sometimes with the support of improvisation and a sense of aesthetics.

==Definition==
[[File:Georgia O'Keeffe by Stieglitz, 1919.png|left|thumb|[[Georgia O'Keeffe]], photographed during a performative process]]

The definition and historical and pedagogical contextualization of performance art is controversial. One of the handicaps comes from the term itself, which is polysemic, and one of its meanings relates to the scenic arts. This meaning of performance in the scenic arts context is opposite to the meaning of performance art, since performance art emerged with a critical and antagonistic position towards scenic arts. Performance art only adjoins the scenic arts in certain aspects such as the audience and the present body, and still not every performance art piece contains these elements.<ref name=":25">{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Marvin|title=Performance: A Critical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|year=1998 |orig-year=1996|location=London and New York|pages= [https://archive.org/details/performancecriti0000carl/page/1, 2, 103–105]|isbn=0-415-13703-9}}</ref>

The meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to [[postmodernist]] traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Dada]], the [[Situationist]]s, [[Fluxus]], [[installation art]], and [[conceptual art]], performance art tended to be defined as an [[antithesis]] to theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Parr | first1 = Adrian | title = Becoming + Performance Art |editor1= Adrian Parr | work = The Deleuze Dictionary | publisher = Edinburgh University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 25, 2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OsVOy4s1QLMC | access-date = October 26, 2010 | isbn = 0748618996}}</ref> The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are used, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.<ref name=":25" />

Performance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a conceptual art which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.

Some types of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may use a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.

Performance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about "what art is". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; use robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the [[Survival Research Laboratories]]; involve ritualised elements (e.g. [[Shaun Caton]]); or borrow elements of any performing arts such as dance, music, and [[circus (performing art)|circus]].

Some artists, e.g. the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]] and [[neo-Dada]]ists, prefer to use the terms "live art", "action art", "actions", "intervention" (see [[art intervention]]) or "manoeuvre" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear [[body art]], fluxus-performance, [[happening]], [[action poetry]], and [[intermedia]].

==Origins==
[[File:Cabaret Voltaire Veranstaltung.JPG|thumb|El [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] on the Spiegelgasse street 1 in [[Zurich]], 2011]]

Performance art is a form of expression that was born as an alternative artistic manifestation. The discipline emerged in 1916 parallel to dadaism, under the umbrella of conceptual art. The movement was led by [[Tristan Tzara]], one of the pioneers of [[Dada]]. Western culture theorists have set the origins of performance art in the beginnings of the 20th century, along with [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[Futurism]] and Dadaism. Dada was an important inspiration because of their poetry actions, which drifted apart from conventionalisms, and futurist artists, specially some members of [[Russian futurism]], could also be identified as part of the starting process of performance art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Performanceras y dadaístas|url=https://conlaa.com/performanceras-dadaistas/|publisher=Con la a|date=2020|access-date=May 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rojas|first1=Diego|title=La performance, esa forma radical y perturbadora del arte contemporáneo|url=https://www.infobae.com/cultura/2017/05/20/la-performance-esa-forma-radical-y-perturbadora-del-arte-contemporaneo/|access-date=May 23, 2020|work=Infobae|date=May 20, 2017}}</ref>

===Cabaret Voltaire===
{{main|Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)}}

The [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] was founded in [[Zurich]] (Switzerland) by the couple [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Emmy Hennings]] for artistic and political purposes and was a place where new tendencies were explored. Located on the upper floor of a theater, whose exhibitions they mocked in their shows, the works interpreted in the cabaret were avant garde and experimental. It is thought that the Dada movement was founded in the ten square meter locale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myswitzerland.com/es/cabaret-voltaire.html|title=Cabaret Voltaire|access-date=March 4, 2018|website=MySwitzerland.com}}</ref> Moreover, Surrealists, whose movement descended directly from Dadaism, used to meet in the Cabaret. On its brief existence—barely six months, closing the summer of 1916—the Dadaist Manifesto was read and it held the first Dada actions, performances, and hybrid poetry, plastic art, music and repetitive action presentations. Founders such as [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Marcel Janco]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]] and [[Jean Arp]] participated in provocative and scandalous events that were fundamental and the basis of the foundation for the anarchist movement called Dada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160719-cabaret-voltaire-a-night-out-at-historys-wildest-nightclub|title=Cabaret Voltaire: A night out at history's wildest nightclub|access-date=March 4, 2018|last=Sooke|first=Alastair}}</ref>

Dadaism was born with the intention of destroying any system or established norm in the art world.<ref name=":2" /> It is an anti-art movement, anti-literary and anti-poetry, that questioned the existence of art, literature and poetry itself. Not only was it a way of creating, but of living; it created a whole new ideology.<ref name="ref_duplicada_2" /> It was against eternal beauty, the eternity of principles, the laws of logic, the immobility of thought and clearly against anything universal. It promoted change, spontaneity, immediacy, contradiction, randomness and the defense of chaos against the order and imperfection against perfection, ideas similar to those of performance art. They stood for provocation, anti-art protest and scandal, through ways of expression many times satirical and ironic.

===Futurism===
{{main|Futurism}}

[[Futurism]] was an artistic [[avant garde]] movement that appeared in 1909. It first started as a literary movement, even though most of the participants were painters. In the beginning it also included sculpture, photography, music and cinema. The First World War put an end to the movement, even though in Italy it went on until the 1930s. One of the countries where it had the most impact was Russia.<ref name=":4" /> In 1912 manifestos such as the ''Futurist Sculpture Manifesto'' and the ''Futurist Architecture'' arose, and in 1913 the ''Manifesto of Futurist Lust'' by [[Valentine de Saint-Point]], dancer, writer and French artist. The futurists spread their theories through encounters, meetings and conferences in public spaces, that got close to the idea of a political concentration, with poetry and music-halls, which anticipated performance art.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|title=El Futurismo|url=http://www.ccapitalia.net/?p=1574|publisher=CCapitalia|date=July 14, 2005|access-date=June 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=lex>{{cite book|last1=Lajo Pérez|first1=Rosina|title=Léxico de arte|date=1990|publisher=Akal|location=Madrid – España|isbn=978-84-460-0924-5|page=87}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bróccoli|first1=Betina|title=El futurismo: a cien años de la estética de la velocidad|url=http://argentinainvestiga.edu.ar/noticia.php?titulo=el_futurismo_a_cien_anos_de_la_estetica_de_la_velocidad&id=676|access-date=June 5, 2020|work=Argentina Investiga|date=June 29, 2009}}</ref>

===Bauhaus===
{{main|Bauhaus}}
The [[Bauhaus]], founded in Weimar in 1919, included an experimental performing arts workshops with the goal of exploring the relationship between the body, space, sound and light. The [[Black Mountain College]], founded in the United States by instructors of the original Bauhaus who were exiled by the Nazi Party, continued incorporating experimental performing arts in the scenic arts training twenty years before the events related to the history of performance in the 1960s.<ref>Essers, V., "La modernidad clásica.

===Action painting===
{{main|Action Painting}}
In the 1940s and 1950s, the action painting technique or movement gave artists the possibility of interpreting the canvass as an area to act in, rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in the studio <ref name="cork" /> According to art critic [[Harold Rosenberg]], it was one of the initiating processes of performance art, along with abstract expressionism. [[Jackson Pollock]] is the action painter par excellence, who carried out many of his actions live.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jackson Pollock, el artista de acción|url=https://totenart.com/noticias/jackson-pollock-accion/|access-date=May 20, 2020|work=Totenart|date=2019}}</ref> Names to be highlighted are [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], whose work include abstract and action painting.<ref name=cork>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/action-painting.htm|title=Action Painting Technique: Definition, Characteristics |access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.aspid=9798|title=''The American Action Painters''|last1=Rosenberg|first=Harold|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref><ref name=artsy>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsy.net/gene/action-painting|title=Action Painting Artsy|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref>

===Nouveau réalisme===
{{main|Nouveau réalisme}}
[[Nouveau réalisme]] is another one of the artistic movements cited in the beginnings of performance art. It was a painting movement founded in 1960 by art critic [[Pierre Restany]] and painter [[Yves Klein]], during the first collective exhibition in the Apollinaire Gallery in Milan.  Nouveau réalisme was, along with Fluxus and other groups, one of the many avant garde tendencies of the 1960s. [[Pierre Restany]] created various performance art assemblies in the [[Tate Modern]], amongst other spaces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pierre Restany, 'Modern Magic at the Tate', Studio International, June 1968|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/performance-at-tate/resources/reviews-and-articles/stuart-brisley-pierre-restany-studio-international|work=Tate Modern|date=June 1968|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> Yves Klein is one of the main exponents of the movement. He was a clear pioneer of performance art, with his conceptual pieces like ''Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle'' (1959–62), ''Anthropométries'' (1960), and the photomontage ''Saut dans le vide''.<ref>Hannah Weitemeier ([[Hannah Weitemeier|de]]), ''Yves Klein, 1928–1962: Internacional Klein Blue'' (Cologne, Lisbon, Paris: Taschen, 2001), 8. {{ISBN|3-8228-5842-0}}.</ref><ref>Gilbert Perlein & Bruno Corà (eds) & al., ''Yves Klein: Long Live the Immaterial!''

The members of the group saw the world as an image, from which they took parts and incorporated them into their work; they sought to bring life and art closer together.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oybin|first1=Marina|title=La revolución del color: tras las huellas de Yves Klein|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/la-revolucion-del-color-tras-las-huellas-de-yves-klein-nid1866164|access-date=May 20, 2020|work=La Nación|date=January 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Un salto al vacío.

===Gutai===
{{main|Gutai}}
One of the other movements that anticipated performance art was the Japanese movement [[Gutai]], who made action art or [[happening]]. It emerged in 1955 in the region of [[Kansai]] ([[Kioto|Kyōto]], [[Osaka|Ōsaka]], [[Kōbe]]). The main participants were [[Jirō Yoshihara]], Sadamasa Motonaga, Shozo Shimamoto, Saburō Murakami, Katsuō Shiraga, Seichi Sato, Akira Ganayama and Atsuko Tanaka.<ref name=":5" /> The Gutai group arose after World War II. They rejected capitalist consumerism, carrying out ironic actions with latent aggressiveness (object breaking, actions with smoke). They influenced groups such as Fluxus and artists like [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Wolf Vostell]].<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9937/|title=Everything Is Illuminated|website=NYMag.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= Barnes|first=Rachel|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition= Reprinted.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A Visual Essay on Gutai|journal=Flash Art|date=2012|publisher=Flash Art International|page=111|issue=287|volume=45|issn=0394-1493}}</ref>

=== Land art and performance ===
{{Main|Land art}}
In the late 1960s, diverse [[land art]] artists such as [[Robert Smithson]] or [[Dennis Oppenheim]] created environmental pieces that preceded performance art in the 1970s. Works by conceptual artists from the early 1980s, such as [[Sol LeWitt]], who made mural drawing into a performance act, were influenced by [[Yves Klein]] and other land art artists.<ref>{{cite news|last1=López|first1=Ianko|title=Land Art: el arte de los misterios de la tierra|url=https://www.revistaad.es/arte/articulos/land-art-vueleve/19545|access-date=May 22, 2020|work=AD Magazine|date=November 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elcultural.com/revista/arte/Earth-Art-o-la-naturaleza-en-el-museo/26162|title=Earth Art o la naturaleza en el museo|access-date=June 5, 2020|website=www.elcultural.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/2016/from-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery.html|title=Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959–1971|access-date=June 5, 2020|author=National Gallery of Art}}</ref> Land art is a [[contemporary art]] movement in which the landscape and the artwork are deeply bound. It uses nature as a material (wood, soil, rocks, sand, wind, fire, water, etc.) to intervene on itself. The artwork is generated with the place itself as a starting point. The result is sometimes a junction between sculpture and architecture, and sometimes a junction between sculpture and landscaping that is increasingly taking a more determinant role in contemporary public spaces. When incorporating the artist's body in the creative process, it acquires similarities with the beginnings of performance art.

[[File:Warhol's_Exploding_Plastic_Inevitable_with_Nico.png|thumb|''Exploding Plastic Inevitable'' by Ann Arbor]]

In the 1960s, with the purpose of evolving the generalized idea of art and with similar principles of those originary from [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zurich)|Cabaret Voltaire]] or [[Futurism]], a variety of new works, concepts and a growing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art. Movements clearly differentiated from [[Viennese Actionism]], [[avant garde]] performance art in New York City, [[process art]], the evolution of [[The Living Theatre]] or [[happening]], but most of all the consolidation of the pioneers of performance art.<ref>{{cite web|title=La evolución de la performance desde los 60/70|url=https://diarium.usal.es/mcusa/2011/05/04/la-evolucion-de-la-performance-desde-los-6070/|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca|date=May 4, 2011|access-date=June 5, 2020}}</ref>

=== Viennese actionism ===
{{Main|Viennese Actionism}}

Indirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the Living Theatre and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at La MaMa in New York City. The Living Theatre is a theater company created in 1947 in New York. It is the oldest experimental theatre in the United States.<ref>BECK, J., El Living Theatre, Madrid, Fundamentos, 1974, Pag.255</ref> Throughout its history it has been led by its founders: actress [[Judith Malina]], who had studies theatre with [[Erwin Piscator]], with whom she studied [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s and [[Meyerhold]]'s theory; and painter and poet [[Julian Beck]]. After Beck's death in 1985, the company member Hanon Reznikov became co-director along with Malina. Because it is one of the oldest random theatre or live theatre groups nowadays, it is looked upon by the rest.{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} They understood theatre as a way of life, and the actors lived in a community under libertary{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} principles. It was a theatre campaign dedicated to transformation of the power organization of an authoritarian society and hierarchical structure. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, ''Paradise Now'', was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.<ref>BECK, J., El Living Theatre, Madrid, Fundamentos, 1974, Pag.102</ref>

===Fluxus===
{{Main|Fluxus}}
[[File:Componist John Cage , kop, Bestanddeelnr 934-3585.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[John Cage]], 1988]]

[[Fluxus]], a Latin word that means ''flow'', is a visual arts movement related to music, literature, and dance. Its most active moment was in the 1960s and 1970s. They proclaimed themselves against the traditional artistic object as a commodity and declared themselves a sociological art movement. Fluxus was informally organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–1978). This movement had representation in Europe, the United States and Japan.<ref>Simposio ''Happening, Fluxus y otros comportamientos artísticos de la segunda mitad del siglo XX''. Cáceres, 1999, Editorial Regional de Extremadura, {{ISBN|84-7671-607-9}}.</ref> The Fluxus movement, mostly developed in North America and Europe under the stimulus of [[John Cage]], did not see the avant-garde as a linguistic renovation, but it sought to make a different use of the main art channels that separate themselves from specific language; it tries to be interdisciplinary and to adopt mediums and materials from different fields. Language is not the goal, but the mean for a renovation of art, seen as a global art.<ref>''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.</ref> As well as [[Dada]], Fluxus escaped any attempt for a definition or categorization. As one of the movement's founders, [[Dick Higgins]], stated:

<blockquote>Fluxus started with the work, and then came together, applying the name Fluxus to work which already existed. It was as if it started in the middle of the situation, rather than at the beginning.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9feLztCuQ18 Dick Higgins on Fluxus], interviewed 1986.</ref><ref>Amongst the earliest pieces that would later be published by Fluxus were Brecht's event scores, the earliest of which dated from around 1958/9, and works such as Valoche, which had originally been exhibited in Brecht's solo show 'Toward's Events' at 1959.</ref></blockquote>

[[Robert Filliou]] places Fluxus opposite to conceptual art for its direct, immediate and urgent reference to everyday life, and turns around Duchamp's proposal, who starting from [[Ready-made]], introduced the daily into art, whereas Fluxus dissolved art into the daily, many times with small actions or performances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fluxus|url=https://masdearte.com/movimientos/fluxus/|publisher=Masdearte.com|access-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref>

[[John Cage]] was an American composer, [[Music theory|music theorist]], artist, and philosopher. A pioneer of [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy in music]], [[electroacoustic music]], and [[Extended technique|non-standard use of musical instruments]], Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war [[avant-garde]].

=== Process art ===
{{Main|Process Art}}
[[Process art]] is an [[artistic movement]] where the end product of ''art'' and ''craft'', the ''[[:wikt:objet d’art|objet d’art]]'' ([[work of art]]/[[found object]]), is not the principal focus; the process of its making is one of the most relevant aspects if not the most important one: the gathering, sorting, collating, associating, patterning, and moreover the initiation of actions and proceedings. Process artists saw art as pure human expression. Process art defends the idea that the process of creating the work of art can be an art piece itself. Artist [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] predicated "anti-form", ''process'' and ''time '' over an objectual finished product.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gottlieb|first1=Baruch|title=Los signos vitales del arte procesual|url=http://www.laboralcentrodearte.org/es/recursos/articulos/es-arte-procesual-el-nuevo-cine|publisher=Laboral Centro de Arte|date=2010|access-date=May 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Process Art|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/process-art|publisher=Tate Modern|access-date=June 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Process Art|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/movement/process-art|publisher=Guggenheim|access-date=June 10, 2020}}</ref>

[[Dennis Oppenheim]] was an American [[conceptual art]]ist, performance artist, [[Land art|earth artist]], sculptor and photographer. Dennis Oppenheim's early artistic practice is an epistemological questioning about the nature of art, the making of art and the definition of art: a meta-art which arose when strategies of the Minimalists were expanded to focus on site and context. As well as an aesthetic agenda, the work progressed from perceptions of the physical properties of the gallery to the social and political context, largely taking the form of permanent public sculpture in the last two decades of a highly prolific career, whose diversity could exasperate his critics.<ref name="Taylor">Simon Taylor, ''Dennis Oppenheim, New Works'', Guild Hall Museum, East Hampton, NY: 2001.  {{ISBN|0-933793-53-7}}</ref>

[[Yayoi Kusama]] is a Japanese artist who, throughout her career, has worked with a great variety of media including:sculpture, installation, painting, performance, film, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts; the majority of them exhibited her interest in psychedelia, repetition and patterns.

In the 1970s, artists that had derived to works related to performance art evolved and consolidated themselves as artists with performance art as their main discipline, deriving into installations created through performance, video performance, or collective actions, or in the context of a socio-historical and political context.

=== Video performance ===
In the early 1970s the use of video format by performance artists was consolidated. Some exhibitions by [[Joan Jonas]] and [[Vito Acconci]] were made entirely of video, activated by previous performative processes. In this decade, various books that talked about the use of the means of communication, video and cinema by performance artists, like ''Expanded Cinema'', by Gene Youngblood, were published. One of the main artists who used video and performance, with notorious audiovisual installations, is the South Korean artist [[Nam June Paik]], who in the early 1960s had already been in the Fluxus movement until becoming a media artist and evolving into the audiovisual installations he is known for.

[[Carolee Schneemann]]'s and Robert Whitman's 1960s work regarding their video-performances must be taken into consideration as well. Both were pioneers of performance art, turning it into an independent art form in the early seventies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Youngblood|first1=Gene|title=Expanded Cinema|publisher=A. Dutton|year=1970|location=New York City}}</ref>

[[Joan Jonas]] started to include video in her experimental performances in 1972, while [[Bruce Nauman]] scenified{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} his acts to be directly recorded on video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jochengerz.eu/works/to-call-until-exhaustion|title=To Call Until Exhaustion|access-date=June 12, 2020|publisher=Jochen Gerz}}</ref> Nauman is an American multimedia artist, whose sculptures, videos, graphic work and performances have helped diversify and develop culture from the 1960s on. His unsettling artworks emphasized the conceptual nature of art and the creation process.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bruce Nauman|url = http://www.epdlp.com/pintor.php?id=2689|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> His priority is the idea and the creative process over the end result.

[[Gilbert and George]] are Italian artist Gilbert Proesch and English artist George Passmore, who have developed their work inside conceptual art, performance and body art. They were best known for their live-sculpture acts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ruíz Mantilla|first1=Jesús|title=Gilbert & George amantes, socios, artistas|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2011/04/10/eps/1302416817_850215.html|access-date=June 11, 2020|work=El País|date=April 10, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gilbert and George|url=https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/la-coleccion/artistas/gilbert-and-george|publisher=Guggenheim Bilbao Museo|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> One of their first makings was ''The Singing Sculpture'', where the artists sang and danced "Underneath the Arches", a song from the 1930s. Since then they have forged a solid reputation as live-sculptures, making themselves works of art, exhibited in front of spectators through diverse time intervals. They usually appear dressed in suits and ties, adopting diverse postures that they maintain without moving, though sometimes they also move and read a text, and occasionally they appear in assemblies or artistic installations.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gilbert & George, la vida como obra de arte|url=https://masdearte.com/gilbert-a-george-la-vida-como-obra-de-arte/|access-date=June 11, 2020|work=Masdearte.com|date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> Apart from their sculptures, Gilbert and George have also made pictorial works, collages and photomontages, where they pictured themselves next to diverse objects from their immediate surroundings, with references to urban culture and a strong content; they addressed topics such as sex, race, death and HIV, religion or politics,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Charo|title=El arte para todos de Gilbert & George|url=https://www.diariodesevilla.es/artes_plasticas/arte-Gilbert-George-Brafa_0_1328267542.html|access-date=June 11, 2020|work=Diario de Sevilla|date=February 2019}}</ref> critiquing many times the British government and the established power. The group's most prolific and ambitious work was ''Jack Freak Pictures'', where they had a constant presence of the colors red, white and blue in the Union Jack. Gilbert and George have exhibited their work in museums and galleries around the world, like the Stedelijk van Abbemuseum of [[Eindhoven]] (1980), the Hayward Gallery in London (1987), and the [[Tate Modern]] (2007). They have participated in the Venice Biennale. In 1986 they won the Turner Prize.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gilbert & George: "Intentamos estar lejos del arte para no contaminarnos"|url=http://www.tendenciasdelarte.com/gilbert-george-intentamos-estar-lejos-del-arte-para-contaminarnos/|access-date=June 11, 2020|work=Tendencias}}</ref>

=== Endurance art ===
{{Main|Endurance art}}
Endurance performance art deepens the themes of trance, pain, solitude, deprivation of freedom, isolation or exhaustion.<ref> For artists in endurance performances "[q]uestioning the limits of their bodies," Tatiana A. Koroleva, ''Subversive Body in Performance Art'', ProQuest, 2008, pp. 29, 44–46.</ref> Some of the works, based on the passing of long periods of time are also known as long-durational performances.<ref>Paul Allain, Jen Harvie, ''The Routledge Companion to Theatre and Performance'', Routledge, 2014, p. 221. Other terms include duration art, live art or time-based art.</ref> One of the pioneering artists was [[Chris Burden]] in California since the 1970s.<ref>Michael Fallon, ''Creating the Future: Art and Los Angeles in the 1970s'', Counterpoint, 2014, p. 106: "Burden's performances were so widely observed that they took on a life beyond the artist, helping create a new art genre, 'endurance art'..."</ref> In one of his best known works, ''Five days in a locker'' (1971) he stayed for five days inside a school locker, in ''Shoot'' (1971) he was shot with a firearm, and inhabited for twenty two days a bed inside an art gallery in ''Bed Piece'' (1972).<ref>Emily Anne Kuriyama, [http://ca.complex.com/style/2013/10/chris-burden-art-new-museum/back-to-you "Everything You Need to Know About Chris Burden's Art Through His Greatest Works"], ''Complex'', October 2, 2013.</ref> Another example of endurance artist is Tehching Hsieh.

That is Tehching Hsieh's advice to artists inspired to emulate the five year-long performances he began in the late 1970s."</ref> In ''The House With the Ocean View'' (2003), [[Marina Abramović]] lived silently for twelve days without food.<ref name="McEvilleyApril2003">Thomas McEvilley, "Performing the Present Tense – A recent piece by Marina Abramovic blended endurance art and Buddhist meditation," ''Art in America'', 91(4), April 2003.</ref> [[The Nine Confinements or The Deprivation of Liberty]] is a conceptual endurance artwork of critical content carried out in the years 2013 and 2016. All of them have in common the illegitimate deprivation of freedom.

=== Performance in a political context ===
In the mid 1970s, behind the Iron Curtain, in major Eastern Europe cities such as [[Budapest]], [[Kraków]], Belgrade, [[Zagreb]], [[Novi Sad]] and others, scenic arts of a more experimental content flourished. Against political and social control, different artists who made performance of political content arose. [[Orshi Drozdik]]'s performance series, titled ''Individual Mythology'' 1975/77 and the ''NudeModel'' 1976/77. All her actions were critical of the patriarchal discourse in art and the forced emancipation programme and constructed by the equally patriarchal state.<ref>{{cite web|first=Orsolya|last=Orshi Drozdik|title=Sensuality and Matter|url=http://budapestgaleria.hu/_/en/2018-exhibitions/orsolya-orshi-drozdik-sensuality-and-matter/|publisher=Budapest Gallery|date=September 2018|access-date=June 12, 2020}}</ref> Drozdik showed a pioneer and feminist point of view on both, becoming one of the precursors of this type of critical art in Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Orshi Drozdik|url=https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Orshi-Drozdik/A46119C2D5D34177|date=2016|access-date=June 12, 2020}}</ref> In the 1970s, performance art, due to its fugacity,{{huh|date=July 2020|reason=not an English word}} had a solid presence in the Eastern European avant-garde, specially in Poland and Yugoslavia, where dozens of artists who explored the body conceptually and critically emerged.

=== The Other ===
[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|[[Ulay]] and [[Marina Abramović]], ''The Other'' collective in one of their works]]

In the mid-1976s, [[Ulay]] and [[Marina Abramović]] founded the collective The Other in the city of [[Amsterdam]]. When Abramović and Ulay<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.larazon.es/cultura/20200302/kstisk74snhujjhfd2m76hus2m.html|title=Muere Ulay, el compañero artístico y vital de Marina Abramovic|access-date=March 12, 2020|last=Pajares|first=Gema|date=March 2, 2020|website=La Razón}}</ref> started their collaboration. The main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. This was the start of a decade of collaborative work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/344687-morir-ulay-artista-expareja-abramovic|title=Muere el artista de la 'performance' Ulay, expareja artística y sentimental de Marina Abramovic|access-date=June 12, 2020|date=March 2, 2020|website=RT en Español}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elcultural.com/muere-el-artista-ulay|title=Muere el artista Ulay|access-date=June 12, 2020|date=March 2, 2020|website=El Cultural}}</ref> Both artists were interested in the tradition of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for rituals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/abramovic-rhythm-0-t14875|title='Rhythm 0', Marina Abramovic, 1974|access-date=June 12, 2020|last=Tate|website=Tate}}</ref> In consecuense,{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} they formed a collective named ''The Other''. They dressed and behaved as one, and created a relation of absolute confidence. They created a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for the audience's interaction. In ''Relation in Space'' they ran around the room, two bodies like two planets, meshing masculine and feminine energies into a third component they called "that self".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=traUaknfR5o|title=Marina Abramović y Ulay en La Artista Está Presente – MoMA 2010}}</ref> ''Relation in Movement'' (1976) had the couple driving their car inside the museum, doing 365 spins. A black liquid dripped out of the car, forming a sculpture, and each round represented a year.<ref>kunstwissen.de [https://archive.is/20120909085829/http://www.kunst-wissen.de/fach/f-kuns/o_pm/abramo0.htm ''Marina Abramovic (1946–'']</ref> After this, they created ''Death Self'', where both of them united their lips and inspired the air expired by the other one until they used up all oxygen. Exactly 17 minutes after the start of the performance, both of them fell unconscious, due to their lungs filling with carbon dioxide. This piece explored the idea of the ability of a person to absorb the life out of another one, changing them and destroying them. In 1988, after some years of a tense relationship, Abramović and Ulay decided to make a spiritual travel that would put an end to the collective. They walked along the Great Wall of China, starting on opposite ends and finding each other halfway. Abramović conceived this walk on a dream, and it gave her what she saw as an appropriate and romantic ending to the relationship full of mysticism, energy and attraction.<ref>Gudrun Sachse: [http://www.nzzfolio.ch/www/d80bd71b-b264-4db4-afd0-277884b93470/showarticle/c3aa511b-4a35-46e9-99bc-703d6cfb7141.aspx ''Die Mutter aller Schmerzen'']. In: ''[[NZZ Folio]]'' 1/2007</ref> Ulay started on the Gobi dessert and Abramovic in the Yellow sea. Each one of them walked 2500 kilometres, found each other in the middle and said goodbye.

=== Main artists ===
In 1973, [[Laurie Anderson]] interpreted ''Duets on Ice'' in the streets of New York. [[Marina Abramović]], in the performance ''Rhythm 10'', included conceptually the violation of a body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/rhythm-10-2/|title=Marina Abramović Rhythm 10|access-date=June 11, 2020|publisher=Media Art Net}}</ref> Thirty years later, the topic of rape, chame and sex exploitation would be reimagined in the works of contemporary artists such as ''Clifford Owens'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2012/03/09/this_sunday_ps1_may_or_may_not_host.php|title=This Sunday MoMA PS1 May Or May Not Host A "Performance Art Rape"|work=[[Gothamist]]|date=March 9, 2012|first=Jen|last=Carlson|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> ''Gillian Walsh'', ''Pat Oleszko'' and ''Rebecca Patek,'' amongst others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/arts/dance/the-margins-of-a-form-are-increasingly-not-where-they-used-to-be.html?smid=fb-share&_r=0|title=The Margins of a Form Are, Increasingly, Not Where They Used to Be|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 30, 2013|first=Gia|last=Kourlas|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> New artists with radical acts consolidated themselves as the main precursors of performance, like [[Chris Burden]], with the 1971 work ''Shoot'', where an assistant shot him in the arm from a five-meter distance, and [[Vito Acconci]] the same year with ''Seedbed''. The work ''Eye Body'' (1963) by Carolee Schneemann en 1963, had already been considered a prototipe of performance art. In 1975, Schneemann recurred to innovative solo acts such as ''Interior Scroll'', that showed the feminine body as an artistic media.

One of the main artists was [[Gina Pane]],<ref name = OAO>{{cite web|title=Panel, Gina|url = http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T065032|website=Oxford Art Online|access-date=June 11, 2020}}</ref> French artist of Italian origins.

''The Conditioning '' was created as an homage to [[Marina Abramović]], part of her ''Seven Easy Pieces''(2005) in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City in 2005. Great part of her works are protagonized by self-inflicted pain, separating her from most of other woman artists in the 1970s. Through the violence of cutting her skin with razors or extinguishing fires with her bare hands and feet, Pane has the intention of inciting a ''real experience'' in the visitor, who would feel moved for its discomfort.<ref name="OAO"/> The impactful nature of these first performance art pieces or actions, as she preferred to call them, many times eclipsed her prolific photographic and sculptural work. Nonetheless, the body was the main concern in Panes's work, either literally or conceptually.

== 1980s ==
=== The technique of performance art ===
Until the 1980s, performance art has demystified virtuosism,{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} this being one of its key characteristics. Nonetheless, from the 1980s on it started to adopt some technical brilliancy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Banes|first1=Sally|title=Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|year=1998|location=New York City|pages=120, 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&q=1980s+performance+art&pg=PA10|access-date=March 23, 2011|isbn=0-472-09678-8}}</ref> In reference to the work ''Presence and Resistance''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Auslander|first1=Philip|title=Presence and Resistance: Postmodernism and Cultural politics in Contemporary American Performance|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1992|location=Ann Arbour|pages=64–65, 78–79}}</ref> by Philip Auslander, the dance critic Sally Banes writes, "... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; mass culture, especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including Laurie Anderson, Spalding Gray, Eric Bogosian, Willem Dafoe, and Ann Magnuson, had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Banes|first1=Sally|title=Subversive expectations: performance art and paratheater in New York, 1976–85|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|year=1998|location=New York City|pages=10, 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdrVYfkAm6IC&q=1980s+performance+art&pg=PA10|access-date=March 23, 2011|isbn=0-472-09678-8}}</ref> In this decade the parameters and technicalities built to purify and perfect performance art were defined.

=== Critique and investigation of performance art ===
Despite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, [[Roselee Goldberg]] notes in ''Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present'' that "performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise." In this decade, publications and compilations about performance art and its best known artists emerged.

=== Performance art from a political context ===
In the 1980s, the political context played an important role in the artistic development and especially in performance, as almost every one of the works created with a critical and political discourse were in this discipline. Until the decline of the European Eastern bloc during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or was covered as another activity, like a photo-shoot. Isolated from the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible|title=Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe|access-date=March 1, 2011|last=Zajanckauska|first=Zane|author2=Interview with Ieva Astahovska|publisher=map – media archive performance}}</ref> Amongst the most remarkable performance art works of political content in this time were those of [[Tehching Hsieh]] between July 1983 and July 1984, ''Art/Life: One Year Performance'' (Rope Piece).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | title = Reclaiming the Invisible Past of Eastern Europe | access-date = March 23, 2011 | last = Zajanckauska | first = Zane | author2 = Interview with Ieva Astahovska | publisher = map – media archive performance | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110416151339/http://perfomap.de/current/kart/reclaiming-the-invisible | archive-date = April 16, 2011 }}</ref>

=== Performance poetry ===
In 1982 the terms "poetry" and "performance" were first used together. [[Performance poetry]] appeared to distinguish text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of escenic{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} and musical performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. Many artists since [[John Cage]] fuse performance with a poetical base.

=== Feminist performance art ===

[[File:Benglis from Arti.jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Linda Benglis, 1974]]
[[File:Andres+Pina+Matthias wiki.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Pina Bausch]], 1985]]

Since 1973 the Feminist Studio Workshop in the Woman's Building of Los Ángeles had an impact in the wave of feminist acts, but until 1980 they did not completely fuse. The conjunction between feminism and performance art progressed through the last decade. In the first two decades of performance art development, works that had not been conceived as feminist are seen as such now.{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}}

Still, not until 1980 did artists self-define themselves as feminists. Artist groups in which women influenced by the 1968 student movement as well as the feminist movement stood out.<ref>{{Cite publication|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2001/AlcazarJosefina.pdf|title=Mujeres y performance.

Special mention to the works created with feminine and feminist corporeity{{clarification needed|date=October 2020}} such as Lynda Benglis and her phallic performative actions, who reconstructed the feminine image to turn it into more than a fetish. Through feminist performance art the body becomes a space for developing these new discourses and meanings. Artist [[Eleanor Antin]], creator in the 1970s and 1980s, worked on the topics of gender, race and class. [[Cindy Sherman]], in her first works in the seventies and already in her artistic maturity in the eighties, continues her critical line of overturning the imposed self, through her use of the body as an object of privilege.

[[File:Hallway in the Wexner Center for the Arts.jpg|thumb|Exhibition by [[Cindy Sherman]] in the United States]]

[[Cindy Sherman]] is an American photographer and artist. She is one of the most representative post-war artists and exhibited more than the work of three decades of her work in the [[MoMA]]. Even though she appears in most of her performative photographies, she doesn't consider them slef-portraits. Sherman uses herself as a vehicle to represent a great array of topics of the contemporary world, such as the part women play in our society and the way they are represented in the media as well as the nature of art creation. In 2020 she was awarded with the ''Wolf prize in arts''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wolffund.org.il/2020/01/13/cindy-sherman/|title=Cindy Sherman|access-date=January 20, 2020|date=January 13, 2020|website=Wolf Foundation}}</ref>

[[Judy Chicago]] is an artist and pioneer of feminist art and performance art in the United States. Chicago is known for her big collaborative art installation pieces on images of birth and creation, that examin women's part in history and culture. In the 1970s, Chicago has founded the first feminist art programme in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills such as sewing, in contrast with skills that required a lot of workforce, like welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's best known work is ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', that was permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art in the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. ''The Dinner Party'' celebrated the achievements of women throughout history and is widely considered as the first epic feminist artwork. Other remarkable projects include ''International Honor Quilt'', ''The Birth Project,''<ref>{{Cite book|edition= 1st|title=The birth project|publisher=Doubleday|date=1985|isbn=0385187106|oclc=11159627|first=Chicago, Judy|last=1939-}}</ref> ''Powerplay,''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Judy Chicago : reviewing powerplay|publisher=David Richard Gallery|date=2012|isbn=9780983931232|oclc=841601939|first1=Chicago, Judy|last1=1939-|first2=David Richard|last2=Gallery.}}</ref> and ''The Holocaust Project.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holocaust project : from darkness into light|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/27145289|publisher=Penguin Books|date=1993|access-date=June 8, 2020|isbn=0140159916|oclc=27145289|first=Chicago, Judy|last=1939-}}</ref>

=== Expansion to Latin America ===
In this decade performance art spread until reaching Latin America through the workshops and programmes that universities and academic institutions offered. It mainly developed in Mexico, Colombia -with artists such as ''Maria Teresa Hincapié''—, in Brasil and in Argentina.<ref name=":0" />

She has developed concepts such as "conduct art" to define her artistic practices with a focus on the limits of language and the body confronted to the reaction and behavior of the spectators. She also came up with "useful art", that is ought to transform certain political and legal aspects of society. Brugera's work revolves around power and control topics, and a great portion of her work questions the current state of her home country, Cuba. In 2002 she created the Cátedra Arte de Conducta in La Habana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taniabruguera.com/cms/608-0-GLOSSARY.htm|title=Glosario|access-date=May 27, 2020|author=Tania Bruguera}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pinto|first=Roberto|title=Ejercicio de Resistencia Tania Bruguera|year=2003|publisher=Torino|location=Turin, Italy|page=25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pinto|first=Roberto|title=Ejercicio de Resistencia Tania Bruguera|year=2003|publisher=Galeria Soffiantino|location=Turin, Italy|pages=25–26}}</ref>

The 1990s was a period of absence for classic European performance, so performance artists kept a low profile. Nevertheless, Eastern Europe experienced a peak. On the other hand, Latin American performance continued to boom, as well as feminist performance art. There also was a peak of this discipline in Asian countries, whose motivation emerged from the [[Butō]] dance in the 1950s, but in this period they professionalized and new Chinese artists arose, earning great recognition. There was also a general professionalization in the increase of exhibitions dedicated to performance art, at the opening of the Venice Art Biennial to performance art, where various artists of this discipline have won the Leone d'Oro, including [[Anne Imhof]], [[Regina José Galindo]] or [[Santiago Sierra]].

=== Performance with political context ===
While the [[Soviet Bloc]] dissolved, some forbidden performance art pieces began to spread. Young artists from the former Eastern Bloc, including Russia, devoted themselves to performance art. Scenic arts emerged around the same time in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. "In these contexts, performance art became a new critical voice with a social strength similar to that of Western Europe, the United States and South America in the sixties and early seventies. It must be emphasized that the rise of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba and other places must not be considered secondary or an imitation of the West".<ref name="Montano">{{cite book|last1=Montano|first1=Linda M.|title=Performance artists talking in the eighties|publisher=University of California Press Berkeley|year=2000|location=Los Angeles, London|pages=479, 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Bl6wm-cV_oC&q=performance+art+1990s&pg=PA479|access-date=March 31, 2011|isbn=0-520-21022-0}}</ref>

=== Professionalization of performance art ===
In the Western World, in the 1990s, performance art joined the mainstream culture. Diverse performance artworks, live, photographed or through documentation started to become part of galleries and museums that began to understand performance art as an art discipline.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Targ Brill|first1=Marlene|title=America in the 1990s|publisher=Lerner Publishing Group|year=2009|pages=93, 1|location=Minneapolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNXeIFQScocC&q=performance|access-date=March 11, 2011|isbn=978-0-8225-7603-7}}</ref> Nevertheless, it was not until the next decade that a major institutionalization happened, when every museum started to incorporate performance art pieces into their collections and dedicating great exhibitions and retrospectives, museums such as the la [[Tate Modern]] in London, the [[MoMA]] in New York City or the [[Pompidou Centre]] in Paris. From the 1990s on, many more performance artists were invited to important biennials like the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[Sao Paulo Biennial]] and the [[Lyon]] Biennial.

In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, a number of artists incorporated technologies such as the World Wide Web, digital video, webcams, and streaming media, into performance artworks.<ref>Steve Dixon, ''Digital Performance: A History of New Media in Theater, Dance, Performance Art, and Installation'' (MIT Press, 2015), pp. 157ff. and pp. 457ff.</ref> Artists such as [[Coco Fusco]], [[Shu Lea Cheang]], and [[Prema Murthy]] produced performance art that drew attention to the role of gender, race, colonialism, and the body in relation to the Internet.<ref>Kelly Dennis, "Gendered Ghosts in the Globalized Machine: Coco Fusco and Prema Murthy,” ''Paradoxa: International Feminist Art Journal'', Vol. 23 (2009), pp. 79–86.
