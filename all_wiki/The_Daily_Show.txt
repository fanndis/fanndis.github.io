'''''The Daily Show'''''<!--The page hasn't been broken up by tenures yet. At this point, it's one article that covers all three incarnations, not just the current one. Therefore this should remain simply as "The Daily Show"--> is an American [[late-night talk show|late-night talk]] and [[news satire]] television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]]. Describing itself as a fake news program, ''The Daily Show'' draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses [[self-referential humor]] as well.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Michelle C.|last1=Newman|url=http://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/academics/communications/research/vol1no2/01NewmanEJFall10.pdf|title=The Daily Show and Meta-Coverage: How Mock News Covers the Political Communications System|journal=The Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research in Communications|volume=1|number=2|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>

The half-hour-long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was first hosted by [[Craig Kilborn]] until December 17, 1998. [[Jon Stewart]] then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on [[political satire]] and [[news satire]], in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart was succeeded by [[Trevor Noah]], whose tenure premiered on September 28, 2015.  Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as ''The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn'' from 1996 to 1998, ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' from 1999 until 2015, and ''The Daily Show with Trevor Noah'' since 2015. ''The Daily Show'' is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 24 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-st-emmy-nominations-live-updates-emmy-nominations-the-diminished-1468520690-htmlstory.html|title=Emmy nominations: The diminished presence of 'The Daily Show' in the variety/talk series category|last=Barton|first=Chris|date=July 15, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref>

The program is popular among young audiences. The [[Pew Research Center]] suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4% who said the same of [[CNN]].<ref name=people-press.org>{{cite web|author=Publications|url=http://people-press.org/2010/09/12/americans-spending-more-time-following-the-news|title=Americans spending more time watching the news|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=September 12, 2010|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> 

Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other ''Daily Show'' writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]'' picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.
{{TOC limit}}

==Format==
===Opening segment===
Each episode begins with announcer Drew Birns announcing the date and the introduction, "From Comedy Central's World News Headquarters in New York, this is ''The Daily Show with Trevor Noah''{{-"}}.<ref name=dailynews/><ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156883 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720205702/http://www.backstage.com/bso/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003156883 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |title=Drew Birns, Voiceover Artist |work=Back Stage |date=September 25, 2006 |access-date=July 15, 2008}}</ref> Previously, the introduction was "This is ''The Daily Show'', the most important television program, ever." The host then opens the show with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. Previously, the show had divided its news commentary into sections known as "Headlines", "Other News", and "This Just In"; these titles were dropped from regular use on October 28, 2002, and were last used on March 6, 2003. Some episodes will begin with a 1–3 minute intro on a small story (or small set of stories) before fully transitioning into the main story of the night.

===Correspondent segments===
The monologue segment is often followed by a segment featuring an exchange with a correspondent, either at the anchor desk with the host or reporting from a false location in front of a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] showing stock footage. They typically present absurd or humorously exaggerated takes on current events against the host's [[Double act|straight man]]. Some correspondent segments involve the show's members travelling to different locations to file comedic reports on current news stories and conduct interviews with people related to the featured issue.

Correspondents are typically introduced as the show's "senior" specialist in the story's subject, and can range from relatively general (such as Senior Political Analyst) to absurdly specific (such as Senior Religious Registry Correspondent). The cast of correspondents is quite diverse, and many often sarcastically portray extreme [[stereotypes]] of themselves to poke fun at a news story, such as "Senior Latino Correspondent", "Senior Youth Correspondent" or "Senior Black Correspondent".
[[File:John Oliver Wyatt Cenac hug Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Former correspondents [[John Oliver]] and [[Wyatt Cenac]] at the launch of ''[[Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'']]
While correspondents stated to be reporting abroad are usually performing in-studio in front of a greenscreen background, on rare occasions, cast members have recorded pieces on location. For instance, during the week of August 20, 2007, the show aired a series of segments called "Operation Silent Thunder: The Daily Show in Iraq" in which correspondent [[Rob Riggle]] reported from Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff writer|url=http://business.highbeam.com/4130/article-1G1-168145932/green-screen-green-zone-daily-show-goes-iraq-real-and|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315121231/http://business.highbeam.com/4130/article-1G1-168145932/green-screen-green-zone-daily-show-goes-iraq-real-and|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 15, 2012|title=From Green Screen to Green Zone: 'Daily Show' Goes to Iraq&nbsp;– for Real&nbsp;– And Airs First Report|work=Editor & Publisher|date=August 20, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2010}}</ref> In August 2008, Riggle traveled to China for a series of segments titled "Rob Riggle: [[Chasing the dragon|Chasing the Dragon]]", which focused on the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bauder, David|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/1120579_Rob_Riggle_s_off_the_hook_in_China|title=Rob Riggle's off the hook in China|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=August 11, 2008|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}</ref> 

[[Jason Jones (actor)|Jason Jones]] traveled to Iran in early June 2009 to report on the Iranian elections, and [[John Oliver]] traveled to South Africa for the series of segments "Into Africa" to report on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In March 2012, Oliver traveled to Gabon, on the west African coast, to report on the Gabonese government's decision to donate $2 million to [[UNESCO]] after the United States cut its funding for UNESCO earlier that year. On July 19, 2016, [[Roy Wood Jr.]] reported live from the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] and talked about [[Donald Trump]]'s African-American support.

Topics have varied widely; during the early years of the show they tended toward character-driven human interest stories such as [[Bigfoot]] enthusiasts. Since Stewart began hosting in 1999, the focus of the show has become more political and the field pieces have come to more closely reflect current issues and debates.<ref name="Colbert interview"/> Under Kilborn and the early years of Stewart, most interviewees were either unaware or not entirely aware of the comedic nature of ''The Daily Show''. However, as the show began to gain popularity—particularly following its coverage of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]] presidential elections—most of the subjects now interviewed are aware of the comedic element.<ref name=Larris/>

===Recurring segments===
{{Main|List of The Daily Show recurring segments}}
[[List of The Daily Show recurring segments|Some segments]] have recurred periodically throughout different tenures, such as "Back in Black" (segments hosted by comedian [[Lewis Black]]) & "Your Moment of Zen". Since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], a common segment of the show has been dubbed "[[Mesopotamia|Mess O' Potamia]]", focusing on the United States' policies in the Middle East, especially Iraq.<ref name=Kurtz>{{cite news|author=Kurtz, Howard|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55440-2004Oct22.html|title=The Campaign of a Comedian|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 23, 2004|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref> Elections in the United States were a prominent focus in the show's "Indecision" coverage throughout Stewart & Noah's time as host (the title "InDecision" is a parody of [[NBC News]]' "Decision" segment). Since 2000, under Stewart's tenure, the show went on the road to record week-long specials from the cities hosting the [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[Republican National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-03-18-jon-stewart_x.htm|title=Jon Stewart to remain at 'Daily Show'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> For the [[2006 United States general elections|2006 U.S. midterm elections]], a week of episodes was recorded in the contested state of [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-08-25-daily-ohio_x.htm|title='Daily Show' to take road trip to Ohio|work=USA Today|date=August 25, 2006|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> The "Indecision" & "Democalpyse" coverage of the 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 elections all culminated in live [[Election Day (United States)|Election Night]] specials.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/08/05/candidates-daily-show.html|title=Comedic campaign stop: Presidential candidates hit The Daily Show|publisher=CBC News|date=August 5, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref>

With Noah as host, one new recurring segment has been "What the Actual Fact", with correspondent [[Desi Lydic]] examining statements made by political figures during speeches or events. Under Noah, the continuation of "Democalypse" and "Indecision" also took place with live shows after the [[Republican National Convention]] and [[Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/2016-republican-national-convention-jon-stewart-daily-show-comedy-central-trevor-noah-rnc-1201817850/|title=Looking Back at 20 Years of 'The Daily Show' — and Its First RNC In Years Without Jon Stewart|publisher=Variety|date=July 20, 2016|accessdate=October 6, 2016}}</ref> For the first time, under Noah, the show also went live after all three [[United States presidential debates, 2016|U.S. presidential debates]] in 2016.

===Interviews===
In the show's third act, the host conducts an interview with a celebrity guest. Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes, pundits, policy experts and political figures.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2006/12/03/dailyshow-karlin-leaves.html|title=Executive producer quits The Daily Show, Colbert Report|publisher=CBC News|date=December 3, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> During Stewart's tenure, the show's guests tended away from celebrities and more towards non-fiction authors and political pundits, as well as many prominent elected officials.<ref name=Kurtz/> In the show's earlier years it struggled to book high-profile politicians. (In 1999, for an ''Indecision 2000'' segment, [[Steve Carell]] struggled to talk his way off Republican candidate [[John McCain]]'s press overflow bus and onto the [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|Straight Talk Express]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
However its rise in popularity, particularly following the show's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 elections, made Stewart according to a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' (2006) article, "the hot destination for anyone who wants to sell books or seem hip, from presidential candidates to military dictators". ''[[Newsweek]]'' labeled it "the coolest pit stop on television".<ref>{{cite news|author=Dowd, Maureen|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors|title=America's Anchors|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 31, 2006|accessdate=August 26, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818095819/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors|archivedate=August 18, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="most trusted" />

Prominent political guests have included U.S. President [[Barack Obama]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/27/AR2010102709035.html | last = Milbank | first = Dana |title=On the Daily Show, Obama is the last laugh|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Vice President [[Joe Biden]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2009/11/17/2009-11-17_police_car_ahead_of_joe_bidens_motorcade_crashes_on_way_to_film_daily_show_with_.html|title=Vice President Joe Biden provides few laughs, gaffes on 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> former Presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former British Prime Ministers [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], former Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]], former Liberian President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]], Jordanian King [[Abdullah II]], Estonian Prime Minister [[Taavi Roivas]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] and former Mexican President [[Vicente Fox]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Agencies|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tony-blair-faces-daily-shows-smiling-inquisition-935635.html|title=Tony Blair faces Daily Show's smiling inquisition|work=The Independent|date=September 19, 2008|accessdate=November 18, 2008|location=London}}</ref> 

The show has played host to former and current members of the Administration and Cabinet as well as members of Congress. Numerous presidential candidates have appeared on the show during their campaigns, including [[John McCain]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/obama-makes-time-again-daily-show-wbna27421868|title=Obama makes time again for 'The Daily Show'|publisher=[[Today.com]]|date=October 28, 2008|accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref>

===Closing segment===
In a closing segment, there is a brief segue to the closing credits in the form of the host introducing "[[List of The Daily Show recurring segments#Your Moment of Zen (July 22, 1996 – Present)|Your Moment of Zen]]", a humorous piece of video footage without commentary that has been part of the show's wrap-up since the series began in 1996.<ref name=zen>{{cite news|author=Scott, A. O.|author-link=A. O. Scott|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/weekinreview/31scott.html|title=Caught Off Message|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 31, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> The segment often relates to a story covered earlier in the episode, but occasionally is merely a humorous or ridiculous clip. Occasionally, the segment is used as a tribute to someone who has died.<ref>{{cite news|last=Courneen|first=Trevor|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/15-great-moments-of-zen-from-the-daily-show.html|title=15 Great "Moments of Zen" from ''The Daily Show''|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=March 3, 2015|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

Sometimes, before the "Your Moment of Zen", this segment is used for quick promotions. The host might promote the show that follows right after their broadcast, such as promoting the show ''[[@midnight]]''. This time has also been used to promote films, books or stand-up specials that are affiliated with the host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/rbfbxt/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-moment-of-zen----do-unto-animals----a-death-stare-for-chris-christie|title=Moment of Zen - "Do Unto Animals" & A Death Stare for Chris Christie-The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - Video Clip - Comedy Central|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/oi8z9k/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-november-17--2016---george-packer---q-tip-season-22-ep-22027|title=November 17, 2016 - George Packer & Q-Tip|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/full-episodes/oi8z9k/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-november-17--2016---george-packer---q-tip-season-22-ep-22027|title=NOVEMBER 17, 2016 - GEORGE PACKER & Q-TIP (20:30)|work=The Daily Show|date=November 17, 2016|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}</ref>

In October 2005, following ''The Colbert Report''{{'s}} premiere, a new feature (sometimes referred to as the toss) was added to the closing segment in which Stewart would have a short exchange with "our good friend, [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] at ''[[The Colbert Report]]''", which aired immediately after. The two would have a scripted comedic exchange via split-screen from their respective sets. In 2007, the "toss" was cut back to twice per week, and by 2009 was once a week before gradually being phased out. It was used on the 2014 mid-term election night and again just before the [[The final episode of The Colbert Report|final episode]] of ''The Colbert Report'' on December 18, 2014, and returned upon the premiere of ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''. Stewart then regularly tossed to Wilmore at the end of his Monday night episodes. Under Noah, the "toss" has been used for ''[[The Opposition with Jordan Klepper]]'' and ''[[Lights Out with David Spade]]''.

== Studio ==
[[File:Daily Show studio.JPG|thumb|left|Outside of the ''Daily Show'' studio, pictured in 2007, during Stewart's tenure]]
The host sits at his desk on the [[podium|elevated island stage]] in the style of a traditional news show. The show relocated from its original New York studio in late-1998 to [[NEP Broadcasting|NEP]] Studio 54 in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, where it remained until 2005, when the studio was claimed by ''The Colbert Report''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Huff, Richard|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-08-11/entertainment/18079925_1_daily-show-cbs-insiders-tom-snyder|title=Jon Stewart to Anchor 'Daily Show' Comedy Central Names Comic as Craig Kilborn's Replacement|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location = New York |date=August 11, 1998|accessdate=July 31, 2008}}</ref> On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.<ref>{{cite web|author=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Colbert set for 'Daily Show' spinoff|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=September 10, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>
The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a "Bring Back the Couch" campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by ''Daily Show'' contributor [[Bob Wiltfong]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Stevens, Dana|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122505|title=Talk Show Feng Shui|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Susman, Gary|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2005/07/daily_show_scan.html|title='Daily Show' scandal: That new set|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 20, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref> The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ebenkamp, Becky|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682113-1.html|title=The Biz: Food Net Unwraps Pop Secrets; Stewart's Sofa Sent to Suburbia|work=Brandweek|date=June 30, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106100635/http://www.allbusiness.com/marketing-advertising/branding-brand-development/4682113-1.html|archivedate=January 6, 2009}}</ref>

On April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sandberg, Marian |url=http://livedesignonline.com/venues/daily_dose/ |title=Daily Dose |work=Live Design |date=July 1, 2007 |accessdate=July 6, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418104606/http://livedesignonline.com/venues/daily_dose/ |archivedate=April 18, 2008 }}</ref>

On September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of [[Trevor Noah]]'s tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart's set.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dillon, Dak|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/2015/10/01/inside-the-daily-show-set-design-evolution/|title=Inside 'The Daily Show' set design evolution|work=NewscastStudio|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}</ref> A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter.

The show's writers begin each day with a morning meeting where they review material that researchers have gathered from major newspapers, the [[Associated Press]], [[United States cable news|cable news]] television channels and websites, and discuss headline material for the lead news segment. Throughout the morning they work on writing deadline pieces inspired by recent news, as well as longer-term projects.

== History ==
===Craig Kilborn's tenure (1996–98)===
''The Daily Show'' was created by [[Lizz Winstead]] and Madeleine Smithberg<ref name="Smithberg IMDb">{{imdb name|810431}}</ref> and premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, having been marketed as a replacement for ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' (a successful Comedy Central program that had moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] earlier that year).<ref>{{cite web|author=Lambert, Brian|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/060897.html|title="Daily Show" is Morning Drive Radio for TV|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=June 8, 1997|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Madeleine Smithberg was co-creator of ''The Daily Show'' as well as the former [[executive producer]]. A graduate of [[Binghamton University]], she was an executive producer of ''[[Steve Harvey's Big Time]]'' and a [[celebrity|talent]] coordinator for ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''.<ref name="Smithberg IMDb"/>

Aiming to parody conventional newscasts, it featured a comedic monologue of the day's headlines from anchor [[Craig Kilborn]] (a well-known co-anchor of [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]''), as well as [[mockumentary]] style on-location reports, in-studio segments and debates from regular correspondents Winstead, [[Brian Unger]], [[Beth Littleford]], and [[A. Whitney Brown]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Grimes, William|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/09/tv/wringing-laughs-from-the-real-world.html |title=Wringing Laughs From the Real World|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 9, 1997|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref>

====Common segments====
[[List of The Daily Show recurring segments#Past recurring Kilborn-era segments|Common segments]] included "This Day in [[David Hasselhoff|Hasselhoff]] History" and "Last Weekend's Top-Grossing Films, Converted into [[Italian lira|Lira]]", in parody of entertainment news shows and their tendency to lead out to commercials with trivia such as celebrity birthdays.<ref>{{cite news|author=James, Caryn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/arts/a-parody-of-shows-covering-pop-news.html |title=A Parody Of Shows Covering Pop News|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 1, 1996|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Another commercial lead-out featured Winstead's parents, on her answering machine, reading that day's "[[Final Jeopardy!]]" question and answer.<ref>LaVecchia, Olivia.

====Differences between Kilborn's version and Stewart's version====
The show was much less politically focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor.<ref name="Colbert interview"/> Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics".<ref>{{cite web|author=Winstead, Lizz|url=http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2008/04/qa_with_daily_show_creator_liz.php|title=Q&A With Daily Show Creator Lizz Winstead|work=Westword|date=April 23, 2008|accessdate=July 9, 2008}}</ref> The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged by some of the show's cast.{{by whom|date=February 2017}} Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before you got on the plane to do one of these pieces."<ref>{{cite web|author=Thompson, Stephen|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/the-daily-shows-stephen-colbert-rob-corddry-ed-hel-13795|title=Interview: The Daily Show's Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, and Mo Rocca|work=The A.V.

Bereft of an ideological or artistic center, the show is precocious but empty.}}</ref>

====Craig Kilborn's departure====
There were reports of backstage friction between Kilborn and some of the female staff, particularly the show's co-creator [[Lizz Winstead]]. Winstead had not been involved in the hiring of Kilborn, and disagreed with him over what direction the show should take. "I spent eight months developing and staffing a show and seeking a tone with producers and writers. Somebody else put him in place. There were bound to be problems. I viewed the show as content-driven; he viewed it as host-driven", she said.<ref>{{cite web|author=C.J.|url=http://members.tripod.com/~lizzland/news/020898a.html|title=Winstead walks over crude quips|work=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=February 8, 1998|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> In a 1997 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine interview, Kilborn made a sexually explicit joke about Winstead. [[Comedy Central]] responded by suspending Kilborn without pay for one week, and Winstead quit soon after.<ref>{{cite news|author=Carter, Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/17/arts/tv-notes-comedy-host-in-hot-water.html |title=TV Notes; Comedy Host In Hot Water|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 17, 1997|accessdate=May 2, 2014|quote=In a quote that was labeled a joke in the article, but which had none of the female members of the show's staff laughing, Mr. Kilborn called Ms. Winstead and other women on the show a derogatory name and then suggested that she liked him and would perform a sex act on him if he wanted her to.}}</ref>

In 1998, Kilborn left ''The Daily Show'' to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on CBS's ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. He claimed the "Five Questions" interview segment as intellectual property, disallowing any future ''Daily Show'' hosts from using it in their interviews.<ref>{{cite news|author=James, Caryn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/01/arts/television-review-an-echo-of-daily-show-on-late-late.html |title=Television Review; An Echo of 'Daily Show' on 'Late Late'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1999|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Correspondents Brian Unger and A.

Whitney Brown, evolved into the similar pieces of "This Week in God" and [[Stephen Colbert]] and [[Steve Carell]]'s "Even Stevphen". After the change, a number of new features were developed. The ending segment "Your Moment of Zen", previously consisting of a random selection of humorous videos, was diversified to sometimes include recaps or extended versions of news clips shown earlier in the show.<ref name=zen /> The show's theme music, "Dog on Fire" by [[Bob Mould]], was re-recorded by [[They Might Be Giants]] shortly after Stewart joined the show.<ref>{{cite web|author=Menconi, David|url=http://blogsarchive.newsobserver.com/beat/index.php?m=20061104|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181211/http://blogsarchive.newsobserver.com/beat/index.php?m=20061104|archivedate=2009-01-13|title=The fine print of truthiness|work=[[The News & Observer]]|date=November 4, 2006|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Leopold, Todd|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/12/tmbg/|title=They Might Be Giants: It's OK to call us whatever|publisher=CNN|date=April 12, 2001|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}</ref>

Stewart served not only as host but also as a writer and executive producer of the series.  He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Chris| title=The Daily Show (The Book): An Oral History As Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests |location=New York |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4555-6538-2|pages=5–6}}</ref> Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of ''[[The Onion]]'' [[Ben Karlin]] who, along with fellow ''Onion'' contributor [[David Javerbaum]], joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things "[started] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that you know they don't believe."<ref name=Larris>{{cite web|author=Larris, Rachel|url=http://cct.georgetown.edu/research/thesisdatabase/RachelLarris.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824055203/http://cct.georgetown.edu/research/thesisdatabase/RachelLarris.pdf|archivedate=2009-08-24|title=The Daily Show Effect: Humor, News, Knowledge and Viewers|publisher=Georgetown University|date=May 2, 2005|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Dailyshow logo.svg|250px|thumb|left|Logo used for Stewart's tenure]]
Under Stewart and Karlin ''The Daily Show'' developed a markedly different style, bringing a sharper political focus to the humor than the show previously exhibited. Then-correspondent Stephen Colbert recalls that Stewart specifically asked him to have a political viewpoint, and to allow his passion for issues to carry through into his comedy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gross, Terry|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title=A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|work=Fresh Air|date=January 20, 2005|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Colbert says that whereas under Kilborn the focus was on "human interest-y" pieces, with Stewart as host the show's content became more "issues and news driven", particularly after the beginning of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]] campaign with which the show dealt in its "[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]" coverage.<ref name="Colbert interview">{{cite web|author=Plume, Ken|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/11/an-interview-with-stephen-colbert|title=An Interview with Stephen Colbert|publisher=IGN|date=August 11, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Jacqueline|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title=So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=July 4, 2008}}</ref> Stewart himself describes the show's coverage of the [[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida|2000 election recount]] as the point at which the show found its editorial voice. "That's when I think we tapped into the emotional angle of the news for us and found our editorial footing," he says.<ref>{{cite news|author=Flaherty, Mike|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998822.html |title=Stewart has real flair for fake news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Following the [[September 11th attacks]], ''The Daily Show'' went off the air for nine days. Upon its return, Stewart opened the show with a somber monologue, that, according to Jeremy Gillick and Nonna Gorilovskaya, addressed both the absurdity and importance of his role as a comedian. Commented Stewart:

{{quotation|They said to get back to work, and there were no jobs available for a man in the fetal position. . . . We sit in the back and we throw spitballs&nbsp;– never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. . . . The view from my apartment was the World Trade Center. Now it's gone. They attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity and strength and labor and imagination and commerce and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The Statue of Liberty. The view from the south of Manhattan is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.<ref name="Moment" />|Jon Stewart, Thursday, September 20, 2001, broadcast}}

Gillick and Gorilovskaya point to the September 11 attacks and the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as the point at which Jon Stewart emerged as a trusted national figure. Robert Thompson, the director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, recalled of this period, "When all the news guys were walking on eggshells, Jon was hammering those questions about WMDs."<ref name="Moment">{{cite journal|last1=Gillick |first1=Jeremy |last2=Gorilovskaya |first2=Nonna |name-list-style=amp |url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2008/12/JonStewart.html |title=Meet Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz (aka) Jon Stewart: The Wildly Zeitgeisty Daily Show Host |journal=[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]] |date=November–December 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531094324/http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2008/12/JonStewart.html |archivedate=May 31, 2011 }}</ref>

====Broadening the role of the correspondent====
During Stewart's tenure, the role of the correspondent broadened to encompass not only field segments but also frequent in-studio exchanges. Under Kilborn, Colbert says that his work as a correspondent initially involved "character driven [field] pieces—like, you know, guys who believe in Bigfoot." However, as the focus of the show has become more news-driven, correspondents have increasingly been used in studio pieces, either as experts discussing issues at the anchor desk or as field journalists reporting from false locations in front of a green screen. Colbert says that this change has allowed correspondents to be more involved with the show, as it has permitted them to work more closely with the host and writers.<ref name="Colbert interview"/>

====Popularity and critical respect====
The show's 2000 and 2004 election coverage, combined with a new satirical edge, helped to catapult Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' to new levels of popularity and critical respect.<ref>{{cite news|author=Goodman, Tim|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/29/DDGSO9HI5F17.DTL|title=Jon Stewart, seriously, here to stay|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=October 29, 2004|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Since Stewart became host, the show has won 23 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and three [[Peabody Awards]], and its ratings steadily increased.

====In the political spectrum====
The move towards greater involvement in political issues and the increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where the views of the show fit in the political spectrum. [[Adam Clymer]], among many others, has argued that ''The Daily Show'' is more critical of Republicans than Democrats.<ref name=Wilson>{{cite news|author=Wilson, Brad|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,126226,00.html|title=Late-Night Leaning?|date=July 20, 2004|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election,<ref>{{cite web|title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast'|author=Kurtz, Howard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html|date=August 28, 2008|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not "a liberal organization" with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny.

Stewart is critical of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politicians for being weak, timid, or ineffective. He said in an interview with Larry King, prior to the 2006 elections, "I honestly don't feel that [the Democrats] make an impact. They have forty-nine percent of the vote and three percent of the power. At a certain point you go, 'Guys, pick up your game.'"<ref name=transcripts1>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=Larry King Live Transcript: Interview With Jon Stewart|publisher=CNN|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=July 12, 2008}}</ref> He has targeted them for failing to effectively stand on some issues, such as the war in Iraq, describing them as "incompetent" and "unable... to locate their asses, even when presented with two hands and a special ass map."<ref>{{cite web |work=The Daily Show |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=83638&title=withdrawal-method|title=Withdrawal Method|date=March 13, 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2008}}</ref>

Karlin, then the show's executive producer, said in a 2004 interview that while there is a collective sensibility among the staff which, "when filtered through Jon and the correspondents, feels uniform," the principal goal of the show is comedy. "If you have a legitimately funny joke in support of the notion that gay people are an affront to God, we'll put that motherfucker on!"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Zulkey |url=http://www.zulkey.com/diary_archive_111904.html|title=The Ben Karlin Interview: Just Under Twenty Questions|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref>

On September 15, 2003, Senator [[John Edwards]] became the first candidate to announce that they were running for president on the show, causing Jon Stewart to jokingly inform him that their show was "fake" and he might have to reannounce elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Comedy Central |url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/3gj7dr/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-intro---john-edwards |title=Daily Show intro with John Edwards, 9-15-2003|accessdate=March 25, 2018}}</ref> On November 17, 2009, Vice President Joe Biden appeared on the show, making him the first sitting vice president to do so.<ref>{{cite web|last=Franke|first=Garance|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/11/biden-on-the-daily-show.html?wprss=44|title=Biden sits down with Stewart on 'The Daily Show'|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 18, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> On October 27, 2010, President Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to be interviewed on the show, wherein Obama commented he "loved" the show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rose|first=Rachel|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101028/el_yblog_upshot/obama-makes-historic-appearance-on-daily-show|title=Obama appears on 'The Daily Show'|publisher=Yahoo News |date=|accessdate=November 20, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104044421/http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20101028/el_yblog_upshot/obama-makes-historic-appearance-on-daily-show <!-- Added by H3llBot -->|archivedate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> Obama took issue with Stewart's suggestion that his health care program was "timid."<ref>{{cite web|title=Laughs in short supply as Barack Obama gets serious on The Daily Show|date=October 28, 2010|author=MacAskill, Ewen|accessdate=April 23, 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/28/barack-obama-jon-stewart-the-daily-show|work=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref>

After the [[United States Senate]] failed to pass and the media failed to cover the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]], which would provide health monitoring and financial aid to sick first responders of the [[September 11 attacks]], Stewart dedicated the entire December 16, 2010, broadcast to the issue. During the next week, a revived version of the bill gained new life, with the potential of being passed before the winter recess.<ref>Newton-Small, Jay.

====Writers' strike====
Due to the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]], the show went on [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] on November 5, 2007. Although the strike continued until February 2008, the show returned to air on January 7, 2008, without its staff of writers. In solidarity with the writers, the show was referred to as '''''A Daily Show with Jon Stewart''''' rather than ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' until the end of the strike.<ref name="Introducing A Daily Show">{{cite episode|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/l4eiq9/introducing-a-daily-show|title=Introducing A Daily Show|series=The Daily Show|airdate=January 7, 2008|season=13}}</ref> As a member of the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]], Stewart was barred from writing any material for the show himself which he or his writers would ordinarily write.<ref>{{cite news|title=Daily Show to return in January|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7155335.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|date=December 21, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}</ref> As a result, Stewart and the correspondents largely [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] the show around planned topics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finn|first=Natalie|title=''Daily Show'', ''Colbert'' returning|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b57052_Daily_Show_Colbert_Returning.html|publisher=[[E!]]|date=December 20, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}</ref> 

In an effort to fill time while keeping to the strike-related restrictions, the show aired or re-aired some previously recorded segments, and Stewart engaged in [[Who Made Huckabee?|a briefly recurring mock feud]] with fellow late-night hosts [[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]] and [[Conan O'Brien]].<ref>[http://www.today.com/id/23017599 Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud].

==== Stewart's absence in 2013 ====
Starting in June 2013, Jon Stewart took a twelve-week break to direct ''[[Rosewater (film)|Rosewater]]'', a drama about a journalist jailed by Iran for four months.

====Jon Stewart's departure====
[[File:Barack Obama on the Daily Show July 21, 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] made his final appearance on the show with Jon Stewart as host on July 21, 2015]]
On February 10, 2015, Stewart announced that he would be leaving the show later in the year. Comedy Central indicated in a statement that ''The Daily Show'' would continue without Stewart, saying it would "endure for years to come".<ref name="O'Neal">{{cite news|last1=O'Neal|first1=Sean|title=Jon Stewart says he's leaving The Daily Show|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/jon-stewart-says-hes-leaving-daily-show-215070|accessdate=February 11, 2015|publisher=[[The A.V.

On June 25, 2015, Comedy Central announced that to lead up to Stewart's final episode, it would hold "Your Month of Zen"—an online [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] streaming every episode of Stewart's tenure from June 26 to August 6, 2015.<ref name="thewrap-jonvoyage">{{cite web|title = Jon Stewart to Get Month-Long Send Off From Comedy Central|url = https://www.thewrap.com/jon-stewart-to-get-month-long-send-off-from-comedy-central/|website = TheWrap|accessdate = June 25, 2015|date = June 25, 2015|first = Joe|last = Otterson}}</ref>

On August 5, 2015, Stewart's longtime friend of 30 years comedian [[Louis C.K.]] was selected to be the last guest before the final Daily Show episode with Stewart helming the show. C.K. joked that he was there "representing comedy to say good job".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/s3onms/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-exclusive---louis-c-k--extended-interview|title=Exclusive - Louis C.K.

On August 6, 2015, Stewart's final episode aired as an hour-long special in three segments. The first featured a reunion of a majority of the correspondents and contributors from throughout the show's history as well as a pre-recorded "anti-tribute" (mocking Stewart) from various frequent guests and "friends" of the show. This included [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[John McCain]], [[Lindsey Graham]], [[Chris Christie]], [[John Kerry]], and [[Chuck Schumer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/8/7/9114919/jon-stewart-daily-show-last-moment-of-zen|title=Watch: Jon Stewart's final Daily Show signoff and last moment of Zen|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santos|date=August 7, 2015|website=Vox}}</ref> 

The second segment featured a pre-recorded tour of the Daily Show production facility and studio introducing all of the show's staff and crew. The final segment featured a short farewell speech from Stewart followed by the final "Moment of Zen" (being 'his own' moment of zen): a performance of "[[Land of Hope and Dreams]]" and "[[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]" by [[Bruce Springsteen]] and the [[E Street Band]].

=== Trevor Noah's tenure (2015–present) ===
On March 30, 2015, it was announced that [[Trevor Noah]] would replace Stewart as host of ''The Daily Show''.<ref name="Noah">{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Trevor Noah to Succeed Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/arts/television/trevor-noah-to-succeed-jon-stewart-on-the-daily-show.html?src=twr&_r=1|accessdate=March 30, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Shortly after his announcement, it was revealed that [[Amy Schumer]], [[Louis C.K.]], [[Amy Poehler]], and [[Chris Rock]] were all considered for the job.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/28/these-stars-turned-down-the-chance-to-host-the-daily-show-heres-why-they-said-no/|title=These stars turned down the chance to host 'The Daily Show' — here's why they said no|last=Yahr|first=Emily|date=September 28, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=September 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/113658-who-rejected-the-daily-show-trevor-noah-alludes-to-female-comedians-who-passed-on-his-job|title=Who Rejected 'The Daily Show'?

==== Differences between Stewart's version and Noah's version ====
In addition to changes in the tone of the show,{{clarify|date=April 2019}} Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/09/trevor-noah-daily-show-is-ready-for-2016-214068|title=Trevor Noah: 'Daily Show' is ready for 2016|date=September 25, 2015|work=Politico}}</ref> new graphics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.troika.tv/the-daily-show-identity/|title=The Daily Show Identity|work=Troika|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901172911/http://www.troika.tv/the-daily-show-identity/|archivedate=September 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and his monologue sometimes taking place while standing in front of a screen as opposed to sitting at the desk. Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial-based references, impersonations and characterizations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-gigs/south-african-comedian-trevor-noah-6319931 |title=South African comedian Trevor Noah to play Birmingham's Glee Club |last=Laws |first=Roz |date=November 22, 2013 |work=birminghampost |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327083710/http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/whats-on/comedy-gigs/south-african-comedian-trevor-noah-6319931 |archivedate=March 27, 2015 }}</ref>

The debut of ''The Daily Show with Trevor Noah'' brought along three new correspondents: [[Roy Wood Jr.]], [[Desi Lydic]] and [[Ronny Chieng]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/02/daily-show-ronny-chieng-desi-lydic-roy-wood-jr-correspondents-trevor-noah|title=The Daily Show adds Ronny Chieng, Desi Lydic, and Roy Wood Jr. as correspondents|date=September 2, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

Additional correspondents were added in 2017. [[Michael Kosta]] became the Senior Constitutional Correspondent and Senior American Correspondent on July 11, 2017. [[Dulcé Sloan]] became the Senior Fashion Correspondent on September 7, 2017.

In January 2016, ''The Daily Show with Trevor Noah'' started to use a modified version of the show's previous theme, remixed by [[Timbaland]] and [[The Royal Court|King Logan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/trevor-noah-premieres-new-version-852152|title=Trevor Noah Premieres New Version of 'Daily Show' Theme Song Produced by Timbaland|date=January 5, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

[[Trevor Noah]] also avoided talking too much about [[Fox News]], as Stewart was previously known for. "''The Daily Show'' was based on an emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired ''The Daily Show''. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the [[Gawker]]s, the [[Buzzfeed]]s. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge is going to be an exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source—which was historically Fox News," Noah said at a press conference before the show's debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/29/trevor-noah-daily-show-fox |title=Trevor Noah reveals Daily Show changes (including less Fox News bashing) |date=July 29, 2015 |last=Hibberd |first=James |work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

====Stewart visits ''The Daily Show with Trevor Noah''; Jordan Klepper guest hosts====
On December 8, 2015, former host Jon Stewart returned to ''The Daily Show'' for the first time in an extended-length show to return attention to extending the [[James Zadroga]] 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, otherwise referred to as 9/11 First Responders Bill, which Stewart explained had been blocked by [[Paul Ryan]] and [[Mitch McConnell]] for political reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/12/08/media/jon-stewart-daily-show-trevor-noah-first-responders/|title=Jon Stewart returns to 'Daily Show' to give attention to 9/11 bill|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|date=December 8, 2015|work=CNNMoney}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/08/arts/television/jon-stewart-returns-to-the-daily-show-for-zadroga-act.html|title=Jon Stewart Returns to 'The Daily Show' as a Guest|date=December 8, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref> On October 20, 2016, Noah was unable to host a scheduled taping of ''The Daily Show'' due to illness,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Noah|first1=Trevor|title=Instagram video by Trevor Noah • Oct 21, 2016 at 12:18pm UTC|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BL0x9hKB4qE|website=Instagram}}</ref> so correspondent [[Jordan Klepper]] guest hosted.

On November 16, 2017, Stewart once again returned to ''The Daily Show'', in part as a parody of the robocalls of fake ''Washington Post'' reporter "Bernie Bernstein" and to promote ''[[Night of Too Many Stars]]'' on [[HBO]].

====''The Daily Social Distancing Show''====
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], it was initially announced that starting March 16, 2020, the show would do away with the live audience, like all other live shows were starting to do. However, that day, Noah posted a short video explaining that they would not do that because of [[social distancing]]. On March 18, 2020, Noah did a modified version of ''The Daily Show'' from his own home for Comedy Central's website and ''The Daily Show'''s YouTube channel called ''The Daily Social Distancing Show with Trevor Noah''.

The show's correspondents have two principal roles: experts with satirical senior titles that Noah interviews about certain issues, or hosts of field reporting segments which often involve humorous commentary and interviews relating to a current issue. The current team of correspondents collectively known as "The World's Fakest News Team" (formerly known as "The Best [[wikt:fuck|F#@king]] News Team Ever") includes [[Ronny Chieng]], [[Michael Kosta]], [[Desi Lydic]], [[Dulcé Sloan]], [[Roy Wood Jr.]] and [[Jaboukie Young-White]].<ref name=corr_web>{{cite web|title=News Team Correspondents |url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/news-team |publisher=[[Comedy Central|Comedy Partners]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131074903/http://www.thedailyshow.com/news-team |archivedate=January 31, 2014 }}</ref> Contributors appear on a less frequent basis, often with their own unique recurring segment or topic.<ref name=corr_web/> Current contributors are [[Lewis Black]], [[Neal Brennan]], and [[Gina Yashere]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Gordon, Devin |url=http://splitsider.com/2016/05/the-daily-show-adds-eliza-cossio-as-its-newest-contributor/ |title='The Daily Show' Adds Eliza Cossio as Its Newest Contributor |work=Splitsider|date=May 17, 2016 |access-date=October 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029113048/http://splitsider.com/2016/05/the-daily-show-adds-eliza-cossio-as-its-newest-contributor/ |archive-date=October 29, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ben Karlin says that the on-air talent contribute in many ways to the material they perform, playing an integral role in the creation of their field pieces as well as being involved with their scripted studio segments, either taking part early on in the writing process or adding improvised material during the rehearsal.<ref name="Karlin chat"/>

The show has featured a number of well-known comedians throughout its run and is notable for boosting the careers of several of these.

A 2004 [[Nielsen Media Research]] study commissioned by Comedy Central put the median age at 35. During the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]], the show received more male viewers in the 18- to 34-year-old age demographic than ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Meet the Press]]'', ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' and all of the evening news broadcasts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap|title=Young America's news source: Jon Stewart|date=March 2, 2004|publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403134904/http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap|archivedate=April 3, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

For this reason, commentators such as [[Howard Dean]] and [[Ted Koppel]] posited that Stewart served as a real source of news for young people, regardless of his intentions.<ref>{{cite episode|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=114993&title=howard-dean-pt.-2|title=Howard Dean interview|episodelink=|series=The Daily Show|airdate=2005-06-23|season=10|number=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=de Moraes, Lisa|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27439-2004Aug23.html|title=Seriously: Kerry on Comedy Central|date=August 24, 2004|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref> In 2016, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that ''The Daily Show'' was "most popular in cities and other more liberal-leaning areas along the coasts.

===As a news source===
The show's writers reject the idea that ''The Daily Show'' has become a source of news for young people. Stewart argues that Americans are living in an "age of information [[osmosis]]" in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," he argues. "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'"<ref>{{cite video|people=Jon Stewart|title=A Conversation with Jon Stewart|medium=Video|publisher=Harvard University|location=Harvard Institute of Politics|date=2002}}</ref>

A 2006 study published by [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] tried to compare the substantive amount of information of ''The Daily Show'' against prime time network [[News broadcasting|news broadcasts]], and concluded that when it comes to substance, there is little difference between ''The Daily Show'' and other news outlets. The study contended that, since both programs are more focused on the nature of "[[infotainment]]" and ratings than on the dissemination of information, both are broadly equal in terms of the amount of substantial news coverage they offer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fox|first1=Julia R.|last2=Koloen|first2=Glory|last3=Sahin|first3=Volkan|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6836/is_2_51/ai_n25010532|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708114040/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m6836/is_2_51/ai_n25010532|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-08|title=No joke: a comparison of substance in The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and broadcast network...|work=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=2007-06-01|accessdate=August 21, 2008}}</ref>

As the lines between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under pressure in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. [[Tucker Carlson]] and ''Daily Show'' co-creator [[Lizz Winstead]] have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, "When you are interviewing a [[Richard Perle]] or a [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]], if you give them a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him be a war criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary."<ref name=Winstead>{{cite journal|last=Andersen|first=Kurt|year=2004|url=https://www.motherjones.com/arts/qa/2004/05/04_100.html|title=Taking Back the Dial|journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|issn=0362-8841|accessdate=July 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105011632/https://www.motherjones.com/media/2004/05/taking-back-dial/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|issue=May/June 2004|url-status=live}}</ref> She has argued that ''The Daily Show''{{'s}} success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show.<ref name=Serious>{{cite news|last=Cave|first=Damien|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/24cave.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413211944/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/weekinreview/if-you-interview-kissinger-are-you-still-a-comedian.html|archive-date=April 13, 2016|title=Jon Stewart Gets Serious: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian?|work=The New York Times|issn=1553-8095|oclc=1645522|date=October 24, 2004|accessdate=July 5, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV.<ref name=avclub.com>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/lizz-winstead-discusses-the-most-useless-person-cu-37469|title=Lizz Winstead discusses the most useless person currently working in news media|work=avclub.com}}</ref> Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_stewart.html|title=Transcript: Bill Moyers Interviews Jon Stewart|work=[[NOW with Bill Moyers]]|date=July 11, 2003|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}</ref>

During Stewart's appearance on [[CNN]]'s [[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|''Crossfire'']], Stewart criticized that show and said that it was "hurting America" by sensationalizing debates and enabling political [[spin (public relations)|spin]]. When co-host Carlson argued that Stewart himself had not asked John Kerry substantial questions when Kerry appeared on ''The Daily Show'', Stewart countered that it was not his job to give hard-hitting interviews and that a "fake news" comedy program should not be held to the same standards as real journalism. "You're on CNN!" Stewart said, "The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title=Jon Stewart's America|publisher=CNN|date=October 15, 2004|accessdate=July 5, 2008}}</ref> Media critic Dan Kennedy says that Stewart came off as disingenuous in this exchange because "you can't interview Bill Clinton, [[Richard A.

A 2004 study into the effect of ''The Daily Show'' on viewers' attitudes found that participants had a more negative opinion of both President Bush and then Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. Participants also expressed more cynical views of the electoral system and news media.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart, Enemy of Democracy?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/22/AR2006062201474.html|last=Morin|first=Richard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> Political scientists Jody Baumgartner and Jonathan Morris, who conducted the study, state that it is not clear how such cynicism would affect the political behavior of the show's viewers. While disillusionment and negative perceptions of the presidential candidates could discourage watchers from voting, Baumgartner and Morris say it is also possible that discontent could prompt greater involvement and that by following the show, viewers may potentially become more engaged and informed voters, with a broader political knowledge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2006/05/29/5_30_06__daily_show.html|title=Study focuses on the effect of ''The Daily Show'' satire|last=Ryals|first=Jimmy|publisher=[[The Daily Reflector]]|date=May 30, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702193522/http://www.reflector.com/local/content/news/stories/2006/05/29/5_30_06__daily_show.html|archivedate=July 2, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Rachel Larris, who has also conducted an academic study of ''The Daily Show'', disputes the findings of Baumgartner and Morris. Larris argues that the study measured cynicism in overly broad terms, and that it would be extremely hard to find a causal link between viewing ''The Daily Show'' and thinking or acting in a particular way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/05/24/the_daily_show_cause_and_effect.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710214647/http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/05/24/the_daily_show_cause_and_effect.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2006 |last=Larris |first=Rachel Joy |publisher=[[TomPaine.com]] |title="The Daily Show" Cause And Effect |date=June 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 12, 2008 }}</ref> Bloggers such as Marty Kaplan of [[The Huffington Post]] argue that so long as Stewart's comedy is grounded in truth, responsibility for increased cynicism belongs to the political and media figures themselves, not the comedian who satirizes them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/27/blogophile/main1754241.shtml|last=McNamara|first=Melissa|publisher=[[CBS News]]|title=Bloggers Laugh Over Jon Stewart Study|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=July 9, 2006}}</ref>

Stewart himself says that he does not perceive his show as cynical. "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," he says. "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like [[Fox News Channel|Fox]] and calling it '[[fair and balanced]]'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/arts/jon-stewart-s-perfect-pitch.html|title=Jon Stewart's Perfect Pitch|last=Rich|first=Frank|work=The New York Times|issn=1553-8095|oclc=1645522|date=April 20, 2003|accessdate=July 8, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815032013/https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/20/arts/jon-stewart-s-perfect-pitch.html|archive-date=August 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Stewart has said that he does not take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide.

=== Effectiveness ===
In late 2004, the [[National Annenberg Election Survey]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] ran a study of American television viewers and found that fans of ''The Daily Show'' had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers.<ref>National Annenberg Election Survey, ''{{cite web |url= http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf|title=Daily Show viewers knowledgeable about presidential campaign, National Annenberg Election Survey shows |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050308165738/http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/naes/2004_03_late-night-knowledge-2_9-21_pr.pdf|archivedate=March 8, 2005}}'', press release, September 21, 2004.

Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/200/cable-and-internet-loom-large-in-fragmented-political-news-universe|title=Cable and Internet Loom Large in Fragmented Political News Universe|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=October 24, 2006}}</ref>

In a survey released by the Pew Research Center in April 2007, viewers who watch both ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' and ''The Daily Show'' tend to be more knowledgeable about news than audiences of other news sources. Approximately 54% of ''Tucker Carlson Tonight'' and ''The Daily Show'' viewers scored in the high knowledge range, followed by [[Jim Lehrer]]'s program at 53% and [[The O'Reilly Factor|Bill O'Reilly's program]] at 51%, significantly higher than the 34% of network morning show viewers. The survey shows that changing news formats have not made much difference on how much the public knows about national and international affairs, but adds that there is no clear connection between news formats and what audiences know.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/319/public-knowledge-of-current-affairs-little-changed-by-news-and-information-revolutions|title=Summary of Findings: Public Knowledge of Current Affairs Little Changed by News and Information Revolutions|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|date=April 2007|accessdate=August 15, 2007}}</ref> The [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] released a content analysis report suggesting that ''The Daily Show'' comes close to providing the complete daily news.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eggerton |first=John |title=PEJ: 'The Daily Show' Borders on News Show|url=http://noownews.com/category/latest-pakistani-talk-shows-online/|work=noownews & |date=May 8, 2008|accessdate=May 8, 2008}}</ref>

Between 2001 and 2006, [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]] broadcast small, ninety-second portions of the show to various radio stations across America.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4818518-1.html|title=Inside Media: News of the Market|last=Torpey-Kemph|first=Anne|publisher=Mediaweek|date=February 12, 2002|accessdate=October 31, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225013417/http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4818518-1.html|archivedate=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

In Canada, ''The Daily Show'' is aired on [[The Comedy Network]] (a cable channel similar to Comedy Central), in simulcast with the Comedy Central airing, as well as on the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] broadcast network at 12:05&nbsp;a.m. local time, following late local newscasts.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the digital television channel [[More4]] used to broadcast episodes of ''The Daily Show'' Tuesday through Friday evenings with the ''Global Edition'', which is uncensored, airs on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 was the first international broadcaster to syndicate entire ''Daily Show'' episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet [[video on demand]] service [[4oD]]. However, the 'toss' to ''The Colbert Report'' was usually included even though it was aired on [[Fox (UK and Ireland)|FX]], another channel.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091006082604/http://www.fxuk.com/shows/the-colbert-report FXUK.com], ''Official FX TV website''</ref> In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When ''The Daily Show'' was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/20/more4-daily-show-stewart|title=More4 cuts back The Daily Show to one episode a week|work=The Guardian|date=December 21, 2010}}</ref>

=== ''The Colbert Report'' ===
{{Main|The Colbert Report}}
A spin-off, ''The Colbert Report'', was announced in early May 2005. The show starred former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and served as Comedy Central's answer to the programs of media pundits such as Bill O'Reilly. Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed the idea for the show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier ''Daily Show'' segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot.<ref name=TCR>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-10-13-colbert_x.htm|title=First 'Stewart', Now 'Colbert'|last=Levin|first=Gary|work=USA Today|date=October 13, 2005|accessdate=July 8, 2008}}</ref> ''The Colbert Report'' premiered on October 17, 2005, and aired following ''The Daily Show'' for nine years.
