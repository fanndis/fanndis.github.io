'''Robert Heron Bork''' (March 1, 1927{{snds}}December 19, 2012) was an American judge, government official, and legal scholar who served as the [[Solicitor General of the United States]] from 1973 to 1977. A professor at [[Yale Law School]] by occupation, he later served as a judge on the influential [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] from 1982 to 1988. In 1987, President [[Ronald Reagan]] [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|nominated Bork]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], but the Democrat-controlled [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] rejected his nomination.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[National Review]] |access-date=April 6, 2017 |title=Robert Bork: America's Best |first=Mona |last=Charen |author-link=Mona Charen |date=December 21, 2012 |url=http://amp.nationalreview.com/article/336233/robert-bork-americas-best-mona-charen}}</ref>

Bork was born in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He pursued a legal career after attending the [[University of Chicago]]. After working at the law firm of [[Kirkland & Ellis]], he served as a Yale Law School Professor. He became a prominent advocate of [[originalism]], calling for judges to hew to the framers' original understanding of the [[United States Constitution]]. He also became an influential [[antitrust]] scholar, arguing that consumers often benefited from [[corporate merger]]s and that [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]] should focus on [[consumer welfare]] rather than on ensuring competition. Bork wrote several notable books, including ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'' and ''[[Slouching Towards Gomorrah]]''.

From 1973 to 1977, he served as Solicitor General under President [[Richard Nixon]] and President [[Gerald Ford]], arguing several cases before the Supreme Court. During the October 1973 [[Saturday Night Massacre]], Bork became acting [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] after his superiors in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] resigned rather than fire [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]] who was investigating the [[Watergate scandal]]. Following an order from the President, Bork fired Cox, his first assignment as Acting Attorney General. Bork served as Acting Attorney General until January 4, 1974 and was succeeded by [[List of United States senators from Ohio|Ohio U.S. Senator]] [[William B. Saxbe]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bork: Nixon Offered Next High Court Vacancy in '73|date=February 25, 2013|website=[[Yahoo!

In 1982, President Reagan appointed Bork to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After Supreme Court Justice [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]] announced his impending retirement, Reagan nominated Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987, precipitating a contested Senate debate. Opposition to Bork centered on his stated willingness to roll back the civil rights rulings of the [[Warren Court|Warren]] and [[Burger Court|Burger]] courts and his role in the Saturday Night Massacre. His nomination was defeated in the Senate, with 58 of the 100 Senators opposing his nomination. The Supreme Court vacancy was eventually filled by another Reagan nominee, [[Anthony Kennedy]]. Bork resigned his judgeship in 1988 and served as a professor at the [[Antonin Scalia Law School|George Mason University School of Law]] and other institutions. He also advised presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and was a fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] and the [[Hudson Institute]] prior to his death in 2012.

== Early career and family ==
Bork was born in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. His father was Harry Philip Bork Jr. (1897-1974), a steel company purchasing agent, and his mother was Elisabeth (''née'' Kunkle; 1898-2004), a schoolteacher.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/18/classified/paid-notice-deaths-bork-elizabeth-kunkle.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524073815/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/18/classified/paid-notice-deaths-bork-elizabeth-kunkle.html | archive-date=May 24, 2013 | work=The New York Times | title=Paid Notice: Deaths Bork, Elizabeth Kunkle | date=January 18, 2004}}</ref> His father was of German and Irish ancestry, while his mother was of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (German) descent.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irMcAAAAMAAJ&q=%22father,+half+German+and+half+Irish,+was+a+steel-mill%22 |title=The Americana Annual, 1988: An Encyclopedia of the Events of 1987; Yearbook ... |date=February 1, 1989 |access-date=December 20, 2012|isbn=9780717202195 |last1=McDannald |first1=Alexander Hopkins }}</ref> He was married to Claire Davidson from 1952 until 1980, when she died of [[cancer]]. They had a daughter, [[Ellen Bork|Ellen]], and two sons, Robert and Charles. In 1982, he married Mary Ellen Pohl,<ref>{{harvnb|Vile|2003|p=111}}</ref> a Catholic [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sister]] turned activist.<ref name="Long and Winding Odyssey">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,965540,00.html|title=A Long and Winding Odyssey|last=Beckwith|first=David|date=September 21, 1987|work=Time|access-date=March 20, 2009}}</ref>

Bork attended the [[Hotchkiss School]] in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]<ref>{{harvnb|Bronner|2007|p=43}}</ref> and earned B.A. and [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degrees from the [[University of Chicago]]. He pursued his bachelor's degree and became a brother of the international social fraternity of [[Phi Gamma Delta]]. While in law school he served on the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]''. At Chicago he was awarded a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key with his J.D. degree in 1953, and [[Admission to practice law|passed the bar]] in Illinois that same year. After a period of service in the [[United States Marine Corps]], Bork began as a lawyer in private practice in 1954 at [[Kirkland & Ellis]]<ref>{{cite news|title=A Conservative Whose Supreme Court Bid Set the Senate Afire| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/robert-h-bork-conservative-jurist-dies-at-85.html}}</ref> in Chicago, and then was a professor at [[Yale Law School]] from 1962 to 1975, and again from 1977 to 1981. Among his students during this time were [[Bill Clinton]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Anita Hill]], [[Robert Reich]], [[Jerry Brown]], [[John R.

== Advocacy of originalism ==
Bork is known{{by whom|date=June 2019}} for his theory that the only way to reconcile the role of the judiciary in the U.S. government against what he terms the "[[James Madison|Madisonian]]" or "counter-majoritarian" dilemma of the judiciary making law without popular approval is for constitutional adjudication to be guided by the framers' [[originalism|original understanding]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. Reiterating that it is a court's task to adjudicate and not to "legislate from the bench," he advocated that [[judicial restraint|judges exercise restraint]] in deciding cases, emphasizing that the role of the courts is to frame "neutral principles" (a term borrowed from [[Herbert Wechsler]]) and not simply ''[[ad hoc]]'' pronouncements or subjective value judgments. Bork once said, "The truth is that the judge who looks outside the Constitution always looks inside himself and nowhere else."<ref name="originalism debate">{{Cite book |title = The American Constitution and the Debate Over Originalism |author = Dennis J. Goldford |publisher = Cambridge University Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w9lFMxRsI7AC |year = 2005 |isbn = 978-0-521-84558-8 |page = 174 |access-date = October 26, 2008 }}</ref>

Bork built on the influential critiques of the [[Warren Court]] authored by [[Alexander Bickel]], who criticized the Supreme Court under [[Earl Warren]], alleging shoddy and inconsistent reasoning, undue [[Judicial activism|activism]], and misuse of historical materials. Bork's critique was harder-edged than Bickel's, however, and he has written, "We are increasingly governed not by law or elected representatives but by an unelected, unrepresentative, unaccountable committee of lawyers applying no will but their own." Bork's writings influenced the opinions of judges such as [[Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], and sparked a vigorous debate within legal academia about how to [[Judicial interpretation|interpret]] the Constitution.

Some conservatives criticized Bork's approach. Conservative scholar [[Harry Jaffa]] criticized Bork (along with Rehnquist and Scalia) for failing to adhere to [[natural law]] principles.<ref name = Jaffa>{{Cite news |last = Linstrum |first= Erik |title = Political scholar Jaffa defends moral foundation of government |periodical = The Daily Princetonian |date = September 30, 2003 |url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2003/09/30/8663/ |access-date = December 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605200549/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2003/09/30/8663/ |archive-date=June 5, 2009 }}</ref> [[Robert P. George]] explained Jaffa's critique this way: "He attacks Rehnquist and Scalia and Bork for their embrace of [[legal positivism]] that is inconsistent with the doctrine of [[natural rights]] that is embedded in the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] they are supposed to be interpreting."<ref name=Jaffa/>

== Antitrust scholar ==
At Yale he was best known for writing ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'', a book in which he argued that [[consumer]]s often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many then-current readings of the [[antitrust]] laws were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that the primary focus of antitrust laws should be on consumer welfare rather than ensuring competition, as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and even help, many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork's writings on antitrust law—with those of [[Richard Posner]] and other [[law and economics]] and [[Chicago School (economics)|Chicago School]] thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gerhart |first=Peter M. |year=1982 |title=The Supreme Court and Antitrust Analysis: The (Near) Triumph of the Chicago School |journal=The Supreme Court Review |volume=1982 |pages=319–349 |jstor=3109560 |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1601&context=faculty_publications |doi=10.1086/scr.1982.3109560 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fox |first=Eleanor M. |year=1987 |title=The Battle for the Soul of Antitrust |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=917–923 |doi=10.2307/3480656 |jstor=3480656 }}</ref>

Bork served as [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general]] in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] from March 1973<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/21/archives/nixons-men-all-work-and-no-frills-presidents-men-all-work-and-no.html "Nixon's Men: All Work and No Frills; President's Men: All Work and No Frills"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 21, 1973.</ref> until 1977. As solicitor general, he argued several high-profile cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s, including 1974's ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'', where his brief in support of the [[State of Michigan]] was influential among the justices. Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] called Bork the most effective counsel to appear before the court during his tenure. Bork hired many young attorneys as assistants who went on to have successful careers, including judges [[Danny Boggs]] and [[Frank H. Easterbrook]] as well as [[Robert Reich]], later [[United States Secretary of Labor|secretary of labor]] in the Clinton administration.

=== "Saturday Night Massacre" ===
On October 20, 1973, Solicitor General Bork was instrumental in the '[[Saturday Night Massacre]]' when President [[Richard Nixon]] ordered the firing of [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] [[Special Prosecutor]] [[Archibald Cox]] following Cox's request for tapes of his [[Oval Office]] conversations. Nixon initially ordered [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Elliot Richardson]] to fire Cox. Richardson resigned rather than carry out the order. Richardson's top deputy, [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[William Ruckelshaus]], also considered the order "fundamentally wrong"<ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE163FF935A15754C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524213506/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/26/us/new-views-emerge-of-bork-s-role-in-watergate-dismissals.html |archive-date=May 24, 2015 |url-status=live |title=New Views Emerge of Bork's Role in Watergate Dismissals |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 26, 1987 |access-date=June 4, 2012|author-link=Kenneth B. Noble |first=Kenneth B. |last=Noble}}</ref> and resigned, making Bork acting [[U.S. Attorney General|attorney general]]. When Nixon reiterated his order, Bork complied and fired Cox. Bork claimed he carried out the order under pressure from Nixon's attorneys and intended to resign immediately afterward, but was persuaded by Richardson and Ruckelshaus to stay on for the good of the Justice Department.<ref name = "Yahoo" /> Bork remained acting attorney general until the appointment of [[William B.

Nixon would never get the chance to carry out his promise to Bork, as the next Supreme Court vacancy came after [[Resignation of Richard Nixon|Nixon resigned]] and [[Gerald Ford]] [[Inauguration of Gerald Ford|assumed the presidency]], with Ford instead nominating [[John Paul Stevens]] following the 1975 retirement of [[William O. Douglas]].

== United States Circuit Judge ==
Bork was a circuit judge for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] from 1982 to 1988. He was nominated by President Reagan on December 7, 1981, was confirmed with a unanimous consent voice vote by the Senate on February 8, 1982,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/97th-congress/891 |title= PN891 – Robert H. Bork – The Judiciary |access-date=February 15, 2016|year= 1982 }}</ref> and received his commission on February 9, 1982.

One of Bork’s opinions while on the D.C. Circuit was ''Dronenburg v. Zech'', 741 F.2d 1388,<ref name="Dronenburg">{{cite court |litigants=DRONENBURG v. ZECH |vol=741 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=1388 |court=D.C. Cir. |date=August 17, 1984 |url=http://openjurist.org/741/f2d/1388/dronenburg-v-zech |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}</ref> decided in 1984. This case involved James L. Dronenburg, a sailor who had been administratively discharged from the navy for engaging in homosexual conduct. Dronenburg argued that his discharge violated his right to privacy. This argument was rejected in an opinion written by Bork and joined by [[Antonin Scalia]], in which Bork critiqued the line of Supreme Court cases upholding a right to privacy.<ref name="Dronenburg"/>

In rejecting Dronenburg's suggestion for a rehearing ''[[en banc]]'', the D.C. Circuit issued four separate opinions, including one by Bork (again joined by Scalia), who wrote that "no principle had been articulated [by the Supreme Court] that enabled us to determine whether appellant's case fell within or without that principle."<ref name="Dronenburg en banc">{{cite court |litigants=DRONENBURG v.

In 1986 President Reagan considered nominating Bork to the Supreme Court after Chief Justice Burger retired. Reagan ultimately chose Rehnquist for chief justice and Bork's D.C. Circuit colleague, [[Antonin Scalia|Judge Scalia]], as the new associate justice.

== U.S. Supreme Court nomination ==
{{Main|Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination}}
[[Image:President Ronald Reagan and Robert Bork.jpg|thumb|upright|Bork (right) with President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1987]]

President Reagan nominated Bork for associate justice of the Supreme Court on July 1, 1987, to replace retiring Associate Justice [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.]]. A hotly contested [[United States Senate]] debate over Bork's nomination ensued. Opposition was partly fueled by civil rights and women's rights groups, concerned about Bork's opposition to the authority claimed by the federal government to impose standards of voting fairness upon states (at his confirmation hearings for the position of solicitor general, he supported the rights of Southern states to impose a poll tax),<ref>{{cite news|last1=Buchanan |first1=John H. |last2=Kropp |first2=Arthur J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/opinion/l-bork-hearings-showed-how-democracy-works-a-very-small-poll-tax-174787.html |title=Bork Hearings Showed How Democracy Works; A Very Small Poll Tax |work=The New York Times |date=October 23, 1987 |access-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref> and his stated desire to roll back civil rights decisions of the [[Earl Warren|Warren]] and [[Warren Burger|Burger]] courts. Bork is one of only four Supreme Court nominees (along with [[William Rehnquist]], [[Samuel Alito]], and [[Brett Kavanaugh]]) to have been opposed by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/scotus/alito/ |title=ACLU Opposes Nomination of Judge Alito  |access-date=August 17, 2007 |work=American Civil Liberties Union |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070406173742/http://www.aclu.org/scotus/alito/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = April 6, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = ACLU spending more than $1M to oppose Kavanaugh  |publisher = Politico |url = https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/01/aclu-kavanaugh-ad-buy-854859 |access-date = October 1, 2018 }}</ref> Bork was also criticized for being an "advocate of disproportionate powers for the executive branch of Government, almost executive supremacy,"<ref name="query.nytimes.com"/> most notably, according to critics, for his role in the '[[Saturday Night Massacre]]'.

Before Supreme Court justice Lewis Powell's expected retirement on June 27, 1987, some Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to "form a 'solid phalanx' of opposition" if President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated an "ideological extremist" to replace him, assuming it would tilt the court rightward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fuerbringer |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/us/byrd-says-bork-nomination-would-face-senate-trouble.html |title=Byrd Says Bork Nomination Would Face Senate Trouble |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 30, 1987 |access-date=February 14, 2016}}</ref>  Democrats also warned Reagan there would be a fight if Bork were nominated.<ref name=Miranda>{{cite news |title=The Original Borking |author=Manuel Miranda |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 24, 2005 |access-date=August 10, 2007 |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007149 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028035123/http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007149 |archive-date=October 28, 2005}}</ref> Nevertheless, Reagan nominated Bork for the seat on July 1, 1987.

Following Bork's nomination, Sen. [[Ted Kennedy]] took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of him, declaring:

<blockquote>Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy&nbsp;... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans.

Television advertisements produced by [[People For the American Way]] and narrated by [[Gregory Peck]] attacked Bork as an extremist. Kennedy's speech successfully fueled widespread public skepticism of Bork's nomination. The rapid response to Kennedy's "Robert Bork's America" speech stunned the Reagan White House, and the accusations went unanswered for two and a half months.<ref name=Chaddock>{{cite web |title=Court nominees will trigger rapid response |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=July 7, 2005 |access-date=August 10, 2007 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0707/p02s01-uspo.html |author=Gail Russell Chaddock}}</ref>

During debate over his nomination, Bork's video rental history was leaked to the press. His video rental history was unremarkable, and included such harmless titles as ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'', ''[[Ruthless People]]'', and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''. Writer Michael Dolan, who obtained a copy of the hand-written list of rentals wrote about it for the ''[[Washington City Paper]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theamericanporch.com/bork2.htm |title=The Bork Tapes Saga |access-date=August 17, 2007 |work=The American Porch |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009144531/http://www.theamericanporch.com/bork2.htm |archive-date=October 9, 2007  }}</ref> Dolan justified accessing the list on the ground that Bork himself had stated that Americans had only such privacy rights as afforded them by direct legislation. The incident led to the enactment of the 1988 [[Video Privacy Protection Act]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Video Privacy Protection Act | url=http://epic.org/privacy/vppa/ }}</ref><ref name="wapo_video">{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Andrea |date=April 28, 2014 |title=How Washington's last remaining video rental store changed the course of privacy law |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/04/28/how-washingtons-last-remaining-video-rental-store-changed-the-course-of-privacy-law/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=January 8, 2018 }}</ref>

To pro-choice rights legal groups, Bork's [[originalism|originalist]] views and his belief that the Constitution did not contain a general "right to privacy" were viewed as a clear signal that, should he become a justice of the Supreme Court, he would vote to reverse the Court's 1973 decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Accordingly, a large number of groups mobilized to press for Bork's rejection, and the resulting 1987 [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation hearings became an intensely partisan battle.

On October 23, 1987, the Senate denied Bork's confirmation, with 42 Senators voting in favor and 58 voting against. Two Democratic senators, [[David Boren]] (D-OK) and [[Ernest Hollings]] (D-SC), voted in his favor, while six Republican senators – [[John Chafee]] (R-RI), [[Bob Packwood]] (R-OR), [[Arlen Specter]] (R-PA), [[Robert Stafford]] (R-VT), [[John Warner]] (R-VA), and [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] (R-CT) – voted against Bork.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-the-bork-vote.html|title=Senate's Roll-Call On the Bork Vote|date=October 24, 1987 |work=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press}}</ref> His defeat in the Senate was the worst against any Supreme Court nominee since [[George Washington Woodward]] was defeated 20—29 in 1845, and the third-worst on record.

== ''Bork'' as a verb ==
<!--If renaming section, please update redirects-->
According to columnist [[William Safire]], the first published use of ''bork'' as a verb was possibly in ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' of August 20, 1987, two months prior to the final vote: "Let's just hope something enduring results for the justice-to-be, like a new verb: Borked."<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |title=On Language: The End of Minority |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/27/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-5-27-01-on-language-judge-fights.html |work=New York Times Magazine |id=Document ID 383739671, ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851–2004) database |page=12 |date=May 27, 2001|quote=judge fights 'borking' needed to stop court-packing? }}</ref>  Perhaps the best-known use of the verb ''to bork'' occurred in July 1991 at a conference of the [[National Organization for Women]] in [[New York City]]. Feminist [[Florynce Kennedy]] addressed the conference on the importance of defeating the nomination of [[Clarence Thomas]] to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying, "We're going to ''bork'' him. We're going to kill him politically&nbsp;... This little creep, where did he come from?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=85000412 |author=John Fund |date=January 8, 2001 |title=The Borking Begins |access-date=August 17, 2007 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Thomas was subsequently confirmed after the most divisive confirmation hearing in Supreme Court history to that point.

In March 2002, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' added an entry for the verb ''bork'' as U.S. political slang, with this definition: "To defame or vilify (a person) systematically, esp. in the mass media, usually to prevent his or her appointment to public office; to obstruct or thwart (a person) in this way."<ref>v. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bork</ref>

There was an earlier usage of ''bork'' as a passive verb, common among litigators in the D.C. Circuit: to ''"get borked"'' was to receive a conservative judicial decision with legal interpretation disagreements, which included many disputes with democrats reflecting their perceptions.

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]] used the term during his own contentious Senate confirmation hearing testimony when he stated that "The behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment. But at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at ''borking''."<ref>{{cite web |title=Kavanaugh hearing: Transcript |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-hearing-transcript |publisher=Bloomberg Government |access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref>

== Later work ==
Following his failure to be confirmed, Bork resigned his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and was for several years both a professor at [[George Mason University School of Law]] and a senior fellow at the [[American Enterprise Institute|American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research]], a Washington, D.C., based [[think tank]]. Bork also consulted for [[Netscape]] in the [[Microsoft]] litigation. Bork was a fellow at the [[Hudson Institute]]. He later served as a visiting professor at the [[University of Richmond School of Law]] and was a professor at [[Ave Maria School of Law]] in Naples, Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avemarialaw.edu/page-section/history-timeline/|title=History Timeline – Ave Maria School of Law|website=Ave Maria School of Law|language=en-US|access-date=March 11, 2016}}</ref> In 2011, Bork worked as a legal adviser for the presidential campaign of Republican [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Grove, Lloyd |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/10/16/robert-bork-on-romney-obama-and-biden.html |title=Robert Bork's Romney Connection |work=Newsweek |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=December 20, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103232028/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/10/16/robert-bork-on-romney-obama-and-biden.html |archive-date = November 3, 2011}}</ref>

== Works and views ==
Bork wrote several books, including the two best-sellers ''[[The Tempting of America]]'', about his judicial philosophy and his nomination battle, and ''[[Slouching Towards Gomorrah|Slouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline]]'', in which he argued that the rise of the [[New Left]] in the 1960s in the U.S. undermined the [[morality|moral]] standards necessary for [[civil society]], and spawned a generation of [[intellectual]]s who oppose [[Western civilization]]. During the period these books were written, as well as most of his adult life, Bork was an agnostic, a fact used pejoratively behind the scenes by Southern Democrats when speaking to their evangelical constituents during his Supreme Court nomination process.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In ''The Tempting of America'', p.&nbsp;82, Bork explained his support for the Supreme Court's desegregation decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'':
{{Quote | By 1954, when Brown came up for decision, it had been apparent for some time that segregation rarely if ever produced equality. Quite aside from any question of psychology, the physical facilities provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites. That had been demonstrated in a long series of cases…  The Court's realistic choice, therefore, was either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in order to achieve equality. There was no third choice. Either choice would violate one aspect of the original understanding, but there was no possibility of avoiding that. Since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit state-imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law.}}

Bork opposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], saying that the provisions within the Act which prohibited [[Public accommodations|racial discrimination by public accommodations]] were based on a principle of "unsurpassed ugliness".<ref>{{Cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/09/16/Supreme-Court-nominee-Robert-Bork-distanced-himself-Wednesday-from/2896558763200/|title=Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork distanced himself Wednesday from… |work=UPI|access-date= 2018-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-c-dorf/a-principle-of-unsurpasse_b_5044574.html|title=A Principle of Unsurpassed Ugliness|last=Dorf|first= Michael C. |date= 2014-03-27|website= Huffington Post |language=en-US|access-date= 2018-09-29}}</ref>  Bork opposed the 1965 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Griswold v.

In 1998 he reviewed [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton|Ann Coulter's book on impeaching President Clinton]] pointing out that "'[[High crimes and misdemeanors]]' are not limited to actions that are crimes under federal law."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Thinking the unthinkable |last1=Bork|first1=Robert H. |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |volume=232 |issue=46 |year=1998 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB904798562566698000}}</ref>

In 1999, Bork wrote an essay about [[Thomas More]] and attacked [[jury nullification]] as a "pernicious practice".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9906/articles/bork.html |title=Thomas More for Our Season |access-date=August 17, 2007 |work=Leadership U}}</ref> Bork once quoted More in summarizing his judicial philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utahpatentattorneys.com/File/c2c851b5-8b2b-4dfb-b1b7-ff7ba1ead084 |title=Regula Pro Lege, Si Deficit Lex: The Latin Sapience of High Judges |access-date=November 17, 2016 |work=The Federal Bar Association}}</ref> In 2003, he published ''Coercing Virtue: The Worldwide Rule Of Judges'', an [[American Enterprise Institute]] book that includes Bork's philosophical objections to the phenomenon of incorporating international ethical and legal guidelines into the fabric of domestic law. In particular, he focuses on problems he sees as inherent in the federal judiciary of three nations, [[Israel]], [[Canada]], and the United States—countries where he believes courts have exceeded their discretionary powers, and have discarded [[precedent]] and [[common law]], and in their place substituted their own liberal judgment.

Bork also advocated modifying the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] to allow Congressional super-majorities to override Supreme Court decisions, similar to the Canadian [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]. Though Bork had many liberal critics, some of his arguments have earned criticism from conservatives as well.

Instead, he argued that the Second Amendment merely guarantees a right to participate in a government [[militia]].<ref>''Life'' Magazine, Vol 14, No. 13.</ref>
