'''Classical music''' is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture]], including both [[Religious music|liturgical]] (religious) and [[secular music|secular]] music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.{{sfn|Kennedy|Kennedy|2013|loc="Classical"}} The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1650 and 1900, which is known as the [[common practice period|common-practice period]].

==Overview==
European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some [[popular music]]al forms by its system of [[musical notation|staff notation]], in use since about the 11th century.<ref name="western musical notation">{{cite web|author = Bent, Ian D. | title = Musical notation | year = 2019 | url =https://www.britannica.com/art/musical-notation | access-date = May 23, 2019 }}</ref><ref>''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (2nd edition, 1972): "Neume", Staff</ref> Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and durations for a piece of music.<ref name="western musical notation"/> In contrast to most popular styles that adopted the song ([[strophic]]) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[fugue]], [[sonata]], and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as [[opera]], [[cantata]], and [[Mass (music)|mass]].<ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63">{{harvnb|Johnson|2002|p=63}}</ref> Alongside traditional musical attributes, Classical music is conscientious about drawing from and re-purposing its formal and social tradition with forms such as the Mass evolving and communicating through over a thousand years.<ref name="What is Classical Music? A Family Resemblance">{{cite web|author=Ezra LaFleur|url=https://www.ezralafleur.com/what-is-classical-music-a-family-resemblance/|title=What is Classical Music? A Family Resemblance}}</ref>

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age.<ref>[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10</ref> The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1829.{{sfn|Kennedy|Kennedy|2013|loc="Classical"}}<ref name="OED_Online_Classical">{{cite web|work=The Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=classical&first=1&max_to_show=10|access-date=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007|quote=1829 V.

==Characteristics==
Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval [[plainchant]] sung by monks to Classical and Romantic [[Symphony|symphonies]] for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde [[atonal]] compositions from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. Nonetheless, a universal characteristic of classical music written since the late 13th century is{{sfn|Kennedy|2006|p=178}}{{incomplete short citation|date=September 2020}} the invariable appliance of a standardized system of precise [[mensural notation]] (which evolved into modern bar notation after 1600) for all compositions and their accurate performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/notationofpolyph00apel/page/n11|title=The notation of polyphonic music, 900–1600|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Mediaeval Academy of America|author=Willi Apel|year=1961|access-date= May 20, 2019|author-link=Willi Apel}}</ref> Another is the creation and development of complex pieces of solo instrumental works (e.g., the [[fugue]]). The first symphonies were produced during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]; beginning in the mid 18th century, the [[Orchestra|symphony ensemble]] and the compositions became prominent features of Classical-period music.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/symphony-music|title=Symphony, music|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|author=Laurence Elliot Libin|access-date= May 20, 2019}}</ref>

==Complexity==
Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of [[orchestration]], [[counterpoint]], [[harmony]], [[musical development]], [[rhythm]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[Texture (music)|texture]], and [[musical form|form]]. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in [[Ternary form|song form]], classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms,<ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"/> like the [[concerto]], [[symphony]] and [[sonata]]. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as [[opera]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Who claims opera is a "sophisticated" form?}} In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment.

Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called [[movement (music)|movements]], often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements:

# an opening Allegro in [[sonata form]],
# a slow movement,
# a [[Minuet#Music|minuet]] or [[scherzo]] (in a [[triple metre]], such as {{music|time|3|4}}), and
# a final Allegro.

These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first [[Section (music)|sections]], then [[Period (music)|periods]], and finally [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].

==Performance==
[[File:Concertband.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Youth [[concert band]] in performance]]

Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] or [[Master of Music]] degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inputyouth.co.uk/jobguides/job-classicalmusician.html |title=Job Guide – Classical Musician |publisher=Inputyouth.co.uk |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>

Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in [[sight-reading]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] playing, [[Harmony|harmonic]] principles, strong [[ear training]] (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of [[performance practice]] (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from [[popular music]] and [[folk music]] is that the repertoire tends to be written down in [[musical notation]], creating a musical part or [[Sheet music|score]].<ref name="What is Classical Music? A Family Resemblance"/> This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: [[fugue]]s, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in [[counterpoint]] yet creating a coherent [[Diatonic function|harmonic logic]].<ref name=" Knud Jeppesen 2007">[[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with bold independence that is often breath-taking." Quoted from {{harvnb|Katz|1946}}</ref> The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago.

Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for [[musical improvisation]], from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise [[prelude (music)|preludes]], keyboard performers playing [[harpsichord]] would improvise [[chord (music)|chords]] from the [[figured bass]] symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise [[musical ornament]]s.<ref>Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. ''Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society.'' University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150</ref> [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/MusicPapers/baroque.html |title=On Baroque Improvisation |publisher=Community.middlebury.edu |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref> During the Classical era, the composer-performer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.<ref>David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95</ref> During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the [[cadenza]] sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] would improvise at the piano.<ref>Tilman Skowronek. ''Beethoven the Pianist''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160</ref>

==Instrumentation and vocal practices==
{{See also|Woodwind section|Brass section|String section|Percussion section|Keyboard section}}
The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematized in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an [[orchestra]] or in a [[concert band]], together with several other solo instruments (such as the [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[organ (music)|organ]]). The symphony orchestra includes members of the [[string instrument|string]], [[woodwind]], [[brass instrument|brass]], and [[percussion]] families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a [[double bass]]. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, [[polyphonic]] choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

==History==
{{Main|History of music}}
{{History of Western art music}}
[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|upright|Music notation from an early 14th-century English [[Missal]], featuring the head of Christ. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}]]
The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the [[Early music]] period, which includes [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras, and the [[Common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1820), and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] (1810–1910) eras. The current period encompasses the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] and the 21st-century to date and includes the [[modernism (music)|Modernist]] musical era and the [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary]] or [[postmodern music|Postmodern]] musical era, the dates of which are often disputed.

The dates are [[Dates of classical music eras|generalizations]], since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".<ref name="Mode and tempo">{{cite journal|author=Vladimir J. Konečni|title=Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era|journal=[[Empirical Musicology Review]]|volume=4|number=1|year=2009|hdl=1811/36604}}</ref> For example, the use of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], who is classified as typical of the Classical era. Beethoven, who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era.

The prefix ''neo-'' is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', for example, is a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era.{{Clarify|date=November 2017|reason=So a "Neo-medieval" work might be so-called because it resembles Renaissance music?}}

===Roots===
{{Main|Ancient music}}

Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via [[cheironomy]] and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC.<ref>{{cite book|title=Listening to Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Israel/Palestine|first=Theodore W.|last=Burgh|publisher=T. & T. Clark Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-0-567-02552-4}}</ref> The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as [[Aristoxenus]] and [[Pythagoras]].<ref name="Grout73p28">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], p. 28</ref> Pythagoras created a [[Pythagorean tuning|tuning]] system and helped to codify [[musical notation]]. Ancient Greek instruments such as the [[aulos]] (a [[reed instrument]]) and the [[lyre]] (a stringed instrument similar to a small [[harp]]) eventually led to several modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.{{sfn|Grout|Palisca|1988|p={{page needed|date=August 2019}}}} The antecedent to the early period was the era of [[ancient music]] before the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] (476 AD).

===Early period===
====Medieval era====
{{Main|Medieval music}}
{{See also|List of medieval composers}}[[File:Vielle.jpg|thumb|Musician playing the [[vielle]] (fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]])]]

The Medieval era includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. [[Monophony|Monophonic]] chant, also called plainsong or [[Gregorian chant]], was the dominant form until about 1100.<ref name="Grout73p75"/> Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3fExcE3ouRYC&q=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&pg=PA173 |title = Making Music and Having a Blast!: A Guide for All Music Students|first1= Bonnie |last1= Blanchard |first2= Cynthia |last2=Blanchard Acree |publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2009|isbn = 978-0-253-00335-5 |page = 173}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnu0BgAAQBAJ&q=catholic+monks+classical+music&pg=PA256|title=The Rough Guide to Classical Music|first=Rough|last=Guides|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|access-date=June 21, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1-84836-677-0}}</ref> [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], including the more complex voicings of [[motet]]s.

Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the [[flute]], the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]]. As well, early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a [[drone (music)|drone]] note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into ''haut'' (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and ''bas'' (quieter, more intimate instruments).{{sfn|Bowles|1954|loc=119 et passim}} During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the vocal music from the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]], was [[Monophony|monophonic]], using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.<ref>Hoppin (1978) p. 57<!-- I guess [[Richard Hoppin]], Medieval Music? -->{{incomplete short citation|date=January 2020}}</ref> [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century.

Notable Medieval composers include [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Francesco Landini]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].

====Renaissance era====
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
{{See also|List of Renaissance composers}}The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first [[Bass (sound)|bass instruments]]. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a [[staff (music)|staff]] and other elements of [[musical notation]] began to take shape.<ref name="Grout73p61">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], p. 61</ref> This invention made possible the separation of the [[Musical composition|composition]] of a piece of music from its ''transmission''; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted.

[[File:Chigi codex.jpg|left|thumb|360x360px|An illuminated opening from the [[Chigi codex]] featuring the [[Kyrie]] of [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]]'s ''Missa Ecce ancilla Domini'']]
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of [[Guild]]s and they included the [[slide trumpet]], the wooden [[cornet]], the valveless [[trumpet]] and the [[sackbut]]. Stringed instruments included the [[viol]], the [[rebec]], the harp-like [[lyre]], the [[hurdy-gurdy]], the [[lute]], the [[guitar]], the [[cittern]], the [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and the [[orpharion]]. [[Keyboard (music)|Keyboard]] instruments with strings included the [[harpsichord]] and the [[clavichord]]. Percussion instruments include the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], the [[Jew's harp]], the [[tambourine]], the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double-reed [[shawm]] (an early member of the [[oboe]] family), the [[reed pipe]], the [[bagpipe]], the [[transverse flute]], the [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]], the [[dulcian]], and the [[crumhorn]]. Simple [[pipe organ]]s existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.<ref name="Grout73p72">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 72–74</ref> Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.<ref name="Grout73p222">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 222–225</ref>

Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal]]) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer [[Jacopo Peri]] wrote ''[[Dafne]]'', the first work to be called an [[opera]] today. He also composed [[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]], the first opera to have survived to the present day.

Notable Renaissance composers include [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], [[John Dowland]], [[Jacob Obrecht]], [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Jacques Arcadelt]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]].

===Common-practice period===
The [[common practice period]] is typically defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of common-practice [[tonality]].<!-- sentence copied in part from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_practice_period&oldid=799911529--> The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.

====Baroque era====
{{Main|Baroque music}}
{{See also|List of Baroque composers}}
[[File:Baschenis - Musical Instruments.jpg|thumb|Baroque instruments including [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[harpsichord]], [[bass viol]], [[lute]], [[baroque violin|violin]], and [[baroque guitar]]]]
Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal [[counterpoint]] and the use of a [[basso continuo]], a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.<ref name=Kirgiss>{{cite book|last=Kirgiss|first=Crystal|title=Classical Music|year=2004|page=6|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1-58340-674-8}}</ref> The beginnings of the [[sonata form]] took shape in the [[canzona]], as did a more formalized notion of [[theme and variations]]. The tonalities of [[major and minor]] as means for managing dissonance and [[chromaticism]] in music took full shape.<ref name="Grout73p300">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 300–32</ref>

During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] became more common.<ref name="Grout73p341">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 341–55</ref> Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music.<ref name=Kirgiss/>

The theories surrounding [[equal temperament]] began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although [[J.S. Bach]] did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the [[meantone|meantone system]], common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible his ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.<ref name="Grout73p378">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], p. 378</ref><!-- This sentence is very wordy/hard to read. -->

Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g., the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm, [[cittern]], [[rackett]], and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the [[Baroque violin|violin]], [[viol]], [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[cello]], [[contrabass]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]] (which often played the [[basso continuo]] parts), [[mandolin]], [[Baroque guitar]], [[harp]] and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the [[Baroque flute]], [[Baroque oboe]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the [[bassoon]]. Brass instruments included the [[cornett]], [[natural horn]], [[Baroque trumpet]], [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[trombone]]. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]], the [[tangent piano]], the [[harpsichord]], the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], and, later in the period, the [[fortepiano]] (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and the [[castanets]].

One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. A Baroque ensemble could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/z2mv34j/revision/2|title=Baroque orchestral music|website=BBC|access-date=June 6, 2019}}</ref> additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute), bowed strings, woodwinds, and brass instruments, and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo,(e.g., a cello, contrabass, viola, bassoon, serpent, etc.).

Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of [[opera]] types such as [[opera seria]] and [[opéra comique]], and related forms such as [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s.<ref name="BritannicaCantata">{{cite web|title=Cantata|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name="BritannicaOratorio">{{cite web|title=Oratorio|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/oratorio|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref>

Though the term "classical music" includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, the Classical Era was the period of Western art music from the 1750s to the early 1820s—the era of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].

The Classical era established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The ''basic'' forces required for an [[orchestra]] became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for [[serenade#Classical and Romantic eras|serenades]]. [[Opera]] continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The ''[[opera buffa]]'', a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The [[symphony]] came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a [[harpsichord]] (which had been part of the traditional ''continuo'' in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the [[concertmaster]]).<ref name="Grout73p463">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], p. 463</ref>

Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern [[piano]]) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the [[violin]]), the Baroque oboe (which became the [[oboe]]) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and [[chamber music]] such as [[string quartet]]s were standardized as the four instruments which form the [[string section]] of the [[orchestra]]: the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed [[viol]]s were phased out. Woodwinds included the [[basset clarinet]], [[basset horn]], [[clarinette d'amour]], the Classical [[clarinet]], the [[chalumeau]], the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]] and the [[fortepiano]]. While the [[harpsichord]] was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use at the end of the century. Brass instruments included the [[buccin]], the [[ophicleide]] (a replacement for the bass [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], which was the precursor of the [[tuba]]) and the [[natural horn]].

Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While [[double reed|double-reed]] instruments like the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]] became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the [[clarinet]] family of [[single reed]]s was not widely used until [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward Kingdon|first1=Martha|title=Mozart and the clarinet|issue=2|pages=126–153|url=https://academic.oup.com/ml/article-abstract/XXVIII/2/126/1375956?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=[[Music & Letters]]|volume=XXVIII|access-date=November 5, 2017|doi=10.1093/ml/XXVIII.2.126|date=April 1, 1947}}</ref>

Major composers of this period include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]].

====Romantic era====
{{Main|Romantic music}}
{{See also|List of Romantic-era composers}}

The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling [[romanticism]] in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like [[nocturne]]s, [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.<ref name="Swafford200">[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 200</ref> The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.<ref name="Swafford201">[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 201</ref> The [[art song]] (or ''Lied'') came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of [[grand opera]], ultimately transcended by [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].<ref name="Grout73p595">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 595–612</ref>

In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in [[metallurgy]]) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred many piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.<ref name="Swafford201"/> Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini]], fulfilled both roles.<ref name="Grout73p543">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], p. 543</ref>

European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of [[nationalism in music]] (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.<ref name="Grout73p634">[[#Grout73|Grout (1973)]], pp. 634, 641–42</ref>

In the Romantic era, the modern [[piano]], with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ([[string section]], woodwinds, brass, and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers." <ref name="classicfm.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/romantic/romantic-music-beginners-guide/#FaXJhIVlfVSph9bq.97 |title=Romantic music: a beginner's guide – Music Periods |publisher=Classic FM |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>

The families of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew larger; a process that climaxed in the early 20th century with very large orchestras used by late romantic and modernist composers. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of [[rotary valve]]s made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.<ref name="Swafford201" /> [[Gustav Mahler]]'s 1906 [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Nashville Symphony|journal=[[American Record Guide]]|volume=76|number=1|pages=8–10|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> New woodwind instruments were added, such as the [[contrabassoon]], [[bass clarinet]] and [[piccolo]] and new percussion instruments were added, including [[xylophone]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[celesta]]s (a bell-like keyboard instrument), [[bell]]s, and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]],<ref name="classicfm.com" /> large [[orchestral harp]]s, and even [[wind machine]]s for [[sound effect]]s. [[Saxophone]]s appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards, usually featured as a solo instrument rather than as in integral part of the orchestra.

The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. It also has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]] and is also used in several late romantic and modernist works by Richard Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |access-date=June 4, 2014}}</ref> Cornets appear regularly in 19th century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century.

Prominent composers of this era include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and [[Johann Strauss II]]. [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]] are commonly regarded as transitional composers whose music combines both late romantic and early modernist elements.

===20th and 21st centuries===

{{Main|20th-century classical music|21st-century classical music}}

====Modernist era====
[[File:Stravinsky picasso.png|thumb|upright|[[Igor Stravinsky]], by [[Pablo Picasso]], collaborators on ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' (1920)]]
{{Main| Modernism (music)}}

Encompassing a wide variety of [[Post-romanticism|post-Romantic]] styles, modernist classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, expressionist, and neoclassical styles of composition. Modernism marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. Some music historians regard musical modernism as an era extending from about 1890 to 1930.<ref>{{harvnb|Károlyi|1994|loc=135}}; {{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–332}}</ref> Others consider that modernism ended with one or the other of the two world wars.{{sfn|Albright|2004|loc=13}} Still other authorities claim that modernism is not associated with any historical era, but rather is "an ''attitude'' of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times".{{sfn|McHard|2008|loc=14}} Despite its decline in the last third of the 20th century, there remained at the end of the century an active core of composers who continued to advance the ideas and forms of modernism, such as [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Toru Takemitsu]], [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], [[Jacob Druckman]], [[Brian Ferneyhough]], [[George Perle]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Richard Wernick]], [[Richard Edward Wilson|Richard Wilson]], and [[Ralph Shapey]].{{sfn|Botstein|2001|loc=§9}}

Two musical movements that were dominant during this time were the [[Impressionist music|impressionist]] beginning around 1890 and the [[Expressionist music|expressionist]] that started around 1908. It was a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of [[modernism]] in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is "innovation".{{sfn|Metzer|2009|loc=3}} Its leading feature is a "linguistic plurality", which is to say that no single [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}

The orchestra continued to grow in size during the early years modernist era, peaking in the first two decades of the 20th century. Saxophones that appeared only rarely during the 19th century became more commonly used as supplementary instruments, but never became core members of the orchestra. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works such as [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]] and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. In some compositions such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', two or more saxophones of different sizes are used to create an entire section like the other sections of the orchestra. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.

Prominent composers of the early 20th century include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Cécile Chaminade]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Amy Beach]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], along with the aforementioned Mahler and Strauss as transitional figures who carried over from the 19th century.

====Post-modern/contemporary era====
{{Main|Postmodern music|Contemporary classical music}}
{{See also| High modernism|List of 20th-century classical composers|List of 21st-century classical composers}}
[[Postmodern music]] is a period of music that began as early as 1930 according to some authorities.<ref name="auto">{{harvnb|Károlyi|1994|loc=135}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}</ref> It shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]] – that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]].

Some other authorities have more or less equated postmodern music with the "contemporary music" composed well after 1930, from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.{{sfn|Sullivan|1995|p=217}}{{sfn|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}} Some of the diverse movements of the postmodern/contemporary era include the neoromantic, neomedieval, minimalist, and post minimalist.

[[Contemporary classical music]] at the beginning of the 21st century was often considered to include all post-1945 musical forms.<ref>"Contemporary" in {{harvnb|Du Noyer|2003|p=272}}</ref> A generation later, this term now properly refers to the music of today written by composers who are still alive; music that came into prominence in the mid-1970s. It includes different variations of [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].<ref>[[Leon Botstein]], "Modernism", §9: The Late 20th Century, ''Grove Music'' (subscription access).</ref>

==Women in classical music==
{{see also|Women in classical music}}
{{Main|Women in music}}

Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the [[Western canon|standard concert repertoire]] are male composers, even though there has been a [[List of female composers|large number of women composers]] throughout the classical music period. Musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is [[Women in music|music composed by women]] so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"<ref name=Citron>{{cite book|last=Citron|first=Marcia J.|author-link=Marcia Citron|title=Gender and the Musical Canon|publisher=[[CUP Archive]]|year=1993|isbn=9780521392921|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gendermusicalcan00citr}}.{{page needed|date=August 2019}}</ref> Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works". She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed not to be notable as composers.<ref name=Citron /> In the "...''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann|Clara S[c]humann]] is one of the only{{sic}} female composers mentioned."<ref name=rvanews>{{cite web|author=Abbey Philips|url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992|title=The history of women and gender roles in music|publisher=Rvanews.com|date=September 1, 2011|access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref> Abbey Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."<ref name=rvanews />

Historically, major professional [[orchestra]]s have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of [[women in music|women being hired in professional orchestras]] was in the position of [[harp]]ist. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008.<ref name="The world's greatest orchestras">{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= October 24, 2012|access-date=April 29, 2013}}</ref> The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].<ref>[[James R.

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."<ref name=JP>Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997</ref> As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria|title=Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505070427/http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria|archive-date=May 5, 2009|publisher=[[France 24]]|date=May 8, 2008}}</ref> In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership.

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists," the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male".<ref>{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref> A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|'blind' auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."<ref>{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2014 |access-date=November 27, 2015}}</ref>

==Relationship to other music traditions==

===Popular music===
Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', genres exemplified by [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including [[Maurice Ravel]], exemplified by the movement entitled "Blues" in his sonata for violin and piano.<ref>{{GroveOnline |last=Kelly |first=Barbara L. |title=Ravel, Maurice, §3: 1918–37}}</ref> Some [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] and [[Postminimalism|postminimalist]] classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.<ref>See, for example, {{GroveOnline |last=Siôn |first=Pwyll Ap |title=Nyman, Michael}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=June 2018|reason=A single instance cannot verify a broader claim.}}

Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which ''[[Pachelbel's Canon#Pachelbel's canon in popular culture|Pachelbel's Canon]]'' has been put since the 1970s, and the musical [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.<ref>Notable examples are the ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series of recordings made by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists [[Vanessa Mae]] and [[Catya Maré]].</ref> In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a number of [[lead guitarist]]s (playing [[electric guitar]]), including [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[Randy Rhoads]],<ref>{{Cite thesis|last1=Carew|first1=Francis Wayne|title=The Guitar Voice of Randy Rhoads|date=January 1, 2018|pages=1–2|type=Master of Arts|publisher=[[Wayne State University]]|url=https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1668&context=oa_theses|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walser|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Walser (musicologist)|date=October 1992|title=Eruptions: heavy metal appropriations of classical virtuosity|journal=Popular Music|volume=11|issue=3|pages=263–308|doi=10.1017/s0261143000005158|issn=0261-1430}}</ref>

===Folk music===
Composers of classical music have often made use of [[folk music]] (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] and [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]],<ref name="Yeomans2">{{cite book|last=Yeomans|first=David|title=Piano Music of the Czech Romantics: A Performer's Guide|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-253-21845-2|page=2}}</ref> have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.<ref name="Stevens129">{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Haley|author2=Gillies, Malcolm|title=The Life and Music of Béla Bartók|year=1993|isbn=978-0-19-816349-7|page=129|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>

==Commercialization==
Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become [[cliché]]d, particularly the opening of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and the opening section "[[O Fortuna]]" of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''; other examples include the "[[Dies irae]]" from the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]], [[Edvard Grieg]]'s "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'', the opening bars of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" from ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]", and excerpts of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Several works from the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of Animation]] matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Tom and Jerry]]'s ''[[Johann Mouse]]'', and [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]´s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s "[[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]]". Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the [[music industry]] through inadequate representation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vancour|first=Shawn|title=Popularizing the Classics: Radio's Role in the Music Appreciation Movement 1922–34.|journal=Media, Culture and Society|date=March 2009|volume=31|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1177/0163443708100319|s2cid=144331723}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Main|Music education}}
During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the "[[Mozart effect]]": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' [[IQ]] by 8 to 9 points.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/23611|pmid=10476959|title=Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'?|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=400|issue=6747|pages=827–828|year=1999|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Bella|first2=Simone Dalla|last3=Peretz|first3=Isabelle|last4=Dunlop|first4=Tracey|last5=Dawe|first5=Lloyd A.|last6=Humphrey|first6=G.

[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDF1239F93BA1575BC0A962958260 "Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.</ref> Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on [[music education]] programs."<ref>Goode, Erica.

{{citation needed-span|date=April 2019|text=In 1996/97, a research study was conducted on a population of preschool through college students in the [[Cherry Creek School District]] in Denver, Colorado, US. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to [[rock-and-roll]] or [[Country music]] had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the [[University of Colorado]].}} This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N.
