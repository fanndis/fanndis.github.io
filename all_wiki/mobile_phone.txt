A '''mobile phone''', '''cellular phone, cell phone''', '''cellphone''', '''handphone''', or '''hand phone''', sometimes shortened to simply '''mobile''', '''cell''' or just '''phone''', is a portable [[telephone]] that can make and receive [[telephone call|calls]] over a [[radio frequency]] link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a [[mobile phone operator]], which provides access to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a [[cellular network]] architecture and, therefore, mobile telephones are called ''cellular telephones'' or ''cell phones'' in North America. In addition to [[telephony]], digital mobile phones ([[2G]]) support a variety of other [[GSM services|services]], such as [[text messaging]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], [[email]], [[Internet access]], short-range wireless communications ([[Infrared Data Association|infrared]], [[Bluetooth]]), business applications, [[video games]] and [[digital photography]]. Mobile phones offering only those capabilities are known as [[feature phone]]s; mobile phones which offer greatly advanced computing capabilities are referred to as [[smartphone]]s.

The development of [[metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) technology, [[information theory]] and [[cellular network]]ing led to the development of affordable [[mobile communications]].<ref name="Srivastava"/> The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by [[John Francis Mitchell|John F.

==History==
{{Main|History of mobile phones}}
[[File:2007Computex e21Forum-MartinCooper.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] of Motorola, shown here in a 2007 reenactment, made the first publicized handheld mobile phone call on a prototype DynaTAC model on 3 April 1973.]]

A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, [[Finland|Finnish]] inventor [[Eric Tigerstedt]] filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding telephone with a very thin carbon microphone". Early predecessors of cellular phones included [[analog signal|analog]] radio communications from ships and trains. The race to create truly portable telephone devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in [[mobile telephony]] have been traced in successive "generations", starting with the early zeroth-generation ([[Mobile radio telephone|0G]]) services, such as [[Bell System]]'s [[Mobile Telephone Service]] and its successor, the [[Improved Mobile Telephone Service]]. These 0G systems were not [[Cellular network|cellular]], supported few simultaneous calls, and were very expensive.

The GSM standard is a European initiative expressed at the CEPT ("Conférence Européenne des Postes et Telecommunications", European Postal and Telecommunications conference). The Franco-German R&D cooperation demonstrated the technical feasibility, and in 1987 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between 13 European countries who agreed to launch a commercial service by 1991. The first version of the GSM (=2G) standard had 6,000 pages.

By 2009, it had become clear that, at some point, 3G networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth-intensive applications, such as [[streaming media]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ece.iupui.edu/~dskim/Classes/ECE695MWN/2006-saeed-Capacity_Limit_Problem_in_3G_Networks.ppt | title=Capacity Limit Problem in 3G Networks | author=Fahd Ahmad Saeed | publisher=Purdue School of Engineering | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> Consequently, the industry began looking to data-optimized fourth-generation technologies, with the promise of speed improvements up to ten-fold over existing 3G technologies.

[[5G]] is a technology and term used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase in mobile telecommunication standards beyond the [[4G]]/[[IMT-Advanced]] standards. The term 5G is not officially used in any specification or official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as [[3GPP]], [[WiMAX]] Forum or [[ITU-R]]. New standards beyond 4G are currently being developed by standardization bodies, but they are at this time seen as under the 4G umbrella, not for a new mobile generation.

===Smartphone===
{{main|Smartphone}}
[[Smartphone]]s have a number of distinguishing features.  The [[International Telecommunication Union]] measures those with Internet connection, which it calls ''Active Mobile-Broadband subscriptions'' (which includes tablets, etc.). In the developed world, smartphones have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems. However, in the developing world, they account for around 50% of [[mobile telephony]].

===Feature phone===
{{main|Feature phone}}
Feature phone is a term typically used as a [[retronym]] to describe [[mobile phones]] which are limited in capabilities in contrast to a modern [[smartphone]]. Feature phones typically provide [[voice calling]] and [[text messaging]] functionality, in addition to basic [[multimedia]] and [[Internet]] capabilities, and other services offered by the user's [[wireless service provider]]. A feature phone has additional functions over and above a basic mobile phone which is only capable of voice calling and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/62894/feature-phone|title=feature phone Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|website=www.pcmag.com}}</ref><ref name="forbes-twoweeks">Todd Hixon, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddhixon/2012/11/13/two-weeks-with-a-dumb-phone/ Two Weeks With A Dumb Phone], ''Forbes'', 13 November 2012</ref> Feature phones and basic mobile phones tend to use a proprietary, custom-designed [[software]] and [[user interface]]. By contrast, smartphones generally use a [[mobile operating system]] that often shares common traits across devices.

==Infrastructure==
{{main|Cellular network|WiFi}}
Mobile phones communicate with cell towers that are placed to give coverage across a telephone service area which is divided up into 'cells'. Each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, and will typically be covered by three towers placed at different locations. The cell towers are usually interconnected to each other and the phone network and the internet by wired connections. Due to bandwidth limitations each cell will have a maximum number of cell phones it can handle at once. The cells are therefore sized depending on the expected usage density, and may be much smaller in cities. In that case much lower transmitter powers are used to avoid broadcasting beyond the cell.

In order to handle the high traffic, multiple towers can be set up in the same area (using different frequencies). This can be done permanently or temporarily such as at special events like at the Super Bowl, Taste of Chicago, State Fair, NYC New Year's Eve, hurricane hit cities, etc. where cell phone companies will bring a truck with equipment to host the abnormally high traffic with a portable cell.

Cellular can greatly increase the capacity of simultaneous wireless phone calls. While a phone company for example, has a license to 1,000 frequencies, each cell must use unique frequencies with each call using one of them when communicating. Because cells only slightly overlap, the same frequency can be reused. Example cell one uses frequency 1–500, next door cell uses frequency 501–1,000, next door can reuse frequency 1–500. Cells one and three are not "touching" and do not overlap/communicate so each can reuse the same frequencies.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

This is even more greatly increased when phone companies implemented digital networks. With digital, one frequency can host multiple simultaneous calls increasing capacity even more.

As a phone moves around, a phone will "hand off" - automatically disconnect and reconnect to the tower of another cell that gives the best reception.

Additionally, short-range [[Wi-Fi]] infrastructure is often used by smartphones as much as possible as it offloads traffic from cell networks on to local area networks.

==Hardware==
{{Main|Mobile phone features}}

The common components found on all mobile phones are:

* A [[central processing unit]] (CPU), the processor of phones. The CPU is a [[microprocessor]] fabricated on a [[metal–oxide–semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip.
* A [[battery (electricity)|battery]], providing the power source for the phone functions. A modern handset typically uses a [[lithium-ion battery]] (LIB), whereas older handsets used [[nickel–metal hydride]] (Ni–MH) batteries.
* An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. These are a [[keypad]] for feature phones, and [[touch screens]] for most smartphones (typically with [[capacitive sensing]]).
* A [[display device|display]] which echoes the user's typing, and displays text messages, contacts, and more. The display is typically either a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) or [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) display.
* [[Loudspeaker|Speakers]] for sound.
* [[Subscriber Identity Module]] (SIM) cards and [[Removable User Identity Module]] (R-UIM) cards.
* A hardware [[notification LED]] on some phones

Low-end mobile phones are often referred to as [[feature phone]]s and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications are known as [[smartphone]]s.

===Central processing unit===
Mobile phones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments.

Mobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])<ref>{{cite web
 | title = CPU Frequency
 | work = CPU World Glossary
 | publisher = CPU World
 | date = 25 March 2008
 | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html
 | accessdate =1 January 2010 }}</ref> but also the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

===Display===
{{main|Display device}}
One of the main characteristics of phones is the [[Display device|screen]]. Depending on the device's type and design, the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device's front surface. Many smartphone displays have an [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], but taller aspect ratios became more common in 2017.

Screen sizes are often measured in diagonal [[inch]]es or [[millimeter]]s; feature phones generally have screen sizes below {{convert|3.5|inch|mm|round=5|order=flip}}. Phones with screens larger than {{convert|5.2|inch|mm|round=5|order=flip}} are often called "[[phablet]]s." Smartphones with screens over {{convert|4.5|inch|mm|round=5|order=flip}} in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand, since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface; they may need to be shifted around in the hand, held in one hand and manipulated by the other, or used in place with both hands. Due to design advances, some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and "edge-to-edge" designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics, while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller 16:9 displays.<ref name="phonearena-s7edgenotphablet">{{cite web|title=Don't call it a phablet: the 5.5" Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is narrower than many 5.2" devices|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Dont-call-it-a-phablet-the-5.5-Samsung-Galaxy-S7-Edge-is-narrower-than-many-5.2-devices_id79482|website=PhoneArena|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="verge-phabletpytha">{{cite web|title=We're gonna need Pythagoras' help to compare screen sizes in 2017|url=https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/30/15120824/screen-aspect-ratio-mathematics-galaxy-s8-lg-g6|website=The Verge|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="verge-s8aspectratio">{{cite web|title=The Samsung Galaxy S8 will change the way we think about display sizes|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/30/15121526/samsung-galaxy-s8-vs-google-pixel-iphone-7-screen-size-comparison|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>

[[Liquid-crystal display]]s are the most common; others are [[IPS panel|IPS]], [[LED]], [[OLED]], and [[AMOLED]] displays. Some displays are integrated with pressure-sensitive digitizers, such as those developed by [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] and [[Samsung]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=J.

===Sound===
In sound, smartphones and feature phones vary little. Some audio-quality enhancing features, such as [[Voice over LTE]] and [[HD Voice]], have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones.  Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone, the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in [[long-distance call]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/wireless/why-mobile-voice-quality-still-stinksand-how-to-fix-it|title=Why Mobile Voice Quality Still Stinks—and How to Fix It|author=Jeff Hecht|work=ieee.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-cell-phone-call-quality-so-terrible|title=Why Is Cell Phone Call Quality So Terrible?|author=Elena Malykhina|work=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>  Audio quality can be improved using a [[VoIP]] application over [[WiFi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/whats-the-best-mobile-voip-app-1579791681|title=What's the Best Mobile VoIP App?|author=Alan Henry|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker}}</ref> Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a [[speakerphone]] feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear. The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component, without holding the phone close to the ear.

===Battery===
The average phone battery lasts 2–3 years at best. Many of the wireless devices use a Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery, which charges 500–2500 times, depending on how users take care of the battery and the charging techniques used.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.phonedog.com/2011/08/07/how-to-prolong-your-cell-phone-battery-s-life-span|title=How To Prolong Your Cell Phone Battery's Life Span|last=Taylor|first=Martin|work=Phonedog.com|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> It is only natural for these rechargeable batteries to chemically age, which is why the performance of the battery when used for a year or two will begin to deteriorate.

===SIM card===
{{Main|Subscriber Identity Module|Removable User Identity Module}}
[[File:Typical cellphone SIM cards.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical mobile phone mini-[[SIM card]]]]
Mobile phones require a small [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] called a Subscriber Identity Module or [[SIM card]], in order to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] and the [[Authentication Center|K<sub>i</sub>]] used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device, provided that this is not prevented by a [[SIM lock]]. The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke & Devrient]] for the Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

A hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four [[SIM card]]s, with a phone having an IMEI per SIM Card. SIM and [[R-UIM]] cards may be mixed together to allow both [[GSM]] and [[CDMA]] networks to be accessed. From 2010 onwards, such phones became popular in emerging markets,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets | title=Smartphone boom lifts phone market in first quarter | agency=Reuters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508150638/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets|archive-date=8 May 2011|date=29 April 2011|accessdate=6 May 2019}}</ref> and this was attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate.

==Software==

===Software platforms===

Feature phones have basic software platforms. Smartphones have advanced software platforms. [[Android (operating system)|Android OS]] has been the [[Usage share of operating systems|best-selling OS]] worldwide on smartphones since 2011.

===Mobile app===
{{main|Mobile app}}
A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone. The term "app" is a shortening of the term "software application".

;Messaging
{{see also|SMS|Multimedia Messaging Service{{!}}MMS}}
[[File:IPhone Text Message Amber Alert 1882467856 o.jpg|thumb|A text message (SMS)]]

A common data application on mobile phones is [[SMS|Short Message Service]] (SMS) text messaging. The first SMS message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993. The first [[mobile news]] service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and subsequently many organizations provided "on-demand" and "instant" news services by SMS. [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) was introduced in 2001.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The introduction of Apple's App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted [[list of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices|online distribution]] for third-party applications (software and computer programs) focused on a single platform. There are a huge variety of apps, including [[video game]]s, music products and business tools. Up until that point, smartphone application distribution depended on [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices#Third-party platforms|third-party sources]] providing applications for multiple platforms, such as [[GetJar]], [[Handango]], [[Handmark]], and [[PocketGear]]. Following the success of the App Store, other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores, such as Google's Android Market (later renamed to the Google Play Store) and RIM's [[BlackBerry App World]] and Android-related app stores like [[F-Droid]]. In February 2014, 93% of [[mobile developers]] were targeting smartphones first for mobile app development.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/02/w3c-interview-vision-mobile-on-the-app-developer-economy-with-matos-kapetanakis-and-dimitris-michalakos/ W3C Interview: Vision Mobile on the App Developer Economy with Matos Kapetanakis and Dimitris Michalakos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629101713/http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/02/w3c-interview-vision-mobile-on-the-app-developer-economy-with-matos-kapetanakis-and-dimitris-michalakos/ |date=29 June 2016 }}. 18 February 2014.

[[File:Mobile phone subscribers 1997-2014 ITU.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants. 2014 figure is estimated.]]
Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, such as keeping in touch with family members, for conducting business, and in order to have access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people carry more than one mobile phone for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans.  For example, a particular plan might provide for cheaper local calls, long-distance calls, international calls, or roaming.

The mobile phone has been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society.  For example:
* A study by [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] found that one in ten mobile phone subscribers have a second phone that is often kept secret from other family members. These phones may be used to engage in such activities as extramarital affairs or clandestine business dealings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1602044.stm |title=Millions keep secret mobile |work=BBC News |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}</ref>
* Some organizations assist victims of domestic violence by providing mobile phones for use in emergencies. These are often refurbished phones.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Brooks |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_S_helpphones13.3d74734.html |title=Donated cell phones help battered women |publisher=The Press-Enterprise |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925105500/http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_S_helpphones13.3d74734.html |archive-date=25 September 2009 }}</ref>
* The advent of widespread text-messaging has resulted in the [[cell phone novel]], the first literary genre to emerge from the cellular age, via [[text messaging]] to a website that collects the novels as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodyear |first=Dana |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/22/081222fa_fact_goodyear |title=Letter from Japan: I ♥ Novels |work=The New Yorker |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref>
* [[Mobile telephony]] also facilitates activism and [[citizen journalism]].
* The [[United Nations]] reported that mobile phones have spread faster than any other form of technology and can improve the livelihood of the poorest people in developing countries, by providing access to information in places where [[landline]]s or the Internet are not available, especially in the [[least developed countries]]. Use of mobile phones also spawns a wealth of micro-enterprises, by providing such work as selling airtime on the streets and repairing or refurbishing handsets.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/assets/print?aid=USTRE69D4XA20101014 | work=Reuters | first=Jonathan | last=Lynn | title=Mobile phones help lift poor out of poverty: U.N. study | accessdate=3 December 2013}}</ref>
* In [[Mali]] and other African countries, people used to travel from village to village to let friends and relatives know about weddings, births, and other events.  This can now be avoided in areas with mobile phone coverage, which are usually more extensive than areas with just land-line penetration.
* The TV industry has recently started using mobile phones to drive live TV viewing through mobile apps, advertising, [[social TV]], and [[mobile TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campustvs.com/ |title=4 Ways Smartphones Can Save Live TV |publisher=Tvgenius.net |accessdate=4 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514021048/http://www.campustvs.com/ |archive-date=14 May 2012 }}</ref> It is estimated that 86% of Americans use their mobile phone while watching TV.
* In some parts of the world, mobile phone sharing is common. Cell phone sharing is prevalent in urban India, as families and groups of friends often share one or more mobile phones among their members. There are obvious economic benefits, but often familial customs and traditional gender roles play a part.<ref>Donner, Jonathan, and Steenson, Molly Wright. "Beyond the Personal and Private: Modes of Mobile Phone Sharing in Urban India." In ''The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices'', edited by Scott Campbell and Rich Ling, 231–50.

===Content distribution===
In 1998, one of the first examples of [[content distribution|distributing and selling media content]] through the mobile phone was the sale of [[ringtone]]s by [[Radiolinja]] in Finland. Soon afterwards, other media content appeared, such as news, video games, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. Most early content for mobile phones tended to be copies of [[legacy media]], such as banner advertisements or TV news highlight video clips. Recently, unique content for mobile phones has been emerging, from ringtones and [[ringback tones]] to [[mobisodes]], video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.

===Mobile banking and payment===
[[File:Mobile payment 01.jpg|thumb|Mobile payment system]]
{{main|Mobile banking|Mobile payment}}
{{see also|Branchless banking|Contactless payment}}
In many countries, mobile phones are used to provide [[mobile banking]] services, which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message. Kenya's [[M-PESA]] mobile banking service, for example, allows customers of the mobile phone operator [[Safaricom]] to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards. Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M-PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies.

[[Branchless banking]] has also been successful in South Africa and the [[Philippines]]. A pilot project in [[Bali]] was launched in 2011 by the [[International Finance Corporation]] and an [[Indonesia]]n bank, [[Bank Mandiri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/01/branchless-banking-start-bali.html |title=Branchless banking to start in Bali |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref>

Another application of mobile banking technology is [[Zidisha]], a US-based nonprofit micro-lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide. Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments, transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia/ |title="Zidisha Set to "Expand" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010 |publisher=Microfinancefocus.com |date=7 February 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921054251/http://www.microfinancefocus.com/news/2010/02/07/zidisha-set-to-expand-in-peer-to-peer-microfinance-julia-kurnia |archive-date=21 September 2012 }}</ref>

Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in [[Espoo]] were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999, the Philippines launched the country's first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators [[Globe Telecom|Globe]] and [[Smart Communications|Smart]].

Some mobile phones can make [[mobile payment]]s via direct mobile billing schemes, or through [[contactless payment]]s if the phone and the [[point of sale]] support [[near field communication]] (NFC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |title=Mobile Payments: Look to Korea |author=Feig, Nancy |publisher=banktech.com |date=25 June 2007 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326155917/http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |archive-date=26 March 2010 }}</ref> Enabling contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators, and retail merchants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/mobile-apps/news/nfc-mobile-phone-explode-1110/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124001632/http://connectedplanetonline.com/mobile-apps/news/nfc-mobile-phone-explode-1110/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 January 2010 |title=NFC mobile phone set to explode |author=Ready, Sarah |publisher=connectedplanetonline.com |date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}

===Mobile tracking===
{{see also|Cellphone surveillance|Mobile phone tracking}}

Mobile phones are commonly used to collect location data. While the phone is turned on, the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not) using a technique known as [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the mobile phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.<ref name="bbc-phone-locate">{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm |title= Tracking a suspect by mobile phone |date= 3 August 2005 |work= BBC News |accessdate= 14 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="foxnews-phone-locate">{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/03/18/cell-phone-tracking-can-locate-terrorists-but-only-where-it-legal/ |title= Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists&nbsp;— But Only Where It's Legal |last= Miller |first= Joshua |date= 14 March 2009 |work= FOX News |accessdate= 4 February 2014}}</ref>

The movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and if desired, by law enforcement agencies and their governments. Both the [[SIM card]] and the handset can be tracked.<ref name="bbc-phone-locate"/>

China has proposed using this technology to track the commuting patterns of Beijing city residents.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/03/china_said_it_may_begin.html |author= Cecilia Kang |title= China plans to track cellphone users, sparking human rights concerns |work= The Washington Post |date= 3 March 2011}}</ref>  In the UK and US, law enforcement and intelligence services use mobile phones to perform surveillance operations.

===While driving===
{{Main|Mobile phones and driving safety|Texting while driving}}

[[File:Hand held phone in car.JPG|thumb|right|A driver using two handheld mobile phones at once]]

Mobile phone use while driving, including talking on the phone, texting, or operating other phone features, is common but controversial. It is widely considered dangerous due to [[distracted driving]]. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents. In September 2010, the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) reported that 995 people were killed by [[Restrictions on cell phone use by U.S. drivers|drivers distracted by cell phones]]. In March 2011, a U.S. insurance company, [[State Farm Insurance]], announced the results of a study which showed 19% of drivers surveyed accessed the Internet on a smartphone while driving.<ref name=post>{{cite news |title=Quit Googling yourself and drive: About 20% of drivers using Web behind the wheel, study says |work=Los Angeles Times |date=4 March 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/03/honk-if-youre-googling-20-of-drivers-using-web-behind-the-wheel-says-study.html/ }}</ref> Many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. In Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal, and Singapore, both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone (which uses a [[speakerphone]]) is banned.  In other countries, including the UK and France and in many [[Restrictions on cell phone use by US drivers|U.S. states]], only handheld phone use is banned while hands-free use is permitted.

A 2011 study reported that over 90% of college students surveyed text (initiate, reply or read) while driving.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Choice to Text and Drive in Younger Drivers: Behaviour May Shape Attitude|last1 = Atchley|first1 = Paul|date = January 2011|journal = Accident Analysis and Prevention|doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2010.08.003|pmid = 21094307|first2 = Stephanie|last2 = Atwood|last3 = Boulton|first3 = Aaron|volume=43|issue = 1|pages=134–142}}</ref>
The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or ''[[texting while driving]]'', is limited. A simulation study at the [[University of Utah]] found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/NEWS01/707140333&template=printart|title=Text messaging not illegal but data clear on its peril}}</ref>

Due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones, they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses. This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices. This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather than those which ban handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a phone call when, in fact, they were using the device legally, for example, when using the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo, [[GPS]] or [[satnav]].

A 2010 study reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while [[cycling]] and its effects on behaviour and safety.<ref>de Waard, D., Schepers, P., Ormel, W. and Brookhuis, K., 2010, ''Mobile phone use while cycling: Incidence and effects on behaviour and safety'', ''Ergonomics'', Vol 53, No. 1, January 2010, pp. 30–42.</ref> In 2013, a national survey in the US reported the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the Internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/12/distracted-driving-accessing-internet/3497721/|title=Drivers still Web surfing while driving, survey finds|website=USA TODAY}}</ref> A study conducted by the University of Vienna examined approaches for reducing inappropriate and problematic use of mobile phones, such as using mobile phones while driving.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.hergovich/php/reaching_the_mobile_respondent_soc.sci.comp.rev.pdf |title = Reaching the Mobile Respondent: Determinants of High-Level Mobile Phone Use Among a High-Coverage Group  |journal = Social Science Computer Review |volume = 28 |issue = 3 |pages = 336–349 |doi = 10.1177/0894439309353099|year = 2010 |last1 = Burger |first1 = Christoph |last2 = Riemer |first2 = Valentin |last3 = Grafeneder |first3 = Jürgen |last4 = Woisetschläger |first4 = Bianca |last5 = Vidovic |first5 = Dragana |last6 = Hergovich |first6 = Andreas |s2cid = 61640965 }}</ref>

Accidents involving a driver being distracted by talking on a mobile phone have begun to be prosecuted as negligence similar to speeding. In the [[United Kingdom]], from 27 February 2007, motorists who are caught using a hand-held mobile phone while driving will have three penalty points added to their license in addition to the fine of £60.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6287005.stm|title=Drivers face new phone penalties|date=22 January 2007|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> This increase was introduced to try to stem the increase in drivers ignoring the law.<ref name="BBC2">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6382077.stm|title=Careless talk|date=22 February 2007|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[Japan]] prohibits all mobile phone use while driving, including use of hands-free devices.

===Health effects===
{{Main|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
{{See also|Nomophobia|Mobile phone overuse}}
The effect of mobile phone radiation on human health is the subject of recent{{When|date=October 2017}} interest and study, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. Mobile phones use [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[microwave]] range, which some believe may be harmful to human health. A large body of research exists, both [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] and experimental, in [[animal model|non-human animals]] and in humans.  The majority of this research shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans. This is often paraphrased simply as the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones, although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship, or are inconclusive. Other [[Wireless electronic devices and health|digital wireless systems]], such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

On 31 May 2011, the [[World Health Organization]] stated that mobile phone use may possibly represent a long-term health risk,<ref>{{cite web|title=IARC Classifies Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans |url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|work=World Health Organization}}</ref><ref name="World Health Organization">{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=19 January 2008|date= 5 December 2005|work= Online Q&A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> classifying mobile phone radiation as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" after a team of scientists reviewed studies on mobile phone safety.<ref name="cnnwhocarcinogenic">{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/31/who.cell.phones/index.html|title= WHO: Cell phone use can increase possible cancer risk|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=CNN|date=31 May 2011}}</ref> The mobile phone is in [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|category 2B]], which ranks it alongside [[coffee]] and other possibly carcinogenic substances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsGroupOrder.pdf|title=Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–107|website=monographs.iarc.fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kovvali|first=Gopala|title=Cell phones are as carcinogenic as coffee|journal=Journal of Carcinogenesis|date=1 January 2011|volume=10|issue=1|page=18|doi=10.4103/1477-3163.83044|pmid=21799662|pmc=3142790}}</ref>

Some recent{{When|date=October 2017}} studies have found an association between mobile phone use and certain kinds of brain and salivary gland tumors. [[Lennart Hardell]] and other authors of a 2009 meta-analysis of 11 studies from peer-reviewed journals concluded that cell phone usage for at least ten years "approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same ('ipsilateral') side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khurana|first=VG|author2=Teo C |author3=Kundi M |author4=Hardell L |author5=Carlberg M |title=Cell phones and brain tumors: A review including the long term epidemiologic data|journal=Surgical Neurology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/j.surneu.2009.01.019|pmid=19328536|year=2009}}</ref>

One study of past mobile phone use cited in the report showed a "40% increased risk for [[gliomas]] (brain cancer) in the highest category of heavy users (reported average: 30 minutes per day over a 10‐year period)".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cell-phones-cause-cancer-2011-5 |title=World Health Organization: Cell Phones May Cause Cancer|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref> This is a reversal of the study's prior position that cancer was unlikely to be caused by cellular phones or their base stations and that reviews had found no convincing evidence for other health effects.<ref name="World Health Organization" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile telephones and their base stations|accessdate=19 January 2008|date=June 2000|work= Fact sheet N°193|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}</ref> However, a study published 24 March 2012, in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' questioned these estimates because the increase in brain cancers has not paralleled the increase in mobile phone use.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Little MP, Rajaraman P, Curtis RE, etal | title = Mobile phone use and glioma risk: comparison of epidemiological study results with incidence trends in the United States | journal = BMJ | year = 2012 | volume=344 | pages=e1147 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e1147 | pmid=22403263 | pmc=3297541}}</ref> Certain countries, including France, have warned against the use of mobile phones by minors in particular, due to health risk uncertainties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0223157720080102|title=France warns against excessive mobile phone use|accessdate=10 May 2010|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Reuters|author=Brian Rohan}}</ref> Mobile pollution by transmitting electromagnetic waves can be decreased up to 90% by adopting the circuit as designed in mobile phone and mobile exchange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ijcnwc.org/papers/vol2no52012/3vol2no5.pdf|title=Mobile Phone and System Are Designed In A Novel Way To Have Minimum Electromagnetic Wave Transmission In Air and Minimum Electrical Power Consumption|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Pijush Kanti (2012)|website=International Journal of Computer Networks and Wireless Communications [IJCNWC], vol. 2, no. 5, pp. 556–59, 2012.}}</ref>

In May 2016, preliminary findings of a long-term study by the U.S. government suggested that radio-frequency (RF) radiation, the type emitted by cell phones, can cause cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/05/federal-study-links-cell-phone-radiation-cancer/|title="Game-changing" study links cellphone radiation to cancer}}</ref><ref>[http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/05/26/055699.full.pdf "Report of Partial Findings from the National Toxicology Program Carcinogenesis Studies of Cell Phone Radiofrequency Radiation in Hsd: Sprague Dawley® SD rats (Whole Body Exposures) – Draft 5-19-2016"]</ref>

===Educational impact===
{{see also|Mobile phone use in schools}}
A study by the [[London School of Economics]] found that banning mobile phones in schools could increase pupils' academic performance, providing benefits equal to one extra week of schooling per year.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Social media 'more stressful than exams'|last=Davis|first=Anna|date=18 May 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=13}}</ref>

===Electronic waste regulation===
[[File:Handy schrott mobile phone scrap.jpg|right|thumb|Scrapped mobile phones]]
{{see also|Mobile phone recycling}}
Studies have shown that around 40–50% of the environmental impact of mobile phones occurs during the manufacture of their printed wiring boards and integrated circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informinc.org/pages/media/the-secret-life-series/the-secret-life-of-cell-phones.html|title=The Secret Life Series – Environmental Impacts of Cell Phones|publisher=Inform, Inc.|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>

The average user replaces their mobile phone every 11 to 18 months,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/engineering-information-technology/e-waste-research-group/facts-figures|title=E-waste research group, Facts and figures|publisher=Griffith University|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref> and the discarded phones then contribute to [[electronic waste]].  Mobile phone manufacturers within [[Europe]] are subject to the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|WEEE directive]], and Australia has introduced a mobile phone recycling scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arp.net.au/envcha.php|title=Mobile Phone Waste and The Environment|publisher=Aussie Recycling Program|accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>

[[Apple Inc.]] had an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter called Liam specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.<sup>[[Apple Inc.|[350]]]</sup>

===Theft===
According to the [[Federal Communications Commission]], one out of three robberies involve the theft of a cellular phone.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Police data in San Francisco show that half of all robberies in 2012 were thefts of cellular phones.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} An online petition on [[Change.org]], called ''[[Secure our Smartphones]]'', urged smartphone manufacturers to install [[kill switch]]es in their devices to make them unusable if stolen. The petition is part of a joint effort by New York Attorney General [[Eric Schneiderman]] and San Francisco District Attorney [[George Gascón]] and was directed to the [[CEO]]s of the major smartphone manufacturers and telecommunication carriers.<ref>[http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/plea-urges-anti-theft-phone-tech/Content?oid=2447711  Adams, Mike "Plea Urges Anti-Theft Phone Tech"] ''San Francisco Examiner'' 7 June 2013 p. 5</ref> On 10 June 2013, Apple announced that it would install a "[[kill switch]]" on its [[iOS 7|next iPhone operating system]], due to debut in October 2013.<ref>"Apple to add kill switches to help combat iPhone theft" by Jaxon Van Derbeken ''San  Francisco Chronicle'' 11 June 2013 p. 1</ref>

All mobile phones have a unique identifier called [[International Mobile Station Equipment Identity|IMEI]]. Anyone can report their phone as lost or stolen with their Telecom Carrier, and the IMEI would be blacklisted with a central registry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imeipro.info/|title=IMEIpro – free IMEI number check service|website=www.imeipro.info|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref> Telecom carriers, depending upon local regulation can or must implement blocking of blacklisted phones in their network. There are, however, a number of ways to circumvent a blacklist. One method is to send the phone to a country where the telecom carriers are not required to implement the blacklisting and sell it there,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/combatting-theft-with-stolen-phone-blacklists/|title=How stolen phone blacklists will tamp down on crime, and what to do in the mean time|date=27 November 2012|language=en-US|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref> another involves altering the phone's IMEI number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockphonetool.com/how-to-change-imei-number/|title=How To Change IMEI Number|date=1 July 2015|language=en-US|access-date=29 September 2016}}</ref> Even so, mobile phones typically have less value on the second-hand market if the phones original IMEI is blacklisted.

An unusual example of a phone bill caused by theft (reported on 28 June 2018) was when a biological group in Poland put a [[GPS tracker]] on a [[white stork]] and released it; during autumn [[Animal migration|migration]] over the [[Blue Nile]] valley in eastern [[Sudan]] someone got hold of the stork's GPS tracker, and found in it a mobile-phone-type [[sim card]], which he put in his mobile phone, and made 20 hours of calls on it, running up a bill of over 10,000 Polish [[zloty]]s (US$2,700) for the biological group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-44645217 |title=Polish charity gets huge phone bill thanks to stork |work=BBC News |date=28 June 2018 |accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>

===Conflict minerals===
{{main|Conflict minerals}}

Demand for metals used in mobile phones and other electronics fuelled the [[Second Congo War]], which claimed almost 5.5 million lives.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8792068/Is-your-mobile-phone-helping-fund-war-in-Congo.html |title=Is your mobile phone helping fund war in Congo? |date= 27 September 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> In a 2012 news story, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: "In unsafe mines deep underground in eastern Congo, [[Child labour|children are working]] to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry. The profits from the minerals finance the bloodiest conflict since the second world war; the war has lasted nearly 20 years and has recently flared up again. ... For the last 15 years, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] has been a major source of natural resources for the mobile phone industry."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/congo-child-labour-mobile-minerals |title= Children of the Congo who risk their lives to supply our mobile phones |date= 7 December 2012 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The company [[Fairphone]] has worked to develop a mobile phone that does not contain [[Conflict resource|conflict minerals]].

==={{anchor|Kosher phone}}Kosher phones===
Due to concerns by the [[Orthodox Jewish]] rabbinate in Britain that texting by youths could waste time and lead to "immodest" communication, the rabbinate recommended that phones with text-messaging capability not be used by children; to address this, they gave their official approval to a brand of "Kosher" phones with no texting capabilities.  Although these phones are intended to prevent [[Immodesty#Judaism|immodesty]], some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices; other Orthodox Jews question the need for them.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Brunwasser |url=http://www.theworld.org/2012/01/kosher-phones-orthodox-jews/ |title=Kosher Phones For Britain's Orthodox Jews |work=Public Radio International |date= January 25, 2012 }}</ref>

In Israel, similar phones to kosher phones with restricted features exist to observe the [[Shabbat|sabbath]]; under Orthodox Judaism, the use of any electrical device is generally prohibited during this time, other than to save lives, or reduce the risk of death or similar needs. Such phones are approved for use by essential workers, such as health, security, and public service workers.<ref name=kosher>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154153|title=Introducing: A 'Kosher Phone' Permitted on Shabbat|first= Rachel |last= Hirshfeld |date= March 26, 2012 |work= Arutz Sheva}}</ref>
