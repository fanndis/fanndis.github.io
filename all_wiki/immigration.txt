==History==

[[File:Immigration Schild.jpg|thumb|Sign ''Immigration'' near the border between Mali and Mauritania; sponsored by EU]]
The term ''immigration'' was coined in the 17th century, referring to non-warlike population movements between the emerging [[nation state]]s.

When people cross [[Border|national borders]] during their migration, they are called migrants or immigrants (from Latin: ''migrare'', wanderer) from the perspective of the country which they enter. From the perspective of the country which they leave, they are called emigrant or outmigrant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/outmigrant|title=outmigrant|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref> [[Sociology]] designates immigration usually as [[Human migration|migration]] (as well as [[emigration]] accordingly outward migration).

{{As of|2015}}, the number of international migrants has reached 244 million worldwide, which reflects a 41% increase since 2000. One third of the world's international migrants are living in just 20 countries. The largest number of international migrants live in the [[Immigration to the United States|United States]], with 19% of the world's total. [[Immigration to Germany|Germany]] and Russia host 12 million migrants each, taking the second and third place in countries with the most migrants worldwide. Saudi Arabia hosts 10 million migrants, followed by the [[Modern immigration to the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (9 million) and the United Arab Emirates (8 million).<ref name=":15">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/populationfacts/docs/MigrationPopFacts20154.pdf|title=Trends in international migration, 2015 |date=December 2015|website=UN.org|publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>

Between 2000 and 2015, Asia added more international migrants than any other major area in the world, gaining 26 million. Europe added the second largest with about 20 million. In most parts of the world, migration occurs between countries that are located within the same major area.<ref name=":15" />

In 2015, the number of international migrants below the age of 20 reached 37 million, while 177 million are between the ages of 20 and 64. International migrants living in Africa were the youngest, with a median age of 29, followed by Asia (35 years), and Latin America/Caribbean (36 years), while migrants were older in Northern America (42 years), Europe (43 years), and Oceania (44 years).<ref name=":15" />

One theory of immigration distinguishes between push and pull factors.<ref name="knaw"/>

Push factors refer primarily to the motive for immigration from the country of origin. In the case of economic migration (usually labor migration), differentials in [[wage rate]]s are common. If the value of wages in the new country surpasses the value of wages in one's native country, he or she may choose to migrate, as long as the costs are not too high. Particularly in the 19th century, economic expansion of the US increased immigrant flow, and nearly 15% of the population was [[foreign born]],<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://immigrationlawnj.com/how-many-people-are-immigrants/|title = How Many People are Immigrants?|date = 4 July 2015|accessdate = 30 July 2015|website = Harlan York and Associates|last1 = York|first1 = Harlan|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150909231007/https://immigrationlawnj.com/how-many-people-are-immigrants/|archive-date = 9 September 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> thus making up a significant amount of the labor force.

As transportation technology improved, travel time, and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. Travel across the Atlantic used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> When the [[opportunity cost]] is lower, the immigration rates tend to be higher.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Escape from [[poverty]] (personal or for relatives staying behind) is a traditional push factor, and the availability of [[employment|jobs]] is the related pull factor. [[Natural disasters]] can amplify poverty-driven migration flows. Research shows that for middle-income countries, higher temperatures increase emigration rates to urban areas and to other countries. For low-income countries, higher temperatures reduce emigration.<ref name="CattaneoPeri2016">{{Cite journal|title = The Migration Response to Increasing Temperatures  | first1 =  Cristina | last1 =  Cattaneo|first2 = Giovanni|last2 = Peri |year=2016 |journal=[[Journal of Development Economics]] |volume=122 |issue=C |pages=127–146 |doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2016.05.004 |hdl = 10419/130264| url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w21622.pdf }}</ref>

Emigration and immigration are sometimes mandatory in a contract of employment: religious [[Missionary|missionaries]] and employees of [[transnational corporations]], international [[non-governmental organizations]], and the [[diplomatic service]] expect, by definition, to work "overseas". They are often referred to as "[[expatriates]]", and their conditions of employment are typically equal to or better than those applying in the host country (for similar work).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Non-economic push factors include [[persecution]] (religious and otherwise), frequent abuse, [[bullying]], [[oppression]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[genocide]], risks to civilians during [[war]], and social marginalization.<ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=224241|title=The Earnings of Male Hispanic Immigrants in the United States | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = Barry|date=March 2000|website=Social Science Research Network|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Chicago]] Institute for the Study of Labor|type=Working paper}}</ref> Political motives traditionally motivate refugee flows; for instance, people may emigrate in order to escape a [[dictatorship]].<ref name="Borjas2016">{{Cite journal | last1 = Borjas | first1 = George J.|date=1 April 1982|title=The Earnings of Male Hispanic Immigrants in the United States |journal=Industrial & Labor Relations Review|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–353|doi=10.1177/001979398203500304| s2cid = 36445207|issn=0019-7939| url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/55a1d87e227714a252fd06305439207338eae07a}}</ref>

Some migration is for personal reasons, based on a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] (e.g. to be with family or a partner), such as in [[family reunification]] or [[transnational marriage]] (especially in the instance of a [[gender imbalance]]). Recent research has found gender, age, and cross-cultural differences in the ownership of the idea to immigrate.<ref name="Rubin2013">{{cite journal |last1= Rubin|first1=Mark|title="It Wasn't My Idea to Come Here!": Young Women Lack Ownership of the Idea to Immigrate – Mark Rubin's Social Psychology Research|journal=International Journal of Intercultural Relations|date=July 2013|volume=37|issue=4|pages=497–501|issn=0147-1767|doi=10.1016/j.ijintrel.2013.02.001 |url=https://sites.google.com/site/markrubinsocialpsychresearch/-it-wasn-t-my-idea-to-come-here-young-women-lack-ownership-of-the-idea-to-immigrate |accessdate=3 October 2018 |ref=Rubin2013}}</ref> In a few cases, an individual may wish to immigrate to a new country in a form of transferred [[patriotism]]. Evasion of [[criminal justice]] (e.g., avoiding [[arrest]]) is a personal motivation. This type of emigration and immigration is not normally legal, if a crime is internationally recognized, although criminals may disguise their identities or find other loopholes to evade detection. For example, there have been reports of [[war criminals]] disguising themselves as victims of war or conflict and then pursuing asylum in a different country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/opinion/125664|title=EU asylum and war criminals: No place to hide | last1 = Haskell | first1 = Leslie|date=18 September 2014|website=EUobserver.com|publisher=EUobserver|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/refugees-in-germany-reporting-dozens-of-war-crimes/a-19179291|title=Refugees in Germany reporting dozens of war crimes | last1 = Knight | first1 = Ben|date=11 April 2016|website=DW.com|publisher=Deutsche Welle|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sweden-syrian-asylum-seeker-suspected-war-crimes-under-assad-regime-arrested-stockholm-1546149|title=Sweden: Syrian asylum seeker suspected of war crimes under Assad regime arrested in Stockholm | last1 = Porter | first1 = Tom|date=26 February 2016|work=International Business Times|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>

Barriers to immigration come not only in legal form or political form; natural and social barriers to immigration can also be very powerful. Immigrants when leaving their country also leave everything familiar: their family, friends, support network, and culture. They also need to liquidate their assets, and they incur the expense of moving.

"It is one of the ironies of post-war European history that, once the freedom to travel for Europeans living under communist regimes, which had long been demanded by the West, was finally granted in 1989/90, travel was very soon afterwards made much more difficult by the West itself, and new barriers were erected to replace the Iron Curtain."  —Anita Böcker<ref>Anita Böcker (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ejOg0L5pbHUC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Regulation of migration: international experiences''].

The politics of immigration have become increasingly associated with other issues, such as [[national security]] and [[terrorism]], especially in western Europe, with the presence of [[Islam]] as a new major religion. Those with security concerns cite the [[2005 French riots]] and point to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] as examples of the value conflicts arising from immigration of [[Muslims in Western Europe]]. Because of all these associations, immigration has become an emotional political issue in many European nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://euranetplus-inside.eu/migration-refugees-europe-waves-of-emotion/|title=Migration, refugees, Europe – waves of emotion |date=7 May 2015|website=Euranet Plus inside|publisher=Euranet Plus Network|language=en-GB|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/global-immigration-germany-integration.html|title=Europe learns integration can become emotional | last1 = Nowicki | first1 = Dan|website=AZCentral.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>

Studies have suggested that some [[special interest group]]s [[Lobbying|lobby]] for less immigration for their own group and more immigration for other groups since they see effects of immigration, such as increased labor competition, as detrimental when affecting their own group but beneficial when impacting other groups. A 2010 European study suggested that "employers are more likely to be pro-immigration than employees, provided that immigrants are thought to compete with employees who are already in the country. Or else, when immigrants are thought to compete with employers rather than employees, employers are more likely to be anti-immigration than employees."<ref name="Tamura2010"/> A 2011 study examining the voting of US representatives on migration policy suggests that "representatives from more skilled labor abundant districts are more likely to support an open immigration policy towards the unskilled, whereas the opposite is true for representatives from more unskilled labor abundant districts."<ref name="FacchiniSteinhardt2011"/>

Another contributing factor may be lobbying by earlier immigrants. The Chairman for the US Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform—which lobby for more permissive rules for immigrants, as well as special arrangements just for Irish people—has stated that "the Irish Lobby will push for any special arrangement it can get—'as will every other ethnic group in the country.{{'"}}<ref name="irishlobbyusa"/><ref name="nclr"/>

Immigrants are motivated to leave their former countries of citizenship, or habitual residence, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of local access to [[resources]], a desire for economic [[prosperity]], to find or engage in paid work, to better their [[standard of living]], [[family reunification]], [[retirement]], [[Environmental migrant|climate or environmentally induced]] migration, [[exile]], escape from prejudice, conflict or natural disaster, or simply the wish to change one's [[quality of life]]. [[Commuting|Commuters]], [[Tourism|tourists]] and other short-term stays in a destination country do not fall under the definition of immigration or migration, [[Seasonal industry|seasonal labour]] immigration is sometimes included.

The term economic migrant refers to someone who has travelled from one region to another region for the purposes of seeking employment and an improvement in quality of life and access to resources. An economic migrant is distinct from someone who is a [[refugee]] fleeing persecution.

Many countries have immigration and visa restrictions that prohibit a person entering the country for the purposes of gaining work without a valid work visa. As a violation of a [[State (polity)|State's]] immigration laws a person who is declared to be an economic migrant can be refused entry into a country.

Some proponents of immigration argue that the freedom of movement both within and between countries is a basic human right, and that the restrictive immigration policies, typical of nation-states, violate this human right of freedom of movement.<ref name="immigration"/> Such arguments are common among ideologies like [[anarchism]] and [[libertarianism]].<ref name=theanarchistlibrary>{{cite web |title=Anarchism and Immigration |date=1 January 2005 |work=theanarchistlibrary |url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/scott-of-the-insurgency-culture-collective-anarchism-and-immigration }}</ref> As philosopher and [[Open border]]s activist [[Jacob M.

Where immigration is permitted, it is typically selective. {{as of|2003}}, [[family reunification]] accounted for approximately two-thirds of legal immigration to the US every year.<ref name="migrationinformation2"/> Ethnic selection, such as the [[White Australia policy]], has generally disappeared, but priority is usually given to the educated, skilled, and wealthy. Less privileged individuals, including the mass of poor people in low-income countries, cannot avail themselves of the legal and protected immigration opportunities offered by wealthy states. This inequality has also been criticized as conflicting with the principle of [[equal opportunities]]. The fact that the door is closed for the unskilled, while at the same time many developed countries have a huge demand for unskilled labor, is a major factor in [[illegal immigration]]. The contradictory nature of this policy—which specifically disadvantages the unskilled immigrants while exploiting their labor—has also been criticized on ethical grounds.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Immigration policies which selectively grant freedom of movement to targeted individuals are intended to produce a net economic gain for the host country. They can also mean net loss for a poor donor country through the loss of the educated minority—a "[[brain drain]]". This can exacerbate the [[Global justice|global inequality]] in [[standards of living]] that provided the motivation for the individual to migrate in the first place. One example of competition for skilled labour is active recruitment of [[health worker]]s from developing countries by developed countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewalrus.ca/poaching-foreign-doctors/|title=Poaching Foreign Doctors | last1 = Krotz | first1 = Larry|date=12 September 2012|website=The Walrus|publisher=The Walrus|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Stilwell | first1 = Barbara|last2=Diallo|first2=Khassoum|last3=Zurn|first3=Pascal|last4=Vujicic|first4=Marko|last5=Adams|first5=Orvill|last6=Dal Poz|first6=Mario|date=2004|title=Migration of health-care workers from developing countries: strategic approaches to its management|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/8/595arabic.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|issue=82|pages=595–600|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref> There may however also be a "brain gain" to emigration, as migration opportunities lead to greater investments in education in developing countries.<ref name="Shrestha2017">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shrestha | first1 = Slesh A.|date=1 April 2016|title=No Man Left Behind: Effects of Emigration Prospects on Educational and Labour Outcomes of Non-migrants |journal=The Economic Journal|volume=127|issue=600|language=en|pages=495–521|doi=10.1111/ecoj.12306| s2cid = 154362034|issn=1468-0297}}</ref><ref name="BeineDocquier2008">{{Cite journal | last1 = Beine | first1 = Michel|last2=Docquier|first2=Fréderic|last3=Rapoport|first3=Hillel|date=1 April 2008|title=Brain Drain and Human Capital Formation in Developing Countries: Winners and Losers |journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=118|issue=528|pages=631–652|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2008.02135.x|issn=1468-0297|hdl=2078.1/5768| s2cid = 28988486| url = http://sites.uclouvain.be/econ/DP/IRES/2006-23.pdf}}</ref><ref name="DinkelmanMariotti2016">{{Cite journal | last1 = Dinkelman | first1 = Taryn|last2=Mariotti|first2=Martine|date=2016|title=The Long Run Effects of Labor Migration on Human Capital Formation in Communities of Origin |journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=1–35 |doi=10.1257/app.20150405 | s2cid = 5140105| url = http://www.nber.org/papers/w22049.pdf}}</ref><ref name="BatistaLacuesta2012">{{Cite journal | last1 = Batista | first1 = Catia|last2=Lacuesta|first2=Aitor|last3=Vicente|first3=Pedro C.|date=1 January 2012|title=Testing the 'brain gain' hypothesis: Micro evidence from Cape Verde |journal=Journal of Development Economics |volume=97|issue=1|pages=32–45|doi=10.1016/j.jdeveco.2011.01.005|hdl=10419/44193| s2cid = 4489444|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Overall, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries.<ref name="di GiovanniLevchenko2015" />

A 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'' found that within racial groups, most immigrants to the United States had fully assimilated within a span of 20 years.<ref name="VillarrealTamborini2018" /> Immigrants arriving in the United States after 1994 assimilate more rapidly than immigrants who arrived in previous periods.<ref name="VillarrealTamborini2018" /> Measuring assimilation can be difficult due to "ethnic attrition", which refers to when ancestors of migrants cease to self-identify with the nationality or ethnicity of their ancestors.

Research suggests that a vicious cycle of bigotry and isolation could reduce assimilation and increase bigotry towards immigrants in the long-term. For instance, University of California, San Diego political scientist Claire Adida, Stanford University political scientist David Laitin and Sorbonne University economist Marie-Anne Valfort argue "fear-based policies that target groups of people according to their religion or region of origin are counter-productive. Our own research, which explains the failed integration of Muslim immigrants in France, suggests that such policies can feed into a vicious cycle that damages national security. French Islamophobia—a response to cultural difference—has encouraged Muslim immigrants to withdraw from French society, which then feeds back into French Islamophobia, thus further exacerbating Muslims' alienation, and so on. Indeed, the failure of French security in 2015 was likely due to police tactics that intimidated rather than welcomed the children of immigrants—an approach that makes it hard to obtain crucial information from community members about potential threats."<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Adida | first1 = Claire L.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|last3=Valfort|first3=Marie-Anne|date=1 February 2017|title=The Wrong Way to Stop Terrorism|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-02-01/wrong-way-stop-terrorism|journal=Foreign Affairs}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1XnDFa2nmdhSnJwSVRoSkJqYjQ/view|title=AdidaLaitinValfort2017_ForeignAffairs.pdf|newspaper=Google Docs|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref>

A study which examined [[Catalan nationalism]] examined the Catalan Government's policy towards the integration of immigrants during the start of the 1990s. At this time the Spanish region of Catalonia was experiencing a large influx in the number of immigrants from Northern Africa, Latin America and Asia. The Spanish government paid little attention to this influx of immigrants. However, Catalan politicians began discussing how the increase in immigrants would effect Catalan identity. Members of the Catalan parliament petitioned for a plan to integrate these immigrants into Catalan society. Crucially, the plan did not include policies regarding [[Naturalization|naturalisation]] , which were key immigration policies of the Spanish government. The plan of the Catalan parliament aimed to create a shared Catalan identity which included both the native Catalan population and immigrant communities. This meant that immigrants were encouraged to relate as part of the Catalan community but also encouraged to retain their own culture and traditions. In this way assimilation of immigrant cultures in Catalonia was avoided.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Coversi |display-authors=etal |date=2017|title=Despite the crisis: The resilience of intercultural nationalism in Catalonia|journal=International Migration|volume= 55 |issue = 2|pages=53–67|doi=10.1111/imig.12323 |s2cid=151628467 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1396c0e5729057ec3566c407c3ce45a1789a1d77 }}</ref>
