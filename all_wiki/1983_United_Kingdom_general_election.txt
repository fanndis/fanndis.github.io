The '''1983 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday 9 June 1983. It gave the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] the most decisive election victory since that of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]], with a landslide majority of 144 seats. 

Thatcher's first four years as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] had not been an easy time.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/margaret-thatcher |title=Baroness Margaret Thatcher |website=[[gov.uk]] |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref><!-- Opinionated --> Unemployment increased during the first three years of her premiership and the economy went [[Early 1980s recession|through a recession]]. However, the British victory in the [[Falklands War]] led to a recovery of her personal popularity; the economy had also returned to growth. By the time Thatcher called the election in May 1983, the Conservatives were most people's firm favourites to win the general election. The resulting win earned the Conservatives their biggest parliamentary majority of the post-war era, and their second-biggest majority as a single-party government, behind only the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]] (they earned even more seats in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 election]], but were part of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]).<ref name="bbcoverview">{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title=1983: Thatcher triumphs again |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>

The Labour Party had been led by [[Michael Foot]] since the resignation of former Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] in 1980. They had fared well in opinion polls and local elections during this time, but issues developed which would lead directly to their defeat. Labour adopted a platform that was considered more [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] than usual.<ref name="bbcoverview"/><ref>{{citation |last=Vaidyanathan |first=Rajini |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8550425.stm |title=Michael Foot: What did the 'longest suicide note' say? |date=4 March 2010 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> Several moderate Labour MPs had defected from the party to form the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP); they then formed the [[SDP–Liberal Alliance]] with the existing [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].

The opposition vote split almost evenly between the Alliance and Labour. With its worst electoral performance since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], the Labour vote fell by over 3 million votes from 1979 and this accounted for both a national swing of almost 4% towards the Conservatives and their larger parliamentary majority of 144 seats, even though the Conservatives' total vote fell by almost 700,000. This was the last general election until [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019]] in which a governing party increased its number of seats.

The Alliance finished in third place but came within 700,000 votes of out-polling Labour; by gaining 25.4% of the vote it won the largest percentage for any third party since [[1923 United Kingdom general election|sixty years prior]]. Despite this, it won only 23 seats, whereas Labour won 209. The Liberals argued that a proportional electoral system would have given them a more representative number of MPs. Changing the electoral system had been a long-running Liberal Party campaign plank, and would later be adopted by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

The election night was broadcast live on the BBC, and was presented by [[David Dimbleby]], Sir [[Robin Day]] and [[Peter Snow]].<ref>{{YouTube |id=sf3NxCCSz3Y |title=Election 1983{{snd}}Part 1}}</ref> It was also broadcast on ITV, and presented by [[Alastair Burnet]], [[Peter Sissons]] and [[Martyn Lewis]].

Three future leaders of the Labour Party ([[Tony Blair]], [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]]) were first elected at this election; Blair and Brown went on to hold the office of Prime Minister. Former Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], [[Shirley Williams]], [[Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], [[Joan Lestor, Baroness Lestor of Eccles|Joan Lestor]], [[Tony Benn]] as well as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and former Labour cabinet minister [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]] left the House of Commons as a result of this election, although Benn would return in a [[1984 Chesterfield by-election|by-election the following year]], and Lestor at the following general election. In addition, two future Leaders of the Liberal Democrats were first elected ([[Paddy Ashdown]] and [[Charles Kennedy]]), and one of the Conservative Party ([[Michael Howard]]).

==Background and campaign==
[[Michael Foot]] was [[1980 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|elected leader]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1980, replacing [[James Callaghan]]. The election of Foot signalled that the core of the party was swinging to the left and the move exacerbated divisions within the party. In 1981 a group of senior figures including [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Bill Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]] left Labour to found the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). The SDP agreed to a pact with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] for the 1983 election and stood as "[[SDP–Liberal Alliance|The Alliance]]".

The election did not have to be held for another year. Although political circumstances were clearly favourable for the government and opposition parties anticipated that Mrs Thatcher would go to the country in June, earlier in 1983 the Conservatives were split on the timing of the election. One faction favoured a June election, but another group wanted to wait until October before going to the country, while some within the Party even advocated delaying the contest until 1984. Supporters of waiting to a later time to hold an election included Thatcher's deputy and [[Home Secretary]] [[William Whitelaw, 1st Viscount Whitelaw|Willie Whitelaw]] and [[John Biffen]] who was then serving as [[Leader of the House of Commons]].<ref name="Haviland1983p23">{{cite book |author1=Julian Haviland |title=The Times Guide to the House of Commons June 1983 |date=1983 |publisher=Times Books Ltd |location=London |isbn=0-7230-0255-X |page=23 |chapter=The June 1983 Election Campaign:Conservative lead was never challenged}}</ref> On 27 April it was reported that all the Conservative party's regional agents had unanimously  expressed a preference to Thatcher for a June election, although some members of her cabinet were advising her to wait until October.<ref name="GH27April1983">{{cite news |last1=Parkhouse |first1=Geoffrey |title=Go for June election, agents urge Thatcher |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&dat=19830427&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |accessdate=11 July 2020 |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=27 April 1983 |page=1}}</ref> On 8 May senior Conservatives met at [[Chequers]] and agreed to go to the country on 9 June.

The campaign displayed the huge divisions between the two major parties. Thatcher had been highly unpopular during her first two years in office until the swift and decisive victory in the [[Falklands War]], coupled with an improving economy, considerably raised her standings in the polls. The Conservatives' key issues included employment, economic growth and defence. Labour's campaign manifesto involved leaving the [[European Economic Community]], abolishing the [[House of Lords]], abandoning the United Kingdom's nuclear deterrent by cancelling [[Trident (UK nuclear programme)|Trident]] and removing cruise missiles—a programme dubbed by Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] "[[the longest suicide note in history]]"; "Although, at barely 37 pages, it only seemed interminable", noted [[Roy Hattersley]]. Pro-Labour political journalist [[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', commented: "There was something magnificently brave about [[Michael Foot]]'s campaign but it was like the [[Battle of the Somme]]."<ref>{{citation| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/11/mondaymediasection.politicsandthemedia | work=The Guardian | first=Michael | last=White | title=Michael White on 35 years of covering elections | date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=23 June 2018}}</ref>

==National election, 1979==

Following boundary changes in 1983, the BBC and ITN ([[ITN|Independent Television News]]) co-produced a [[Notional election results|calculation]] of how the 1979 general election would have gone if fought on the new 1983 boundaries. The following table shows the effects of the boundary changes on the House of Commons:

==Results==
{{Further|Results of the 1983 United Kingdom general election}}
The election saw a [[landslide victory]] for the Conservatives, achieving their best results since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Although there was a slight drop in their share of the vote, they made significant gains at the expense of Labour. The night was a disaster for the Labour Party; their share of the vote fell by over 9%, which meant they were only 700,000 votes ahead of the newly-formed [[third party (politics)|third party]], the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The massive increase of support for the Alliance at the expense of Labour meant that, in many seats,{{which|date=June 2018}} the collapse in the Labour vote allowed the Conservatives to gain. Despite winning over 25% of the national vote, the Alliance got fewer than 4% of seats, 186 fewer than Labour. The most significant Labour loss of the night was [[Tony Benn]], who was defeated in the revived [[Bristol East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol East]] seat. SDP President [[Shirley Williams]], then a prominent leader in the Social Democratic Party, lost her [[Crosby (UK Parliament constituency)|Crosby]] seat which she had won in a [[1981 Crosby by-election|by-election in 1981]]. [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], another leading figure in the Alliance (like Williams, one of the "[[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Gang of Four]]") also failed to win his old seat that he previously held as a Labour MP.

In Scotland, both Labour and the Tories sustained modest losses to the Alliance. Labour remained by far the largest party, with 41 seats to 21 for the [[Scottish Conservatives]]. The Scottish Conservatives have been unable to match their 1983 Westminster seat total since, although they did record a slightly larger share of the Scottish vote in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017 (Scotland)|2017]], by which time the [[Scottish National Party]] had become the dominant party in Scotland with the Tories being the largest unionist party.

On a UK-wide basis, the 1983 election was the worst result in Labour's modern history until the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]]. The 1983 result remains the worst-ever modern performance for Labour in England.
