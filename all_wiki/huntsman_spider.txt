'''Huntsman spiders''', members of the [[Family (biology)|family]] '''Sparassidae''' (formerly Heteropodidae), are known by this name because of their speed and mode of hunting.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2018}} They are also called '''giant crab spiders''' because of their size and appearance. Larger species sometimes are referred to as '''wood spiders''', because of their preference for woody places (forests, mine shafts, woodpiles, wooden shacks). In southern Africa the genus ''[[Palystes]]'' are known as '''rain spiders''' or '''lizard-eating spiders'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/arachnids/spiders/sparassidae/palystes.htm |title=''Palystes'' (rain spiders, lizard-eating spiders) |author=Norman Larsen |work=Iziko Museums of Cape Town |publisher=Biodiversity Explorer |access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref> Commonly they are confused with [[Harpactirinae|baboon spiders]] from the [[Mygalomorphae]] [[Order (biology)|infraorder]], which are not closely related.

More than a thousand Sparassidae species occur in most warm temperate to tropical regions of the world, including much of [[Australasia]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], the [[Mediterranean Basin]], and the [[Americas]].<ref name="Isbister">{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey K. Isbister & David Hirst |year=2003 |title=A prospective study of definite bites by spiders of the family Sparassidae (huntsmen spiders) with identification to species level |journal=[[Toxicon]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=163–171 |pmid=12906887 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(03)00129-6}}</ref>

Several species of huntsman spider can use an unusual form of locomotion. The [[wheel spider]] (''Carparachne aureoflava'') from the [[Namib]] uses a [[cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheeling]] motion, while ''[[Cebrennus rechenbergi]]'' uses a [[handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]] motion.

==Appearance==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

Sparassids are eight-eyed spiders. The eyes appear in two largely forward-facing rows of four on the [[anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior aspect]] of the [[cephalothorax|prosoma]]. Many species grow very large&nbsp;– in [[Laos]], male [[giant huntsman spider]]s (''Heteropoda maxima'') attain a legspan of {{convert|25–30|cm}}. Persons unfamiliar with spider taxonomy commonly confuse large species with [[tarantula]]s, but huntsman spiders can generally be identified by their legs, which, rather than being jointed vertically relative to the body, are twisted in such a way that in some attitudes the legs extend forward in a [[crab]]-like fashion.

On their upper surfaces the main colours of huntsman spiders are inconspicuous shades of brown or grey, but many species have undersides more or less [[Aposematism|aposematically]] marked in black-and-white, with reddish patches over the mouthparts. Their legs bear fairly prominent spines, but the rest of their bodies are smoothly furry. They tend to live under rocks, bark and similar shelters, but human encounters are commonly in sheds, garages and other infrequently-disturbed places. The banded huntsman (''Holconia'') is large, grey to brown with striped bands on its legs. The badge huntsman (''[[Neosparassus]]'') is larger still, brown and hairy. The tropical or brown huntsman (''[[Heteropoda]]'') is also large and hairy, with mottled brown, white and black markings. The eyesight of these spiders is not nearly as good as that of the ''Salticidae'' ([[jumping spider]]s). Nevertheless, their vision is quite sufficient to detect approaching humans or other large animals from some distance.

==Size, venom and aggression==
On average, a huntsman spider's leg span can reach up to {{convert|15|cm|in}}, while their bodies measure about {{convert|1.8|cm|in}} long.<ref name=livescience>{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/65746-possum-eating-spider-australia.html|title=Huntsman Spider Devours Possum in Viral (and Terrifying) Photos|date=June 19, 2019|publisher=livescience.com}}</ref>

Like most spiders, apart from the [[Uloboridae]] and some [[Liphistiidae]] and [[Holarchaeidae]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foelix |first1=Rainer |last2=Erb |first2=Bruno |title=Mesothelae have venom glands |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=38 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=596–598 |issn=0161-8202 |doi=10.1636/B10-30.1 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/229262 }}</ref> Sparassidae use venom to immobilize prey. They have been known to inflict serious defensive bites on humans.<ref>{{cite book |author=S. H. Skaife |year=1963 |title=A Naturalist Remembers |publisher=Longmans South Africa |oclc=11111496 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}</ref>

There have been reports of members of various genera such as ''[[Palystes]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=D'Ewes |first1=Dudley |title=Wayward naturalist |chapter=Chapter 12 |publisher=Howard Timmins |location=Cape Town |year=1967 |oclc=457367 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}</ref> ''[[Neosparassus]]'' (formerly called ''[[Olios]]'') and several others, inflicting severe bites. The effects vary, including local swelling and pain, nausea, headache, vomiting, irregular pulse rate, and heart palpitations, indicating some systemic neurological toxin effects, especially when the bites were severe or repeated. However, the formal study of spider bites is fraught with complications, including unpredictable infections, [[dry bite]]s, shock, [[nocebo]] effects, and even bite misdiagnosis by medical professionals and specimen misidentification by the general public.

It is not always clear what provokes Sparassidae to attack and bite humans and animals, but it is known that female members of this family will aggressively defend their egg sacs and young against perceived threats.<ref name="Isbister"/> Bites from sparassids usually do not require hospital treatment.

==Sound production in mating rituals==
Males of ''[[Heteropoda venatoria]]'', one of the huntsman spiders that seems to easily find its way around the world, have recently been found to deliberately make a substrate-borne sound when they detect a chemical ([[pheromone]]) left by a nearby female of their species. The males anchor themselves firmly to the surface onto which they have crawled and then use their legs to transmit vibrations from their bodies to the surface. Most of the sound emitted is produced by strong vibrations of the abdomen. The characteristic frequency of vibration and the pattern of bursts of sound identify them to females of their species, who will approach if they are interested in mating. This sound can often be heard as a rhythmic ticking, somewhat like a quartz clock, which fades in and out and can be heard by human ears in a relatively quiet environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rovner |first1=Jerome S. |year=1980 |title=Vibration in ''Heteropoda venatoria'' (Sparassidae): A Third Method of Sound Production in Spiders |journal= The Journal of Arachnology |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages= 193–200 |jstor=3705191 }}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Members of the Sparassidae are native to tropical and warm temperate regions worldwide. A few species are native to colder climates, like the green huntsman spider (''[[Micrommata virescens]]'') which is native to [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lissner|first1=Jørgen|title=Family: Sparassidae (Giant Crab Spiders)|url=http://www.jorgenlissner.dk/Sparassidae.aspx|website=The Spiders of Europe and Greenland|access-date=16 January 2018}}.</ref> Some tropical species like ''[[Heteropoda venatoria]]'' (Cane huntsman) and ''[[Delena cancerides]]'' (Social huntsman) have been accidentally introduced to many subtropical parts of the world, including [[New Zealand]] (which has no native sparassid species).<ref name="hirst1">{{cite journal|author=David Hirst, Julianne M.

As adults, huntsman spiders do not build webs, but hunt and forage for food: their diet consists primarily of insects and other [[invertebrate]]s, and occasionally small skinks and geckos. They live in the crevices of tree bark, but will frequently wander into homes and vehicles. They are able to travel extremely quickly, often using a springing jump while running, and walk on walls and even on ceilings. They also tend to exhibit a "cling" reflex if picked up, making them difficult to shake off and much more likely to bite. The females are fierce defenders of their egg sacs and young. They will generally make a threat display if provoked, and if the warning is ignored they may attack and bite. The egg sacs differ fairly widely among the various genera. For example, in ''[[Heteropoda]]'' spp. egg sacs are carried underneath the female's body, while in other species like ''[[Palystes]]'' and ''[[Pseudomicrommata]]'' spp., females generally attach egg sacs to vegetation.<ref name="Filmer">{{cite book | last = Filmer | first = Martin | title = Southern African Spiders | publisher = BHB International / Struik | location = City | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-86825-188-8 }}</ref>
