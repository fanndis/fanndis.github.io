It is the administrative centre of the borough. In the fifteenth century the town became an economic hub of the old [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], primarily in [[wool]]len manufacture.  From New Year's Day 1779 manufacturers and [[mercer (occupation)|mercers]] dealt internationally in such articles through its grandiose square, the [[Piece Hall]]. Halifax is known for [[Mackintosh's]] [[chocolate]] and [[toffee]] products including [[Rolo]] and [[Quality Street (confectionery)|Quality Street]]. The [[Halifax (bank)|Halifax Bank]] was founded and has large offices in the town. [[Dean Clough]], one of the largest textile factories in the world at more than {{convert|1/2|mi|m|sigfig=1}} long, is today a converted building for hotel, office and retail use including a gym, theatre, [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]] and radio station, north of the town centre.

==Toponymy==
[[File:2ndEarlofHalifaxByJoshuaReynoldsNSArtGallery.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]]]]
The town's name was recorded in about 1091 as ''Halyfax'', from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''halh-gefeaxe'', meaning "area of coarse grass in the nook of land".<ref name=cambridge>{{cite book | contribution = Halifax  | year = 2010  | title = The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names  | editor-last = Watts | editor-first = Victor  | publisher = Cambridge University Press  }}</ref>  This explanation is preferred to derivations from the Old English ''halig'' (holy), in ''hālig feax'' or "holy hair", proposed by 16th-century antiquarians.<ref>{{harvnb|Hargreaves|1999| page=12}}</ref>  The incorrect interpretation gave rise to two legends. One concerned a maiden killed by a lustful priest whose advances she spurned. Another held that the head of [[John the Baptist]] was buried here after his execution.<ref name=cambridge/> The legend is almost certainly medieval rather than ancient, although the town's [[coat of arms]] carries an image of the saint. Another explanation is a corruption of the Old English ''hay'' and ''ley'' a clearing or meadow. This etymology is based on Haley Hill, the nearby hamlet of [[Healey, Kirklees|Healey]] (another corruption), and the common occurrence of the surnames Hayley/Haley around Halifax.<ref name="haliflax">{{cite book|first=Eilert |last=Ekwall|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names|year=1936|edition=Fourth edition 1960}}</ref> The erroneous derivation from ''halig'' has given rise to the [[demonym]] Haligonian, which is of recent origin and not in universal use.

The [[Earl of Halifax|Earldom of Halifax]] took the name of the town. Its first creation{{clarification needed|date=October 2017}}, in the [[Peerage of England]] in 1677, was for [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|George Savile]], who was created Baron Savile of Eland and Viscount Halifax in 1668 and later became the [[Marquess of Halifax]] (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700). [[George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax]], (2nd order of the 3rd creation) became the [[President of the Board of Trade]] in 1748. In 1749 the city of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], the capital of [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, was named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Halifax-Nova-Scotia|title=Halifax: Nova Scotia, Canada|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005054806/https://www.britannica.com/place/Halifax-Nova-Scotia|archive-date=5 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Halifax River]] in [[Central Florida]], United States, was also named after him.

==History==
[[File:Town of Halifax,Yorkshire,FromPennyMagazineMarch15,1834.PNG|thumb|240px|Halifax in 1834]] 

Halifax is not mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', and evidence of the early settlement is indefinite.<ref>{{harvnb|Hargreaves|1999| page=10}}</ref> By the 12th&nbsp;century the township had become the religious centre of the vast parish of Halifax, which extended from [[Brighouse]] in the east to [[Heptonstall]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Hargreaves|1999| pages=18–19}}</ref>  [[Halifax Minster]], parts of which date from the 12th&nbsp;century is dedicated to St John the Baptist. The minster's first organist, in 1766, was [[William Herschel]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halifaxminster.org.uk/about-us/music/organ/organ-history/|title=Halifax Minster.org – Organ History|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225055/http://www.halifaxminster.org.uk/about-us/music/organ/organ-history/|archive-date=10 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> who discovered the planet [[Uranus]]. The coat of arms of Halifax include the chequers from the original coat of arms of the Earls Warenne, who held the town during [[Normans|Norman]] times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/wriding_ob.html |title=Arms of Halifax, Civic Heraldry of England and Wales |publisher=Civicheraldry.co.uk |access-date=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414065410/http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/wriding_ob.html |archive-date=14 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Halifax was notorious for its [[Halifax Gibbet|gibbet]], an early form of [[guillotine]] used to [[capital punishment|execute]] criminals by [[decapitation]], that was last used in 1650. A replica has been erected on the original site in Gibbet Street. Its original blade is on display at [[Bankfield Museum]]. Punishment in Halifax was notoriously harsh, as remembered in the ''Beggar's Litany''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/gibbet/index.htm |title=Yorkshire History – Halifax Gibbet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303051234/http://www.yorkshirehistory.com/gibbet/index.htm |archive-date=3 March 2008 }}</ref> by [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor]] (1580–1654), a prayer whose text included "From [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], from Halifax, from [[Hell]], ‘tis thus, From all these three, Good Lord deliver us.".<ref>The association of the three names pre-dates Taylor as the poet [[Thomas Nashe]] refers to them: "...neither in Hull, Hell, nor Halifax." – ''Nashes Lenten Stuffe'', London, 1599.</ref>

The town's 19th century wealth came from the cotton, wool and carpet industries and like most other Yorkshire towns, it had a large number of [[weaving]] [[textile mill|mills]] many of which have been lost or converted to alternate use.

In November 1938, in an incident of [[mass hysteria]], many residents believed a serial killer, the [[Halifax Slasher]], was on the loose. [[Scotland Yard]] concluded there were no attacks after several locals admitted they had inflicted wounds on themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/making_history_20070501.shtml |title=Radio 4 History – The Halifax Slasher |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718133504/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/making_history_20070501.shtml |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Halifax (bank)|Halifax plc]] started as a [[building society]], the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society, in the town in 1853. Today the bank operates as a trading name of [[HBOS]], part of the [[Lloyds Banking Group]]. [[Yorkshire Bank]], based in [[Leeds]] and known as the ''[[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] Penny Savings Bank'', was established on 1 May 1859 by Colonel [[Edward Akroyd]] of Halifax. Halifax is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Aachen]] in Germany. The [[A58 road|A58]] has a stretch called Aachen Way.

Halifax has benefited from Single Regeneration Budget, European URBAN II and the Home Office’s Community Cohesion Fund money through Action Halifax <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.actionhalifax.org.uk|title=www.actionhalifax.org.uk|access-date=23 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202222731/http://www.actionhalifax.org.uk/|archive-date=2 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> who have a vision for "a prosperous, vibrant and safe centre where all sections of the community can access opportunities to enhance their quality of life."

==Governance==
[[File:Halifax Town Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Halifax Town Hall]]]]
The ancient parish of Halifax was divided into a large number of civil parishes in the 19th&nbsp;century. In Halifax, a body of [[improvement commissioners]] or town trustees was created between 1762 and 1823,<ref>{{harvnb|Hargreaves|1999| page=107}}</ref> and the town became a [[Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)|borough constituency]] under the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832. Halifax was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1848 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], and, with the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1888]], became a [[county borough]] in 1889. Since 1974, Halifax has been the [[administrative centre]] of the Metropolitan Borough of [[Calderdale]] in [[West Yorkshire]].

As well as the significance of the bank [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax plc]] which, since 2008, is part of the [[Lloyds Banking Group]], the town has strong associations with confectionery.

John Mackintosh and his wife, Violet, opened a [[toffee]] shop in [[King Cross]] Lane in 1890. Violet formulated the toffee's recipe. John became known as "The Toffee King". A factory was opened on Queens Road in 1898. A new factory at Albion Mill, at the current site near the railway station, opened in 1909. John died in 1920, and his son Harold not only continued the business but took it to the present size and range of confectionery it has today. Their famous brands, including [[Rolo]], [[Toffee Crisp]] and [[Quality Street (confection)|Quality Street]] of chocolate and confectionery are not just popular in the UK, but around the world including the USA.

In 1969 [[Mackintosh's|John Mackintosh & Co Limited]] merged with the [[York]]-based [[Rowntree's|Rowntree Limited]] to form [[Rowntree Mackintosh]]. This was, in turn, purchased by [[Nestlé]] in 1988.

Halifax was a busy industrial town, dealing in and producing wool, carpets, machine tools and beer. The Crossley family began carpet manufacture in modest premises at [[Dean Clough]], on the banks of [[Hebble Brook]]. The family was philanthropic and Joseph and [[Francis Crossley|Sir Francis Crossley]] built and endowed [[almshouse]]s for their workers, which exist to this day and are run by volunteer trustees. Halifax is also home to [[Suma (co-operative)|Suma Wholefoods]], which was established in 1975 and is the largest [[Worker cooperative|workers' co-operative]] in the UK.

Originally intended to be the chimney for a dye works, it became a folly after the dye works was sold in 1874 and the new owner refused to pay for its completion. It is the tallest folly in the world and the tallest structure in [[Calderdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/wainhouse|access-date=25 March 2011|title=Wainhouse Tower, Halifax – Icons of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029195504/http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/wainhouse|archive-date=29 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/leisure/localhistory/wainhouse-tower/index.html|access-date=25 March 2011|title=Introduction: Wainhouse Tower: Calderdale Council|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514185050/http://www.calderdale.gov.uk/leisure/localhistory/wainhouse-tower/index.html|archive-date=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Sport==
[[File:The Shay.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Shay]], the town's football and rugby league stadium.]]
The town has relatively successful sports clubs. Its [[rugby league]] club, [[Halifax RLFC]], plays in the [[Betfred Championship]]. The town's [[Association football|football team]], [[F.C. Halifax Town]] participates in the [[National League (division)|National League]], the fifth tier of English football.

===Football===
[[The Shay]] football ground has been the home of the town's football club since 1921. The ground was substantially redeveloped in the late 20th and early 21st&nbsp;centuries, with money provided by the [[Football Foundation]] and funds raised or provided by the local community and Calderdale Council.

===Rugby league===
Halifax is home to the semi-professional rugby league academy, Halifax Elite Rugby Academy, which has a partnership with [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]] and [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Halifax RLFC]] is one of the most historic rugby league clubs in the game, formed over a century ago, in 1873. Amateur clubs Boothtown Terriers, Greetland All Rounders, Illingworth, King Cross Park, Ovenden, [[Siddal A.R.L.F.C.|Siddal]] and Stainland Stags are based in or near the town. The Siddal club is a leading member of amateur rugby league's flagship [[National Conference League]]. Greetland All Rounders and Ovenden are former members.

===Rugby union===
Halifax has several senior [[rugby union]] clubs. They include Halifax, Halifax Vandals (Warley), Heath (West Vale), Old Crossleyans, Old Rishworthians (Copley) and Old Brodleians (Hipperholme).{{cn|date=June 2020}}

===Speedway===
[[Motorcycle speedway]] racing has been staged at two venues in Halifax. In the pioneering days of 1928–1930 a track operated at [[Thrum Hall]]. A Halifax team took part in the [[Speedway English Dirt Track League|English Dirt Track League]] of 1929.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Speedway returned to Halifax at the Shay Stadium in 1949 and operated until 1951.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The team operated as the Halifax Nomads in 1948 racing three away fixtures. The Halifax Dukes, the name they took once the Shay was opened, operated in the National League Third Division in 1949 before moving up to the Second Division in 1950. Riders including Arthur Forrest, moved on to [[Bradford]]. The Dukes re-emerged in 1965 as founder members of the British League and operated there for many years before the team moved en bloc to Odsal Stadium, Bradford. The steeply banked bends of the track at the Shay have been buried under stands at either end when the spectator facilities were squared off.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Swimming===
Halifax Swimming Pool<ref>{{cite web |title=Halifax swimming pool |url=https://www.calderdale.gov.uk/v2/sports-and-fitness/venues/halifax-swimming-pool |website=Calderdale Council |access-date=13 August 2020}}</ref> was opened in 1966 and designed by the borough architects FH Hoyles and JL Berbiers. It contains two ceramic murals by [[Kenneth Barden]] on the theme of British pond life. By 2020 there was consideration that a new swimming pool should be installed within the existing North Bridge Leisure Centre, and that the current building should be listed as a significant twentieth century building.<ref name="Halifax-pool-2020">{{cite web |last1=Ing |first1=Will |title=Campaigners call for 1960s Halifax pool and murals to be listed |url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/campaigners-call-for-1960s-halifax-pool-and-murals-to-be-listed |website=Architects' Journal |access-date=13 August 2020}}</ref>

==Religious buildings==
[[File:All Souls church, Halifax.JPG|thumb|[[All Souls Church, Halifax|All Souls' Church]] (now redundant) and statue of [[Edward Akroyd]]]]
[[File:The Assembly Rooms and Trinity Church in Halifax from A Complete History of the County of York by Thomas Allen (1828-30).JPG|thumb|right|The Assembly Rooms and Trinity Church in Halifax from ''A Complete History of the County of York'' by Thomas Allen (1828–30)]]
The 15th-century Minster dedicated to [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] did not achieve [[cathedral]] status when a new diocese was being considered for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] ([[Wakefield]] Parish Church became the cathedral in 1888 and was extensively altered and enlarged). [[Minster (church)|Minster]] Status was conferred on the Parish Church in a ceremony on 22 November 2009.<ref name="halifaxcourier.co.uk"/> There is a collection of rare [[Commonwealth]] white glass as well as a series of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] windows. Another feature is the complete array of [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[box pew]]s. The pair of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] organ cases by John Oldrid Scott now house the four-manual instrument by Harrison & Harrison. The belfry holds fourteen bells and an [[Angelus]].

[[St Mary's Church, Halifax|St Mary's Roman Catholic Church]] on the corner of Gibbet Street and Clarence Street, was built in 1839, rebuilt in 1864 and extended in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title = Halifax – St Marie / Diocese of Leeds / Dioceses / Home / Taking Stock – Taking Stock|url = http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Leeds/Halifax-St-Marie/|website = taking-stock.org.uk|access-date = 30 December 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160124150726/http://taking-stock.org.uk/Home/Dioceses/Diocese-of-Leeds/Halifax-St-Marie/|archive-date = 24 January 2016|url-status = live}}</ref>

The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]], in the Boothtown area, formerly the Mount Carmel Methodist Chapel, was acquired in 1956 and after extensive refurbishment was opened in the 1965 by the town's [[Serbs|Serbian]] community. In 2015 the church celebrated its Golden Jubilee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-johnthebaptistchurch-halifax.org.uk/index.html |title=St. John the Baptist Church history |publisher=St-johnthebaptistchurch-halifax.org.uk |access-date=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112031241/http://www.st-johnthebaptistchurch-halifax.org.uk/index.html |archive-date=12 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The currently redundant mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[All Souls Church, Halifax|All Souls' Church]] by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] standing part way up Haley Hill to the north of the main town centre is now vested in the [[Historic Churches Preservation Trust]]. Its lofty {{convert|236|ft|m|sing=on}} spire and white magnesian limestone exterior stand as a very personal statement in 13th-century French style of the mill owner Colonel [[Edward Akroyd]], who paid solely for its construction as the centre-piece of a purpose-built model village ("Akroydon"). [[All Souls' Day|All Souls']] boasts an unusually complete sequence of windows by the leading artists of the 1850s, including William Wailes, John Hardman and Clayton & Bell. The large organ by Forster & Andrews inserted in 1868, ten years after the building was completed, is currently unplayable and many of its surviving parts are in storage awaiting restoration. The tower houses a ring of eight bells.

Other churches which once included the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Holy Trinity]] Church (which has since now been converted to office use) and the late impressive [[neo-Gothic]] (1911) [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St. Paul's]], [[King Cross]], by Sir Charles Nicholson. St Paul's is notable not only for its fine [[acoustics]] but also for an unusual and highly colourful west window, specified by Nicholson, showing the apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax as it was before the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulskingcross.co.uk/index.html|access-date=25 March 2011|title=St Paul's, King Cross &#124; Homepage|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009171715/http://www.stpaulskingcross.co.uk/index.html|archive-date=9 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[William Swinden Barber#Church of St Jude, Savile Park, 1888|Church of St Jude]] in Savile Park, designed by local architect [[William Swinden Barber]] in 1888, is easily identified by the four large pinnacles on its tower.<ref name="EH 1254029">{{NHLE|num=1254029 |desc=Church of St Jude, Free School Lane|accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref> There is also a more modern [[Christadelphian]] church, located on Balmoral Place.<ref>[http://www.halifax-christadelphians.org/ Halifax Christadelphians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180125193610/http://www.halifax-christadelphians.org/ |date=25 January 2018 }}, accessed 25 January 2018</ref>

The spire of the Square Church, not far from the minster at the bottom of the town, paid for by the carpet manufacturing Crossley family, is all that remains of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Congregational church]] built by Joseph James in 1856–58 as a rival design to All Souls', Haley Hill.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The building was closed in 1969 and arsonists caused severe damage to the building two years later leading to its partial demolition. The rather comic story of the rival spires runs that the two buildings' towers were nearing completion simultaneously; the architects were ordered to stop work within a few feet of the top of the spires to see who would finish first.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} After some time, the Crossleys lost patience and finished their spire at {{convert|235|ft|m|sing=on}}, prompting the immediate completion of the rival building one foot higher. The remaining structure now forms the core of the new central library. The neighbouring and earlier (Georgian) [[Square Chapel]] (1772) survived a hundred years of use as a church hall and [[Sunday school]] for the larger church: it is currently an arts centre.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
