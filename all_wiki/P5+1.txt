The '''P5+1''' refers to the [[UN Security Council]]'s [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]] (the P5); namely China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; plus Germany.

==History==
{{See also|List of United Nations resolutions concerning Iran}}

In June 2006, China, Russia, and the United States joined the three [[EU three|EU-3 countries]], which had been negotiating with Iran since 2003,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/board-welcomes-eu-iran-agreement/ |title=IAEA Board Welcomes EU-Iran Agreement: Is Iran Providing Assurances or Merely Providing Amusement? |author=Peter Crail, Maria Lorenzo Sobrado |publisher=NTI |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=3 April 2015}}</ref> to offer another proposal for comprehensive negotiations with Iran.

Up to then, the UN Security Council has adopted six resolutions in response to the [[Iranian nuclear program]]. The first resolution, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696|#1696]], was adopted in July 2006 and demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.

The next three years saw the adoption of three more resolutions, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1737|#1737]] in December 2006, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747|#1747]] in March 2007, and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1803|#1803]] in March 2008, which have imposed gradual sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities believed to be involved in Iran's nuclear and missile programs.

UN Security Council Resolution [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1835|#1835]], adopted in September 2008, restated the Security Council's demands made in resolution #1696 of 2006, but without imposing additional sanctions.

The last Security Council resolution, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|#1929]], adopted in June 2010, saw the expansion of more sanctions on Iran for its lack of cooperation and its continued uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities

==Role of Germany==
Germany is the key trading partner of Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/2007/11/20/germany-s-pivotal-role-in-iranian-nuclear-standoff/7f2 |title=Germany's Pivotal Role in the Iranian Nuclear Standoff|last=Jones|first=Georgina|date=20 November 2007|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> Iran's nuclear program depends mainly upon German products and services.

The [[Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce]] has estimated that economic [[sanctions against Iran]] may cost more than 10,000 German jobs and have a negative impact on the economic growth of Germany. Sanctions would especially hurt medium-sized German companies, which depend heavily on trade with Iran.<ref name="payvand1"/> There has been a shift in German business ties with Iran from long-term business to short-term and from large to mid-sized companies which have fewer business interests in the US and thus are less prone to U.S. political pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tehrantimes.com/Index_view.asp?code=229816|title=‘Iran-Germany trade prospering’|date=3 November 2010|website=tehrantimes.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>

In a further meeting of the P5+1 in Geneva on 16 October 2013, Iran stated that it may allow unannounced visits to its nuclear sites as a "last step" in a proposal to resolve differences with the West.

==2014 negotiations on a comprehensive agreement==
{{main|Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program}}
U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and the lead negotiator with Iran, Wendy Sherman, told a Senate hearing that Iran's ballistic missile program would be addressed as part of a comprehensive nuclear deal. On 10 February 2014, Iran's defense minister said they successfully test-fired two new domestically made missiles.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/10/us-iran-missile-idUSBREA191R220140210 Iran test-fires long-range missile], Reuters, 10 February 2014</ref> The next day, Iran laid out "red lines" related to its [[Iran's missile forces|ballistic missile program]], atomic sites and uranium enrichment ahead of talks of the next step in nuclear talks, which resumed in Vienna on 18 February. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, also a senior Iranian nuclear negotiator, said "defense-related issues are a red line for Iran" and that Tehran "will not allow such issues to be discussed in future talks."<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/iran-sets-39-red-lines-39-ahead-fresh-150313959.html Iran sets 'red lines' ahead of fresh nuclear talks], AFP, 11 February 2014</ref>

Senior officials of the P5+1 and Iran met on 18–20 February 2014 in Vienna and agreed on a framework for future negotiations. The P5+1 and Iran planned to have monthly meetings to try and forge a final, comprehensive deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next Round of Iran Nuclear Talks to be held in Vienna from March 17|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/next-round-of-iran-nuclear-talks-to-be-held-in-vienna-from-march-17/|agency=Indo-Asian News Service|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304914204579393603775059032?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304914204579393603775059032.html Framework Is Set for Iran Nuclear Talks], ''The Wall Street Journal''; 19 February 2014</ref>

Former Israeli UN Ambassador Dore Gold claimed that the comprehensive agreement being negotiated between Iran and the P5+1 focused on increased transparency instead of a reduction in nuclear capability.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Inspections: The Weak Link in a Nuclear Agreement with Iran |url= http://jcpa.org/article/inspections-nuclear-agreement/#sthash.NHnWjTBF.dpuf}}</ref>  Former U.S. State Department official and advisor on Iran's nuclear program Robert Einhorn said such an agreement would need to both increase transparency and lengthen Iran's timeline for nuclear breakout capability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Experts Discuss Framework for a Final Iran Nuclear Agreement|url=http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/iran-at-saban/posts/2014/04/02-einhorn-event-iran-nuclear-deal|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=29 June 2014|date=2 April 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829032518/http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/iran-at-saban/posts/2014/04/02-einhorn-event-iran-nuclear-deal|archive-date=29 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
