'''Abortion in Brazil''' is considered a crime against human life, being prohibited in all circumstances by articles 124–127 of the Penal Code. In 1940, however, Brazilian legislators withdrew the penalty of this crime when it is practiced of there is no other way to save mother's life or if the pregnancy is the result if a [[rape]].<ref name="CP1">[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848.htm Brazilian Criminal Code] (in Portuguese), art. 128.</ref> This does not mean that the law regards abortion in these cases as a "right", but only that women who commit this crime will not be punished.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lemos da Silva|first=Rosângela|date=2010|title=DIREITO À JUSTIÇA E A LEI MARIA DA PENHA: uma análise na visão da isonomia material e forma|doi=10.24824/978856248092.8|isbn=9788562480928}}</ref> The punishment for a woman who performs an [[abortion]] on herself or consents to an abortion performed by another outside these legal exceptions is one to three years of detention.<ref name="CP2">[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848.htm Brazilian Criminal Code] (in Portuguese), art. 124.</ref> The base penalty for a third party that performs an illegal abortion with the consent of the patient, ranges from one to four years of detention, with the possibility of increase by a third if the woman comes to any physical harm, and can be doubled if she dies.<ref name="CP3">[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848.htm Brazilian Criminal Code] (in Portuguese), arts. 125 and 127.</ref> Criminal penalties fixed at four years or less can be converted to non-incarceration punishments, such as community service and compulsory donation to charity.<ref name="CP4">[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Decreto-Lei/Del2848.htm Brazilian Criminal Code] (in Portuguese), arts. 43 and 44.</ref>

[[Brazil]] is a signatory of the [[American Human Rights Convention]], also called the Pact of San José. The Convention grants the [[right to life]] to human embryos, "in general, from the moment of [[Fertilisation|conception]]", and has a legal status on a par with the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] in [[Brazilian Law]]. The [[Civil Code of Brazil]] also safeguards the rights of the unborn. In a 2008 case, however, the [[Supreme Federal Court]] ruled, by a 6-5 vote, that the right to life applies only to [[intrauterine]] embryos, and that frozen embryos not eligible to a [[Embryo transfer|uterus transfer]] do not hold [[fundamental rights]] and may be manipulated for research purposes. In 2012, the Supreme Court also authorized the practice of abortion on fetuses with [[anencephaly]].

On November 29, 2016 the Supreme Court in Brazil ruled that "abortion should not be a crime when performed in the first three months of pregnancy".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://plus55.com/culture/2016/11/abortion-brazilian-supreme-court|title=BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT TAKES STEP TOWARDS DECRIMINALIZING ABORTION|newspaper=plus55|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202115501/http://plus55.com/culture/2016/11/abortion-brazilian-supreme-court|archive-date=2016-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> This ruling is very controversial, due to the fact that the Brazilian government just passed a bill, earlier in 2016, which aimed to make Brazilian law on abortion even stricter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-26/new-bill-aims-make-brazils-abortion-law-even-tougher|title=A new bill aims to make Brazil's abortion law even tougher|newspaper=Public Radio International|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>

The number of clandestine abortions taking place in Brazil is a very controversial subject which divides pro-life and pro-choice activists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,audiencia-publica-sobre-aborto-no-stf-comeca-com-batalha-de-numeros-e-depoimentos-emocionais,70002429211|title=Audiência pública sobre aborto no STF tem batalha de números e depoimentos emocionais - Saúde - Estadão|work=Estadão|access-date=2018-08-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> A study published by the [[International Journal of Women's Health]] in 2014, estimated that in Brazil about 48 thousand clandestine abortions occurs annually.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://estudosnacionais.com/aborto/pesquisa-internacional-projeta-48-mil-abortos-clandestinos-no-brasil/|title=Pesquisa internacional projeta 48 mil abortos clandestinos no Brasil - Estudos Nacionais|date=2018-08-14|work=Estudos Nacionais|access-date=2018-08-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> Pro-choice institutes like Anis - Bioethics Institute, however, estimate a much higher number.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpostbrasil.com/2016/12/08/1-em-cada-5-mulheres-ate-40-anos-ja-fez-aborto-no-brasil-catoli_a_21700824/|title=1 em cada 5 mulheres até 40 anos já fez aborto no Brasil.

More recent studies suggest that, despite Brazil's severe legislation, 500,000 illegal abortions are estimated to occur every year among women aged 18–39 years - or one in five Brazilian women.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 31314905|year = 2019|last1 = Diniz|first1 = D.|last2 = Brito|first2 = L.|last3 = Ambrogi|first3 = I.|last4 = Tavares|first4 = A.

== Impact to women's health ==
In 2010, it was reported that 200,000 women a year were hospitalized for complications due to abortion (which includes both miscarriages and clandestine abortions). More recent figures estimate that around 250,000 women are hospitalized every year due to illegal abortion complications, or 50% of all illegal abortions estimated per year.<ref name="Malta et al 2019">{{cite journal |last1=Malta |first1=Monica |last2=Wells |first2=Samantha |last3=LeGrand |first3=Sara |last4=Seixas |first4=Michele |last5=Baptista |first5=Angelica |last6=Silva |first6=Cosme Marcelo Furtado Passos da |last7=Kalume |first7=Clarisse |last8=Whetten |first8=Kathryn |title=Abortion in Brazil: the case for women's rights, lives, and choices |journal=The Lancet Public Health |date=1 November 2019 |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e552 |doi=10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30204-X |pmid=31677774 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Those figures contrast with 2–5% of women requiring medical care after an abortion in countries where abortion is legal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sedgh |first1=Gilda |last2=Bearak |first2=Jonathan |last3=Singh |first3=Susheela |last4=Bankole |first4=Akinrinola |last5=Popinchalk |first5=Anna |last6=Ganatra |first6=Bela |last7=Rossier |first7=Clémentine |last8=Gerdts |first8=Caitlin |last9=Tunçalp |first9=Özge |last10=Johnson |first10=Brooke Ronald |last11=Johnston |first11=Heidi Bart |last12=Alkema |first12=Leontine |title=Abortion incidence between 1990 and 2014: global, regional, and subregional levels and trends |journal=The Lancet |date=16 July 2016 |volume=388 |issue=10041 |pages=258–267 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30380-4 |pmid=27179755 |pmc=5498988 }}</ref> The majority of women admitted at hospital after an illegal abortion are uninsured, representing a government cost of more than US$10 million every year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wenham |first1=Clare |last2=Arevalo |first2=Amaral |last3=Coast |first3=Ernestina |last4=Corrêa |first4=Sonia |last5=Cuellar |first5=Katherine |last6=Leone |first6=Tiziana |last7=Valongueiro |first7=Sandra |title=Zika, abortion and health emergencies: a review of contemporary debates |journal=Globalization and Health |date=24 July 2019 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=49 |doi=10.1186/s12992-019-0489-3 |pmid=31340836 |pmc=6657045 }}</ref> More than 200 women die every year in Brazil, as a direct consequence of unsafe abortions.

==Methods==
In a 2005 survey, one third of the Brazilian doctors who reported having performed abortions, used [[dilation and curettage]]. They have little experience with vacuum aspiration but they are aware of it as a method. They have a general awareness of [[medical abortion]] using [[misoprostol]] (Cytotec) or other [[prostaglandin]]s to induce abortion but less experience with it. Few know of newer and more effective regimens using [[mifepristone]] or [[methotrexate]].<ref name="rhj1">{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Lisa A|date=2005-11-15|others=García SG, Díaz J, and Yam EA|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices|journal=Reproductive Health |volume=2|issue=10|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10|pmid=16288647|pmc=1308861}}</ref>

The 2005 survey also found considerable ignorance of Brazil's law on abortion, with only 48% of the physicians knowing that it is legal to save a woman's life and widespread confusion about fetal age limits. An earlier survey found that two-thirds of Brazilian OB-GYNs incorrectly believed that a judicial order is required to obtain a legal abortion and only 27% knew that the woman needed to make a written request to obtain a legal abortion. Those doctors cannot give accurate information to their patients.<ref name=rhj1/>

In non-hospital settings, women's folk medicine allegedly brings on the menstrual flow rather than causing an abortion. "Two folk medical conditions, "delayed" (atrasada) and "suspended" (suspendida) menstruation, are described as perceived by poor Brazilian women in Northeast Brazil. Culturally prescribed methods to "regulate" these conditions and induce menstrual bleeding are also described, including ingesting herbal remedies, patent drugs, and modern pharmaceuticals."<ref name=transcripts>

==Public opinion==
Brazilian culture is greatly influenced by the [[Catholic Church]]. In a survey made in [[Ribeirão Preto]] (SP) in 2004, 70% of the Brazilian doctors responded that they didn't support the decriminalization of abortion in the country.<ref name="Loureiro 679–688">{{cite journal |last1=Loureiro |first1=David Câmara |last2=Vieira |first2=Elisabeth Meloni |title=Aborto: conhecimento e opinião de médicos dos serviços de emergência de Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brasil, sobre aspectos éticos e legais |journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública |date=June 2004 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=679–688 |doi=10.1590/s0102-311x2004000300004 |pmid=15263978 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The survey also suggested that 77% of the doctors of this region rejected the idea that abortion should be carried out simply because of the woman's desire.<ref name="Loureiro 679–688"/> Furthermore it suggested that 82.5% of these doctors also reject the legalization of abortion due to socioeconomic difficulties.<ref name="Loureiro 679–688"/> Finally, in the case of a possible legalization, only 17.5% of them would agree to carry it out professionally.<ref name="Loureiro 679–688"/>

A March 2007 Datafolha/''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'' poll found that 65% of Brazilians believe that their country's current law "should not be modified", 16% that it should be expanded "to allow abortion in other cases", 10% that abortion should be "decriminalized", and 5% were "not sure".<ref>"[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15370 Brazilians Want to Keep Abortion as Crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163234/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/15370 |date=2007-06-29 }}."

Another poll on this issue was made in December 2010, by the polling institute [[Vox Populi]].

==Excommunication controversy==
{{main|2009 Brazilian girl abortion case}}
In March 2009, after an abortion on a nine-year-old girl raped by her stepfather and pregnant with twins had been performed to save her life, Archbishop [[José Cardoso Sobrinho]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife|Olinda and Recife]] stated that [[latae sententiae|automatic]] [[excommunication]] had been incurred by the girl's mother and the medical team. President [[Lula da Silva]] and Health Minister [[José Gomes Temporão]] decried his statement, and the [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] disowned it, saying that the mother was certainly not excommunicated and there was insufficient evidence to show that any member of the medical team was. The statement was criticized also on the Vatican newspaper by the President of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]]. One of the doctors concerned said the controversy had drawn needed attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5247DU20090305 Brazil attacks church opposition to girl's abortion] Stuart Grudgings, ''Reuters''.

==Anencephaly exception==
In July 2004, a Brazilian federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that waived the requirement for court authorization for abortions in cases of fetuses with [[anencephaly]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goldman|first1=Lisa A|last2=García|first2=Sandra G|last3=Díaz|first3=Juan|last4=Yam|first4=Eileen A|date=2005-11-15|title=Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists and abortion: a survey of knowledge, opinions and practices |journal=Reproductive Health|volume=2|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-2-10 |pmc=1308861|pmid=16288647}}</ref> The Brazilian Council of Bishops lobbied against the ruling and the National Confederation of Healthcare Workers wanted to make the exception permanent. In October 2004, the full Brazilian Supreme Court convened and voted 7-4 to suspend the judge's ruling until the full tribunal had the opportunity to deliberate and rule on the matter.<ref name=rhj1/>

A 2005 study found that 53% of doctors had performed an abortion in the case of a severely deformed fetus, even though that was not allowed by Brazilian law without a court order. Doctors who thought that the law should be more liberal were more likely to have correct knowledge of abortion law and to be familiar with the abortion law regarding severe fetal malformations.<ref name=rhj1/>

On April 12, 2012, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by an 8–2 vote to legalize abortion in cases of fetuses with anencephaly, saying that it was not about a potential life because an anencephalic fetus would certainly die and never become a person. The Catholic Church and Brazilian Pro-Life movements criticized the decision of the court, saying that even with a terminal illness, children with anencephaly also had the right to life.<ref>{{Cite news |work=Global Post |date=April 14, 2012 |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/brazil/120414/abortion-ban-lifted-brazil-fetuses-severe-brain-damage-anencephaly |first=Jill |last=Langlois |title=Abortion ban lifted in Brazil for fetuses with severe brain damage}}</ref>
