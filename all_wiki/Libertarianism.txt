The use of the term ''libertarian'' to describe a new set of political positions has been traced to the French cognate ''libertaire'', coined in a letter French [[libertarian communist]] [[Joseph Déjacque]] wrote to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in 1857.<ref>Déjacque, Joseph (1857).

''Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism''. p. 641. "The word 'libertarian' has long been associated with anarchism, and has been used repeatedly throughout this work. The term originally denoted a person who upheld the doctrine of the freedom of the will; in this sense, Godwin was not a 'libertarian', but a 'necessitarian'. It came however to be applied to anyone who approved of liberty in general. In anarchist circles, it was first used by Joseph Déjacque as the title of his anarchist journal ''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social'' published in New York in 1858.

In the United States, ''libertarian'' was popularized by the [[individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] around the late 1870s and early 1880s.<ref>Comegna, Anthony; Gomez, Camillo (3 October 2018). [https://www.libertarianism.org/columns/libertarianism-then-now "Libertarianism, Then and Now"]. ''Libertarianism''. Cato Institute.

Russell justified the choice of the term as follows:
{{quote|Many of us call ourselves "liberals." And it is true that the word "liberal" once described persons who respected the individual and feared the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense. At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding.

Subsequently, a growing number of Americans with classical liberal beliefs began to describe themselves as ''libertarians''. One person responsible for popularizing the term ''libertarian'' in this sense was [[Murray Rothbard]], who started publishing libertarian works in the 1960s.<ref>[[Paul Cantor]], ''The Invisible Hand in Popular Culture: Liberty Vs.

Although libertarianism originated as a form of [[left-wing politics]],<ref name="Carson"/><ref name="routledge-anarchism"/> the development in the mid-20th century of modern [[libertarianism in the United States]] led several authors and political scientists to use two or more categorizations<ref name="Long1"/><ref name="Carlson1"/> to distinguish libertarian views on the nature of property and capital, usually along left–right or socialist–capitalist lines,<ref name="Francis"/> Unlike right-libertarians, who reject the label due to its association with [[conservatism]] and [[right-wing politics]], calling themselves simply ''libertarians'', proponents of [[free-market anti-capitalism]] in the United States consciously label themselves as ''left-libertarians'' and see themselves as being part of a broad libertarian left.<ref name="Carson"/><ref name="routledge-anarchism"/>

"It is important to distinguish between anarchism and certain strands of right-wing libertarianism which at times go by the same name (for example, Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism). There is a complex debate within this tradition between those like Robert Nozick, who advocate a 'minimal state', and those like Rothbard who want to do away with the state altogether and allow all transactions to be governed by the market alone. From an anarchist perspective, however, both positions—the minimal state (minarchist) and the no-state ('anarchist') positions—neglect the problem of economic domination; in other words, they neglect the hierarchies, oppressions, and forms of exploitation that would inevitably arise in a ''laissez-faire'' 'free' market. [...] Anarchism, therefore, has no truck with this right-wing libertarianism, not only because it neglects economic inequality and domination, but also because in practice (and theory) it is highly inconsistent and contradictory. The individual freedom invoked by right-wing libertarians is only a narrow economic freedom within the constraints of a capitalist market, which, as anarchists show, is no freedom at all".</ref> encompasses those libertarian beliefs that claim the Earth's natural resources belong to everyone in an egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively.<ref name="Kymlicka">[[Will Kymlicka|Kymlicka, Will]] (2005).

"'Left-libertarianism' is a new term for an old conception of justice, dating back to Grotius. It combines the libertarian assumption that each person possesses a natural right of self-ownership over his person with the egalitarian premiss that natural resources should be shared equally. Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. According to left-libertarians, however, the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

[[Neo-libertarianism]] combines "the libertarian's moral commitment to [[negative liberty]] with a procedure that selects principles for restricting liberty on the basis of a unanimous agreement in which everyone's particular interests receive a fair hearing".<ref>Sterba, James (2013).

Such free-standing farmers, Jefferson thought, were the basis of a vigorous and independent public sphere where citizens could speak their mind without fear or favor.

[[File:Thomas Paine rev1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Thomas Paine]], whose theory of property showed a libertarian concern with the redistribution of resources]]
John Locke greatly influenced both libertarianism and the modern world in his writings published before and after the [[Glorious Revolution|English Revolution of 1688]], especially ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' (1667), ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' (1689) and ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690). In the text of 1689, he established the basis of liberal political theory, i.e. that people's rights existed before government; that the purpose of government is to protect personal and property rights; that people may dissolve governments that do not do so; and that representative government is the best form to protect rights.<ref>Boaz, David (2010).

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] was inspired by Locke in its statement: "[T]o secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].

According to [[Murray Rothbard]], the libertarian creed emerged from the liberal challenges to an "absolute central State and a king ruling by divine right on top of an older, restrictive web of feudal land monopolies and urban guild controls and restrictions" as well as the [[mercantilism]] of a bureaucratic warfaring state allied with privileged merchants. The object of liberals was individual liberty in the economy, in personal freedoms and civil liberty, separation of state and religion and peace as an alternative to imperial aggrandizement. He cites Locke's contemporaries, the Levellers, who held similar views. Also influential were the English ''[[Cato's Letters]]'' during the early 1700s, reprinted eagerly by [[Colonial history of the United States|American colonists]] who already were free of European aristocracy and feudal land monopolies.<ref name=Rothbard1/>

In 1793, [[William Godwin]] wrote a libertarian philosophical treatise titled ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Morals and Happiness]]'' which criticized ideas of human rights and of society by contract based on vague promises. He took liberalism to its logical anarchic conclusion by rejecting all political institutions, law, government and apparatus of coercion as well as all political protest and insurrection. Instead of institutionalized justice, Godwin proposed that people influence one another to moral goodness through informal reasoned persuasion, including in the associations they joined as this would facilitate happiness.<ref>Ousby, Ian (1993).

=== Anarchism ===
{{main|History of anarchism}}
{{anarchism sidebar}}
[[File:Pierre Joseph Proudhon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the first to proclaim himself as an ''anarchist'']]
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the Enlightenment, particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.<ref name=Encarta>"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).</ref>

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought.<ref>Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.</ref><ref name="godwinsep"/> According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work"<ref name="EB1910">Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.</ref> while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].<ref>Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to Edmund Burke's '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. "Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence..." – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.</ref>

Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism. He argued in ''Political Justice'' (1793)<ref name="godwinsep"/><ref>Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.</ref> that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, Godwin advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.<ref name="godwinsep">{{cite SEP|url-id=godwin|title=William Godwin|last=Philip|first=Mark|date=20 May 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners|last=Godwin|first=William|author-link=William Godwin|year=1796|publisher=G. G. and J. Robinson|oclc=2340417|orig-year=1793|title-link=Political Justice}}</ref>

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's "mental enslavement", the foundations of law, property rights and even the institution of marriage. Godwin considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.<ref name="godwinsep"/>

In France, various anarchist currents were present during the Revolutionary period, with some revolutionaries using the term ''anarchiste'' in a positive light as early as September 1793.<ref>Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.</ref> The ''[[enragés]]'' opposed revolutionary government as a contradiction in terms. Denouncing the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] dictatorship, [[Jean Varlet]] wrote in 1794 that "government and revolution are incompatible, unless the people wishes to set its constituted authorities in permanent insurrection against itself".<ref name=graham/> In his "Manifesto of the Equals", [[Sylvain Maréchal]] looked forward to the disappearance, once and for all, of "the revolting distinction between rich and poor, of great and small, of masters and valets, of governors and governed".<ref name=graham>{{cite book|last=Graham|first=Robert|chapter=Preface|title=Anarchism: a Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas: from Anarchy to Anarchism|publisher=Black Rose Books|location=Montréal|year=2005|isbn=1-55164-250-6|author-link=Robert Graham (historian)|pages=xi–xiv|accessdate=11 August 2010|chapter-url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism2.htm|title-link=Anarchism: a Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas: from Anarchy to Anarchism}}</ref>

[[Murray Bookchin]] wrote that the Spanish libertarian movement of the mid-1930s was unique because its workers' control and collectives—which came out of a three-generation "massive libertarian movement"—divided the republican camp and challenged the Marxists. "Urban anarchists" created libertarian communist forms of organization which evolved into the CNT, a syndicalist union providing the infrastructure for a libertarian society. Also formed were local bodies to administer social and economic life on a decentralized libertarian basis. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the 1930s Spanish Civil War against authoritarian and fascist forces.<ref>Murray Bookchin, ''To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936'', AK Press, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1DzxkWr0X60C&printsec=frontcover&dq=To+Remember+Spain:+The+Anarchist+and+Syndicalist+Revolution+libertarian&sa=X#v=onepage&q=Libertarian pp. 2–39], {{ISBN|9781873176870}}.</ref>

In 1969, French [[platformist]] anarcho-communist [[Daniel Guérin]] published an essay in 1969 called "Libertarian Marxism?" in which he dealt with the debate between [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] at the [[First International]] and afterwards suggested that "libertarian Marxism rejects determinism and fatalism, giving the greater place to individual will, intuition, imagination, reflex speeds, and to the deep instincts of the masses, which are more far-seeing in hours of crisis than the reasonings of the 'elites'; libertarian Marxism thinks of the effects of surprise, provocation and boldness, refuses to be cluttered and paralyzed by a heavy 'scientific' apparatus, doesn't equivocate or bluff, and guards itself from adventurism as much as from fear of the unknown".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revoltlib.com/?id=1352|title=Libertarian Marxism? – The Anarchist Library|date=6 February 2017}}</ref>

{{quote|Steven Pearl Andrews [...] was not a Fourierist, but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in America and adopted a lot of Fourierist principles and practices [...], a maker of worlds out of words.  He syncretized abolitionism in the United States, free love, spiritual universalism, Warren, and Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy. [...] He was instrumental in founding several 'intentional communities,' including the 'Brownstone Utopia' on 14th St. in New York, and 'Modern Times' in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known Fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts & the North American Phalanx in New Jersey)—in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for 'Free Love') and finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews (and Victoria Woodhull) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, and spiritualist tendencies.<ref>[[Hakim Bey|Bey, Hakim]].

For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, "[i]t is apparent that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews. William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form".<ref name="againstallauthority.org">Schuster, Eunice Minette.

Greene is best known for the works ''Mutual Banking'', which proposed an interest-free banking system; and ''Transcendentalism'', a critique of the New England philosophical school. After 1850, he became active in labor reform.<ref name="againstallauthority.org" /> He was elected vice president of the New England Labor Reform League, "the majority of the members holding to Proudhon's scheme of mutual banking, and in 1869 president of the Massachusetts Labor Union".<ref name="againstallauthority.org" /> Greene then published ''Socialistic, Mutualistic, and Financial Fragments'' (1875).<ref name="againstallauthority.org" /> He saw mutualism as the synthesis of "liberty and order".<ref name="againstallauthority.org" /> His "associationism [...] is checked by individualism. [...] 'Mind your own business,' 'Judge not that ye be not judged.' Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands 'mutuality' in marriage—the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property".<ref name="againstallauthority.org" />

Poet, naturalist and [[transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. He is best known for his book ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings; and his essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'' (''Resistance to Civil Government''), an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. In ''Walden'', Thoreau advocates simple living and self-sufficiency among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of industrial civilization.<ref name="Thoreau">"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock(8), esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."

Right-wing libertarians argue that the right of self-ownership entails the right to appropriate unequal parts of the external world, such as unequal amounts of land. However, according to left-libertarians the world's natural resources were initially unowned, or belonged equally to all, and it is illegitimate for anyone to claim exclusive private ownership of these resources to the detriment of others. Such private appropriation is legitimate only if everyone can appropriate an equal amount, or if those who appropriate more are taxed to compensate those who are thereby excluded from what was once common property.

=== Georgism and geolibertarianism ===
{{main|Georgism|Geolibertarianism}}
[[File:Henry George c1885 retouched.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry George]], influential among left-libertarians, advocated that the value derived from land should belong to all members of a society]]
[[Henry George]] was an American political economist and journalist who advocated that all economic value derived from land, including [[natural resources]], should belong equally to all members of society. Strongly opposed to [[feudalism]] and the [[Land tenure|privatisation of land]], George created the philosophy of [[Georgism]], or [[geoism]], influential among many left-libertarians, including [[Geolibertarianism|geolibertarians]] and [[geoanarchists]]. Much like the English [[The Diggers|Digger movement]], [[Communism|who held all material possessions in common]], George claimed that land and its financial properties belong to everyone, and that to hold land as [[private property]] would lead to immense inequalities, including authority from the private owners of such ground.

Prior to [[State (polity)|states]] assigning property owners slices of either once populated or uninhabited land, the world's earth was held in common. When all resources that derive from land are put to achieving a higher quality of life, not just for [[Ruling class|employers or landlords]], but to serve the general interests and comforts of a wider community, Geolibertarians claim vastly higher qualities of life can be reached, especially with ever advancing technology and industrialised agriculture.

[[File:Levellers declaration and standard.gif|thumb|The [[Diggers]], early libertarian communists, held all things in common, including land which was often violently seized by the European aristocracy]]
The [[Levellers]], also known as the Diggers, were a 17th-century [[anti-authoritarian]] movement that stood in resistance to the English government and the [[feudalism]] it was pushing through the forced privatisation of land known as the [[enclosure]] around the time of the [[First English Civil War]]. Devout [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Gerrard Winstanley]] was a prominent member of the community and with a very progressive interpretation of his religion sought to end buying and selling, instead for all inhabitants of a society to share their material possessions and to hold all things in common, without money or payment. With the complete abolition of private property, including that of private land, the English Levellers created a pool of property where all properties belonged in equal measure to everyone. Often seen as some of the first practising anarchists, the Digger movement is considered [[Christian communist]] and extremely early [[libertarian communism]].

[[Austrian School]] economist Murray Rothbard was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism,<ref>Raimondo, Justin (2001). ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard''. Amherst, NY: Prometheus.</ref> but long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions.

Rothbard was influenced by the work of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists<ref>DeLeon, David (1978). ''[[The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism]]''. [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. p. 127. "only a few individuals like Murray Rothbard, in ''Power and Market'', and some article writers were influenced by [past anarchists like Spooner and Tucker].

[[Karl Hess]], a speechwriter for [[Barry Goldwater]] and primary author of the Republican Party's 1960 and 1964 [[Party platform|platforms]], became disillusioned with traditional politics following the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential campaign]] in which Goldwater lost to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. He parted with the Republicans altogether after being rejected for employment with the party, and began work as a heavy-duty welder. Hess began reading American anarchists largely due to the recommendations of his friend Murray Rothbard and said that upon reading the works of communist anarchist Emma Goldman, he discovered that anarchists believed everything he had hoped the Republican Party would represent. For Hess, Goldman was the source for the best and most essential theories of [[Ayn Rand]] without any of the "crazy [[solipsism]] that Rand was so fond of".<ref>Fischler, Steven (Director); Sucher, Joel (Director) (1983). ''Anarchism in America'' (DVD). Pacific Street Films. "I was just amazed. When I read Emma Goldman, it was as though everything I had hoped that the Republican Party would stand for suddenly came out—crystallized—in this magnificently clear statement."</ref> Hess and Rothbard founded the journal ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'', which was published from 1965 to 1968, with George Resch and [[Leonard P. Liggio]]. In 1969, they edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' which Hess left in 1971. Hess eventually put his focus on the small scale, stating that society is "people together making culture". He deemed two of his cardinal social principles to be "opposition to central political authority" and "concern for people as individuals". His rejection of standard American [[Politics of the United States|party politics]] was reflected in a lecture he gave during which he said: "The Democrats or liberals think that everybody is stupid and therefore they need somebody [...] to tell them how to behave themselves. The Republicans think everybody is lazy".<ref>Halle, Roland; Ladue, Peter (1980). ''Karl Hess: Toward Liberty''. Direct Cinema, Ltd. [M16 2824 K].</ref>

The [[Vietnam War]] split the uneasy alliance between growing numbers of American libertarians and conservatives who believed in limiting liberty to uphold moral virtues. Libertarians opposed to the war joined the [[Draft dodger|draft resistance]] and [[peace movement]]s as well as organizations such as [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). In 1969 and 1970, Hess joined with others, including Murray Rothbard, [[Robert LeFevre]], [[Dana Rohrabacher]], [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] and former SDS leader [[Carl Oglesby]] to speak at two conferences which brought together activists from both the New Left and the Old Right in what was emerging as a nascent libertarian movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archive-url=https://archive.today/20110708090610/http://bradspangler.com/blog/archives/288|archive-date=8 July 2011|title=Spangler Home Improvement Tips – Smart home improvement decisions}}</ref> As part of his effort to unite the left and right wings of libertarianism, Hess would join both the SDS and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), of which he explained: "We used to have a labor movement in this country, until I.W.W. leaders were killed or imprisoned.

Modern libertarianism gained significant recognition in academia with the publication of Harvard University professor [[Robert Nozick]]'s ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' in 1974, for which he received a National Book Award in 1975.<ref>National Book Foundation.

Specifically, Nozick wrote: "We argue that the first transition from a system of private protective agencies to an ultraminimal state, will occur by an invisible-hand process in a morally permissible way that violates no one's rights. Secondly, we argue that the transition from an ultraminimal state to a minimal state morally must occur.

== Contemporary libertarian organizations ==
{{category see also|Anarchist organizations|Libertarian parties|Libertarian publications|Libertarian think tanks}}
Current international anarchist federations which identify themselves as libertarian include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]] and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]]. The largest organized anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.<ref>Carley, Mark (2004). "Trade union membership 1993–2003". International: SPIRE Associates.</ref> Other active syndicalist movements include the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]] in Sweden; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana]] in Italy; [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] in the United States; and [[Solidarity Federation]] in the United Kingdom. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] claiming 2,000 paying members as well as the [[International Workers' Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]], also remain active. In the United States, there exists the [[Common Struggle|Common Struggle – Libertarian Communist Federation]].

Since the 1950s, many American libertarian organizations have adopted a free-market stance as well as supporting civil liberties and non-interventionist foreign policies. These include the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], [[Francisco Marroquín University]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], [[Center for Libertarian Studies]], the [[Cato Institute]] and [[Liberty International (organization)|Liberty International]]. The activist [[Free State Project]], formed in 2001, works to bring 20,000 libertarians to New Hampshire to influence state policy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html|first=Pam|last=Belluck|work=The New York Times|date=27 October 2003|accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref> Active student organizations include [[Students for Liberty]] and [[Young Americans for Liberty]].

=== Allegation of utopianism ===
Libertarian philosophies such as [[anarchism]] are evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by their critics, often in general and formal debate. European history professor Carl Landauer argued that [[anarchy]] is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force". He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity".<ref name="Landauer"/> In response, ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' states the following: "Anarchy is not a utopia, [and] anarchists make no such claims about human perfection. [...] Remaining disputes would be solved by reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties, or community and workplace assemblies". It also states that "some sort of 'court' system would still be necessary to deal with the remaining crimes and to adjudicate disputes between citizens".<ref>Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective (2017). ''An Anarchist FAQ''. "A.2.16 Does anarchism require "perfect" people to work?". "I.5.8 What about crime?"</ref>

=== Government decentralization ===
{{further|Decentralization}}
John Donahue argues that if political power were radically shifted to local authorities, parochial local interests would predominate at the expense of the whole and that this would exacerbate current problems with collective action.<ref>Donahue, John. (1 May 1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070414205533/http://www.prospect.org/print/V8/32/donahue-j.html "The Devil in Devolution"]. ''American Prospect''. 8 (32).</ref>

Before Donahue, [[Friedrich Engels]] claimed in his essay ''On Authority'' that radical decentralization would destroy modern industrial civilization, citing an example of [[railway]]s:<ref name="On Authority"/>
{{quote|Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?}}

In the end, it is argued that authority in any form is a natural occurrence which should not be abolished.<ref>Goodwin, Barbara. (2014). ''Using Political Ideas'' (6th ed.). John Wiley and Sons, Inc. Hoboken, New Jersey.</ref>

=== Lack of real-world examples ===
[[Michael Lind]] has observed that of the 195 countries in the world today, none have fully actualized a society as advocated by American libertarians:
{{quote|If libertarianism was a good idea, wouldn't at least one country have tried it? Wouldn't there be at least one country, out of nearly two hundred, with minimal government, free trade, open borders, decriminalized drugs, no welfare state and no public education system?<ref>[[Michael Lind|Lind, Michael]] (4 June 2013). [http://www.salon.com/2013/06/04/the_question_libertarians_just_cant_answer "The Question Libertarians Just Can't Answer"]. ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''.</ref>}}

Furthermore, Lind has criticized [[libertarianism in the United States]] as being incompatible with [[democracy]] and apologetic towards [[autocracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/lind_libertariansim/|title=Why libertarians apologize for autocracy|first=Michael|last=Lind|website=Salon|date=30 August 2011}}</ref> In response, American libertarian [[Warren Redlich]] argues that the United States "was extremely libertarian from the founding until 1860, and still very libertarian until roughly 1930".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://independentpoliticalreport.com/2017/04/was-america-ever-libertarian/|title=Was America Ever Libertarian|date=25 April 2017|work=Independent Political Report|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>

=== Tacit authoritarianism ===
The libertarian tendency within anarchism known as [[platformism]] has been criticized by other libertarians of preserving tacitly authoritarian, bureaucratic or statist tendencies.<ref name="Debord"/><ref name="Libcom"/>
