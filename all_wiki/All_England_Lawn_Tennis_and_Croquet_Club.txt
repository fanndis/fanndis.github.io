Initially an [[Amateur sport|amateur]] event that occupied club members and their friends for a few days each summer, the championships have become far more prominent than the club itself. However, it still operates as a members' tennis club.

The club has 375 full members, about 100 temporary playing members, and a number of honorary members, including past Wimbledon singles champions and people who have rendered distinguished service to the game. To become a full or temporary member, an applicant must obtain letters of support from four existing full members, two of whom must have known the applicant for at least three years. The name is then added to the Candidates' List. Honorary Members are elected from time to time by the club's Committee. Membership carries with it the right to purchase two tickets for each day of the Wimbledon Championships. In addition to this all champions are invited to become members.<ref>[http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/club.html "The All England Lawn Tennis Club," ''Wimbledon.org'', accessed  29 June 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612235810/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/club.html |date=12 June 2009 }}</ref>

The current [[Centre Court]] dates from that year. It has been improved and extended on several occasions. Most recently a sliding roof was added in time for the 2009 Championships. In 1924 the old No.1 Court opened on the west side of Centre Court. During World War II The Championships were suspended but the Club remained open with a much smaller staff, and was used for fire and ambulance services, [[British Home Guard]], and a decontamination unit, and troops stationed nearby drilled on the main concourse. At 5:20&nbsp;p.m. on 11 October 1940, five 500 pound German bombs struck the grounds, demolishing 1,200 seats in Centre Court.<ref>{{dead link|date=August 2012}} [http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/history.html About Wimbledon – History – Wartime Wimbledon,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617052153/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/history.html |date=17 June 2009 }} ''Wimbledon.org'', accessed 7 October 2009</ref> The old No.1 Court was replaced with the current No.1 Court in 1997, and the Broadcast Centre was built at the same time. Shortly afterwards, the Millennium Building, which houses facilities for players, press, officials and members, was built on the site of the old No.1 Court.

The Church Road site initially extended only as far north as Centre Court. In 1967 the All England Club purchased {{convert|11|acre|ha}} to the north. This was leased to the [[London New Zealand RFC|New Zealand Sports and Social Club]] and became known as Aorangi Park (Aorangi means "Cloud Piercer", and is the [[Māori language|Māori]] part of [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]]; "Aorangi" is the standard Māori spelling and "Aoraki" is used in the Māori dialect in the vicinity of the mountain). It is most commonly known as 'Henman Hill' because of the popularity of former British tennis player [[Tim Henman]]. Initially the only use that the All England Club itself made of this new land was for car parking during The Championships, but in 1981 the New Zealanders' lease was terminated, and the Club has developed most of the area for its own purposes.

The All England Club, through its subsidiary The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc, issues [[Debenture (sport)|debentures]] to tennis fans every five years to raise funds for capital expenditure.<ref>[http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx "About Wimbledon Debentures,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723005314/http://www.aeltc.com/cms/debentures/about/About.aspx |date=23 July 2010 }} The All England Lawn Tennis Ground, accessed 29 June 2009</ref> The original debentures were issued in 1920. Each debenture provides a pair of tickets for each day of the tournament for five years. Only debenture holders are legally permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties.

In 2011, the Club established another subsidiary, The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships) Limited, trading as AELTC, and transferred all of its assets relating to The Championships to that entity on 1 August of that year. Since that time, the Club's activities have been conducted separately from those of The Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/about_aeltc.html |title=About the AELTC |publisher=The All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>

The Club was the venue for the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|tennis event]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{citation|publisher=Wimbledon |title=About |chapter=Olympics |chapter-url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/olympics.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219072045/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/olympics.html |archivedate=19 December 2008 }}.</ref><ref>{{citation | url = http://www.london2012.com/games/venues/wimbledon.php | publisher = London2012 | title = Wimbledon | accessdate = 29 September 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100916103702/http://www.london2012.com/games/venues/wimbledon.php | archivedate = 16 September 2010 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref>

==Facilities==
The Club currently has 18 tournament grass courts, eight American clay courts, two acrylic courts and five indoor courts. There are also 22 Aorangi Park grass courts, which serve as competitors' practice courts before and during The Championships. The grass courts can be used from May until September. The grass has been cut to 8&nbsp;mm since 1995, and 100% [[perennial ryegrass]] has been used for its strength since 2001 (prior to that, it was 70% perennial rye and 30% creeping [[red fescue]]).<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline=the-wonders-of-wimbledon-fortnight&method=full&objectid=19348144&siteid=93463-name_page.html | last = Bletchly | first = Rachael | title = The Wonders of Wimbledon Fortnight | publisher = People | date = 24 June 2007 | accessdate = 8 July 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120218084822/http://www.people.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Dthe-wonders-of-wimbledon-fortnight%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19348144%26siteid%3D93463-name_page.html | archivedate = 18 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref><ref>{{citation | year = 2009 | chapter-url = http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/infosheets/grasscourts_2009.pdf | title = The Championships | chapter = Grass Courts | publisher = Wimbledon | accessdate = 15 July 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224154523/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/infosheets/grasscourts_2009.pdf | archivedate = 24 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> The courts are renovated in September, using nine tons of grass seed annually.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grass courts |url=https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/atoz/grass_courts.html |work=About the grass courts at Wimbledon |accessdate=27 July 2019 |year=2019 }}</ref>

The largest court is the [[Centre Court]], which hosts the finals of the main singles and doubles events at The Championships. The quotation above the players' entrance to Centre Court is an extract from the poem "[[If—]]", by [[Rudyard Kipling]], which reads: "If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same." This court also served as the main venue for the tennis events at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].
Initially, the courts were arranged in such a way that the principal court was situated in the middle with the others arranged around it; hence the title "Centre Court".<ref>{{citation | year = 2009 | chapter-url = http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/history.html | title = About | chapter = The Beginning | publisher = Wimbledon | accessdate = 7 October 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090617052153/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/history.html | archivedate = 17 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref>

The present Centre Court, built in 1922 upon the move of the Club, was not actually in the centre at the time it was built, but as new courts were added in later years it became a more accurate description. It currently seats 15,000 – expanded from 14,000 following redevelopment in 2007–08 (spatially, the expansion is greater than those numbers imply, as seats have been widened), and (as of 2009) is the fourth-largest tennis stadium in the world.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/209478-the-championships-wimbledon "The Championships, Wimbledon"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120617025903/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/209478-the-championships-wimbledon |date=17 June 2012 }}, ''Bleacher Report'', 29 June 2009, accessed 8 July 2009</ref> The Club installed a retractable roof on Centre Court which was completed in May 2009. It is a 'folding concertina' made of 5,200 square metres of a [[translucent]] waterproof fabric that allows [[Sunlight|natural light]] to reach the grass, and opens or closes in under 10 minutes.<ref>{{citation | year = 2009 | chapter-url = http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/longtermplan.html#works | series = About Wimbledon | title = Behind the scenes | chapter = How the roof works | publisher = Wimbledon | accessdate = 29 June 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120616174702/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/guide/longtermplan.html#works | archivedate = 16 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> Redevelopment work commenced in 2006 and Centre Court had no roof at all in place for the duration of the 2007 Championships.

The other 'show court' is [[No. 1 Court (Wimbledon)|No.1 Court]], built in 1997, which holds around 11,500 people and occasionally plays host to [[Davis Cup]] matches (Centre Court usually being reserved for the Wimbledon Championships). It has been fitted with a retractable roof similar to Centre Court and was unveiled at a special ceremony on 19 May 2019.<ref name='BBC-C1Roof'>{{cite news | title = Wimbledon prize money up 40% and roof planned for Court One | date = 23 April 2013 | publisher = [[BBC]] | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/22266581 | work = BBC Sport | accessdate = 23 April 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130425040410/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/22266581 | archivedate = 25 April 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

A new [[No. 2 Court (Wimbledon)|No.2 Court]] with 4,000 seats was first used at the 2009 Championships. The old No.2 Court was renamed [[No. 3 Court (Wimbledon)|No.3 Court]] in 2009, and was rebuilt after the 2009 Championships. The grounds are set to undergo major renovation in the coming years as part of the Wimbledon Master Plan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wimbledon to see one of the biggest revamps in its history |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/10013502/Wimbledon-to-see-one-of-the-biggest-revamps-in-its-history.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |author=Ensor, Josie |date=23 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213163727/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon/10013502/Wimbledon-to-see-one-of-the-biggest-revamps-in-its-history.html |archivedate=13 February 2017  }}</ref>

In December 2018 the club agreed a £65m million compensation package with the members of the adjacent [[Wimbledon Park Golf Club]] to cut short their lease on the ground in order to expand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-tennis-wimbledon-golf-idUKKBN1OC31S|title=Wimbledon set to expand after golf agrees to sell|date=13 December 2018|work=Reuters|access-date=23 June 2019|language=en}}</ref>

==The Championships==
{{main|The Championships, Wimbledon}}
Among the features that differentiate The Championships from the other Grand Slams are that they are played on grass courts, they require the players to wear white, and they schedule a day off on the middle Sunday of the tournament (though sometimes – such as in 2004 and 2016 – poor weather has meant play has needed to take place).<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5hXlhZPE_1GjopwQ1MHUcRG4JUmNA | last = Fendrich | first = Howard | title = Like Federer, Venus seeks sixth Wimbledon title | publisher = The Canadian Press | date = 21 June 2009| accessdate = 8 July 2009}}.</ref> The winner of the Gentlemen's singles at The Championships receives a gold trophy inscribed with the words: "The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World".<ref>{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Fv2LTX6PfqcC&pg=PA26 | last = Rigby | first = Christopher | title = 1000 Facts on Sport | page = 136 | publisher = [[Miles Kelly Publishing]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-84236-397-3}}</ref>

The Championships attract attendance of around 450,000 people. Ninety per cent of the financial surplus that the Club generates from running The Championships is used to develop tennis in Great Britain; between 1998–2016 the surplus ranged from £25–40&nbsp;million per year.<ref>{{citation | chapter-url = http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/infosheets/finance_2009.pdf | title = The Championships | chapter = Finance | publisher = Wimbledon | accessdate = 15 July 2009 | year = 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120224154629/http://aeltc2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/infosheets/finance_2009.pdf | archivedate = 24 February 2012 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> The Championships are run by a Committee of Management that consists of 12 club members and seven nominees of The [[Lawn Tennis Association]] (LTA).

The mere fact that I'm not a member is a full sentence that speaks for itself."
