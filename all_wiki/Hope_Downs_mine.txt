The '''Hope Downs mine''' is an [[iron ore]] mining complex located in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]]. It comprises four large [[open-pit]] mines (Hope 1 North, Hope 1 South, Hope 4 and Baby Hope). The mines are co-owned by the [[Hancock Prospecting |Hancock Group]] and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]], and the complex was named after Hope Hancock.<ref name=hancock>{{cite web | title=Hope Downs | website=Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd | date=23 July 2020 | url=https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/featured_item/hope-downs/ | access-date=25 July 2020}}</ref>

After the establishment of successful operations at Hope 1 North and South from 2007 onwards, Hope Downs 4 was developed, commencing production in 2013. Hope 4 is about {{convert|30|km}} north of [[Newman, Western Australia|Newman]], and had a reserve of 162Mt as at 2016. Production at Baby Hope started in 2018.<ref name=hancock/> 

The [[Hamersley Range]], where the mine is located, contains 80 percent of all identified iron ore reserves in [[Australia]] and is one of the world's major iron ore provinces.<ref>[http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/education/fact_sheets/iron.jsp Iron fact sheet - Australian Resources and Deposits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218001043/http://www.australianminesatlas.gov.au/education/fact_sheets/iron.jsp |date=2011-02-18 }} [[Geoscience Australia]] website, accessed: 7 November 2010</ref>

Rio Tinto iron ore operations in the Pilbara began in 1966.<ref name="Pilbara">[http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/301_pilbara.asp Pilbara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021131325/http://www.riotintoironore.com/ENG/operations/301_pilbara.asp |date=2013-10-21 }} Rio Tinto Iron Ore website, accessed: 6 November 2010</ref> Exploration work through [[Hancock Prospecting]] at the Hope Downs 4 deposit began in 1992.

== In popular culture ==
In June 2018, Australian [[indie rock]] band [[Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever]] named their debut [[album]] ''Hope Downs'' after the vast mining complex, explaining that it evoked the notion of "standing at the edge of the void of the big unknown, and finding something to hold on to."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://rollingblackouts.bandtshirts.com.au/buy/rolling-blackouts-coastal-fever/7929-hope-downs-cd |title=Hope Downs CD | website=Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever website|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>
