==History==

===Origins===

''Business Today'' was founded as a magazine in 1968 by [[Steve Forbes]], Michael Mims, and Jon Perel, who were students at Princeton University at the time. Created in an era where business and finance was facing backlash from the public, Forbes, Mims, and Perel's magazine immediately caught the attention of the outside world. Later in 1968, the three co-founders were interviewed on the [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'' Show]] with [[Hugh Downs]], giving the magazine nationwide notoriety.

===1970s===

In 1971, Business Today became a nonprofit foundation. The same year, the organization hosted its first conference, “Business Tomorrow,” which would eventually evolve into the present-day International Conference. This first conference lasted from October 20–22. Speakers included [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] and [[Ralph Nader]]. The event was held in Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington, D.C.

The conferences originally happened sporadically and in cities around the country, but by the mid-to-late 70s, they became more regular and concentrated geographically. In 1974, the first official annual International Conference was held in [[New York City]], inviting students from around the globe to participate.

In 1976, [[Meg Whitman]] became Vice President of Business Today.

===1980s to 2000s===

In 1988, [[Wendy Kopp]] became President of Business Today. She brainstormed the idea of Teach for America during an International Conference.

In 2007, [[Michael Kratsios]] became President of Business Today.

===2010s===

In the 2010s, Business Today began greatly expanding its programming for college students, as well as increasing its editorial capacities.

In 2012, Business Today hosted the Start @ a Startup conference. During the same year, Business Today published its [http://journal.businesstoday.org Online Journal], which features editorial pieces, interviews, career pieces, seminar coverage, and conference coverage.

In 2013, Business Today launched its Women in Business Conference, which would eventually become rebranded as HerVentures.

In 2017, Mihika Kapoor spearheaded the first Design Nation conference for undergraduate students. Business Today also launched its first annual Breakout trip, allowing for 15 students to visit companies around New York City.

In 2018, Business Today celebrated its 50th Anniversary.
