'''Trinity College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|constituent college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] in England. The college was founded in 1546 by King [[Henry VIII]]. With around 600 undergraduates, 300 [[graduate student|graduates]], and over 180 [[Research fellow|fellows]], it is the largest college in either of the [[Oxbridge]] universities by number of undergraduates. In terms of total student numbers, it is second only to [[Homerton College, Cambridge]].<ref name="student-numbers">Student figures from the 2015 Cambridge Trinity College Official Website https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about</ref>

Members of Trinity have won 34 Nobel Prizes<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/nobel-laureates |title=Trinity College Cambridge – Nobel Prizes |publisher=Trin.cam.ac.uk |accessdate=3 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528214933/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/nobel-laureates |archive-date=28 May 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> out of the 121 [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|won by members of Cambridge University]], the highest number of any college at either Oxford or Cambridge.

M. Trevelyan]] and [[E.H. Carr]], philosophers [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] (whom it expelled before reaccepting), and Soviet spies [[Kim Philby]], [[Guy Burgess]], and [[Anthony Blunt]].

Two members of the [[British royal family]] have studied at Trinity and been awarded degrees as a result: [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Prince William of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], who gained an MA in 1790, and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], who was awarded a lower second class BA in 1970. Other royal family members have studied there without obtaining degrees, including [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], and [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]].

Trinity has many college societies, including the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]], which is the oldest mathematical university society in the United Kingdom, and the [[First and Third Trinity Boat Club]], its [[Sport rowing|rowing]] club, which gives its name to the [[First and Third Trinity Boat Club May Ball|college's May Ball]]. Along with [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's]], [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] colleges, it has also provided several of the well known members of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]], an intellectual [[secret society]]. In 1848, Trinity hosted the meeting at which Cambridge undergraduates representing [[public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] such as Westminster codified the early rules of [[Association Football|football]], known as the [[Cambridge Rules]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i32zcifYgEgC&q=%22association+football%22+trinity+college&pg=PA3|title=The World's Game: A History of Soccer|isbn=9780252067181|last1=Murray|first1=Bill|last2=Murray|first2=William J|date=1 January 1998}}</ref> Trinity's sister college in Oxford is [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. Like that college, Trinity has been linked with [[Westminster School]] since the school's re-foundation in 1560, and its Master is an ''[[ex officio]] ''governor of the school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intranet.westminster.org.uk/lists/whoswho/governors.asp |title=Westminster School Intranet |publisher=Intranet.westminster.org.uk |accessdate=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120713102645/http://intranet.westminster.org.uk/lists/whoswho/governors.asp |archivedate=13 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Trinity also maintains a significant connection with [[Whitgift School]] in Croydon, as John Whitgift, the founder of Whitgift School, was the master of Trinity from 1561 to 1564.

==History==
[[File:Cambridge 1575 colour Trinity College.jpg|thumb|upright|1575 map showing the [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] (top left) and [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] (top right) buildings before [[Thomas Nevile]]'s reconstruction.]]

===Foundation===
The college was founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1546, from the merger of two existing colleges: [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] (founded by [[Hervey de Stanton]] in 1324), and [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] (established by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1317 and refounded by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1337). At the time, Henry had been seizing (Catholic) church lands from abbeys and monasteries. The universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], being both religious institutions and quite rich, expected to be next in line. The King duly passed an [[Act of Parliament]] that allowed him to suppress (and confiscate the property of) any college he wished. The universities used their contacts to plead with his sixth wife, [[Catherine Parr]]. The Queen persuaded her husband not to close them down, but to create a new college. The king did not want to use royal funds, so he instead combined two colleges ([[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]] and [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]]) and seven hostels namely [[Physwick Hostel, Cambridge|Physwick]] (formerly part of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]), Gregory's, Ovyng's, Catherine's, Garratt, Margaret's and Tyler's, to form Trinity.

===Nevile's expansion===
[[File:Trinity College Cambridge 1690.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[David Loggan]]'s print of 1690 showing Nevile's Great Court (foreground) and Nevile's Court with the then-new [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]] (background) – New Court had yet to be built]]

Contrary to popular belief, the monastic lands granted by Henry VIII were not on their own sufficient to ensure Trinity's eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, it was not until the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593–1615) that Trinity assumed both its spaciousness and its courtly association with the governing class that distinguished it since the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]: in the exaggerated words of [[Roger Ascham]], Trinity was little more than a ''colonia deducta''{{clarify|date=September 2014}}.<ref name="british-history1">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66656#s20 |title=The colleges and halls – Trinity College &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> Its first four Masters were educated at St John's, and it took until around 1575 for the two colleges' application numbers to draw even, a position in which they have remained since the Civil War. In terms of wealth, Trinity's current fortunes belie prior fluctuations; Nevile's building campaign drove the college into debt from which it only surfaced in the 1640s, and the Mastership of [[Richard Bentley]] adversely affected applications and finances.<ref name="british-history1"/> Bentley himself was notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master's Lodge, and for his repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellows.

Most of the Trinity's major buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Thomas Nevile]], who became Master of Trinity in 1593, rebuilt and redesigned much of the college. This work included the enlargement and completion of [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]], and the construction of [[Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge|Nevile's Court]] between Great Court and the [[river Cam]]. Nevile's Court was completed in the late 17th century when the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]], designed by [[Christopher Wren]], was built.

In the 20th century, Trinity College, St John's College and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] were for decades the main recruiting grounds for the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite, intellectual secret society.

In 2011, the [[John Templeton Foundation]] awarded Trinity College's Master, the astrophysicist [[Baron Rees of Ludlow|Martin Rees]], its controversial million-pound<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/06/martin-rees-templeton-prize|title=Martin Rees wins controversial £1m prize|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=29 February 2012|first=Ian|last=Sample}}</ref> [[Templeton Prize]], for "affirming life's spiritual dimension".

Trinity is sometimes suggested to be the second, third or fourth wealthiest landowner in the UK (or in England) – after the [[Crown land|Crown Estate]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and the [[Church of England]]. {{cn|date=October 2020}} In 2005, Trinity's annual rental income from its properties was reported to be in excess of £20&nbsp;million.

Trinity owns:

In 2018, Trinity revealed that it had investments totalling £9.1M in companies involved in oil and gas production, exploration and refinement. These included holdings of £1.2M in Royal Dutch Shell, £1.7M in Exxon Mobil and £1M in Chevron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/16518|title=Big Oil and deep sea drilling: The corporations underpinning Cambridge colleges' investments|website=Varsity Online|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> On 17 February 2020, protestors from the campaign group [[Extinction Rebellion]] dug up the front lawn of Trinity College to protest against the College's investments in fossil fuels and its negotiations to sell off a farm in Suffolk that was to be turned into a lorry park.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-51534446</ref>

In 2019, Trinity confirmed that it planned to withdraw from the [[Universities Superannuation Scheme]] (USS), the main pre-1992 UK University pension provider.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/college-notices/trinity-college-and-uss/|title=Trinity College and USS – Trinity College Cambridge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref> In response, more than 500 Cambridge academics signed an open letter undertaking to "refuse to supervise Trinity students or to engage in other discretionary work in support of Trinity’s teaching and research activities".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EHwkVrK5MAPsDfYOX3qlbRs6uaywPG88OLFAbn0zMwA/edit?usp=embed_facebook|title=An open letter to the Council and Fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge|website=Google Docs|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>

===Legends===
[[Lord Byron]] purportedly kept a pet bear whilst living in the college.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalbyronsociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=7 |title=University |publisher=International Byron Society |accessdate=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726181932/http://www.internationalbyronsociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=7 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A second legend is that it is possible to walk from Cambridge to [[Oxford]] on land solely owned by Trinity. Several varieties of this legend exist – others refer to the combined land of Trinity College, Cambridge and [[Trinity College, Oxford]], of Trinity College, Cambridge and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], or [[St John's College, Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. All are almost certainly false.

Trinity is often cited as the inventor of an English, less sweet, version of [[crème brûlée]], known as "Trinity burnt cream",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefoody.com/pudding/burntcream.html|title=Cambridge Trinity Burnt Cream|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114110606/http://thefoody.com/pudding/burntcream.html|archivedate=14 January 2010|publisher=thefoody.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=TRINITY BURNT CREAM |url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-burnt-cream/ |publisher=Trinity College, Cambridge |accessdate=17 February 2020}}</ref> or "crème brûlée Trinity". The burnt-cream, first introduced at Trinity [[High Table]] in 1879, in fact differs quite markedly from French recipes, the earliest of which is from 1691.

===Trinity in Camberwell===
Trinity College has a long-standing relationship with the Parish of St George's, [[Camberwell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dswark.org/parishes/051l.htm|title=Diocese of Southwark:Parishes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040904051226/http://www.dswark.org/parishes/051l.htm|archivedate=4 September 2004|publisher=Diocese of Southwark}}</ref> in South London. Students from the College have helped to run holiday schemes for children from the parish since 1966. The relationship was formalised in 1979 with the establishment of '''Trinity in Camberwell''' as a registered charity (Charity Commission no. 279447)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ |title=Charity Commission Homepage |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date=21 May 2007 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402222408/http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ |archive-date=2 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which exists 'to provide, promote, assist and encourage the advancement of education and relief of need and other charitable objects for the benefit of the community in the Parish of St George's, [[Camberwell]], and the neighbourhood thereof.'

==Buildings and grounds==
[[File:Historical plan of Trinity College, Cambridge (1897) - cambridgedescri00atkiuoft 0571.png|thumb|400px|A historical plan of the development of Trinity College by 1897.]]

===Great Gate===
The Great Gate is the main entrance to the college, leading to the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]]. A statue of the college founder, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], stands in a niche above the doorway. In his right hand he holds a chair leg instead of the original sword and myths abound as to how the switch was carried out and by whom. In 1983 Trinity College undergraduate Lance Anisfeld, then vice President of CURLS (Cambridge Union Raving Loony Society) replaced the chair leg with a bicycle pump. Once discovered the following day, the college removed the pump and replaced with another chair leg. The original chair leg was auctioned off by TV Presenter Chris Serle at a Cambridge Union Society charity raffle in 1985.   In 1704, the University's first [[Astronomy departments in the University of Cambridge|astronomical]] [[observatory]] was built on top of the gatehouse. Beneath the founder's statue are the coats of arms of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], the founder of King's Hall, and those of his five sons who survived to maturity, as well as William of Hatfield, whose shield is blank as he died as an infant, before being granted arms.

===Great Court===
[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] (built principally 1599–1608) was the brainchild of [[Thomas Nevile]], who demolished several existing buildings on this site, including almost the entirety of the former college of [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]]. The sole remaining building of Michaelhouse was replaced by the then current Kitchens (designed by [[James Essex]]) in 1770–1775. The Master's Lodge is the official residence of the Sovereign when in Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

King's Hostel (built 1377–1416) is located to the north of Great Court, behind the Clock Tower, this is (along with the King's Gate), the sole remaining building from [[King's Hall, Cambridge|King's Hall]].

Bishop's Hostel (built 1671, [[Robert Minchin]]) is a detached building to the southwest of Great Court, and named after [[John Hacket]], Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Additional buildings were built in 1878 by Arthur Blomfield.

===Nevile's Court===
[[File:Cmglee Cambridge Trinity College Neviles Court.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]] at Nevile's Court]]

[[Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge|Nevile's Court]] (built 1614) is located between Great Court and the river, this court was created by a bequest by the college's master, [[Thomas Nevile]], originally two-thirds of its current length and without the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]]. The court was extended and the appearance of the upper floor remodelled slightly in 1758 by [[James Essex]]. Cloisters run around the court, providing sheltered walkways from the rear of Great Hall to the college library and reading room as well as the Wren Library and New Court.

[[File:WrenLibraryInterior.jpg|thumb|Wren Library interior, showing the limewood carvings by [[Grinling Gibbons]]]]
[[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]] (built 1676–1695, [[Christopher Wren]]) is located at the west end of Nevile's Court, the Wren is one of Cambridge's most famous and well-endowed libraries. Among its notable possessions are two of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] First Folios, a 14th-century manuscript of [[The Vision of Piers Plowman]], and letters written by Sir Isaac Newton. The [[Eadwine Psalter]] belongs to Trinity but is kept by [[Cambridge University Library]]. Below the building are the pleasant Wren Library Cloisters, where students may enjoy a fine view of the Great Hall in front of them, and the river and [[The Backs|Backs]] directly behind.

===New Court===
New Court (or ''King's Court''; built 1825, [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]]) is located to the south of Nevile's Court, and built in Tudor-Gothic style; this court is notable for the large tree in the centre. A myth is sometimes circulated that this was the tree from which the apple dropped onto [[Isaac Newton]]; in fact, Newton was at home in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth|Woolsthorpe]] when he deduced his theory of gravity – and the tree is a [[sweet chestnut]] tree.<ref>[http://alumni.trin.cam.ac.uk/document.doc?id=101 Trinity College Cambridge, "The Fountain", Issue 14, Spring 2012, p.12]</ref> Many other "New Courts" in the colleges were built at this time to accommodate the new influx of students.

===Other courts===
[[File:cmglee Cambridge Trinity College Whewells Court.jpg|thumb|left|Whewell's Court north range]]
Whewell's Court (actually two courts with a third in between, built 1860 & 1868, architect [[Anthony Salvin]])<ref>{{cite web|title=Whewell's Court, Trinity College|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-47282-trinity-college-whewell-s-court-whewell-s|work=British Listed Buildings|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> is located across the street from Great Court, and was entirely paid for by [[William Whewell]], the Master of the college from 1841 until his death in 1866. The north range was later remodelled by [[W.D. Caroe]].

Angel Court (built 1957–1959, [[H. C. Husband]]) is located between Great Court and [[Trinity Street, Cambridge|Trinity Street]], and is used along with the Wolfson Building for accommodating first year students.

The Wolfson Building (built 1968–1972, Architects Co-Partnership) is located to the south of Whewell's Court, on top of a podium above shops, this building resembles a brick-clad ziggurat, and is used exclusively for first-year accommodation. Having been renovated during the academic year 2005–06, rooms are now almost all en-suite.

Blue Boar Court (built 1989, [[McCormac Jamieson Prichard|MJP Architects]] and Wright) is located to the south of the Wolfson Building, on top of podium a floor up from ground level, and including the upper floors of several surrounding Georgian buildings on Trinity Street, Green Street and [[Sidney Street, Cambridge|Sidney Street]].

[[Burrell's Field]] (built 1995, MJP Architects)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjparchitects.co.uk/index.php?show=Burrells_Field_%3Cbr%3ETrinity_College,%3Cbr%3E_Cambridge |title=MJP Architects |publisher=MJP Architects |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> is located on a site to the west of the main College buildings, opposite the [[Cambridge University Library]].

There are also College rooms above shops in [[Bridge Street, Cambridge|Bridge Street]] and [[Jesus Lane]], behind Whewell's Court, and graduate accommodation in Portugal Street and other roads around Cambridge.

===Chapel===

Trinity bridge is a stone built tripled-arched road bridge across the River Cam. It was built of Portland stone in 1765 to the designs of [[James Essex]] to replace an earlier bridge built in 1651 and is a [[Grade I listed]] building.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1331804|desc=TRINITY COLLEGE, TRINITY BRIDGE |accessdate= 13 April 2017}}</ref>

==Academic profile==
Over the last 20 years, the college has always come at least eighth in the [[Tompkins Table]], which ranks the 29 Cambridge colleges according to the academic performance of their undergraduates, and for the last six occasions it has been in first place. Its average position in the [[Tompkins Table]] over that period has been between second and third, higher than any other.  In 2016, 45% of Trinity undergraduates achieved Firsts, 12 percentage points ahead of second place Pembroke – a recent record among Cambridge colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/10514|title=The Tompkins Table 2016: Christ's has risen}}</ref>

===Admissions===

Currently, about 50% of Trinity's undergraduates attended independent schools. In 2006 it accepted a smaller proportion of students from state schools (39%) than any other Cambridge college, and on a rolling three-year average it has admitted a smaller proportion of state school pupils (42%) than any other college at either Cambridge or Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table7.pdf |title=Cambridge 2005/2006 admissions statistics by college |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table7.pdf |title=Cambridge 2004/2005 admissions statistics by college |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/facts_and_figures/undergraduate_admissions_statistics/school_type.html|title=Oxford 3-year average admissions statistics by college|accessdate=1 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802013322/http://www.ox.ac.uk/about_the_university/facts_and_figures/undergraduate_admissions_statistics/school_type.html|archivedate=2 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
According to the ''[[The Good Schools Guide|Good Schools Guide]]'', about 7% of British school-age students attend private schools, although this figure refers to students in all school years – a higher proportion attend private schools in their final two years before university. Trinity states that it disregards what type of school its applicants attend, and accepts students solely on the basis of their academic prospects.

Trinity admitted its first woman graduate student in 1976 and its first woman undergraduate in 1978. It elected its first female fellow ([[Marian Hobson]]) in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |author=Trinity College, Cambridge |url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/history/20th-century-present |title=Trinity College Cambridge – 20th Century to Present |publisher=Trin.cam.ac.uk |accessdate=1 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702194201/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/history/20th-century-present |archive-date=2 July 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Scholarships and prizes===
[[File:StatueOfIsaacNewton.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in the chapel, where scholars are typically installed]]
The Scholars, together with the Master and Fellows, make up the '''Foundation of the College'''.

In order of seniority:

'''Research Scholars''' receive funding for graduate studies. Typically one must graduate in the top ten percent of one's class and continue for graduate study at Trinity. They are given first preference in the assignment of college rooms and number approximately 25.

The '''Senior Scholars''' usually consist of those who attain a degree with [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class honours]] or higher in any year after the first of an undergraduate [[tripos]]. The college pays them a stipend of £250 a year and allows them to choose rooms directly following the research scholars. There are around 40 senior scholars at any one time.

The '''Junior Scholars''' usually consist of those who attained a First in their first year. Their stipend is £175 a year. They are given preference in the room ballot over 2nd years who are not scholars.

These scholarships are tenable for the academic year following that in which the result was achieved. If a scholarship is awarded but the student does not continue at Trinity then only a quarter of the stipend is given. However all students who achieve a First are awarded an additional £240 prize upon announcement of the results.

All final year undergraduates who achieve first-class honours in their final exams are offered full financial support, through a scheme known as Internal Graduate Studentships, to read for a [[Master's degree]] at Cambridge<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/postgraduate/graduate-funding-awards/|title=Trinity Graduate Student Funding Awards – Trinity College Cambridge|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> (this funding is also sometimes available for students who achieved high second-class honours marks). Other support is available for [[Doctorate|PhD]] degrees. The College also offers a number of other bursaries and studentships open to external applicants. The right to walk on the grass in the college courts is exclusive to Fellows of the college and their guests. Scholars do, however, have the right to walk on the Scholars' Lawn, but only in full academic dress.

===Great Court Run===
[[File:cmglee Cambridge Trinity College Great Court.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]], with (from left to right) the dining hall, Master's Lodge, fountain, clock tower, chapel and Great Gate]]

The Great Court Run is an attempt to run round the 400-yard perimeter of [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] (approximately 367m), in the 43 seconds of the clock striking twelve. Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the day of the Matriculation Dinner. It is a rather difficult challenge: one needs to be a fine sprinter to achieve it, but it is by no means necessary to be of Olympic standard, despite assertions made in the press.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article2748773.ece Student breaks 'Chariots of Fire' record] ''Times Online'' article. 27 October 2007.</ref>

It is widely believed that [[Sebastian Coe]] successfully completed the run when he beat [[Steve Cram]] in a charity race in October 1988. Coe's time on 29 October 1988 was reported by [[Norris McWhirter]] to have been 45.52 seconds, but it was actually 46.0 seconds (confirmed by the video tape), while Cram's was 46.3 seconds. The clock on that day took 44.4 seconds (i.e., a "long" time, probably two days after the last winding) and the video film confirms that Coe was some 12 metres short of his finish line when the fateful final stroke occurred. The television commentators were disingenuous in suggesting that the dying sounds of the bell could be included in the striking time, thereby allowing Coe's run to be claimed as successful.{{citation needed|reason=Lots of detail for something with no source|date=December 2015}}

One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe found the challenge so tough is that they started at the middle of one side of the court, thereby having to negotiate four right-angle turns. In the days when students started at a corner, only three turns were needed. In addition, Cram and Coe ran entirely on the flagstones, while until 2017 students have typically cut corners to run on the cobbles. {{citation needed|reason=Lots of detail for something with no source|date=December 2015}}

The Great Court Run was portrayed in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' about the British Olympic runners of 1924.

Until the mid-1990s, the run was traditionally attempted by first-year students at midnight following their matriculation dinner.<ref>[http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2015-10-13/runners-latest-attempt-to-beat-the-college-clock/ "Runners' latest attempt to beat the college clock"], ''ITV News'', 13 October 2015</ref> Following a number of accidents to undergraduates running on slippery cobbles,{{citation needed|reason=Lots of detail for something with no source|date=December 2015}} the college now organises a more formal Great Court Run, at 12 noon on the day of the matriculation dinner: while some contestants compete seriously, many others run in fancy dress and there are prizes for the fastest man and woman in each category.<ref>[https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/news/great-court-run-reverts-to-tradition/, "Great Court run reverts to tradition"], Trinity College, 11 October 2017</ref>

===Open-air concerts===

}}
One Sunday each June (the exact date depending on the university term), the [[Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge|College Choir]] perform a short concert immediately after the clock strikes noon. Known as ''Singing from the Towers'', half of the choir sings from the top of the Great Gate, while the other half sings from the top of the Clock Tower approximately 60 metres away, giving a strong [[antiphon]]al effect. Midway through the concert, the Cambridge University Brass Ensemble performs from the top of the Queen's Tower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitycollegechoir.com/concerts/|title=Trinity College Choir – Concerts|work=trinitycollegechoir.com}}</ref>

Later that same day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as ''Singing on the River'', where they perform [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]] and arrangements of popular songs from a raft of [[punt (boat)|punts]] lit with lanterns or fairy lights on the [[River Cam|river]]. For the finale, [[John Wilbye]]'s madrigal ''Draw on, sweet night'', the raft is unmoored and punted downstream to give a [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade out]] effect. As a tradition, however, this latter concert dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this, an annual concert on the river was given by the University Madrigal Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertprogrammes.org.uk/index.php?|title=Search|website=Concert Programmes}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Mallard===
Another tradition relates to an artificial duck known as the Mallard, which should reside in the rafters of the Great Hall. Students occasionally moved the duck from one rafter to another without permission from the college. This is considered difficult; access to the Hall outside meal-times is prohibited and the rafters are dangerously high, so it was not attempted for several years. During the Easter term of 2006, the Mallard was knocked off its rafter by one of the pigeons which enter the Hall through the pinnacle windows. It was reinstated by students in 2016, and is only visible from the far end of the hall.<ref>Geoffrey Winthrop Young, John Hurst, Richard Williams, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KuOvj8huqGgC&pg=PA29 ''The Roof-Climber's Guide to Trinity: Omnibus Edition''] p.29, Oleander Press, 2013, {{ISBN|0900891920}}</ref><ref>Jovan Powar, Kate Pfeffer, [https://issuu.com/travistytrinity/docs/travisty_issue_1 ''Travisty Issue 1'']</ref>

===Chair legs and bicycles===
[[File:CambridgeTrinityGreatGate.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of the college's founder [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] presiding over the Great Gate, with a chair leg in his right hand]]
The sceptre held by the statue of Henry VIII mounted above the medieval Great Gate was replaced with a chair leg as a prank many years ago. It has remained there to this day: when in the 1980s students exchanged the chair leg for a bicycle pump, the College replaced the chair leg.

For many years it was the custom for students to place a bicycle high in branches of the tree in the centre of New Court. Usually invisible except in winter, when the leaves had fallen, such bicycles tended to remain for several years before being removed by the authorities. The students then inserted another bicycle. {{citation needed|reason=section|date=January 2016}}

===College rivalry===
The college remains a great rival of [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St John's]] which is its main competitor in sports and academia (John's is situated next to Trinity). This has given rise to a number of anecdotes and myths. It is often cited as the reason why the older courts of Trinity generally have no J staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order. A far more likely reason remains the absence of the letter J in the [[Latin alphabet]], and that [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St John's College's]] older courts also lack J staircases. There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on the bowling green pointing in the direction of John's, though this orientation may be coincidental. Another story sometimes told is that the reason that the clock in Trinity Great Court strikes each hour twice is that the fellows of St John's once complained about the noise it made.  {{citation needed|reason=section|date=January 2016}}

===Minor traditions===
Trinity College undergraduate gowns are readily distinguished from the black gowns favoured by most other Cambridge colleges. They are instead dark blue with black facings. They are expected to be worn to formal events such as formal halls and also when an undergraduate sees the Dean of the College in a formal capacity.

Trinity students, along with those of King's and St John's, are the first to be presented to the Congregation of the Regent House at graduation.

===College Grace===
[[File:ISH WC Trinity1.jpg|thumb|The High Table is at the far end of the dining hall under the portrait of [[Henry VIII]]]]

Each evening before dinner, grace is recited by the senior fellow presiding, as follows:

{{Verse translation |lang=la
|1=Benedic, Domine, nos et dona tua,
quae de largitate tua sumus sumpturi,
et concede, ut illis salubriter nutriti
tibi debitum obsequium praestare valeamus,
per Christum Dominum nostrum.
|2=Bless us, Lord, and these gifts
which, through your generosity, we are about to receive
and grant that we, wholesomely nourished by them,
may be able to offer you the service we owe
through Christ our Lord.
}}

If both of the two high tables are in use then the following [[antiphonary|antiphonal]] formula is prefixed to the main grace:

{{Verse translation |lang=la
|1=A. Oculi omnium in te sperant Domine:
B. Et tu das escam illis in tempore.
A. Aperis tu manum tuam,
B. Et imples omne animal benedictione.
|2=The eyes of all are on you, Lord:
and you give them their food, in due time.
You open your hand
and bestow upon all living things your blessing.<ref>[[Psalm 145]]:15–16</ref>
}}

Following the meal, the simple formula {{lang|la|Benedicto benedicatur}} is pronounced.<ref>Reginald H. Adams, The College Graces of Oxford and Cambridge (Oxford: Perpetua Press, 1992).</ref>

==Trinity in literature==
[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|Newton's own copy of the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]], with handwritten corrections, on display in the Wren Library]]
<blockquote>
"Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock, <br>
Who never let the quarters, night or day,<br>
Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours <br>
Twice over with a male and female voice. <br>
Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;<br>
And from my pillow, looking forth by light <br>
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold <br>
The antechapel where the statue stood <br>
Of Newton with his prism and silent face,<br>
The marble index of a mind for ever <br>
Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone."<br></blockquote> – [[William Wordsworth]], The Prelude (1850), Book Third, describing his view from [[St John's College, Cambridge]].

<blockquote>
"One night, just before ten o'clock, he [Maurice] slipped into Trinity and waited in the Great Court until the gates were shut behind him. Looking up, he noticed the night. He was indifferent to beauty as a rule, but "what a show of stars!" he thought. And how the fountain splashed when the chimes died away, and the gates and doors all over Cambridge had been fastened up. Trinity men were around him – all of enormous intellect and culture. Maurice's set had laughed at Trinity, but they could not ignore its disdainful radiance, or deny the superiority it scarcely troubles to affirm. He had come to it without their knowledge, humbly, to ask its help. His witty speech faded in its atmosphere, and his heart beat violently."</blockquote> – [[E. M. Forster]], graduate of [[King's College Cambridge]], writes of Maurice Hall's search for homosexual love at Trinity College in his novel, [[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]] (completed 1914, published 1970).

<blockquote>'[B]ut here I was actually at the door which leads into the library itself. I must have opened it, for instantly there issued, like a guardian angel barring the way with a flutter of black gown instead of white wings, a deprecating, silvery, kindly gentleman, who regretted in a low voice as he waved me back that ladies are only admitted to the library if accompanied by a Fellow of the college or furnished with a letter of introduction.

That a famous library has been cursed by a woman is a matter of complete indifference to a famous library. Venerable and calm, with all its treasures safe locked within its breast, it sleeps complacently and will, so far as I am concerned, so sleep for ever.'</blockquote> – [[Virginia Woolf]] describes her attempt at entry to the Wren, [[A Room of One's Own]] (1929) -->
