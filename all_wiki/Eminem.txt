'''Marshall Bruce Mathers III''' (born October 17, 1972),<!--Do NOT add Slim Shady. That is a character, not an alias/stage name.--> known professionally as '''Eminem''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|m|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|m}}; often stylized as '''EMINƎM'''), is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer. Credited with popularizing [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]], Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in [[popular music]]. While much of his [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] work during the early 2000s made him hugely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst and the American [[underclass]]. He has been [[List of artists influenced by Eminem|influential for many artists of various genres]].

After his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' (1996) and the [[extended play]] ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997), Eminem signed with [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]''. His next two releases ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Eminem Show]]'' (2002) were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. After the release of his next album, ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'' (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005 partly due to a [[prescription drug]] [[addiction]].<ref name="nNNSM" /> He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'' (2009), and ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' was released the following year. ''Recovery'' was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after ''The Eminem Show'' in 2002, to be the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|best-selling album of the year worldwide]]. In the following years, he released the US number one albums ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'', ''[[Revival (Eminem album)|Revival]]'', ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]'' and ''[[Music to Be Murdered By]]''.

Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the [[musical drama film]] ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track "[[Lose Yourself]]" from its soundtrack won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], making him the first hip hop artist to ever win the award.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> He has made [[cameo appearance]]s in the films ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'' (2001), ''[[Funny People]]'' (2009), and ''[[The Interview]]'' (2014), and the television series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' (2010). Eminem has developed other ventures, including [[Shady Records]], with manager [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]], which helped launch the careers of artists such as [[50 Cent]], [[Yelawolf]] and [[Obie Trice]], among others. He has also established his own channel, [[Shade 45]], on [[Sirius XM Holdings|Sirius XM Radio]]. In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group [[D12]]. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper [[Royce da 5'9"]]; the two are collectively known as [[Bad Meets Evil]].

Eminem is among the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with estimated worldwide sales of more than 220 million records. He was the [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|best-selling music artist in the United States]] of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall.  ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named him the "Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)". ''The Marshall Mathers LP'', ''The Eminem Show'', "Lose Yourself", "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" and "[[Not Afraid]]" have all been certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name=":7" /> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' included him in its lists of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]] and the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]. He has won numerous awards, including 15 [[Grammy Award]]s, eight [[American Music Awards]], 17 [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and an [[MTV Europe Music Award for Global Icon|MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award]].
He has had ten number one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart making him the only artist to achieve this,<ref name="CcoQ7" /> and five number-one singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=":1" />

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972<ref name="allmusicbio" /> in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae "Debbie" ([[née]] Nelson).<ref name="qXFlU" /><ref name="yiWux" /><ref name="MySonMarshall" /> He is of English, Scottish, German, [[German-speaking Switzerland|German Swiss]], Polish, and Luxembourgian ancestry.<ref name="TtJq4" /><ref name="qcv9k" /> His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him.<ref name="SL00" /> Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in [[Ramada]] Inns along the [[The Dakotas|Dakotas]]{{ndash}}[[Montana]] border before their separation. Eminem's father, referred to by his middle name Bruce, left the family, moving to California<ref name="RS99" /> after having two other children: Michael and Sarah.<ref name="EminemSister" /> Debbie later had a son named Nathan "Nate" Kane Samara.<ref name="MySonMarshall" /> During his childhood, Eminem and Debbie shuttled between [[Michigan]] and [[Missouri]], rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, [[Savannah, Missouri|Savannah]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].<ref name="gAA4h" /><ref name="O9IJK" />

[[File:Eight Mile Road.jpg|left|thumb|Eminem lived on [[8 Mile Road]] in Detroit]]
As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father, which Debbie stated all came back marked "return to sender".<ref name="RS99" /> Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but "a bit of a loner"
{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} who was often bullied. One bully, D'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head in an assault;<ref name="P6SvX" /> Debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year because the Macomb County, Michigan judge said the schools were immune from lawsuits.<ref name="SL00" /> Eminem spent much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, [[Detroit]] neighborhood.<ref name="RS99" /> He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times.<ref name="RS99" /> As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a [[Comic book|comic-book]] artist before discovering [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name="Noshame?" /> Eminem heard his first rap song ("Reckless", featuring [[Ice-T]]) on the ''[[Breakin']]'' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkingharn, who was close to him and later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkingharn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.<ref name="RS99" /><ref name="8Nr1c" />

In Eminem's song "[[Cleanin' Out My Closet]]", he states his mother suffers from [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]]; making him believe he was sick when he wasn't his whole life. And in his song "[[My Mom (Eminem song)|My Mom]]", he says his mother had a valium addiction, and would sprinkle valium on his food when he was a kid — “The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate, she sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak” — to keep him under control. He also claims this is how he became addicted to valium.<ref name="3Q7jj" />

Eminem's home life was seldom stable; he frequently fought with his mother, whom a [[social work]]er described as having a "very suspicious, almost [[Paranoia|paranoid]] personality". When her son became famous, Debbie was unimpressed by suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott.<ref name="SL00" /> After spending three years in ninth grade due to [[truancy]] and poor grades,<ref name="Britannica" /> he dropped out of [[Lincoln High School (Warren, Michigan)|Lincoln High School]] at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies.<ref name="RS10" /> Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway, often after taking most of his paycheck. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.<ref name="RS99" />

At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names "Manix" and "M&M", the latter of which stood for his initials and evolved into "Eminem".<ref name="allmusicbio" /><ref name="SL00" /> Eminem sneaked into neighboring [[Osborn High School]] with friend and fellow rapper [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] for lunchroom [[freestyle rap|freestyle rap battles]].<ref name="cASTT" /> On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered "ground zero" for the Detroit rap scene.<ref name="RS99" /> Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by [[underground hip hop]] audiences.<ref name="allmusicbio" /><ref name="Fox News" /><ref name="60 mins Eminem" /> When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable.<ref name="RS10" /> Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.<ref name="RS10" />

===1988–1997: Early career, ''Infinite'' and family struggles===
[[File:Proof-eminem.jpg|thumb|right|Eminem and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] performing in 1999]]In 1988, he went by the stage name MC Double M and formed his first group New Jacks with DJ Butter Fingers.<ref name="huffpost" /><ref name="foxnews" /><ref name="fiQsZ" /> In 1989, they later joined Bassmint Productions who later changed their name to Soul Intent in 1992 with rapper [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] and other childhood friends.<ref name="6O2UF" /> They released a self-titled EP in 1995 featuring Proof.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Eminem also made his first music video appearance in 1992 in a song titled, "Do-Da-Dippity", by [[Champtown]]. Later in 1996, Eminem and Proof teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen ([[D12]]), who released their first album ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' in 2001.<ref name="RS99" /> Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.<ref name="SL00" />

Eminem was soon signed to [[Jeff Bass|Jeff]] and Mark Bass's [[F.B.T. Productions]], and recorded his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' for their independent [[Web Entertainment]] label.<ref name="03qFC" /> The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996.<ref name="KjeF0" /> One lyrical subject of ''Infinite'' was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers [[Nas]], [[Esham]] and [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.<ref name="vNwOP" /> Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored ''Infinite'', and the feedback Eminem did receive ("Why don't you go into rock and roll?") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.<ref name="RS99" /> At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times.<ref name="RS99" /> Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]].<ref name="0dIxL" /> His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.<ref name="SL00" /> He was fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, "It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something."<ref name="RS99" /> After the release of ''Infinite'', his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time and lived in his mother's [[mobile home]] with Kim and Hailie.<ref name="SL00" />

===1997–1999: Introduction to Slim Shady, ''The Slim Shady LP'' and rise to success===
[[File:Eminem (cropped).jpg|thumb|Eminem in 1999|left|upright]]
Eminem attracted more attention when he developed '''Slim Shady''', a sadistic, violent [[alter ego]]. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape, and murder.<ref name="SL00" /> In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'', which was released that winter by [[Web Entertainment]].<ref name="RS99" /> The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability, and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.<ref name="allmusicbio" /> Hip-hop magazine ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' featured Eminem in its "Unsigned Hype" column in March 1998.<ref name="Bozza 81" />

After he was fired from his job and evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 [[Rap Olympics]], an annual, nationwide [[battle rap]] competition. He placed second, and an [[Interscope Records]] intern in attendance called Dean Geistlinger asked Eminem for a copy of the ''Slim Shady EP'', which was then sent to company CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]].<ref name="kBmoE" /> Iovine played the tape for record producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and founding member of hip-hop group [[N.W.A]]. Dre recalled, "In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'" He would later state on the fourth and last episode of ''[[The Defiant Ones (documentary)|The Defiant Ones]]'', "I was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?" expressing his shock towards Mathers' rapping talent. Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: "I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you."<ref name="RS99" /> Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A. as a teenager, and was nervous about working with him on an album: "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much...I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars let alone Dr. Dre."{{sfn|Bozza|2003|page=24}} He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.<ref name="Stubbs58" />

Eminem released ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums ([[RIAA certification|certified triple platinum]] by the end of the year),<ref name="rotn" /> he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]].<ref name="nZKUD" /><ref name="SRCjC" /> The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in "'97 Bonnie and Clyde" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, and in "[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. "Guilty Conscience" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs ("[[Forgot About Dre]]" and "What's the Difference" while also providing uncredited vocals on "The Watcher" from Dr. Dre's album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', "[[Bitch Please II]]" from ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', "Say What You Say" from ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', "[[Encore/Curtains Down]]" from ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', and "[[Old Time's Sake]]" and "[[Crack a Bottle]]" from ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]''), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]] albums.<ref name="HsPQP" /> ''The Slim Shady LP'' has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="riaa" />

===2000–2002: ''The Marshall Mathers LP'', lyrical conflicts and ''The Eminem Show''===
[[File:Eminem Up in Smoke Tour.png|thumb|upright|Eminem at the [[ARCO Arena]] for the [[Up in Smoke Tour]], June 2000]]
''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' was released in May 2000. It sold 1.76 million copies in its first week, breaking US records held by [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Doggystyle]]'' for fastest-selling hip hop album and [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' for fastest-selling solo album.<ref name="MMLP" /><ref name="criminal" /> The first single from the album, "[[The Real Slim Shady]]", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that [[Christina Aguilera]] had performed oral sex on [[Fred Durst]] and [[Carson Daly]]).<ref name="lGl09" /> In his second single, "[[The Way I Am (Eminem song)|The Way I Am]]", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top "[[My Name Is]]". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker [[Marilyn Manson]] in the music video for "My Name Is", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in "The Way I Am", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem.<ref name="sKiRF" /> In the third single, "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" (which samples [[Dido (singer)|Dido]]'s "[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring "'97 Bonnie & Clyde" from ''The Slim Shady LP'').<ref name="Fox News" /> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' called "Stan" the third-greatest rap song of all time,<ref name="NHuhD" /> and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey.<ref name="Y8TKU" /> The song has since been ranked 296th on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.<ref name="iMJfO" /> In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of ''The Source''.<ref name="Bozza 81" /> ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 21 million copies worldwide.<ref name="reverb.com" />

Eminem performed with [[Elton John]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]] ceremony in 2001,<ref name="Qm7gW" /> with the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics [[homophobia|homophobic]]) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem.<ref name="VBNY8" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the appearance on its end-of-decade "best-of" list: "It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of "Stan" that would have been memorable in any context."<ref name="zBIno" /> On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the [[Staples Center]] (the ceremony's venue).<ref name="eI3LR" /> In 2001 Eminem appeared in the [[Up in Smoke Tour]] with rappers Dr. Dre, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Xzibit]] and [[Ice Cube]]<ref name="up in smoke" /> and the [[Family Values Tour]] with [[Limp Bizkit]],<ref name="QVqAg" /> headlining the [[Anger Management Tour]] with [[Papa Roach]], [[Ludacris]] and [[Xzibit]].

''The Eminem Show'' was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week.<ref name="rotn" /> The album's single, "[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]", denigrates [[boy band]]s, [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Dick Cheney|Dick]] and [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Moby]] and others. ''The Eminem Show'', certified Diamond by the RIAA, examines the effects of Eminem's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] found ''The Eminem Show'' less inflammatory than ''The Marshall Mathers LP''.<ref name="eminem show" /> [[L. Brent Bozell III]], who had criticized ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' for [[misogyny|misogynistic]] lyrics, noted ''The Eminem Show''{{'}}s extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem "Eminef" for the prevalence of the word "[[motherfucker]]" on the album.<ref name="tasteless" /> ''The Eminem Show'' sold 27 million copies worldwide<ref name="reverb.com" /> and was the best-selling album of 2002.

===2003–2007: ''Encore'', more lyrical conflicts and musical hiatus===
[[File:EMINEM rapping Anger management tour 2003.jpg|left|thumb|Eminem on the Anger Management Tour, 2003]]
On December 8, 2003, the [[United States Secret Service]] said that it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States.<ref name=":4" /> The cause for concern was the lyrics of "We As Americans" ("Fuck money / I don't rap for [[Dead Presidents (song)|dead presidents]] / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]''.<ref name="encore amg" />

In 2003, Eminem, a lifelong fan of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]],<ref name="Loyalmtv" /> provided production work for three tracks on the ''[[Tupac: Resurrection (soundtrack)|Tupac Resurrection]]'' soundtrack<ref name="BBCloyal" /> He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac's ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' album.<ref name="BBCloyal" />

''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, "[[Just Lose It]]", which contained slurs directed toward [[Michael Jackson]]. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of "Just Lose It", Jackson phoned [[Steve Harvey]]'s radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, [[plastic surgery]], and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, "That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including [[Stevie Wonder]], who described it as "kicking a man while he's down" and "bullshit".<ref name="MJ" /> and Steve Harvey (who said, "Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back").<ref name="MJ" /> The video also parodied [[Pee-wee Herman]], [[MC Hammer]] and [[Madonna]] during her ''[[Blond Ambition World Tour|Blond Ambition]]'' period.<ref name="03GFQ" /> [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who parodied the Eminem song "[[Lose Yourself]]" on "Couch Potato" for his 2003 album ''[[Poodle Hat]]'', told the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' about Jackson's protest: "Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me."<ref name="losing it" /> Although [[BET|Black Entertainment Television]] stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. ''The Source'', through CEO [[Benzino|Raymond "Benzino" Scott]], called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson.<ref name="rZyeh" /> In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought [[Famous Music]] from [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]], giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, [[Shakira]], [[Beck]] and others.<ref name="2007 music deal"/> Despite its lead single's humorous theme, ''Encore'' explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song "[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]", which criticized President [[George W. Bush]] as "This [[weapon of mass destruction]] that we call our president", with lyrics including "Fuck Bush".<ref name="0eGuR" /> On October 25, 2004, a week before the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 US Presidential election]], Eminem released the video for "Mosh" on the Internet.<ref name="eHpvi" /> In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper [[Lloyd Banks]]) of [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-administration]] victims and leads them to the [[White House]]. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with "VOTE Tuesday November 2". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the [[White House]] during a speech by the president.<ref name="BqoHZ" /> Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, [[Shade 45 (Eminem)|Shade 45]], on Sirius radio,<ref name="OT3Ir" /> which was described by his manager as "essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing."<ref name="ytzRr" />

[[File:Eminem at Voodoo 2000.jpg|thumb|Proof's (left) death in 2006 was one of the factors that caused Eminem to fall into [[Depression (mood)|depression]] during his five-year hiatus.<ref name="LSYra" />]]
Meanwhile, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering retirement, while rumors circulated that a [[double album]] titled ''The Funeral'' would be released.<ref name="lbsXR" /> In July, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} A greatest hits album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'', was released on December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment,<ref name="777P9" /> and sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US in its first week, marking Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the ''Billboard'' Hot 200,<ref name="EIfu5" /> and was certified double platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name="RIAA-CC" /> However, Eminem suggested that month on [[WKQI]]'s "Mojo in the Morning" show that he would be taking a break as an artist: "I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call' because this could be the final thing. We don't know."<ref name="4Wlto" /> Eminem was ranked 58th in [[Bernard Goldberg]]'s 2005 book ''[[100 People Who Are Screwing Up America]]''.<ref name="R7Bau" /> Goldberg cited a 2001 column by [[Bob Herbert]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which Herbert wrote, "In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them",<ref name="Lt5T5" /> and cited the song "No One's Iller" from the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' as an example of Eminem's [[misogyny]].<ref name="m51J2" />

Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: "Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff."<ref name="LZOGT" /> Interscope confirmed that a new album<ref name="PdgyD" /> would be released in spring 2009.<ref name="D4edI" /> In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'': "Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man. Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on 'Relapse'. We are up to our old mischievous ways&nbsp;... let's just leave it at that."<ref name="ujyft" />

According to a March 5, 2009 press release, Eminem would release two new albums that year.

He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, Eminem said that the stunt had been staged.<ref name="K3jlv" /> On October 30 he headlined at the [[Voodoo Experience]] in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year.<ref name="2s10p" /> Eminem's act included several songs from ''Relapse'', many of his older hits and an appearance by D12.

The album was a re-release of ''Relapse'' with seven bonus tracks, including "[[Forever (Drake song)|Forever]]" and "Taking My Ball". Eminem described the CD:
<blockquote>I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned&nbsp;... Hopefully, these tracks on ''The Refill'' will tide the fans over until we put out ''Relapse 2'' next year&nbsp;... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on ''Relapse 2'', but I still want the other stuff to be heard.<ref name="kjRQ1" /></blockquote>

<blockquote>I had originally planned for ''Relapse 2'' to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to ''Relapse'' started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album.

Eminem has cited several MCs as influencing his rapping style, including [[Esham]],<ref name="Dqu6b" /> [[Kool G Rap]],{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=88}} [[Masta Ace]], [[Big Daddy Kane]],{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=88}} [[Newcleus]], [[Ice-T]], [[Mantronix]], [[Melle Mel]] (on "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]"), [[LL Cool J]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Rakim]] and [[Boogie Down Productions]].<ref name="Eminem 2008, p. 20" />
In ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Guerilla Black]] notes that Eminem studied other MCs to hone his rapping technique: "Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats".{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=x}} In the book, other MCs also praise aspects of his rapping technique; varied, humorous subject matter,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|pages=5, 38}} connecting with his audience,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=7}} carrying a concept over a series of albums,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=34}} complex rhyme schemes,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|pages=66, 107}} bending words so they [[rhyme]],{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=85}} [[multisyllabic rhymes]],{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=88}} many rhymes to a bar,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=106}} complex rhythms,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|pages=120, 129}} clear [[Elocution|enunciation]]{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=244}} and the use of [[melody]]{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=253}} and [[syncopation]].{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=257}} Eminem is known to write most of his lyrics on paper (documented in ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]''), taking several days or a week to craft lyrics,{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=160}} being a "[[workaholic]]"{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=212}} and "[[Double tracking|stacking]]" vocals.{{sfn|Edwards|2009|page=282}} Examples of hip hop subgenres that Eminem's music has been described as include [[horrorcore]],{{sfn|Cohen|2007|p=52}}{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=80}}<ref name="1vdry" /> [[comedy hip hop]],<ref name="SKBN9" /> and [[hardcore hip hop]].<ref name="4N9m2" /><ref name="XsniV" /> Eminem also incorporates [[rap rock]] into his music and has cited [[Rock music|rock]] acts during the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Led Zeppelin]], as influences in his music.<ref name="dsCOh" /><ref name="sOLKZ" /><ref name="ZSLf1" /><ref name="gASPA" />

===Alter egos===
Eminem uses alter egos in his songs for different rapping styles and subject matter. His best-known alter ego, Slim Shady, first appeared on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' and was in ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'', ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'', and ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]''. In this persona, his songs are violent and dark, with a comic twist.<ref name="SbDzi" /> Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' because he felt it did not fit the album's theme.<ref name="sg3En" /> Another character is Ken Kaniff, a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the ''Slim Shady LP'', where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem. An argument after the album's release prompted Eminem to use the Kaniff character on ''Marshall Mathers'' and later albums (except ''Encore'' and ''Recovery''). Aristotle, angry with Eminem's use of his character, released a mixtape in his Kaniff persona ridiculing him.<ref name="rmBpM" />

==={{anchor|Featurings and productions}}Collaborations and productions===
{{see also|Eminem production discography|Eminem discography#Guest appearances}}
Although Eminem usually collaborates with Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records rappers such as Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Obie Trice and Yelawolf, he has also worked with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Kid Rock]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], Lil Wayne, [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jay Z]], [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]], Rihanna, [[Nicki Minaj]], Xzibit, [[Method Man]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Sticky Fingaz]], [[T.I.]] and [[Young Jeezy]]. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of [[Busta Rhymes]]' "[[Touch It (Busta Rhymes song)|Touch It]]" remix at the June 27, 2006 BET Music Awards. He appeared on [[Akon]]'s single "[[Smack That]]" from ''[[Konvicted]]'', Lil Wayne's hit "[[Drop the World]]", and "[[My Life (50 Cent song)|My Life]]" (the lead single from 50 Cent's ''Street King Immortal'').

Eminem was the executive producer of D12's first two albums (''Devil's Night'' and ''D12 World''), Obie Trice's ''[[Cheers (Obie Trice album)|Cheers]]'' and ''[[Second Round's on Me]]'' and 50 Cent's ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' and ''[[The Massacre]]''.<ref name="Pxs9E" /> He has produced songs for other rappers, such as [[Jadakiss]]' "Welcome To D-Block", Jay-Z's "[[Renegade (Jay-Z song)|Renegade]]" and "Moment of Clarity", [[Lloyd Banks]]' "[[On Fire (Lloyd Banks song)|On Fire]]", "Warrior Part 2" and "[[Hands Up (Lloyd Banks song)|Hands Up]]", [[Tony Yayo]]'s "Drama Setter", Trick-Trick's "[[Welcome 2 Detroit (song)|Welcome 2 Detroit]]", and Xzibit's "My Name" and "Don't Approach Me".<ref name="inijS" /> Most of ''The Eminem Show'' was produced by Eminem and his longtime collaborator, [[Bass Brothers|Jeff Bass]],<ref name="ANpku" /> and Eminem co-produced ''Encore'' with Dr. Dre. In 2004 Eminem was co-executive producer of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac's]] posthumous album ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' with Shakur's mother, [[Afeni Shakur|Afeni]].<ref name="DoEda" /> He produced the UK number-one single "[[Ghetto Gospel]]", featuring Elton John,<ref name="rqLNe" /> "The Cross" from the [[Nas]] album ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]''<ref name="pKxOc" /> and eight tracks on Obie Trice's 2006 ''[[Second Round's on Me]]'' (also appearing on "There They Go").<ref name="kaWOK" /> Eminem produced several tracks on Trick-Trick's ''[[The Villain (album)|The Villain]]'' (appearing on "Who Want It"),<ref name="RpBN6" /> and produced four tracks on Cashis' 2013 album ''[[The County Hound 2]]''.

Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics, rather than writing to beats.<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> One exception was "Stan", which came from an idea and [[Studio recording#The process|scratch track]] produced by [[the 45 King]].<ref name="hitquarters.com" /> After doing little production on ''Relapse'' and ''Recovery'', Eminem produced a significant portion of ''The Marshall Mathers LP 2''. He said about producing his own music, "Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made. They don't know what's in my head. I think maybe it helps, a little bit, with diversity, the sound of it, but also, I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch."<ref name="MbLsN" />

==={{anchor|Comparisons to other artists}}Comparisons with other artists===
As a white performer prominent in a genre influenced by black artists, Eminem has been compared, much to his chagrin,<ref name="pIsBX" /> to [[Elvis Presley]],<ref name="vsQAB" /> and as a lyricist and as aforementioned to [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="jM2Sv" /> Rapper [[Asher Roth]] has been compared to Eminem, and Roth devoted a song on his album ("As I Em") to him, which he took offense to.<ref name="W7iva" /><ref name="GMtwN" /><ref name="7ICdR" /> The accomplished trumpeter [[Nicholas Payton]] has called Eminem "the [[Bix Beiderbecke]] of hip hop".

Eminem and [[Christian hip hop]] artist [[KJ-52]] have been compared to each other, with KJ-52 called his "Christian counterpart".<ref name="q2LES" /> KJ-52's single, "Dear Slim", was controversial with Eminem fans when it appeared on ''[[Total Request Live]]''. Although he said the song was not intended to be disrespectful,<ref name="KJInterview" /> KJ-52 received [[hate mail]] and the song was number 26 on [[VH1]]'s Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop list.<ref name="VH1 Top 40 Worst Moments in Hip Hop" />

==Personal life==
===Family===
Eminem has been scrutinized, both as a rapper and personally.<ref name="criminal" /> He was married twice to Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott. He met Kim in high school while he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping [[LL Cool J]]'s "[[I'm Bad]]".<ref name="ooklj" /> Kim and her twin sister Dawn had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989.

Eminem and Kim's daughter Hailie was born on December 25, 1995. The two were married in 1999 and divorced in 2001. Although Eminem told ''Rolling Stone'' in 2002, "I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again," he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April,<ref name="hYghZ" /> agreeing to joint custody of Hailie.<ref name="aNJ7u" />

Eminem also has custody of Alaina, his sister-in-law Dawn's daughter,<ref name="EHsuO" /> and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.<ref name="B62oc" /><ref name="xeGFz" />

In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.<ref name="PefrM" /> He had legal custody of his younger half-brother Nathan.<ref name="5QpCv" />

In his 2013 song "[[Headlights (Eminem song)|Headlights]]", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.<ref name="SA5xe" />

==={{anchor|Drug issues}}Health issues===
Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Zolpidem|Ambien]], and [[Diazepam|Valium]].<ref name="nSuFe" /> According to friend and fellow D12 member [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], Eminem first straightened out in 2002.<ref name="iEBkE" /> During the production of ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which "knocked [him] out", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on ''Encore'', he would "just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills". Eminem began taking the drugs to "feel normal", taking a "ridiculous amount&nbsp;[...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to {{convert|230|lb|kg}}, and he was regularly eating fast food: "The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: "Eminem ain't fat."<ref name="RS10" />

====2007 overdose====
In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a [[methadone]] overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was "just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of [[heroin]] and was "about two hours from dying". After missing Christmas with his children,<!-- What other children? So far, we've just read about Hailie. --> Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully [[Detoxification|detoxed]]. He tore the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a [[seizure]]. His drug use "ramped right back to where it was before" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running. [[Elton John]] was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.<ref name="RS10" /> Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.<ref name="wjwUm" />

===2020 house invasion===
On April 5, 2020, Matthew Hughes broke into Eminem's house, reportedly breaking a kitchen window with a paving stone. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and he said that he was there to kill him. Hughes was on a $50,000 cash bond and was charged with first-degree home invasion and malicious destruction of property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2020/09/09/eminem-home-invasion-kill-matthew-david-hughes/3333513001/|title=Home invader told Eminem he was there to kill him, officer testifies|first=Brian|last=McCollum|website=Detroit Free Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/eminem-home-break-in-death-threat/|title=Man Who Broke Into Eminem's Home Threatened to Kill Him, Testimony Alleges|website=XXL Mag}}</ref>

==Controversies==
==={{anchor|Homophobia controversy}}Allegations of homophobia===
Some of Eminem's lyrics have been considered [[Homophobia|homophobic]], and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country.<ref name="OtkaY" /> Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as "faggot" and "queer" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 2010 ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] explored the issue:<ref name="nbe8L" />
:''Cooper'': Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song "Criminal" you say "My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress—hate fags? The answer's 'yes{{'"}}.
:''Eminem'': Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, "faggot" was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.
:''Cooper'': Do you not like gay people?
:''Eminem'': No, I don't have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I'm just like whatever.

When ''The New York Times'' asked him about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan in 2010, Eminem replied: "I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want",<ref name="3Ly5s" /> adding that his "overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be".<ref name="QuestionsforEm" />

Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics in "Rap God" (2013) and explained "I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words...(to actually mean homosexual)"<ref name="RqakW" />

In 2018, musicians criticized Eminem's use of the slur "[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]" to describe rapper [[Tyler, the Creator]] on the song "Fall", including [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] of [[Imagine Dragons]], calling the rapper's language "hateful",<ref name="dAnoc" /> and [[Troye Sivan]];<ref name="ViIYc" /> additionally, guest vocalist Justin Vernon distanced himself from the collaboration due to the message.<ref name="JmMvv" />

==={{anchor|Legal troubles}}Legal issues===
In 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for $10&nbsp;million claiming he was slandering her on ''The Slim Shady LP''. Litigation concluded in 2001 resulting in an award of $1,600 for her damages.<ref name="s8R9U" /> On June 3, 2000, Eminem was arrested during an altercation with Douglas Dail at a car-audio store in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], when he pulled out an unloaded gun and pointed it at the ground. The next day, in [[Warren, Michigan]], he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerra in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw him kissing his wife.<ref name="AOZ" /><ref name="personal life" /> Eminem recreated the Guerra assault in "The Kiss (Skit)" on ''[[The Eminem Show]]''. He pleaded guilty to possession of a concealed weapon and assault, and received two years' [[probation]]; however, Guerra's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.<ref name="DcHpv" /> On July 7, 2000, Kim attempted suicide by slashing her wrists,<ref name="g8w2C" /> and later sued Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in "[[Kim (song)|Kim]]".<ref name="personal life" />

Sanitation worker DeAngelo Bailey sued Eminem for $1 million in 2001, accusing him of invading his privacy by publicizing information placing him in a false light in "Brain Damage", a song which portrays him as a violent school bully. Although Bailey admitted picking on Eminem in school, he said he merely "bumped" him and gave him a "little shove".{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} The lawsuit was dismissed on October 20, 2003; Judge [[Deborah Servitto]], who wrote a portion of her opinion in rap-like rhyming verse, ruled that it was clear to the public that the lyrics were exaggerated.<ref name="Mh2kv" />

On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year's probation and community service and was fined about $2,000 on weapon charges stemming from an argument with an employee of [[Psychopathic Records]].<ref name="z1Qzb" />

On March 31, 2002, French [[jazz]] pianist [[Jacques Loussier]] filed a $10&nbsp;million lawsuit against Eminem and Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for "Kill You" was taken from his instrumental "Pulsion". Loussier demanded that sales of ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' be halted, and any remaining copies destroyed.<ref name="4zRBl" /> The case was later settled out of court.<ref name="EEMQ1" />

In 2006, Eminem was accused of assaulting Miad Jarbou, a resident of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], in the bathroom of a Detroit strip club, but was never charged. Two years later in 2008, Jarbou sued Eminem for more than $25,000 in damages.<ref name="q0Zuk" />

In 2007, Eminem's music-publishing company (Eight Mile Style) and Martin Affiliated sued [[Apple Inc.]] and Aftermath Entertainment, claiming that Aftermath was not authorized to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's [[iTunes]].<ref name="apple2" /><ref name="ky9yA" /> The case against Apple was settled shortly after the trial began, in late September 2009.<ref name="hBFMT" />

In July 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled in ''[[F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records]]'' that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50 percent of Aftermath's net revenue from licensing his recordings to companies such as Apple, [[Sprint Corporation]], [[Nextel Communications]], [[AT&T Mobility|Cingular]] and [[T-Mobile]]. In March 2011, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to hear the case.<ref name="scotus_appeal" />

In October 2013, Eminem [[sampling (music)|sampled]] Chicago-based rap group [[Hotstylz]]'s 2008 viral hit, "Lookin' Boy", for his 2013 hit single "[[Rap God]]". The group claims that Eminem did not receive permission to use the sample, nor did he credit or compensate them.<ref name="MshrO" /> In November 2013, Hotstylz released a [[diss track]] towards Eminem titled "Rap Fraud", where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them.<ref name="Fs0BI" /><ref name="9jpSe" /> In January 2015, [[TMZ]] reported that Hotstylz was suing Eminem and his label, [[Shady Records]], for $8 million, for using the 25 second sample of "Lookin' Boy" on his song "Rap God", without their permission.<ref name="0MKBa" /><ref name="rQ0JG" />

===United States Secret Service===
On December 8, 2003, the [[United States Secret Service]] reported that it was "looking into" allegations that Eminem threatened U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]<ref name=":4" /> in "We As Americans" (an unreleased [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] at the time), with the lyrics: "Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents." The incident was included in the video for "[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]", as a newspaper clipping on a wall with articles about unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. "We As Americans" eventually appeared on ''Encore''{{'}}s deluxe-edition bonus disc, with altered lyrics.

In 2018–2019, the Secret Service interviewed Eminem again regarding threatening lyrics towards President [[Donald Trump]] and daughter [[Ivanka Trump|Ivanka]].<ref name=":5" />

===Other===
On October 26, 2000, Eminem was scheduled to perform at Toronto's [[SkyDome]] when [[Ontario]] Attorney General [[Jim Flaherty]] said that Eminem should not be allowed to enter the country. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women," he said. Flaherty also said that he was "disgusted" when he read the lyrics of "Kill You", which includes the lines "Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a [[freedom of speech|free-speech]] issue,{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] Michael Bryant suggested that [[hate crime]] charges should be brought against Eminem for advocating violence against women in his lyrics.<ref name="B" /> Robert Everett-Green wrote in a ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'' editorial, "Being offensive is Eminem's job description".<ref name="A" /> Eminem's Toronto concert went on as planned.<ref name="D" />

On November 2, 2020, one day before the [[2020 United States presidential election|US election]], Eminem endorsed [[Joe Biden]] for President.<ref>{{cite web |title=One Opportunity {{!}} Joe Biden For President 2020 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p3iMZBzW7M |access-date=3 November 2020}}</ref>

| quote = Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history, easily the biggest crossover success ever seen in rap. To call him hip-hop's [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is correct to a degree, but it's largely inaccurate.

}}Credited for popularizing hip hop to a Middle American audience, Eminem's unprecedented global commercial success and acclaimed works for a white rapper is widely recognized for breaking racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in [[popular music]].<ref name="EGXm7" /> Rising from [[rags to riches]], Eminem's anger fuelled music represented widespread angst and the reality of American [[underclass]].<ref name="lpa2O" /> With African Americans and Hispanic and Latino Americans developing the hip hop art form, Eminem's undisputed regard as one of the greatest rappers of all time<ref name="billboard-best-rappers" /><ref name="44fQ7" /><ref name="6egga" /> and his prominence in a form of [[black music]] has led to him being regarded as an important figure of 21st century popular music.<ref name="87qGk" /> He has been greatly [[List of artists influenced by Eminem|influential for artists of various genres]].

Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American themed television network [[BET]] (Black Entertainment Television), said in 2002,<blockquote><nowiki>''</nowiki>Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] black folks had to be better than average, had to be the best, to be accepted [...] he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best lyricist, alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.<nowiki>''</nowiki><ref name="UjWGs" /></blockquote>In 2002, the [[BBC]] said that the perception of Eminem as a "modern-day [[William Shakespeare]]" was comparable to the reception of American singer [[Bob Dylan]]: "Not since Bob Dylan's heyday in the mid-1960s has an artist's output been subjected to such intense academic scrutiny as an exercise in contemporary soul-searching. US critics point to [Eminem's] vivid portraits of disenfranchised lives – using the stark, direct language of the street – as an accurate reflection of social injustice." In addition, the BBC highlighted that, "Where parents once recoiled in horror [to his music], there now seems a greater willingness to acknowledge a music that is striking such a chord among the American young, angry white underclass."<ref name="B2VVJ" /> Dan Ozzi of [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] highlighted that Eminem during the early 2000s was "the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  [...] he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] for a dial-up modem generation."<ref name="VhYMF" />

Writing for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 2002, rock critic [[Alan Light]] compared Eminem to [[the Beatles]]' [[John Lennon]]: "Eminem is even starting to bear a resemblance to one of those rock icons [...] Marshall Mathers is becoming something like this generation’s John Lennon [...] Lennon and Eminem were both subjects of pickets and protests; they both wrote songs about troubled relationships with their mothers; they both wrote about their strange public lives with their wives; they both wrote about how much they loved their kids. Lennon, of course, was able to find ways to use his voice to advocate for peace rather than just blasting away at litigious family members and various pop stars, but still, few other pop musicians since Lennon have found a way to render their private psychodramas into compelling art as effectively as Eminem."<ref name="daOy3" />

Regarding his rehearsal with Eminem for the "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" duet at the [[2001 Grammy Awards]], English singer [[Elton John]] said, "[When] Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[James Brown]] and [[Aretha Franklin]]. Eminem was that good. I just thought, "Fuck, this man is amazing." There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats."<ref name=":10" /> John further praised Eminem, saying, "Eminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what [Bob] Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out."<ref name=":10" />[[File:Eminem Shanghai graffit.jpg|thumb|alt=Large graffiti picture of a serious-looking Eminem|Eminem graffiti in Shanghai, China|270x270px|left]]Concerning the controversy surrounding Eminem due to his [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] music, American entertainer [[Madonna]] had said, "I like the fact that Eminem is brash and angry and politically incorrect [...] He's stirring things up, he's provoking a discussion, he's making people's blood boil. He's reflecting what's going on in society right now. That is what art is supposed to do."<ref name=":11" /> American musician [[Stevie Wonder]] also said, "Rap to me is a modern [[blues]] — a statement of how and where people are at [...] I think art is a reflection of our society, and people don't like to confront the realities in society [...] But until we really confront the truth, we are going to have a [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]] or Eminem or [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]] to remind us about it — and thank God. They force people to look at realities in society."<ref name=":11" />

Eminem has been credited with boosting the careers of hip hop proteges such as [[50 Cent]], [[Yelawolf]], [[Stat Quo]], [[Royce da 5'9"]], [[Cashis]], [[Obie Trice]], [[Bobby Creekwater]], [[Boogie (rapper)|Boogie]], and hip hop groups such as [[D12]] and [[Slaughterhouse (hip hop group)|Slaughterhouse]]. A number of artists have cited Eminem as an influence, including [[The Weeknd]],<ref name="eqNYw" /><ref name="oE44x" /><ref name="6F21H" /> [[Logic (rapper)|Logic]],<ref name="nTv09" /> [[Joyner Lucas]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[50 Cent]],<ref name="i7ob8" /> [[Kendrick Lamar]],<ref name="O6Pnb" /> [[Ed Sheeran]],<ref name="lnkbQ" /><ref name="PNZVE" /> [[J.

==Other ventures==
===Shady Records===
{{Main|Shady Records}}
{{See also|Bad Meets Evil |Soul Intent (group)|label 2=Soul Intent|selfref=yes}}

Following Eminem's multiplatinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper [[Obie Trice]] to the label and signed [[50 Cent]] in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added [[Atlanta]] rapper [[Stat Quo]] to the Shady-Aftermath roster. [[DJ Green Lantern]], Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-[[Jadakiss]] feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper [[Cashis]] to Shady Records.<ref name="Britannica" />

On December 5, 2006, the compilation album ''[[Eminem Presents: The Re-Up]]'' was released on Shady Records. The project began as a [[mixtape]], but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. ''The Re-Up'' was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.<ref name="xpCCY" /> While he was recording ''Infinite'', Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for "Detroit Twelve" or "Dirty Dozen", who performed in a style similar to [[Wu-Tang Clan]].<ref name="ex6gm" /> In 2001 D12's debut album, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'', was released.<ref name="d12 all music" /> The first single from the album was "[[Shit on You]]", followed by "[[Purple Pills]]" (an ode to [[recreational drug use]]) and "[[Fight Music]]". "Purple Pills" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed "Purple Hills".

After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, ''[[D12 World]]'', which included the hit singles "[[My Band]]" and "[[How Come]]". "American Psycho 2" featuring [[Cypress Hill]] member, [[B-Real]], was another popular hit.<ref name="d12 all music" /> According to D12 member [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]], Eminem was not featured on his album ''[[Blue Cheese & Coney Island]]'' because "he's busy doing his thing".<ref name="oExGn" />

In January 2014, [[Bass Brothers]] announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.<ref name="6dyFL" />

===Acting career===
After small roles in the 2001 film ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'' and as an extra in the 1998 [[Korn]] music video for "[[Got the Life]]" (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the semi-autobiographical 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including "[[Lose Yourself]]" (which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 [[hip hop music|hip hop]] single in history).<ref name="Rj2Zo" /> Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]] accepted the award.<ref name="WrFnB" />

Eminem voiced an aging, corrupt, [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics-speaking]] police officer in the video game ''[[50 Cent: Bulletproof]]'' and guested on the [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' and a Web cartoon, ''The Slim Shady Show''<ref name="seFkK" /> He was signed to star in an unmade film version of ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'',<ref name="8v8or" /> and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name="k8qwJ" /> Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with [[Ray Romano]], in the 2009 film ''[[Funny People]]''. In a 2010 interview with [[Jonathan Ross]], he stated "You know, I love music so much. This is my passion, this is what I want to do. Not saying that I won't do a movie ever again, but this is me."<ref>{{cite web |title=(HQ) Eminem on Jonathan Ross 2010.06.04 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBCzDAkvA0g |access-date=5 November 2020}}</ref>

He played himself in the ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'' season-seven finale "[[Lose Yourself (Entourage)|Lose Yourself]]" with Christina Aguilera.<ref name="zzH1W" /> Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'', he turned it down because director [[Neill Blomkamp]] would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.<ref name="KthKm" /> Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film ''[[The Interview]]''. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark ([[James Franco]]), Eminem satirically [[Coming out|comes out]] as homosexual.<ref name="The Interview cameo" />

===Books and memoirs===
On November 21, 2000, Eminem published ''[[Angry Blonde]]'', a non-fiction book featuring commentary of several of his own songs, along with several previously unpublished photographs. On October 21, 2008 his autobiography ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]'' was published. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak, and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from "Stan" and "The Real Slim Shady".<ref name="OoNG7" /> An autobiography of Eminem's mother (''[[My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem]]'') was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.

===Advertising and charity===
Eminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during [[Super Bowl XLV]]. In the first, a one-minute spot for [[Lipton]]'s [[Brisk (beverage)|Brisk]] iced tea, he is a [[clay animation|claymation]] figure.<ref name="XjhPw" /> In the second, [[Born of Fire|a two-minute ad]] – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the [[Chrysler 200]], Eminem drives through Detroit (with "Lose Yourself" as the soundtrack) to his show at the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]].<ref name="sLbdY" /><ref name="6ug46" />

He established the Marshall Mathers Foundation to aid disadvantaged youth. The foundation works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a Detroit attorney.<ref name="OxH9W" />

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020, Eminem donated "mom's spaghetti" (a reference to a line from his song "Lose Yourself") to healthcare workers at [[Henry Ford Health System]] in Detroit.<ref name="VWpm4" /> Additionally, he donated a pair of [[Air Jordan|Jordan]] 4 Retro Eminem Carhartt shoes, which are rare, to be raffled off with proceeds going to COVID-19 relief.<ref name="snDx9" />

=== Royalty Flow ===
In September 2017, a company called Royalty Flow (a subsidiary of [[Royalty Exchange]]), filed to issue an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] under [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|SEC]] Regulation A+ to raise money with the intent of purchasing either 15% or 25% of Eminem's former production team's ([[Bass Brothers|The Bass Brothers]], aka FBT Productions) share of his sound-recording royalties.<ref name="sdcLl" /><ref name="m5gd0" /><ref name="3mqN0" /><ref name="Ve6oM" />

=== Politics ===
Eminem has expressed his political views in multiple songs. The first was "[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the [[2004 United States presidential election]], and heavily criticized then president [[George W. Bush]]. However, he did not directly endorse [[John Kerry]] in the song, either.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rock History 101: Eminem's "Mosh" |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/03/rock-history-101-eminems-mosh/ |website=ConsequencesOfSound.com}}</ref> He wouldn't express political views again until the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]] when he released ''[[Campaign Speech]]'', which criticized presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Eminem Shades Donald Trump in new song |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/10/20/eminem-shades-trump-is-new-song/ |website=WashingtonPost.com}}</ref> The following year, he again criticized Trump in a freestyle titled "The Storm". In the freestyle, he expressed support for former [[San Francisco 49ers]] quarterback [[Colin Kaepernick]] and the [[U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)|National Anthem protests]] and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eminem's 'The Storm' Freestyle Whips Up Social Media: LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick & Others React |url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/7997434/eminem-freestyle-social-media-reaction-lebron-james-colin-kaepernick |website=Billboard.com}}</ref> In his song "[[Darkness (Eminem song)|Darkness]]", he heavily references the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|2017 Las Vegas mass shooting]], and, at the end of the music video, he expresses his support for gun control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eminem's New 'Darkness' Music Video Is Darker Than It First Appears: Watch |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8548302/eminem-darkness-music-video/ |website=Billboard.com}}</ref> The week before the [[2020 United States presidential election]], he approved his song [[Lose Yourself|"Lose Yourself"]] to be used in a campaign video for [[Joe Biden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Eminem Lends ‘Lose Yourself’ to New Joe Biden Campaign Ad |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-lose-yourself-joe-biden-campaign-ad-1084887/ |website=RollingStone.com}}</ref>
