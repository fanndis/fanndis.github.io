'''ZDNet''' is a business technology [[news website]] owned and operated by [[Red Ventures]], along with [[TechRepublic]]. The brand was founded on April 1, 1991, as a general interest technology portal from [[Ziff Davis]] and evolved into an [[Enterprise software|enterprise IT]]-focused online publication.

==History==
===Beginnings: 1991 to 1995===

ZDNet began as a subscription-based digital service called "ZiffNet" that offered computing information to users of [[CompuServe]]. It featured computer industry forums, events, features and searchable archives.

Initially, ZiffNet was intended to serve as a common place to find content from all [[Ziff-Davis]] print publications. As such, ZiffNet was an expansion on an earlier online service called PCMagNet for readers of [[PC Magazine]]. Launched in 1988, [[PC Magazine|PCMagNet]] in turn was the evolution of Ziff Davis' first electronic publishing venture, a bulletin board, which launched in 1985.<ref name="Ziff-Davis">{{Cite web

On June 20, 1995, Ziff-Davis announced the consolidation of its online information services under a single name, ''ZD Net''. The service had grown its membership to 275,000 subscribers across six platforms: CompuServe, [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]], [[AT&T]] Interchange, [[MSN Dial-up|the Microsoft Network]], [[AppleLink]] and [[eWorld]].<ref name="thefreelibrary.com">{{Cite web

===Early history: 1995 to 2000===

By its fifth anniversary in 1996, the collective "ZD Net" brand—now on the Web, [[AOL|America Online]], Microsoft Network and Prodigy—counted 300,000 subscribers and was named the second-highest grossing advertising site on the web.<ref name="Ziff-Davis"/> The site also expanded overseas: initially to [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; later to [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Italy]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Malaysia]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Taiwan]] and [[India]].<ref>{{Cite web

On May 11, 1998, Ziff-Davis launched ZDTV as the first [[cable television]] channel and website to offer 24-hour programming about computing and the Internet.

By the end of 1998, ZDNet was the dominant technology brand online. It led its closest rival, [[CNET]], by a 26 percent margin and was the 13th most popular site on the Web, reaching 8.4 million users, or 13.4 percent of all users on the Web.<ref>{{Cite web

====ZDNet the company====

In 1999, Ziff-Davis spun ZDNet off as a separate company and offered it as a tracking stock, ZDZ, to accompany the parent stock, ZD. An initial public offering raised $190 million, but the tracking stock was eliminated in early 2000 and revived as common stock.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://ecommerce.hostip.info/pages/1117/Ziff-Davis-Inc-COMPUTER-TECHNICAL-PORTAL-ZDNET.html|title=Inc Ziff-Davis – Computer And Technical Portal, Zdnet}}</ref> The new company soon acquired Updates.com, a software upgrade service.

It also launched "Computer Stew," a web-based comedy show about technology that featured John Hargrave and Jay Stevens,<ref>{{Cite web

On December 30, 1999, ZDNet launched a $25 million branding campaign in response to a $100 million advertising campaign launched by rival CNET.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

ZDNet's lead over the competition narrowed by 2000. Despite a record 10.7 million unique users in January, it managed only a 13 percent lead over the next competitor.<ref>{{Cite web

====Realignment====

In 2003, CNET Networks redesigned and relaunched ZDNet as an enterprise-focused publication intended to help business executives make better technology decisions.

The entire site was realigned as part of a CNET Networks B2B portfolio that included CNET News.com, Builder.com and TechRepublic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/index.cfm?fa=Articles.showArticle&art_aid=16081|title=CNET Networks Re-launches ZDNet |accessdate=February 17, 2003}}</ref>

A "Tech Update" section was created to serve as a directory of proprietary IT research (dubbed "IT Priorities"), and a new "Power Center" was implemented to prominently feature webcasts, white papers and case studies from partners. ZDNet also offered eight enterprise-targeted newsletters, as well launched its first blogs.<ref>{{Cite web

In 2006, ZDNet experienced another redesign that reduced its editorial focus on traditional news articles and product reviews and emphasized a growing network of expert bloggers, now totaling more than 30. The blogs covered topics such as enterprise IT, open source, Web 2.0, Google, Apple and Microsoft, and featured journalists David Berlind, Mary Jo Foley and Larry Dignan.<ref>{{Cite web
