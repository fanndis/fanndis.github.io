"'''Fly'''" is a song by American rapper and singer [[Nicki Minaj]] from her debut studio album, ''[[Pink Friday]]'' (2010). The song was released as the eighth and final single from the album on August 30, 2011. It features additional guest vocals by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]]. The track was written by Kevin Hissink, Will Jordan, J.R. Rotem, Clemm Rishad and Minaj herself, while production was helped by Rotem and Hissink. The song is a R&B track which incorporates the hip hop genre. The song is inspired by the emotion of soaring above and overcoming all stereotypes and negativity, to come out victorious.

In the United States, "Fly" reached number 19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also peaked within the top twenty of the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, the song became Nicki Minaj's first number one on the [[UK R&B Chart]]. Furthermore, "Fly" marked top twenty positions on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs]] and [[Pop Songs]] charts and reached the top ten of the US [[Rap Songs]] chart at number nine.

The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Sanaa Hamri]], depicts Minaj and Rihanna experiencing the destruction in a post-apocalyptic environment.

==Background==
[[File:Rihanna, LOUD Tour, Florida 5-2.jpg|thumb|upright|155px|left|[[Rihanna]]'s contribution to the song was a last minute addition.]]
The song was produced by Hissink and [[J.R. Rotem]], who has additionally worked with [[Sean Kingston]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Jason Derülo]], and [[Iyaz]]. In an interview with [[MTV News]], Rotem discussed the track, stating that it almost did not make the cut for ''Pink Friday'' and was the last addition to the album after Minaj heard how inspirational it was. He stated, "Near the tail end of her project, I came into the studio and I had some tracks [for her]. That was one of the ones I was excited about. When I played it for her, she knew instantly: 'Yes, this is the record.' She connected with it immediately. I could just tell she was excited by it, which excited me." The demo version of the song featured a studio-vocalist that would have later been an uncredited vocalist on the track, however Minaj decided to ask Rihanna to do the track. Rotem reminisced on the moment, stating that he told Minaj "'That would be great, but getting Rihanna to do a hook for you is easier said than done.' I think that speaks to Nicki's star power. I said, 'Yeah, she's definitely first choice. It took time because she was promoting her own album and traveling overseas. It happened, and I heard it when Nicki gave me the record and it really was one of those incredible things that was really a blessing. It manifested. She said she wanted it and it happened."<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Jayson |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1653259/nicki-minaj-manifested-rihanna-fly-feature-jr-rotem.jhtml |title=Nicki Minaj 'Manifested' Rihanna For 'Fly' Feature, J.R. Rotem Says – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV News. MTV Networks |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>

During a ''Pink Friday Diaries'' session, Minaj talked more in depth about the song. "FLY is one of my absolute faves. I wanted to work with Rihanna for a long time. I'm very proud of her accomplishments ; especially since she was born on an island like me. This song is a female empowerment song. But then again, it's not specific to just women. It speaks about flying, soaring high in the face of every single solitary adversity that comes your way. I speak about how the media has attempted to box me in and how that has made me feel suffocated. After years of being dragged thru the mud, I've mustered up the courage to re-define myself. I believe that I represent an entire generation. My fans have become my family, and together we have become a movement. Get ready for it. We came to win."<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

==Critical reception==
Robbie Daw of ''Idolator'' gave the song a positive review, stating, "And here on the J.R. Rotem-produced “Fly,” she’s wearing the coat of the down-and-out-but-hopeful fighter striving to overcome her adversaries. Consider this an '[[I Believe I Can Fly]]' for the current generation. If there’s one thing Rihanna has proven, it’s that she’s the go-to chorus girl with a Midas touch. And if Eminem’s “Love The Way You Lie” and T.I.’s “Live Your Life” are any indicators, Nicki stands the chance of having her first #1 on the Hot 100 with “Fly”—provided, of course, it gets an official single release."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idolator.com/5691331/nicki-minaj-rihanna-fly-pink-friday |title=Nicki Minaj And Rihanna Soar On Inspirational New Song "Fly" &#124; Music News, Reviews, and Gossip on |publisher=Idolator.com |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref> Margaret Wappler of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' complimented the song's collaboration, stating, "Even though her roots are elsewhere, Minaj sounds better on the “Pink Friday” tracks that are more squarely in the club R&B vein, which she almost always spikes with enough rap to remind anyone that she isn’t another Beyonce or even Sasha Fierce, not by any stretch. “Fly” makes good work out of its Rihanna cameo — while the dark glamour bird soars, Minaj skitters around her with her vulnerable but choppy rhymes, equal parts tough woman and big softie."<ref name="pop & hiss">{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/11/album-review-nicki-minajs-pink-friday.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Pop & Hiss}}</ref>

Scott Plagenhoef of ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' complimented the song and how it made ''Pink Friday'' the record it is by stating, "but these tracks -- plus the Rihanna collaboration "Fly" and the solo ballad "Save Me"—are the best examples of what Pink Friday is rather than what many of us wanted it to be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/ |title=Album Reviews: Nicki Minaj: Pink Friday |work=Pitchfork Media |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref> Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented on the genre of choice and the toned-down sexiness, "Minaj aims for a Rihanna-style crossover approach, singing R&B choruses over electro floss and toning down her nasty side."<ref name="RS">{{cite web|author=Rob Sheffield |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/pink-friday-20101122 |title=Pink Friday by Nicki Minaj &#124; Music Reviews |work=Rolling Stone |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref> Marc Hogan of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' complimented the song's inspirational tone and that other cuts from the album, including "Fly", "have her charismatically colorful, larger-than-life personality all over them."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/nicki-minaj-pink-friday-young-moneycash-moneyuniversal-motown |title=Nicki Minaj, 'Pink Friday' (Young Money/Cash Money/Universal Motown) |work=Spin|publisher=Spin Media LLC|date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
[[File:Nicki Minaj Fly musicvideo.png|thumb|upright|280px|A scene from the video with Rihanna (''left'') and Nicki Minaj (''right'')]]
The video begins with a [[Jaguar XKR]] driving through the wreckage of a [[post-apocalyptic]] landscape. Part way through it cuts to a shot of the sky, with the sun blocked out by clouds. The video then returns to the car which has stopped and the roof retreats to the back of the car. The song begins as Minaj steps out wearing a strange, pink barbed dress, thigh-high cowboy boots and big curly hair. Minaj begins her verse whilst walking through the wreckage, and as her verse finishes she is joined by Rihanna who sings the second chorus, wearing a black dress, with straight red hair. As the second verse begins the video switches to a scene where we see Minaj standing on the wing of a crashed plane, this time sporting a pink bob-style wig and lilac dress. For the third chorus we see Rihanna and Minaj together again standing amongst the wreckage in a night time scene, with Rihanna wearing a white long-sleeved straight jacket, and Minaj with leopard print style hair and a baby dress. As Minaj begins her third verse the scenes alternate between the current scene and one where we see Minaj, wearing a white cat suit and White Tiger print hair style, standing on at the top of some steps. As she walks down, ninjas start appearing from over either side of the stair railings and attacking her. Minaj surprisingly defeats all her opponents, in what is a slightly extended version of the third verse compared to the album version of the song. This scene also alternates with the scene where Minaj is on the plane wing. On the last chorus the video alternates between the plane wing scene and the scene with Rihanna and Minaj whimpering amongst the wreckage. As the video comes to an end, plant life begins to grow around and over the wreckage. The video finishes by returning to the shot of the sky, where now the sun can be seen exploding between the clouds.
