The '''Washington Wizards''' are an American professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Washington, D.C.]] The Wizards compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Southeast Division (NBA)|Southeast Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Capital One Arena]], in the [[Chinatown (Washington, D.C.)|Chinatown]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

The franchise was established in 1961 as the '''Chicago Packers''' based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and were renamed to '''Chicago Zephyrs''' the following season. In 1963, they relocated to [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], and became the '''Baltimore Bullets''', taking the name from a [[Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)|previous team of the same name]]. In 1973, the team changed its name to the '''Capital Bullets''' to reflect their move to the [[Washington metropolitan area]], and then to '''Washington Bullets''' in the following season. In 1997, they rebranded themselves as the '''Wizards'''.

The Wizards have appeared in four [[NBA Finals]], and won in [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]]. They have had a total of 28 playoff appearances, won four conference titles (1971, 1975, 1978, 1979), and seven division titles (1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1979, 2017). Their best season came in 1975 with a record of 60–22. [[Wes Unseld]] is the only player in franchise history to become the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] (1969), and win the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]] award (1978). Four players ([[Walt Bellamy]], [[Terry Dischinger]], [[Earl Monroe]], and Wes Unseld) have won the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award.

==Franchise history==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}

===Team creation===
[[File:1961 Chicago Packers vs. Boston Celtics.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Bellamy (#8) averaged 31.6 points per game and 19.0 rebounds per game during his rookie season.]]
The team now known as the Wizards began playing as the '''Chicago Packers''' in 1961, as the first modern [[expansion team]] in NBA history, an expansion prompted by [[Abe Saperstein]]'s [[American Basketball League (1961–63)|American Basketball League]]. Rookie [[Walt Bellamy]] was the team's star, averaging 31.6 points per game, 19.0 rebounds per game, and leading the NBA in field goal percentage. During the All-Star game, Bellamy represented the team while scoring 23 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. Bellamy was named the league Rookie of the Year, but the team finished with the NBA's worst record at 18–62.

The team's original nickname was a nod to Chicago's meatpacking industry; their home arena, the [[International Amphitheater]], was next door to the [[Union Stock Yards]]. However, it was extremely unpopular since it was the same nickname used by the NFL's [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Bears–Packers rivalry|bitter rivals]] of the [[Chicago Bears]]. After only one year, the organization changed its name to the '''Chicago Zephyrs''' and played its home games at the [[Chicago Coliseum]] (Saperstein's ABL [[Chicago Majors|Majors]] prevented the team from playing in the larger [[Chicago Stadium]]). Their only season as the Zephyrs boasted former [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] star [[Terry Dischinger]], who went on to win Rookie of the Year honors. In 1963 the franchise moved to [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and became the '''Baltimore Bullets,''' taking their name from a 1940s–'50s [[Baltimore Bullets (1944–54)|Baltimore Bullets]] BAA/NBA franchise and playing home games at the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] (the NBA would return to Chicago in 1966 when [[1966–67 Chicago Bulls season|the Chicago Bulls]] began play). In their first year in Baltimore, the Bullets finished fourth in a five–team Western Division.<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=bal Baltimore Bullets (1963–1972)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012081621/http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=bal |date=October 12, 2012 }}, databasebasketball.com, accessed June 23, 2011.</ref>

Prior to [[1964–65 NBA season|the 1964–65 season]] the Bullets pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending Dischinger, [[Rod Thorn]] and [[Don Kojis]] to [[1964–65 Detroit Pistons season|the Detroit Pistons]] for [[Bailey Howell]], [[Don Ohl]], [[Bob Ferry]] and [[Wali Jones]]. The trade worked out well; Howell proved to be a hustler and a fundamentally sound player. He helped the Bullets reach the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In the [[1965 NBA Playoffs]], the Bullets stunned [[1964–65 St. Louis Hawks season|the St. Louis Hawks]] 3–1, and advanced to the Western Conference finals. In the finals, Baltimore managed to split the first four games with [[1964–65 Los Angeles Lakers season|the Los Angeles Lakers]] before losing the series 4–2.

===1967–1981: The Wes Unseld era===
[[File:Wes Unseld 1975.jpeg|225px|right|thumb|[[Wes Unseld]], who won the NBA Rookie of the Year, NBA Regular Season MVP, and NBA Finals MVP awards, played all 13 seasons of his career with the Bullets.]]
In the late 1960s, the Bullets drafted two future Hall of Fame members: [[Earl Monroe]], in [[1967 NBA draft|the 1967 draft]], number two overall, and [[Wes Unseld]], in [[1968 NBA draft|the following year's draft]], also number two overall. The team improved dramatically, from 36 wins the previous season to 57 in [[1968–69 Baltimore Bullets season|the 1968–69 season]], and Unseld received both the rookie of the year and MVP awards. The Bullets reached the playoffs with high expectations to go far, but they were eliminated by [[1968–69 New York Knicks season|the New York Knicks]] in the first round. The next season the two teams met again in the first round, and although this one went to seven games, the Knicks emerged victorious again.

In [[1970–71 Baltimore Bullets season|the 1970–71 season]], the 42–40 Bullets again met [[1970–71 New York Knicks season|the Knicks]], this time though in the Eastern Conference finals. With the Knicks team captain [[Willis Reed]] injured in the finals, the injury-free Bullets took advantage of his absence, and in game seven, at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]], the Bullets' [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]] made a critical basket late in the game to lift the Bullets over the Knicks 93–91 and advance to their first [[NBA Finals]]. They were swept in four games by the powerful [[1970–71 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] led by future Hall of Fame members [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] (known in 1971 as Lew Alcindor) and [[Oscar Robertson]].

Even after the trades of Earl Monroe (to the Knicks) and [[Gus Johnson (basketball)|Gus Johnson]] (to the Suns), the Bullets remained a playoff contender throughout the 1970s. Following a less than spectacular [[1971–72 Baltimore Bullets season|1971–72 season]], Baltimore acquired [[Elvin Hayes]] from [[1971–72 Houston Rockets season|the Houston Rockets]] and [[1972 NBA draft|drafted]] [[Kevin Porter (basketball)|Kevin Porter]] in the third round, out of [[Saint Francis Red Flash men's basketball|St. Francis]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

After a slow start in [[1972–73 Baltimore Bullets season|1972–73]], Baltimore made their charge in December, posting a 10–4 record on the way to capturing the Central Division title for the third straight year. The Bullets again faced [[1972–73 New York Knicks season|the Knicks]] in the [[1973 NBA Playoffs]], losing for the fourth time in five series against New York.

In February 1973, the team announced its pending move {{convert|30|mi|-1}} southwest to the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]] in [[Landover, Maryland|Landover]], a Washington, D.C. suburb, and became the '''Capital Bullets'''.<ref name=bfstbcb>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nKUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dTgHAAAAIBAJ&pg=4727%2C577353 |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |location=Maine |agency=Associated Press |title=Baltimore five set to become Capital Bullets |date=February 17, 1973 |page=21 }}</ref> After that [[1973–74 Capital Bullets season|1973–74 season]], they changed their geographic identifier name to the '''Washington Bullets'''.<ref name=bchnmagn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZxBIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qQANAAAAIBAJ&pg=5269%2C3317003 |newspaper=Morning Record |location=Meriden, Connecticut |agency=Associated Press |title=Bullets change name again |date=April 23, 1974 |page=15 }}</ref><ref name=bchnmagup>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tWE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=UQoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5770%2C5657117 |newspaper=Wilmington Morning Star |location=North Carolina |agency=UPI |title=Bullets change name |date=April 23, 1974 |page=16 }}</ref>

During November 1973, while waiting for the completion of their new arena in Landover, the Bullets played their home games at [[Cole Field House]] on the campus of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]. The Capital Centre (later known as the [[US Airways|USAir/US Airways]] Arena) opened on December 2, 1973, with the Bullets defeating [[1973–74 Seattle SuperSonics season|the SuperSonics]]. Through the mid-1990s, the Bullets still played a few games per season in [[Baltimore]].

[[File:Elvin Hayes 1975.jpeg|thumb|160px|left|During his nine seasons with the Bullets, [[Elvin Hayes]] averaged 21.3 points per game and 12.7 rebounds per game. He led the NBA in rebounding in the 1973–74 season with an average of 18.1 rebounds per game.]]
The 60–22 Bullets made it back to the [[1975 NBA Playoffs]]. [[1974–75 Washington Bullets season|That year]], Washington posted a 36–5 home record at the Capital Centre. In the first round of the playoffs, they survived a seven-game series against [[1974–75 Buffalo Braves season|the Buffalo Braves]] as both teams won all of their games at home. In the Eastern Conference finals, they beat the defending NBA champion [[1974–75 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] in six games to advance to [[1975 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]]. The Bullets were favorites to win the NBA Championship, but were swept by the Al Attles-led [[1974–75 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in four games, losing games one and four at the Capital Centre.

The loss at the NBA Finals lingered into [[1975–76 Washington Bullets season|the 1975–76 season]], as they won 12 fewer games than last year, and in the playoffs they were eliminated by [[1975–76 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the Cleveland Cavaliers]] in seven games. After the season, the Bullets fired head coach [[K.C. Jones]], despite having a career 62 percent winning percentage as the Bullets head coach.

[[1976–77 Washington Bullets season|In 1976–77]], under new head coach [[Dick Motta]], the Bullets again fell short of the Central Division title for the second straight year. Elvin Hayes finished sixth in the league in rebounds with 12.5 rebounds per game. After opening the [[1977 NBA Playoffs]] with a three-game series victory over [[1976–77 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the Cleveland Cavaliers]], the Bullets took a 2–1 series lead in the second round against [[1976–77 Houston Rockets season|the Houston Rockets]]. With a chance to take a 3–1 series lead at home, the Bullets lost 107–103, and the Rockets took the series in six games.

====1977–78 Championship season====
<!-- This section is linked from [[Nils Lofgren]] -->
Although they had future hall of famers [[Elvin Hayes]] and [[Wes Unseld]] on the team, the Bullets finished [[1977–78 Washington Bullets season|the 1977–78 season]] 44–38 and were a longshot to win the [[NBA Finals]], but San Antonio journalist [[Dan Cook]] used the famed phrase "[[It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings|The opera ain't over 'til the fat lady sings]]". This became the rallying cry for the Bullets as they finished a playoff run that led to the [[NBA Finals]], defeating [[1977–78 Seattle SuperSonics season|the Seattle SuperSonics]] in seven games to bring a professional sports championship to Washington, D.C. for the first time in 36 years. It remains the only NBA title won by the team as of 2020.

====1978–79====
In [[1978–79 Washington Bullets season|the 1978–79 season]] the Bullets moved to the Atlantic Division, capturing the title in their first season there. They entered the [[1979 NBA Playoffs]] having lost eight of the final 11 games to finish the regular season at 54–28. In the playoffs the Bullets nearly blew a 3–1 series lead against [[1978–79 Atlanta Hawks season|the Atlanta Hawks]], but managed to hold off the Hawks in seven games.

In the Eastern Conference finals, they trailed [[1978–79 San Antonio Spurs season|the San Antonio Spurs]] 3–1, but they mounted a comeback by winning two straight games to force a game seven at the Capital Centre. The Bullets rallied again, overcoming a fourth–quarter deficit to beat [[George Gervin]] and the Spurs 107–105 in one of the NBA's all-time greatest games and advance to the NBA Finals and a rematch with [[1978–79 Seattle SuperSonics season|the Seattle SuperSonics]].

In game one of the finals, the Bullets defeated the SuperSonics, 99–97, on two game-winning free throws. They lost the next four games, and the series, to Seattle. The Bullets were the only team to play in the [[NBA Finals]] four times during the 1970s.

===1979–1988: Playoff disappointments===
Age and injuries finally caught up with the Bullets. In [[1979–80 Washington Bullets season|the 1979–80 season]], they [[1980 NBA Playoffs|barely made the playoffs]] as they captured the sixth and final playoff spot via a tiebreaker despite posting a 39–43 record. In the playoffs, they were swept by [[1979–80 Philadelphia 76ers season|the Philadelphia 76ers]] in a two-game playoff series. The following year the Bullets failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. [[Wes Unseld]] retired and [[Elvin Hayes]] was traded to [[1980–81 Houston Rockets season|the Houston Rockets]] the following season.

[[File:Washington Bullets at Charlotte Hornets 1988-11-26 (ticket).jpg|thumb|left|75px|A ticket for a [[1988–89 Washington Bullets season|1988–89]] game between the Bullets and [[1988–89 Charlotte Hornets season|the Hornets]].]]
In [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82]], Washington played strong under the coaching of [[Gene Shue]] and [[Don Moran]], finishing the regular season with a 43–39 record, and although they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals in the playoffs, they had clearly lost the power of the late 1970s. The 1983 Bullets continued to play with the same talent they had in the previous year. They finished with a winning record, but in a highly competitive Atlantic Division they finished last and missed the playoffs.

The next two years saw the Bullets continue to play mediocre basketball as they finished with losing records but they made the playoffs in the new expanded [[NBA Playoffs]] format that involved the 16 best teams to make the playoffs; the Bullets were eliminated in both years in the first round.

In [[1984–85 Washington Bullets season|1985]], the Bullets acquired [[Manute Bol]], whose specialty was blocking shots. That year, he blocked 397 shots (a Bullets record), part of a team that blocked 716 shots (a Bullets team record). However, the Bullets finished with a disappointing 39–43 record, and were eliminated by the 76ers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The Bullets acquired center [[Moses Malone]] from [[1984–85 Philadelphia 76ers season|the Philadelphia 76ers]] for center [[Jeff Ruland]] the following season for hope of improvement. Malone would lead the team in scoring with a 24.1 points per game as he would be joined by [[Jeff Malone]] who averaged 22.0 points per game. The Bullets' 42–40 record would be their last winning season until [[1996–97 Washington Bullets season|1996–97]]. Washington was eliminated by [[1986–87 Detroit Pistons season|the Detroit Pistons]] in three games in the playoffs.

Twelfth overall in the 1987 Draft the Bullets selected [[Muggsy Bogues]], who at {{convert|5|ft|3|in|cm}} is the shortest player in NBA history. The Bullets would get off to a slow start as coach [[Kevin Loughery]] was fired 27 games into the season with the Bullets holding an 8–19 record. To replace Loughery, the Bullets hired former [[MVP]] Wes Unseld. Under Unseld the Bullets improved as they were able to reach the playoffs again with a record of 38–44. After losing the first two games on the road in the first round of the [[1988 NBA Playoffs]] to [[1987–88 Detroit Pistons season|the Detroit Pistons]], the Bullets fought back and forced a fifth game with two home wins. They would lose game 5 by 21 points. It would be nine seasons before Washington would return to the NBA Playoffs.

===1989–1997===
The Bullets got off to a 5–1 start in 1988–89, but they lost 16 of 18 games from mid-December to mid-January. They finished with a 31–51 record despite stellar seasons by Jeff Malone and [[Bernard King]], who averaged 24.3 and 22.3 points per game respectively to lead the team.

The lone highlight of the Bullets’ 30-win 1990–91 season was the successful comeback effort by Bernard King as he recovered from knee surgery he suffered while playing for the Knicks in [[the 1984–85 New York Knicks season|1984–85 season]] to finish third in the NBA in scoring with a 28.4 points per game. In 1990, the team named [[Susan O'Malley]] as its president, the first female president of a franchise in the history of the NBA, who is the daughter of Peter O'Malley, the prominent lawyer from Maryland and former president of the [[Washington Capitals]].

The Bullets continued to struggle due to injuries and inconsistent play. They posted a 25–57 record in the 1991–92 season. [[Pervis Ellison]] was named 1992 [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player of The Year]], averaging 20.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks per game. Undrafted rookie [[Larry Stewart (basketball)|Larry Stewart]] became the first undrafted player in NBA history to make an All-Rookie Team, being selected to the All-Rookie Second Team. The Bullets drafted [[Tom Gugliotta]] with their sixth overall pick in the [[1992 NBA draft]]. They finished the 1992–93 season with a 22–60 record. Following the season, the Bullets traded [[Harvey Grant]] to [[1993–94 Portland Trail Blazers season|the Portland Trail Blazers]] for former All-Star center [[Kevin Duckworth]]. In 1993, the Bullets did a rap music video of their version of [[Naughty by Nature]]'s rap single "[[Hip Hop Hooray]]", featuring the rap trio themselves.

Injuries continued to bite the Bullets as key players [[Rex Chapman]] and [[Calbert Cheaney]] (the club's first-round draft pick) missed significant stretches, and Ellison missed almost the entire season. The result was a 24–58 record for the 1993–94 season. [[Don MacLean (basketball)|Don MacLean]] was named 1994 Most Improved Player of the season, leading the Bullets with 18.2 points per game (tied with Chapman).

The Bullets selected [[Juwan Howard]] in the [[1994 NBA draft]] and traded Gugliotta along with three first-round draft picks to [[1994–95 Golden State Warriors season|the Golden State Warriors]] for the rights to [[Chris Webber]]. While the season started out with promise, a shoulder injury to Chris Webber (ironically against the Warriors) caused him to miss 19 games and the Bullets struggled through the rest of the season finishing a then franchise-worst (percentage wise) 21–61. Webber averaged 20.1 points and 9.6 rebounds per game, but declined surgery for his dislocated shoulder. This would prove costly for the next season. The Bullets released a holiday video, "You da Man, You da Man, that's the reason I'm a Bullets Fan!" in 1994, which featured all 12 Bullets dancing in front of the Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2017/05/04/bullets-classic-you-da-man-video-gets-a-wizards-makeover/|title=Bullets’ classic ‘You Da Man’ video gets a Wizards makeover|last=Allen|first=Scott|date=May 4, 2017|work=Washington Post|access-date=March 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wtop.com/washington-wizards/2017/05/da-man-video-revives-legendary-dc-basketball-anthem/|title='You Da Man!' video revives legendary DC basketball anthem|last=Moore|first=Jack|date=May 8, 2017|work=WTOP|access-date=March 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2014/05/13/the-top-10-moments-of-the-bullets-you-the-man-video/|title=The top 10 moments of the Bullets’ ‘You the Man’ video|last=Allen|first=Scott|date=May 13, 2014|work=Washington Post|access-date=March 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

In the Bullets' 1995–96 season Webber suffered a dislocated left shoulder in a preseason game against [[1995–96 Indiana Pacers season|the Indiana Pacers]] on October 21, and opened the season on the injured list. He was activated on November 27, but strained his shoulder against [[1995–96 New York Knicks season|the New York Knicks]] on December 29. After hoping the injury would get better with rest, Webber finally underwent surgery on Feb 1 which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. The Bullets were 9–6 with Webber in the lineup as he averaged a team-high 23.7 points plus 7.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.80 steals in 37.2 minutes per game when he was able to play. Other players injured included [[Mark Price]] (who only played in seven games) and [[Robert Pack (basketball)|Robert Pack]] (31 games played out of 82). Bright spots of the season included the selection of [[Rasheed Wallace]] in the 1995 NBA draft and the All-Star play of Howard. Howard averaged a career-best 22.1 ppg and 8.1 rpg and kept the Bullets slim playoff hopes alive until the end of the season. Center [[Gheorghe Mureșan]] was named Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. The Bullets improved to 39–43 but just missed the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.

Washington, boasting the league's tallest player (Mureșan, whose height is {{convert|7|ft|7|in|cm|disp=or}}), two very athletic forwards (Howard and Webber) and one of the league's top point guards ([[Rod Strickland]]), started the 1996–97 season at 22–24. That led to the dismissal of head coach [[Jim Lynam]]. [[Bernie Bickerstaff]], an assistant coach with the Bullets when they won their only NBA Championship in 1978, was called upon to resurrect his former team. The Bullets responded, winning 16 of their final 21 games to finish 44–38, their best record since 1978–79. The late surge enabled the Bullets to climb within reach of [[1996–97 Cleveland Cavaliers season|the Cleveland Cavaliers]] for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. In a win-or-go-home game with the Cavaliers on the season's final day, the Bullets squeezed past Cleveland 85–81 to end the franchise's longest playoff drought. Whilst the Bullets were swept by the Bulls in the first round, they lost the three games by a total of 18 points.

Webber led the way in scoring (20.1 ppg), rebounding (10.3) and blocks (1.9) and shot 51.8 percent from the floor to make his first All-Star team. Howard averaged 19.1 ppg and 8.0 rpg, while Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 1.74 spg and finished fifth in the league in assists with 8.9 per game. Mureşan dominated the middle and led the NBA in field goal percentage (.599). Washington received contributions from [[Calbert Cheaney]] (10.6 ppg) and [[Tracy Murray]] (10.0 ppg).

====Becoming the Wizards====
[[File:Verizon Center 12-05-2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Wizards moved to the MCI Center (later named Verizon Center and now the [[Capital One Arena]]) in 1997.]]
In November 1995, owner [[Abe Pollin]] announced he was changing the team's nickname,<ref name=bwchtmnn>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K7wfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FNgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1117%2C1048322 |newspaper=Gadsden Times |location=Alabama |agency=Associated Press |title=Bullets will change nickname |date=November 10, 1995 |page=D4 }}</ref> because ''Bullets'' had acquired violent overtones that had made him increasingly uncomfortable over the years, particularly given the high homicide and [[Gun laws in the United States (by district)|crime]] rate in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C. The name change was widely believed to be related to the [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassination]] of Pollin's longtime friend, [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/dcsportsbog/2010/02/why_abe_pollin_went_from_bulle.html|title=D.C.

A contest was held to choose a new name and the choices were narrowed to the ''Dragons'', ''Express'', ''Stallions'', ''Sea Dogs'', and the ''Wizards''.<ref name="Peterseim">{{cite news |last=Peterseim |first=Locke |title=Like magic, Wizards' name becomes cool |work=Page 2 Goes to Washington |publisher=ESPN |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/wash/s/closer/020316.html |accessdate=July 7, 2006 }}</ref> On May 15, 1997, the Bullets officially became the Wizards. The new name generated some controversy because "[[Imperial Wizard|Wizard]]" is a rank in the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and Washington has a large [[African American]] population.<ref name="Peterseim" />
A new logo was unveiled and the team colors were changed from the traditional red, white and blue to a lighter shade of blue, black and bronze, the same colors as the [[Washington Capitals]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), also owned by Pollin. Washington forward [[Juwan Howard]] sat on the committee that decided on the logo design.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bembry |first1=Jerry |title=Wizards officially assume NBA identity Bullets name put to rest; logos, colors are unveiled |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1997-05-16-1997136067-story.html |website=baltimoresun.com |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128181758/https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1997-05-16-1997136067-story.html |archivedate=January 28, 2020 |date=May 16, 1997}}</ref> That same year the Wizards moved to the then MCI Center, now called [[Capital One Arena]], which is home to the Capitals and [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|the Georgetown Hoyas men's college basketball team]].

In 1998, they became the brother team to the [[Washington Mystics]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], and remained officially thus until 2005 when the Mystics were sold to Lincoln Holdings (headed by [[Ted Leonsis]]), parent company of the Capitals. However, upon the purchase of the Wizards by Leonsis in 2010, the Wizards and Mystics again became sibling teams.

===1997–2001===
The newly named Wizards began the 1997–98 season playing 5 home games at the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]] before moving to the new MCI Center on December 2, 1997. The Wizards finished the season with a 42–40 record including 4 straight victories to end the season but just missed the playoffs. Highlights of the season included [[Chris Webber]] leading the team in scoring (21.9 ppg) and rebounding (9.5 rpg). Strickland led the league in assists (10.5 apg) before suffering an injury near the end of the season. He was also named on the All-NBA Second Team. Tracy Murray averaged 15.1 ppg off the bench including a 50-point game against Golden State. Off court distractions led to the trade of Webber to [[1998–99 Sacramento Kings season|the Sacramento Kings]] for [[Mitch Richmond]] and [[Otis Thorpe]] in May 1998.

The Wizards finished the lockout shortened season of [[1998–99 Washington Wizards season|1998–99]] with a record of 18–32. Mitch Richmond led the team in scoring with a 19.7 ppg average. In [[1999–2000 Washington Wizards season|the 1999–2000 season]], the Wizards finished with a 29–53 record. Mitch Richmond led the team with 17.4 ppg. In [[2000–01 NBA season|the 2000–2001 season]], under newly hired coach [[Leonard Hamilton]], [[1999 NBA draft]] pick [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] led the team in scoring with 18.1 ppg, but the team finished with a 19–63 record, the most losses the team had ever suffered in one season.

On February 23, 2001, the Wizards were involved in a blockbuster trade days before the trading deadline. The team sent [[Juwan Howard]], [[Obinna Ekezie]] and [[Calvin Booth]] to [[2000–01 Dallas Mavericks season|the Dallas Mavericks]]. In return, Washington received [[Hubert Davis]], [[Courtney Alexander]], [[Christian Laettner]], [[Loy Vaught]] and [[Etan Thomas]] along with $3&nbsp;million.

===2001–2003: Michael Jordan era===
[[File:Michael Jordan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Jordan]] served as president of basketball operations and was a minority owner.]]

====2001–02====
After retiring from [[1998–99 Chicago Bulls season|the Chicago Bulls]] in early 1999, [[Michael Jordan]] became the Washington Wizards' president of basketball operations as well as a minority owner in January 2000. In September 2001, Jordan came out of retirement at age 38 to play for Washington. Jordan stated that he was returning "for the love of the game." Because of NBA rules, he had to divest himself of any ownership of the team. Before the All-Star break, Jordan was one of only two players to average more than 25 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds<ref name=dupree>{{cite news|last=DuPree|first=David|title=NBA's brightest stars set to collide|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/jordan/2002-02-12-jordan-bryant.htm|accessdate=July 14, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 12, 2002}}</ref> as he led the Wizards to a 26–21 record. After the All-Star break, Jordan's knee could not handle the workload of a full-season as he ended the season on the injured list, and the Wizards concluded the season with a 37–45 record.

====2002–03====
Jordan announced he would return for [[2002–03 Washington Wizards season|the 2002–03 season]], and this time he was determined to be equipped with reinforcements, as he traded for All-Star [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and signed budding star [[Larry Hughes]]. Jordan even accepted a sixth-man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82-game season. A combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan's return to the [[starting lineup]], where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early-season struggles. By the end of the season, the Wizards finished with a 37–45 record once again. Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games, as he averaged 20.0 points,<ref name=20points>{{cite news|title=Jordan's top 10 countdown|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2003-04-17-jordan_x.htm|accessdate=July 14, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=April 17, 2003}}</ref> 6.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game. Jordan retired from playing for a third and final time after the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/17/sports/pro-basketball-jordan-bows-out-for-a-third-time.html|title=PRO BASKETBALL; Jordan Bows Out for a Third Time|first=Chris|last=Broussard|date=April 17, 2003|accessdate=February 16, 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

====Jordan's departure====
After the season, majority owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to the shock of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking that he would get his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had detrimental effects on the team, such as benching Hughes for [[Tyronn Lue]], making poor trades, and using the team's first-round draft pick on high schooler [[Kwame Brown]]. The Wizards replaced Jordan's managerial role with general manager [[Ernie Grunfeld]].

===2003–2010: Gilbert Arenas era===
[[File:Wizards G-Man.jpg|thumb|The Wizards G-Man, one of the team's mascots]]

====2003–04====
Without Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard [[Gilbert Arenas]], in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25–57 record in [[2003–04 Washington Wizards season|the 2003–04 season]]. Following the season, [[Jerry Stackhouse]], [[Christian Laettner]], and a first-round draft pick (which turned out to be [[Wisconsin Badgers basketball|University of Wisconsin–Madison]] point guard [[Devin Harris]]) were all traded to [[2004–05 Dallas Mavericks season|the Dallas Mavericks]] for Antawn Jamison.

====2004–05: Return to the playoffs====
[[2004–05 Washington Wizards season|The 2004–05 season]] saw the team (now in the new Southeast Division) post its best regular-season record in 26 years (45–37) and marked the first time the franchise had ever made the playoffs as the Wizards. In the off-season, the team traded Stackhouse, [[Christian Laettner]], and the draft rights to [[Devin Harris]] to [[2004–05 Dallas Mavericks season|the Dallas Mavericks]] for [[Antawn Jamison]]. During the regular season, the scoring trio of Arenas, Jamison and Hughes was the highest in the NBA and earned the nickname of "The Big Three". Hughes led the NBA in steals with 2.89 per game. Arenas and Jamison were both named to the 2005 Eastern Conference All-Star team, marking the first time Washington had two players in the All-Star game since [[Jeff Malone]] and Moses Malone represented the Bullets in the 1987 All-Star Game.

With a 93–82 win over [[2004–05 Chicago Bulls season|the Chicago Bulls]] on April 13, 2005, the Wizards clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 1996–97.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20050413_CHI@WAS|title=NBA – CBSSports.com|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Long-suffering fans celebrated by buying over 16,000 playoff tickets in two and a half hours the day tickets went on sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20050409_PHI@WAS|title=NBA – CBSSports.com|work=CBSSports.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> In game 3 of [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the first round]] against the Bulls, the Wizards won their first playoff game since 1988.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards Run Past Bulls|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20050430/CHIWAS/recap.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 30, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050502155733/http://www.nba.com/games/20050430/CHIWAS/recap.html|archivedate=May 2, 2005|accessdate=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Adding to the "long-overdue" feeling was the fact that game 3 was the first NBA playoff game to be held within Washington, D.C. city limits.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sereno|first=Brian A.|title=All You Ever Wanted to Know About the 2004–05 Wizards|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/0405_recap_1.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|date=June 7, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107204919/http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/0405_recap_1.html|archivedate=January 7, 2007|accessdate=October 30, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the Wizards' game 5 victory in Chicago, Arenas hit a buzzer-beater to win the game<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards Win at the Buzzer|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20050504/WASCHI/recap.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=May 4, 2005|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> and the Wizards took their first lead in a playoff series since 1986. In Game 6 at the MCI Center, [[Jared Jeffries]] picked up a loose ball and went in for an uncontested tie-breaking dunk with 32 seconds left, thus giving the Wizards a 94–91 win and the team's first playoff series win in 23 years. They were only the 12th team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being down 0–2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards' Late Heroics End Playoff Drought|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20050506/CHIWAS/recap.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=May 6, 2005|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> This playoff series victory ended the [[List of NBA franchise post-season droughts|second longest streak with no post-season series wins]] in NBA history.

In the conference semifinals, the Wizards were swept by [[2004–05 Miami Heat season|the Miami Heat]], the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

====2005–06====
[[2005–06 Washington Wizards season|The 2005–06 season]] was filled with ups and downs. During the off-season, Washington acquired [[Caron Butler]] and [[Antonio Daniels]]. During the regular season, the Wizards again had the best scoring trio in the NBA, this time consisting of Arenas, Jamison and Butler as the "Big Three". The Wizards started the 2005–06 season at 5–1, but went on an 8–17 funk to go to 13–18 through 31 games. Then, they went 13–5 in the next eighteen games. On April 5, 2006, the team was 39–35 and looking to close in on the 45-win mark achieved the previous year, until Butler suffered a thumb sprain and the Wizards lost all five games without him. Butler returned and the team pulled out their final three games, against the Pistons, Cavs and Bucks, all playoff-bound teams, to finish the year at 42–40 and clinch the 5th seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. They averaged 101.7 points a game, third in the NBA and tops in the East and clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season for the first time since 1987.

Their first-round match-up with Cleveland was widely seen as the most evenly matched series in the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]]. The teams exchanged wins during the first two games in Cleveland, with Game 2 highlighted by the Wizards holding [[LeBron James]] to 7–25 shooting from the floor while [[Brendan Haywood]] gave James a hard foul in the first quarter that many cited as the key to shaking up the rest of James's game. In Game 3 at the Verizon Center, James hit a 4-footer on the way down with 5.7 seconds left to take the game and the series lead for the Cavs with a 97–96 win. Arenas missed a potential game-winning three-pointer on the other end to seal the win for the Cavs. Game 4 saw the Wizards heat up again, as Arenas scored 20 in the fourth quarter after claiming he changed his jersey, shorts, shoes and tights in the room and the Wizards won 106–96. Yet in Games 5 and 6, the Cavs would take control of the series, both games decided by one point in overtime.

In Game 5, despite the Wizards being down 107–100 with 1:18 to play, the team drove back and eventually tied the game on Butler's layup with 7.5 seconds remaining to send the game to OT, where James scored with 0.9 seconds left in overtime to send the Cavs to a 121–120 win. The series returned to the Verizon Center for Game 6, where the game went back and forth all night. The Wizards blew a 14-point first-quarter lead, then for 24 minutes, from early in the second quarter to early in the fourth, neither team led by more than five points at any time. The Wizards blew a seven-point lead with just under 5 to play and needed Arenas to hit a 31-footer at the end of regulation to take the game to overtime. In OT, Arenas missed two key free throws. Cleveland rebounded the ball, went downcourt and [[Damon Jones]] hit a 17-foot baseline jumper with 4.8 seconds remaining to give the Cavs the lead for good. Butler missed a three-pointer on the other end to seal the game, and the series, for the Cavaliers.

====2006–07====
[[File:washington wizards toronto raptors.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Wizards in a home game against [[2006–07 Toronto Raptors season|the Toronto Raptors]], March 30, 2007.]]
The 2006–07 season started out very promisingly for the Wizards. In the off-season they signed free agents [[DeShawn Stevenson]] and [[Darius Songaila]]. Etan Thomas beat out Haywood for the starting center job. After starting the season 0–8 on the road, Washington rebounded to win 6 of 7 away from Verizon Center. After a November 4–9, Washington went 22–9 through December and January. Arenas scored a franchise-record 60 points against [[2006–07 Los Angeles Lakers season|the Lakers]] on December 17. He and Eddie Jordan were named player of the month and coach of the month for December, respectively. On January 3 and again on January 15, Arenas hit buzzer-beating three-pointers to beat [[2006–07 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee]] and [[2006–07 Utah Jazz season|Utah]].

On January 30, Jamison went down with a sprained left knee in a win against [[Detroit Pistons|Detroit]]. Washington went 4–8 in the 12 games without him. On February 3, Songaila made his Wizards debut against the Lakers. On February 18, Eddie Jordan became the first Wizards/Bullets coach to coach in the [[NBA All-Star Game]] since [[Dick Motta]] in 1978–1979. Arenas played in his third straight All-Star game and Butler made his [[All-Star Game]] debut.

On March 14, Butler went out with a knee injury that kept him out of the lineup for six games. He returned for only three games until he fractured his right hand on April 1 against Milwaukee. On April 4, Arenas suffered a season-ending knee injury, of the meniscus. An April 15 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' pointed out that with Arenas and Butler gone, the team had lost 42.3% of their offensive production, quite possibly "the most costly" loss for any team in the midst of a playoff hunt in NBA history.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2007/04/15/GR2007041500137.html | work=The Washington Post | title=A Big Piece of the Pie | accessdate=May 27, 2010 | date=April 15, 2007}}</ref>

Despite their late-season struggles without Arenas and Butler, the Wizards still managed to make the Eastern Conference playoffs, taking the 7th seed at 41–41. They were swept four games to none in a rematch of the previous year's first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Despite a depleted roster, the Wizards still managed to keep things close in every game in the series and only lost the final three games by a combined 20 points. The team enjoyed their best attendance figures in the post-Jordan era with a season attendance of 753,283 (18,372 per game).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/attendance?year=2007|title=2006-2007 NBA Attendance - National Basketball Association |publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>

====2007–08====
The Wizards retained a majority of their roster from the 2006–07 season, only losing [[Jarvis Hayes]] to [[2007–08 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit]], Calvin Booth to [[2007–08 Philadelphia 76ers season|the Philadelphia 76ers]], and Michael Ruffin to [[2007–08 Milwaukee Bucks season|the Milwaukee Bucks]] as free agents. Washington signed [[Oleksiy Pecherov]], the team's first-round pick in 2006, as well as 2007 picks [[Nick Young (basketball)|Nick Young]] and [[Dominic McGuire]]. Etan Thomas missed the regular season after undergoing open-heart surgery.

The team began the season starting 0–5, but rebounded to win six straight. After eight games, Arenas underwent surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee, as well as a microfracture surgery. This was the same knee he had injured the previous year. The injury forced Arenas out for a total of 68 games. Midway through the season, Butler was forced to the sidelines for a total of 20 games with what initially was a strained hip flexor, but turned out to be a labral tear. Despite all of the injuries, the Wizards managed to finish 43–39 on the regular season, good for 5th place in the Eastern Conference and a first-round playoff matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight season; the Wizards lost that series in six games.

====2008–10====
During the off-season, Arenas signed a 6-year, $111&nbsp;million contract, while Jamison signed a 4-year, $50&nbsp;million contract. The Wizards did not re-sign guard [[Roger Mason (basketball)|Roger Mason]], who signed with [[2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season|the San Antonio Spurs]]. The Wizards added guards [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1984)|Dee Brown]] and [[Juan Dixon]], and drafted [[JaVale McGee]] 18th overall<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington Wizards Draft JaVale McGee|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/mcgee18_080626.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}</ref> in the 2008 NBA Draft.

In September, Arenas underwent a third operation on his surgically repaired left knee to clean out fluid and debris, and was expected to miss at least the first month of the season. The forecast came in longer than expected, as Arenas missed 5 months of action due to concerns on his knee before returning on March 29, 2009. In the first game of the preseason, Jamison suffered a right knee contusion, and was expected to miss the rest of the preseason. Haywood announced that he would undergo surgery on his right wrist and was expected to miss 4–6 months. The preseason marked the return of Etan Thomas who had missed all of the 2007–2008 season while recovering from open heart surgery. The Wizards added guard Fenny Falmagne from the Dakota Wizards on August 23, 2008 that later was waived by the team after knee injury.

The Wizards opened the season on October 29 with a loss against [[2008–09 New Jersey Nets season|New Jersey]], and dropped fifteen of their first nineteen games. Head coach [[Eddie Jordan (basketball)|Eddie Jordan]] was fired on November 24 after a 1–10 start, and was replaced by interim coach [[Ed Tapscott]]. On December 10, Washington acquired guards [[Javaris Crittenton]] and [[Mike James (basketball, born 1975)|Mike James]] in a three-team deal that sent Antonio Daniels to [[New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans]]. The team waived guard [[Dee Brown (basketball, born 1984)|Dee Brown]]. They won just 14 of their first 60 games and in the end tied a franchise worst record of 19–63.

One of the few high points of the season came on February 27 when recently inaugurated President Barack Obama attended a Wizards game against the Chicago Bulls, sitting in a northeast court-side seat. The Wizards produced their second-biggest victory margin of the season with a 113–90 win; Jamison paced the side with 27 points.

On April 2, the Wizards shut down the Cleveland Cavaliers, who came in with a record of 61–13, and ended Cleveland's franchise-best winning streak at 13.

[[Flip Saunders]] reached an agreement to become the new coach of the team in mid-April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/basketball/bal-sp.digest231apr23,0,3531161.column|title=Wizards confirm Saunders is new coach|website=Baltimoresun.com}}</ref> Despite having the second best chance at obtaining the number one overall pick in the 2009 draft, the Wizards were randomly chosen to pick fifth overall in the NBA Draft Lottery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&sid=aJjibIGSkj4Q&refer=home|title=Clippers Win NBA's Draft Lottery; Blake Griffin May Go First | website=Bloomberg.com | date=May 20, 2009}}</ref> This pick was later traded to the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]], along with Songaila, Thomas, and [[Oleksiy Pecherov]], in exchange for [[Randy Foye]] and [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4282279|title=Source: Foye, Miller head to Wiz|website=Sports.espn.go.com}}</ref> On May 21, 2009, Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld announced that the team has named [[Randy Wittman]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as assistant coaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realgm.com/src_wiretap_archives/59305/20090521/wizards_name_sam_cassell_assistant_coach/#|title=Wizards Name Sam Cassell Assistant Coach|website=Realgm.com}}</ref>

On December 24, 2009, it was revealed that Arenas had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at [[Capital One Arena|Verizon Center]] and had surrendered them to team security.

On February 26, 2010, the Wizards signed [[Shaun Livingston]] to a 10-day contract. With Gilbert Arenas suspended and Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison being traded, the Wizards finished the season at 26-56, posting an abysmal 9–23 record to finish the season.

They were behind most of game 6, but battled back to take the lead late in the game. However, Indiana closed out the series with a 93–80 win. [[Trevor Ariza]] would leave in the off-season.

====2014–15====
After the departure of [[Trevor Ariza]], the Wizards signed veteran small forward [[Paul Pierce]] to a two-year contract. Pierce's veteran leadership proved to be a major factor on and off the court in the team's improvement. On November 12, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 107–103, extending their record to 6–2 for the first time since the 1975–76 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wall's 27 points lead Wizards over Pistons 107-103|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141112/DETWAS/gameinfo.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=November 13, 2014|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> The following game three days later, the Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic 98-93 as they won their third straight and moved to 7–2, their best start since opening 7–1 during the 1974–75 season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Valentine|first=Harvey|title=Bench key as Wizards defeat Magic 98-93|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141115/ORLWAS/gameinfo.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=November 15, 2014|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> With a 104–96 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 12, the Wizards moved to an 11–2 record at home to start the season for the first time in franchise history.<ref>{{cite news|last=White|first=Joseph|title=Wall, Wizards end Clippers' 9-game streak, 104-96|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20141212/LACWAS/gameinfo.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=December 13, 2014|accessdate=October 30, 2018}}</ref> They would struggle throughout the later months of the season but the Washington Wizards would finish the season with a 46–36 record, their best record since the 1978–1979 season. They played the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and won in four games, marking their first sweep in franchise history. Following the victory over Toronto, the Wizards next had to play the top seeded Atlanta Hawks. The Wizards managed to take the first game in the series, but suffered the loss of Wall due to a fractured wrist. Although small forward Paul Pierce made several big shots throughout the series, the loss of Wall proved too much, and Atlanta took the series in six games.

====2015–16====
However, the 2015–16 season was much less successful. The Wizards finished 10th in the Eastern Conference with a 41-41 record, and missed the playoffs. On April 13, 2016 the Wizards, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012–13, fired head coach Randy Wittman.<ref>{{cite news|title=WIZARDS PART WAYS WITH WITTMAN|url=https://wizardstoday.monumentalsportsnetwork.com/2016/04/14/wizards-part-ways-with-wittman|work=WizardsToday.MonumentalSportsNetwork.com|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards fire coach Randy Wittman after team misses playoffs|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15200611/wizards-fire-coach-randy-wittman-team-misses-playoffs|publisher=ESPN|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>

====2016–17====
The Wizards started off the 2016–17 season with a 2–8 record. However, they rebounded to touch the second seed, before a slump brought them down to the fourth seed, finishing 49–33, behind the 51–31 Toronto Raptors at third, the 51–31 Cleveland Cavaliers at second, and the 53–29 Boston Celtics in first place. The Wizards won their division title for the first time since the 1978–79 season, also clinching home-court advantage for the first time since the 1978–79 season, and the team had their best record since the 1978–79 season. The Wizards played the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs, defeating them in six games behind a 42-point game six performance from Wall and 31 from Beal; before losing to the Boston Celtics in a seven-game series.

====2018–19====
In the off-season, the Wizards picked up [[Thomas Bryant (basketball)|Thomas Bryant]] off waivers and Troy Brown in the draft with the 15th pick in the [[2018 NBA Draft]]. Despite Bryant becoming a valuable asset and [[Bradley Beal]] having a career season, the season would end up being an underwhelming one full of turmoil and on court troubles. The Wizards also went through injuries, including [[Dwight Howard]] playing 9 games before missing the rest of the season due to back problems and losing [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]] who underwent a season-ending surgery on his left Achilles which he injured while recovering from a previous injury, while trading [[Kelly Oubre Jr.]], [[Otto Porter Jr.]], and [[Markieff Morris]] at the same time.

===2020–present: Tommy Sheppard and Bradley Beal and Russell Westbrook era===

==Team name, logos and uniforms==
[[File:Washington Wizards G-Wiz.jpg|thumb|Washington Wizards G-Wiz, current team mascot]]
After moving from Chicago in 1963, the then-Baltimore Bullets used red and navy colors as part of the team's logos and uniforms. In 1969, the club changed the colors to blue and orange. The red, white and blue colors returned as part of the franchise's iconic uniforms beginning with the [[1973–74 NBA season|1973–74 season]], coinciding with the team's move to [[Landover, Maryland]] to become the Capital Bullets. Those uniforms also featured large horizontal stripes on the chest of the jerseys, and three stars on the side panels of the shorts. The uniforms were kept when they changed their location identifier a year later to the Washington Bullets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Going Retro: Washington Wizards|url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_wizards.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=August 22, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>

The Bullets kept the "Stars and Stripes" uniform until 1987, although they made a minor tweak prior to the 1985–86 season with additional thin stripes, the "Bullets" logo on the right leg, and thin shorts stripes replacing the three stars. In 1987, the Bullets changed their logo and uniforms, going with red uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. With the exception of a switch to block lettering and numbers before the 1990–91 season (switching over from the Serpentine font used for both elements, with the player name on back rendered in lower case as well), the Bullets kept these uniforms until 1997.

In 1997, the then-team owner [[Abe Pollin]] decided to change the club's nickname from '''Bullets''' to '''Wizards'''. The reasoning behind the name change was because Pollin did not want the team's name to continue to be associated with any violent connotations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind The Name – Wizards|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/behind_the_name.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=August 22, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> The name change also included new logos, colors and uniforms, coinciding with the team's move to the new [[MCI Center]]. The new team's colors were blue, bronze and black. The primary logo depicted a wizard conjuring a basketball with a quarter moon. In 2007, the Wizards made minor modifications on their team jerseys and logos. To accommodate the gold–black alternate jerseys they introduced the previous season along with the design change on the Verizon Center floor, they changed their secondary team colors from [[bronze (color)|bronze]] to metallic gold, and the player's name on the back of the jersey was changed from white/blue with bronze trim to gold (blue on home uniforms) with a change in lettering; the road uniform name lettering changed back to white with gold trim before the 2010–11 season.

On May 10, 2011, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms, and logo. David Safren, Pat Sullivan, and Michael Glazer were the product designers for the new jerseys which include the [[Washington Monument]] as an alternate logo. The team of product designers was led by Jessie Caples, who made most of the design decisions. James Pinder was also an essential part of the team, as he helped to engineer the jerseys to meet the players' standards. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors, which are the colors of the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]]. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years. Leonsis said the throwback to the old Bullets' uniforms was intentional; the only difference between those uniforms and the current ones is the team name on the jerseys. The colors were also used by Leonsis' other franchises, the Capitals and the Mystics, who adopted to those colors in 2007 and 2011, respectively.<ref name="NewWizardsLogosandUnis" />

On July 23, 2014, the Wizards unveiled a new alternate uniform. The uniform is similar to the club's road set, with the navy and red colors switched, so that navy is the predominant color instead of red.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards to Wear Alternate Uniforms for 2014-15 Season|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/wizards-wear-alternate-uniforms-2014-15-season|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|date=July 23, 2014|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref>

On April 15, 2015, the Wizards unveiled a new primary logo. The new logo features the Washington Monument ball logo set in a [[roundel]], with the striping pattern from the team's uniforms, three stars (each representing Washington, D.C., [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]], similar to that of the NHL's Capitals), and the team's wordmarks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards Unveil New Primary Logo|url=http://www.nba.com/wizards/wizards-unveil-new-primary-logo|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Lang|title=WASHINGTON WIZARDS UNVEIL NEW LOGO|url=http://allball.blogs.nba.com/2015/04/15/washington-wizards-unveil-new-logo/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> The team also said it would immediately discontinue the use of the wizard/partial moon logo, which had been used since 1997.

On September 30, 2015, the Wizards unveiled a new alternate uniform. Called the "Baltimore Pride" uniform, the uniform was intended to be worn for six select games during the Wizards' [[2015–16 Washington Wizards season|2015–16 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards to Wear Baltimore Pride Jerseys this Season|url=http://wizardstoday.monumentalnetwork.com/2015/09/30/wizards-to-wear-baltimore-pride-jerseys-this-season|publisher=Monumental Network|date=September 30, 2015|accessdate=November 30, 2015}}</ref>

On September 8, 2016, the Wizards released a second white uniform to honor the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The side stripes pay homage to the American flag.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards unveil new stars and stripes uniform to honor military|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/washington-wizards/wizards-unveil-new-stars-and-stripes-uniform-honor-military|publisher=NBC Sports|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

The Wizards kept their existing uniforms (minus the two alternate uniforms) when [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over as uniform supplier in 2017. Along with the white "Association", red "Icon" and navy "Statement" uniforms, a "City" uniform was also released as part of the collection. The 2017–18 "City" uniform featured a white base, "The District of Columbia" wordmark in navy and numbers in white. The uniform paid tribute to the [[Washington Monument]].<ref>{{cite news|title=WIZARDS, NIKE UNVEIL CITY EDITION UNIFORM|url=https://www.nba.com/wizards/wizards-nike-unveil-city-edition-uniform|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|date=December 27, 2017|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref> The "City" uniform for 2018–19 was similar to the previous set, but with a black base, white letters and orange trim. The uniform paid homage to the [[National Mall]] at night.<ref>{{cite news|title=2018–19 Wizards "City" uniform|url=https://www.nba.com/wizards/district|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref> A red version of the 2017–18 "City" uniform served as the team's "Earned" uniform, which was a reward for making the 2018 playoffs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards release new red alternate jerseys, their fifth uniform|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/wizards/wizards-release-new-red-alternate-jerseys-their-fifth-uniform|author=Chase Hughes|publisher=NBC Sports Washington|website=NBCSports.com|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref>

Prior to the 2019–20 season, the navy "Statement" uniform received a minor tweak as the city name was replaced with "The District of Columbia" wordmark previously used on the team's "City" uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Unveiling the Wizards' 2019-20 Statement Edition Jersey|url=https://www.nba.com/wizards/wizards-statement-jersey-2019-20-unveil|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref>

For the Wizards' 2019–20 "City" uniform, they brought back the white alternate uniform design worn in the 2016–17 season, but with the "dc" alternate logo in front and red numbers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wizards' 2019-20 City Edition Jersey|url=https://www.nba.com/wizards/cityedition|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=WashingtonWizards.com|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref> The same design was carried over to the 2020–21 "City" uniform, but with a grey base.

===Retained draft rights===
The Wizards hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm|title=NBA Salary Cap FAQ – 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement|quote=If the player is already under contract to, or signs a contract with a non-NBA team, the team retains the player's draft rights for one year after the player's obligation to the non-NBA team ends.
