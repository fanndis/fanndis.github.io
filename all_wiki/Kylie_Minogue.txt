'''Kylie Ann Minogue''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|OBE|sep=,}} ({{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|n|oʊ|ɡ}}; born 28 May 1968), often [[Mononymous person|known simply]] as '''Kylie''', is an Australian-British singer, songwriter, actress, record producer and television judge. Having sold 70&nbsp;million records worldwide, Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time and has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]" and a style icon. [[List of awards and nominations received by Kylie Minogue|Her accolades]] include a [[Grammy Award]], three [[Brit Awards]] and 17 [[ARIA Music Awards]].

Born and raised in [[Melbourne]], Minogue achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', playing tomboy mechanic [[Charlene Robinson]]. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] and released by [[Pete Waterman Entertainment|PWL]]. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]", "[[The Loco-Motion]]", "[[Hand on Your Heart]]", and "[[Better the Devil You Know]]". Taking more creative control over her music, in 1993, Minogue signed with [[Deconstruction Records]], where she released ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'' (1994) and ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997), both of which received positive reviews, and the latter being described as her most personal and best work. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'', which was preceded by lead single "[[Spinning Around]]". The follow-up, ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001) was an international breakthrough for Minogue and became her best-selling album to date. Its lead single, "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.

Minogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her next albums, which produced successful singles such as "[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]", "[[2 Hearts (Kylie Minogue song)|2 Hearts]]" and "[[All the Lovers]]". With her 2020 album release ''[[Disco (Kylie Minogue album)|Disco]]'', she became the first female artist to have a chart-topping album in the UK for five consecutive decades. Minogue made her film debut in ''[[The Delinquents (1989 film)|The Delinquents]]'' (1989) and portrayed [[Cammy]] in ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' (1994). She has also appeared in the films ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), ''[[Jack & Diane (film)|Jack & Diane]]'' and ''[[Holy Motors]]'' (2012). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of ''[[The Voice UK (series 3)|The Voice UK]]'' and ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''. Her other ventures include product endorsements, children's books, fashion, and charitable work.

Minogue was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[2008 New Year Honours]] for services to Music.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58557 |date=29 December 2007 |page=11 |supp=y}}</ref> She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2005, while Minogue was on her [[Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour]], she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After treatment, she resumed the tour under the title [[Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour]], which critics viewed as a "triumph". Minogue was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Health Science]] (D.H.Sc.) degree by [[Anglia Ruskin University]] for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. On the 25th anniversary of the [[ARIA Music Awards]] in 2011, she was inducted by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].

Minogue's signing with [[Deconstruction Records]] in 1993 marked a new phase in her career.<ref name=cankylie/> Her fifth album, ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'', was released in September 1994 and was a departure from her previous efforts as it "no longer featured the Stock-Aitken-Waterman production gloss", with critics praising Minogue's vocals and the album production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/thesound/a222204/kylie-revisited-5-kylie-minogue.html |title=Kylie: Revisited #5: 'Kylie Minogue' |publisher=Digital Spy|date=29 May 2010 |accessdate=2 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603144735/https://www.digitalspy.com/music/thesound/a222204/kylie-revisited-5-kylie-minogue.html|archive-date=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=True |first=Chris |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kylie-minogue-r220635 |title=Kylie Minogue – Kylie Minogue |website=AllMusic |accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> It was produced by dance music producers the [[Brothers In Rhythm]], namely [[Dave Seaman]] and [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]], who had previously produced "[[Finer Feelings]]", her last single with [[PWL]].

During this period, Minogue made a guest appearance as herself in an episode of the comedy ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''. Director [[Steven E. de Souza]] saw Minogue's cover photo in Australia's ''[[Who (magazine)|Who Magazine]]'' as one of "The 30 Most Beautiful People in the World" and offered her a role opposite [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] in the film ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]''.<ref name="Smith152">{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=152}}</ref> The film was a moderate success, earning US$70&nbsp;million in the US,<ref name="Smith152" /> but received poor reviews, with ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Richard Harrington calling Minogue "the worst actress in the English-speaking world".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/streetfighterpg13harrington_a0ad15.htm|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Street Fighter|date=24 December 1994|first=Richard|last=Harrington|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> She had a minor role in the 1996 film ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' starring [[Pauly Shore]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/biodomepg13hinson_c0422f.htm|newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Bio Dome|date=12 January 1996|first=Hal|last=Hinson|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> She also appeared in the 1995 short film ''[[Hayride to Hell]]'' and in the 1997 film ''Diana & Me''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema|first1=Errol|last1=Vieth|first2=Albert|last2=Moran|page=198|date=2005}}</ref> In 1995, Minogue collaborated with Australian artist [[Nick Cave]] for the song "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]". Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing "Better the Devil You Know", saying it contained "one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics".<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 99</ref> The music video for their song was inspired by [[John Everett Millais]]'s painting ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1851–1852), and showed Minogue as the murdered woman, floating in a pond as a serpent swam over her body. The single received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and reached number two in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds and Kylie Minogue: Where The Wild Roses Grow (song)|publisher=Media Jungen|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Nick+Cave+%26+The+Bad+Seeds+%2B+Kylie+Minogue&titel=Where+The+Wild+Roses+Grow&cat=s|accessdate=26 July 2009}}</ref> The song won [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA Awards]] for "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Release".<ref>{{cite web|title=1996: 10th Annual ARIA Awards|url=http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1996|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=6 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235646/http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history-by-year.php?year=1995|archivedate=26 September 2007}}</ref> Following concert appearances with Cave, Minogue recited the lyrics to "I Should Be So Lucky" as poetry in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref name="lalala112">Baker and Minogue, p. 112</ref>

By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with French photographer [[Stéphane Sednaoui]], who encouraged her to develop her creativity.<ref>Baker and Minogue, pp. 107–112</ref> Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of "[[geisha]] and [[manga]] superheroine" for the photographs taken for Minogue's sixth album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' and the video for "[[German Bold Italic]]", Minogue's collaboration with [[Towa Tei]].<ref>Baker and Minogue, pp. 108–109</ref> She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as [[Shirley Manson]] and [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], [[Björk]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[U2]], and Japanese pop musicians such as [[Pizzicato Five]] and Towa Tei.<ref name=iprincess>Baker and Minogue, p. 108</ref> The album featured collaborations with musicians including [[James Dean Bradfield]] and [[Sean Moore (musician)|Sean Moore]] of the [[Manic Street Preachers]]. ''Impossible Princess'' garnered some negative reviews upon its release in 1997,<ref name="slant"/> but would be praised as Minogue's most personal and best work in retrospective reviews. In 2003, ''Slant Magazine'''s Sal Cinquemani called it a "deeply personal effort" and "Minogue’s best album to date",<ref name="slant"/> while Evan Sawdey, from ''[[PopMatters]]'', described ''Impossible Princess'' as "one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created" in a 2008 review.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Sawdey, Evan|url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/kylie-minogue-x/|title=Kylie Minogue: X|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|date=31 March 2008|access-date=15 September 2016}}</ref> Mostly a dance album, Minogue countered suggestions that she was trying to become an [[independent music|indie artist]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Petridis|first=Alex|title=Kylie Chameleon|work=Mixmag (UK)|date=October 1997|url=http://www.kylie.co.uk/press/00000002.shtml|accessdate=20 January 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003157/http://www.kylie.co.uk/press/00000002.shtml|archivedate=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Acknowledging that she had attempted to escape the perceptions of her that had developed during her early career, Minogue commented that she was ready to "forget the painful criticism" and "accept the past, embrace it, use it".<ref name="lalala112" /> The music video for "[[Did It Again (Kylie Minogue song)|Did It Again]]" paid homage to her earlier incarnations.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 113</ref> Retitled ''Kylie Minogue'' in the UK following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], it became the lowest-selling album of her career.

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not "paid her dues" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on ''Neighbours''.<ref name="Shuker164" /> Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, "If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go."<ref name="ThinWhiteDame" />

In 1993, [[Baz Luhrmann]] introduced Minogue to photographer [[Bert Stern]], notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 50</ref> Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' to the more traditionally sophisticated ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]] has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream [[popular culture|pop culture]] in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 165</ref>

By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected.<ref name="Copley">Copley, p. 128</ref> Her progression from the wholesome "[[girl next door]]" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans.<ref name="Copley" /> Her "Spinning Around" video led to some media outlets referring to her as "SexKylie", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos.<ref name="Copley" /> In September 2002, she was ranked 27 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Sexiest Artists list.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-tops-the-list-as-vh1-counts-down-musics-100-sexiest-artists-in-five-hour-five-night-special-premiering-september-23-27-at-1000-pm-etpt-75840192.html|title=Madonna Tops the List as VH1 Counts Down Music's '100 Sexiest Artists'|agency=PR Newswire|date=18 September 2002|accessdate=11 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606015929/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-tops-the-list-as-vh1-counts-down-musics-100-sexiest-artists-in-five-hour-five-night-special-premiering-september-23-27-at-1000-pm-etpt-75840192.html|archivedate=6 June 2011}}</ref> She was also named one of the 100 Hottest Women of All-Time by ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Hottest Women of All-Time|url=https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/g19547274/hottest-women-all-time/?slide=38|work=[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]|accessdate=15 August 2019|date=22 November 2013|archive-date=15 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815142627/https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/g19547274/hottest-women-all-time/?slide=38|url-status=live}}</ref> William Baker described her status as a [[sex symbol]]<ref>{{Cite news|author=Lottie Anderson|title=Sing out sister|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/oct/31/artsfeatures.popandrock|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 October 2002|accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Baker|first=William|author2=Minogue, Kylie|title=Kylie: La La La|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2002|page=211|isbn=978-0-340-73440-7|title-link=Kylie: La La La}}</ref> as a "double edged sword", observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.

Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]] and commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment soon after.<ref name="CNNtreatment" /> After the surgery, the disease "had no recurrence".<ref name=chemo/> On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital.

Minogue was acknowledged for the impact she made by publicly discussing her cancer diagnosis and treatment.

===Philanthropy===
Minogue has helped fundraise on many occasions. In 1989, she participated in recording "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" under the name [[Band Aid II]] to help raise money. In early 2010, Minogue along with many other artists (under the name Helping Haiti) recorded a cover version of "[[Everybody Hurts]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/753376/haiti-aid-song-to-be-rems-everybody-hurts|title="X Factor Simon Cowell Earthquake Charity Single To Be REM's Everybody Hurts, Sky Sources Say".|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> The single was a fundraiser to help after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

In 2008, Minogue pledged her support for a campaign to raise money for abused children, to be donated to the British charities ChildLine and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. According to the source, around $93&nbsp;million was raised.<ref name="charity1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyscoop.com/kylie-minogue/kylie-minogue-launches-charity-drive-for-children.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203221114/http://www.hollyscoop.com/kylie-minogue/kylie-minogue-launches-charity-drive-for-children.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 December 2013|title=Kylie Minogue Launches Charity Drive For Children|work=Hollyscoop|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: "Finding the courage to tell someone about being abused is one of the most difficult decisions a child will ever have to make."<ref name="charity1" /> In 2010 and 2012, she was involved in supporting the [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] Support Gala, which was held by the American Foundation for Aids Research (Amfar).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18059332|title=Kylie Minogue supports Cannes Aids gal|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014|date=14 May 2012}}</ref>

Since Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis in 2005, she has been a sponsor and ambassador for the cause. In May 2010, she held a breast cancer campaign for the first time. She later spoke about the cause saying "It means so much to me to be part of this year's campaign for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer. I wholeheartedly support their efforts to raise funds for the vital work undertaken by Breakthrough Breast Cancer."<ref name="fundraiser">{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG7532553/Kylie-Minogue-leads-stars-in-breast-cancer-charity-campaign.html|title=Kylie Minogue leads stars in breast cancer charity campaign – Telegraph|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=18 December 2012|location=London|date=28 March 2010}}</ref> For the cause, she "posed in a silk sheet emblazoned with the distinctive target logo of Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" for photographer [[Mario Testino]].<ref name="fundraiser" /> In April 2014, Minogue had launched a new campaign entitled One Note Against Cancer, which is a charity organisation to help cancer research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onenoteagainstcancer.com/en|title=OneNoteAgainstCancer|work=One Note Against Cancer|date=15 April 2014|accessdate=15 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417135150/http://www.onenoteagainstcancer.com/en|archivedate=17 April 2014}}</ref>
