== Energy policy positions ==

=== Carbon capture and storage ===
The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies|Center for Strategic & International Studies]] (CSIS) held a wide-ranging interview of Good on June 21, 2018; among the topics were [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture and sequestration]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/13222-duke-energy-ceo-sees-carbon-sequestration-worth-pursuing/|title=Duke Energy CEO sees carbon sequestration worth pursuing|last=Anderson|first=Hil|date=2018-06-22|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Carbon capture and storage technology can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions made from a fossil fuels electricity generation plant, thus releasing much less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccsassociation.org/what-is-ccs/|title=What is CCS? – The Carbon Capture & Storage Association (CCSA)|website=www.ccsassociation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> Good told CSIS that the carbon capture and sequestration process was not quite ready for general use, even though it has potential for keeping fossil fuels in the power-generation mix. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', "On paper, a gas or coal plant that does not release carbon dioxide into the air would be a logical asset to fill in any lags in purely green power production, but Good indicated that while Duke was still collaborating on various research projects involving carbon capture, the big breakthroughs necessary to launch a commercially viable carbon-capture plant were not yet in sight."<ref name=":0" />
