'''Sir Clarence Henry Kennett Marten''' [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] (28 October 1872 – 11 December 1948) was the [[Provost of Eton]] and the private tutor of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].

==Biography==
Henry Marten was born with his twin sister Isabel in [[Kensington]], [[London]]. He was the younger son of Sir [[Alfred Marten]] and his wife Patricia, and was the brother of Sir Alfred Barrington Marten, Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court from 1926-30. Marten entered [[Eton College]], and from there matriculated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1891. In 1895, he graduated with a first class degree in modern history, and accepted an offer from [[Edmond Warre]] to return to Eton to teach history.<ref name=odnb/>

He was a founder member of the [[Historical Association]] in 1906. In 1912, he published ''The Groundwork of British History'' with his co-author, George Townsend Warner, which became "one of the most used school textbooks of the first half of the twentieth century".<ref name=odnb>[[Robert Birley|Birley, Sir Robert]], revised by Tim Card, (2004).

In 1925, Marten narrowly missed becoming [[Master of Magdalene College]], in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], when he was recommended to the Hereditary [[Visitor]] of Magdalene, [[Lord Braybrooke]] as a possible candidate, but the College Fellows opposed the appointment, preferring another candidate, [[Arthur Stanley Ramsey|A. S. Ramsey]]. Braybrooke chose to appoint neither, and instead [[Allen Beville Ramsay|A. B. Ramsay]], who was Lower Master at Eton, got the job. Marten was appointed to Ramsay's vacated post at Eton. Further promotions followed, to Vice-Provost in 1929, and [[List of Provosts of Eton College|Provost]] in 1945.<ref name=odnb/>
 
In 1938, Marten began instructing [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II)]] in constitutional history.<ref name=odnb/><ref>[[Marion Crawford|Crawford, Marion]] (1950).
