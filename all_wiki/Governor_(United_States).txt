{{update|date=May 2020}}{{Politics of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], a '''governor''' serves as the [[chief executive officer]] and [[commander-in-chief]] in each of the fifty [[U.S. state|states]] and in the five permanently inhabited [[Territories of the United States|territories]], functioning as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] therein.{{refn|group=nb|The [[federal district]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] has been led by [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|a chief executive officer of varying titles]], including governor. The current governor-equivalent of D.C. is the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]].}} As such, governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the operation of the state [[Executive (government)|executive branch]]. As state leaders, governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, among them [[State executive order|executive orders]], executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. Governors carry out their management and leadership responsibilities and objectives with the support and assistance of department and agency heads, many of whom they are empowered to appoint. A majority of governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well, in most cases from a list of names submitted by a nominations committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governors' Powers and Authority|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/management-resources/governors-powers-and-authority.html|website=Nga.org|publisher=[[National Governors Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2011}}</ref>

All but five states ([[Arizona]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], and [[Wyoming]]) have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the gubernatorial office (the powers and duties but not the office, in [[Massachusetts]] and [[West Virginia]]), if vacated by the removal from office, death, or resignation of the previous governor. Lieutenant governors also serve as unofficial acting state governors in case the incumbent governors are unable to fulfill their duties, and they often serve as presiding officers of the upper houses of state legislatures. But in such cases, they cannot participate in political debates, and they have no vote whenever these houses are not equally divided.

==Role and powers==
States are semi-sovereign republics under the [[federal government]] of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the [[United States Constitution]], such as regulating intrastate commerce, holding [[Elections in the United States|elections]], creating [[Local government in the United States|local governments]], and ratifying [[Constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendments]]. Each state has its own [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], grounded in [[Republicanism in the United States|republican principles]], and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/faq/faqtoc.aspx?subject=1 | title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Minnesota Legislature | publisher=[[Minnesota State Legislature]]}}</ref> Also, due to the shared [[sovereignty]] between each state and the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]], [[Americans]] are [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] of both the [[federal republic]] and of the state in which they [[Domicile (law)|reside]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erler|first1=Edward|title=Essays on Amendment XIV: Citizenship|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/14/essays/167/citizenship|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>

The governor heads the government's executive branch in each state or territory and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, such as that of [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] (when not federalized) and of that state's respective [[State defense force|defense force]] (which is not subject to federalization). In many states and territories the governor also has partial or absolute power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or [[pardon]] a [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. All U.S. governors serve four-year terms except those in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]], who serve two-year terms.

In all states, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and in some cases by other elected executive officials. In the five extant U.S. territories, all governors are now directly elected as well, though in the past many territorial governors were historically appointed by the President of the United States. Governors can [[veto]] state bills, and in all but seven states they have the power of the [[line-item veto]] on appropriations bills (a power the President does not have). In some cases legislatures can override a gubernatorial veto by a two-thirds vote, in others by three-fifths.

In [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]], the governor's veto can be overridden by a [[majority|simple majority]] vote, making it virtually useless.  In [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas]], a gubernatorial veto may be overridden by an [[absolute majority]]. The [[governor of North Carolina]] had no veto power until a 1996 referendum. In 47 of the 50 states, whenever there is a vacancy of one of the state's [[U.S. Senate]] seats, that state's governor has the power to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until a [[special election]] is held; the governors of [[Oregon]], [[Alaska]], and [[Wisconsin]] do not have this power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Vacancies.pdf|format=PDF|title=CRS Report for Congress|date=January 22, 2003|website=Senate.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>

A state governor may give an annual [[State of the State address]] in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being "from time to time") on the state or condition of the state. Governors of states may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations or attending the [[state fair]]. The governor may also have an [[official residence]] (see [[List of governors' mansions in the United States|Governor's Mansion]]).

In a ranking of the power of the governorship in all 50 states, University of North Carolina political scientist Thad Beyle makes the distinction between "personal powers" of governors, which are factors that vary from person to person, season to season - and the "institutional powers" that are set in place by law. Examples of measurable personal factors are how large a governor's margin of victory was on election day, and where he or she stands in public opinion polls. Whether a governor has strong budget controls, appointment authority, and [[veto power]]s are examples of institutional powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-02/news/0109020193_1_governors-veto-power |title=Governors' powers ranked |first=Stevenson |last=Swanson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 2, 2001 |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}
In colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways, depending on how the colony was organized.  In the [[crown colony|crown colonies]] of Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power, or his designees; in British colonies, the [[Board of Trade]] was often the primary decision maker.  Colonies based on a corporate charter, such as the [[Connecticut Colony]] and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.  In [[Proprietary colony|proprietary colonies]], such as the [[Province of Carolina]] before it became a crown colony (and was divided into [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South]]), governors were chosen by the [[Lords Proprietor]] who controlled the colony.  In the early years of the [[American Revolutionary War]], eleven of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and proprietary governors. The other two colonies ([[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]] was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island, Governor [[Joseph Wanton]] was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort.

Before achieving statehood, many of the 50 states were [[Territories of the United States|territories]] or parts of territories. Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were appointed by the [[President of the United States|president]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] rather than elected by the resident population.  Election of territorial governors began in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1948.  The last appointed territorial governor, [[Hyrum Rex Lee]] in [[American Samoa]], left office in 1978.

For each term, governors serve four years in office. The exceptions are [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] where tenures are two years long.

The longest-serving current governor is [[Gary Herbert]] of [[Utah]], who was elected to his second full term in 2016, having ascended to the governorship in 2009 after [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman, Jr.]], resigned after being appointed [[United States Ambassador to China|Ambassador to China]]. He has been serving for approximately 11 years.

The longest-serving governor of all time was [[Terry Branstad]] of [[Iowa]], who was elected to his sixth (non-consecutive) term in [[2014 Iowa gubernatorial election|2014]]. Governor Branstad resigned on May 24, 2017 to become the United States Ambassador to China. He held the title of [[Governor of Iowa]] for 22 years. On December 14, 2015, he became the longest-serving governor in US history, breaking the record held by [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], who served 21 years from 1777 to 1795 and from 1801 to 1804. 

The shortest-serving governor of all time was [[Hiram Bingham III]] of [[Connecticut]], who served for one day between January 7 and January 8, 1925, following the suicide of [[Frank B. Brandegee|Frank Bosworth Brandegee]].

In the majority of states, [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|term limits]] cap a governor's tenure.

===Age===
The oldest current governor is [[Kay Ivey]] of [[Alabama]], born on {{birth date and age|1944|10|15}}.  The youngest current state governor is [[Ron DeSantis]] of [[Florida]] who was born on {{birth date and age|1978|9|14}}.  Among territorial governors, [[Ralph Torres]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] is youngest, born on {{birth date and age|1979|8|6}}.

The youngest person to ever serve as a governor in the United States was [[Stevens T. Mason]] of the [[Michigan Territory]], elected in 1835 having just turned 24. Mason would later become the first governor of the state of [[Michigan]] when it was admitted to the Union in January 1837, when he was 25. Mason was re-elected in November 1837, then age 26.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-17451_18670_18793-52864--,00.html|title="Stevens Thomson Mason - Background Reading"|website=Michigan.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>

The second youngest governor ever elected was [[J. Neely Johnson]] of [[California]], when he was elected in 1855 at the age of 30, and the third youngest governor was [[Harold Stassen]] of [[Minnesota]], when he was elected in 1938 at age 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/136stassen.htm|title=LibGuides: Harold E. Stassen:|first=MNHS Reference|last=Staff|website=Mnhs.org|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> When future President [[Bill Clinton]] was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978 at age 32, he became the youngest governor since Stassen.

In 35 states, the minimum age requirement of the governor is 30, though in some it is 25 (7), 21 (1), or 18 (5). Oklahoma is the only state with an older age, 31. Some states require the governor to be a qualified elector/voter, implying a minimum age of 18. Vermont requires candidates to be residents of the state for at least four years as of Election Day, which would preclude small children from running, but has no other implicit or explicit age limit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/|title=Candidates|website=Vermont Secretary of State|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Kansas has no explicit or implicit age or residency requirements whatsoever.

===Gender===
{{Main|List of female state governors in the United States}}
[[File:United States Governor gender map.svg|thumb|State and territorial governors, colored as male (blue) and female (pink).]]
As of October 2020, there are 41 male state governors and 9 female governors: [[Kate Brown]] of [[Oregon]], [[Kay Ivey]] of [[Alabama]], [[Kim Reynolds]] of [[Iowa]], [[Laura Kelly]] of [[Kansas]], [[Janet Mills]] of [[Maine]], [[Gretchen Whitmer]] of [[Michigan]], [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] of [[New Mexico]], [[Gina Raimondo]] of [[Rhode Island]], and [[Kristi Noem]] of [[South Dakota]]. Of those, Ivey, Noem, and Reynolds are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], while Brown, Kelly, Mills, Whitmer, Grisham, and Raimondo are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].

Four territorial governors are male; one territorial governor and the mayor of Washington, D.C. are female.

Thirty-eight women have been or are currently serving as the governor, including two in an acting capacity.

The first female governor was [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] of [[Wyoming]] (widow of the late Wyoming Governor [[William B. Ross]]) who was elected on November 4, 1924 and sworn in on January 5, 1925 succeeding [[Frank Lucas (Wyoming politician)|Frank Lucas]]. Also elected on November 4, 1924 was [[Miriam A. Ferguson]] of [[Texas]] (wife of former Texas Governor [[James E. Ferguson]]), succeeding  [[Pat Morris Neff]] on January 21, 1925. The first female governor elected without being the wife or widow of a past state governor was [[Ella T. Grasso]] of [[Connecticut]], elected in 1974 and sworn in on January 8, 1975.

[[Connecticut]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] are the only three states to have elected female governors from both major parties. [[New Hampshire]] has also had female governors from two parties, but Republican [[Vesta M. Roy]] served only in the acting capacity for a short time. Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.  [[Washington (state)|Washington]] was the first state to have both a female governor and female U.S. Senators serving at the same time ([[Christine Gregoire]]; [[Patty Murray]]; [[Maria Cantwell]], respectively). [[New Hampshire]] was the first and currently only state to have a female governor and entirely female Congressional delegation serving at the same time.

Nine women have been serving as chief executive of their states since January 5, 2019, when [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[South Dakota]]. This ties the record previously set on two occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]]; and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]].

===LGBT status===
There are currently two governors who identify as [[LGBT]]: [[Jared Polis]] of Colorado, who identifies as gay, and [[Kate Brown]] of Oregon, who identifies as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/style/jared-polis-gay-governor.html|title=Colorado’s Got a Gay Governor.

===Race and ethnicity===
[[File:Ethnic minority governors.svg|thumb|Ethnic minority governors]]
{{main|List of minority governors and lieutenant governors in the United States}}

Ethnic minorities as [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|defined by the United States Census]] currently constitute 38.9% of the total population of the U.S. as of 2018.<ref name=acs17>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=united%20states&g=0100000US&hidePreview=false&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&vintage=2018&cid=DP05_0001E|title=ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates|date=December 2019|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]] |access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  There are currently 46 state governors who are non-Hispanic whites of [[European American]] background. There are 4 minority governors: [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] of [[New Mexico]], who is of Hispanic descent; [[Chris Sununu]] of [[New Hampshire]], who is of Lebanese, Palestinian, Latin American, Irish and British descent; [[David Ige]] of [[Hawaii]], who is of Ryukyuan descent; and [[Kevin Stitt]] of [[Oklahoma]], who is a member of the [[Cherokee Nation]]. Sununu and Stitt are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] while Grisham and Ige are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].

Among the five U.S. territories, one Hispanic ([[Wanda Vázquez]] of [[Puerto Rico]]), one Black ([[Albert Bryan (politician)|Albert Bryan]] of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]), and three [[Pacific Islander American]]s ([[Lou Leon Guerrero]] of [[Guam]], [[Lolo Letalu Matalasi Moliga]] of [[American Samoa]], and [[Ralph Torres]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) currently serve as governor. African-American [[Muriel Bowser]] is the current [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]], an office equivalent to a governor.

In 1990, [[Douglas Wilder]] of [[Virginia]] became the first African-American governor of any state since the [[Reconstruction era]].

===Birthplace===
14 of the current state governors were born outside the state they are serving: [[Mike Dunleavy (politician)|Mike Dunleavy]] of Alaska (born in Pennsylvania), [[Doug Ducey]] of Arizona (born in Ohio), [[Ned Lamont]] of Connecticut (born in Washington, D.C.), [[J. B. Pritzker]] of Illinois (born in California), [[Laura Kelly]] of Kansas (born in New York), [[Larry Hogan]] of Maryland (born in Washington, D.C.), [[Charlie Baker (politician)|Charlie Baker]] of Massachusetts (born in New York), [[Tim Walz]] of Minnesota (born in Nebraska), [[Steve Sisolak]] of Nevada (born in Wisconsin), [[Phil Murphy]] of New Jersey (born in Massachusetts), [[Kevin Stitt]] of Oklahoma (born in Florida), [[Kate Brown]] of Oregon (born in Spain), and [[Mark Gordon (politician)|Mark Gordon]] of Wyoming (born in New York).

State constitutions have varying requirements for the length of citizenship and residency of the governor but unlike the President, state governors do not need to be [[natural-born citizen]]s. There is some ambiguity in some state constitutions if a governor must be a citizen or just a resident.

===Physical disability===
Two legally blind governors have served: [[Bob C. Riley]], who was acting governor of Arkansas for eleven days in January 1975, and [[David Paterson]], who was governor of New York from 2008 until 2010.

The current governor of Texas, [[Greg Abbott]], has been [[paraplegic]] since an accident in 1984; he has used a wheelchair ever since. Governor of New York [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was paraplegic; he later became the first wheelchair-using president. Governor of Alabama [[George Wallace]] was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot in 1972. He never walked again.

==Salary==
The average salary of a state governor in 2009 was $124,398. The highest salary currently being accepted is that of [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] at $225,000. The lowest salaries are those of Maine Governor [[Janet Mills]]  and of Puerto Rico [[Wanda Vázquez Garced]] at $70,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2013/06/25/governors-salaries-range-from-70000-to-187256|title=Governors’ Salaries Range From $70,000 to $187,256|website=Pewtrusts.org|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>

There have been several instances where the governor of a state has either refused their salary in its entirety or instead only taken $1.00 per year. Alabama Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]] refused his yearly salary of $119,950.00 until the state reached full employment. Michigan Governor [[Rick Snyder]] took a $1.00 yearly salary. Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] has returned his salary to the state during each year he has held office. During his tenure as [[Governor of California]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also did not accept his salary of $170,000.00 per year.
However, several governors instead have decided to take a reduction in their salary instead of refusing it entirely. New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] took a 5 percent reduction in his salary in 2015, and Kentucky Governor [[Steve Beshear]] reduced his salary by 10 percent during the same year.

Only seven states (Massachusetts,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cthrupayroll.mass.gov |title=Statewide Payroll |access-date=June 5, 2019}}</ref> California, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia) currently offer their governors a higher salary than the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. In many states, the governor is not the highest-paid state employee; most often, that distinction is held by the head [[College football|football]] or men's [[basketball]] coach at a major state university.

==Gubernatorial election timeline schedule==
All states except Louisiana hold gubernatorial elections on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The earliest possible date for the election is therefore November 2 (if that date falls on a Tuesday), and the latest possible date is November 8 (if November 1 falls on a Tuesday). Louisiana holds its gubernatorial primary on the third or fourth Saturday of October and the general election (commonly referred to as the runoff within the state) on the third Saturday of November,  but the general election is cancelled if one candidate wins the primary outright (see primary section below).
* '''Two states hold their gubernatorial elections every even numbered year'''. Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].
:New Hampshire and Vermont

The other 48 states hold gubernatorial elections every four years.
* '''Thirty-four states and three territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a midterm election year. Washington D.C. also holds their mayoral election during a midterm election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2002|2002]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2006|2006]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].

* '''Nine states and two territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a presidential election year.''' (although Puerto Rico and American Samoa do not hold an election for president). Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2004|2004]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2008|2008]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]].

* '''Three states hold their gubernatorial elections the year before a presidential election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2007|2007]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2011|2011]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2015|2015]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2019|2019]].

:New Jersey and Virginia

===Gubernatorial primaries===
All states except for California, Louisiana, and Washington hold primaries in which each political party holds a primary election, and the winner of the primary election moves on to compete in a general election. In California, Louisiana, and Washington, all the candidates run in a [[blanket primary]] against each other. Regardless of political party, the top two candidates move on to the general election. In Louisiana, the general election occurs between the top two candidates if no candidate obtains more than 50% of the votes cast, and is cancelled if one of the candidates receives more than 50%. In California and Washington, the top two vote getters proceed to the general election regardless of how many votes the top vote getter received in the primary, and California prohibits [[write-in]] candidates from competing in the general election.

==Term limits==
{{See|Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits}}
{{empty section|date=May 2017}}

==Relationship with lieutenant governor==
The type of relationship between the governor and the lieutenant governor greatly varies by state. In some states the governor and lieutenant governor are completely independent of each other, while in others the governor gets to choose (prior to the election) who would be his or her lieutenant governor.
* '''Five states [[List of current United States lieutenant governors#States which do not have lieutenant governors|do not have a lieutenant governor]]'''. In those states, a different [[State constitutional officer|constitutional officer]] assumes the office of the governor should there be a vacancy in the office. Those states are Arizona, Oregon and Wyoming where the Secretary of State is next in line, and Maine and New Hampshire, where the President of the Senate is next in line.
* '''Seventeen states have separate elections for the governor and the lieutenant governor''', which may lead to the governor and the lieutenant governor being from different parties. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.
* '''Two states have the State Senate appoint the lieutenant governor''', which may mean that the governor and the lieutenant governor may be from different parties. Those states are Tennessee and West Virginia.
* '''Eight states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket, but the governor does not get to choose his/her running mate'''. In those states, the primaries for governor and lieutenant governor are held separately, and the winners run together as a joint ticket in the general election. The governor and lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party, but not necessarily political allies. Those states are Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
* '''Eighteen states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket''' similar to the President and Vice President of the United States, where a candidate for governor selects a would-be lieutenant governor. Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, and Utah have gubernatorial candidates pick their running mates before the primaries, while in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Carolina, and South Dakota, the running mate is chosen after the primary. The latter system allows the nominee to potentially select a defeated primary competitor.
