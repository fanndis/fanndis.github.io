==Church and chapel==
===Church of England===
[[File:ChurchEnstone StKenelm grotesque.JPG|thumb|Grotesque on the exterior of St Kenelm's parish church]]
The earliest parts of the [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Kenelm|Saint Kenelm]] are [[Norman architecture|Norman]], but it has been rebuilt in stages since the 12th century. The south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisle]] with a four-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] dates from about 1180. The north aisle was added late in the 13th century. It has an arcade that alternates round and octagonal [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. At about the same time, a new [[chancel]] arch was placed in the east wall of the old chancel and the present chancel added east of the previous one. The two-storey south porch was added late in the 13th century. It has octopartite [[rib vault]]ing springing from head corbels.{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=593}}

In about 1450, the south aisle was widened, wide arches being opened on both sides of the former chancel and both aisles extended eastwards to form side chapels beside these new arches. Most of the present windows in the north aisle were added in the 15th or early 16th centuries. Early in the 16th century, a [[chantry]] chapel with a rib-vaulted ceiling was added on the south side of the later chancel and a wide arch built to link it with the chancel. Little of the chapel remains except the [[corbel]]s of the vaulting. The [[bell tower]] was built in the mid-16th century.{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=593}} The side windows of the chancel are also [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]].{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=594}}

In 1856, St Kenelm's was restored under the direction of the [[Diocese of Oxford|Oxford Diocesan]] architect [[George Edmund Street|G. E. Street]],{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=593}} and the [[Lychgate|lych gate]]{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=594}} and west doorway were added. In about 1870, the present east window of the chancel was inserted, along with a window on the corner between the chancel and the north-east chapel.{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=593}} A [[stained glass|stained-glass]] window installed in the north aisle as a [[World War I|First World War]] memorial may have been done by [[William Morris|Morris & Co.]]{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=594}}

St Kenelm's is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1052805 |desc=Church of St Kenelm |accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>

The tower has a [[Change ringing|ring]] of six bells. [[John Taylor & Co|W. and J. Taylor]] of [[Loughborough]], Leicestershire, cast the treble, second, third, and fifth bells in 1831,<ref name=DoveDetails>{{cite web |url=http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Enstone&Submit=+Go+&DoveID=CHURCH+ENS |title=Church Enstone S Kenelm |work=[[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]] |last=Davies |first=Peter |date=8 January 2007 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref> presumably at the [[Bellfounding|foundry]] they had at Oxford at that time. [[John Taylor & Co]] cast the fourth and tenor bells at their Loughborough foundry in 1961 and 1981 respectively.<ref name=DoveDetails/>

East of St Kenelm's church is a medieval [[tithe barn]] built for [[Winchcombe Abbey]], a [[Benedictine]] monastery in [[Gloucestershire]] that owned the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Enstone. The barn has a [[cruck]] roof and a date stone of 1382, but its manner of construction suggests it is a late 15th-century building. It may therefore have been rebuilt at that time, retaining the date stone from an earlier structure.{{sfn |Sherwood |Pevsner |1974 |p=594}}

The barn is a Grade II* listed building and a scheduled monument.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1368063 |desc=Rectorial Tithe Barn |accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref>

In 1657, an attempt to merge the [[Benefice#Church of England|Benefices]] of Enstone and [[Heythrop]] was abandoned in the face of local opposition.{{sfn |Crossley |1983 |pp=131–143}} They were finally merged in 1964.{{sfn |Crossley |1983 |pp=131–143}} In 2001, the Enstone and Heythrop benefice merged with that of [[Ascott-under-Wychwood]], [[Chadlington]], and [[Spelsbury]] to form the Chase Benefice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/enstone-st-kenelm/ |title=Enstone: St Kenelm, Enstone |work=[[A Church Near You]] |author=[[Archbishops' Council]] |publisher=[[Church of England]] |accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref>

The vicar in the 1960s was Hubert Brasier (1917–1981), father of UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]].<ref>David Runciman: "Do Your Homework". ''London Review of Books'', 16 March 2017.</ref>

==Main roads==
[[File:ChurchEnstone TheCrownInn.JPG|thumb|The Crown Inn, Church Enstone]]
Enstone is at the junction of two long-established main roads, one between [[Oxford]] and Chipping Norton, and the other between Enstone and [[Bicester]]. Both were once [[Turnpike trust|turnpikes]]: the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] for the latter was passed in 1797.

Since the 1920s, the Oxford–Chipping Norton road has been classified as part of the [[A44 road|A44]], and the Enstone–Bicester Road has been the [[B4030 road|B4030]].

==RAF Enstone==
'''RAF Enstone''', north-east of Church Enstone, was a [[Royal Air Force]] [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] [[Operational Training Unit]] (OTU) in the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>[http://oldairfields.fotopic.net/c1545807.html Old Airfields website: Oxfordshire.
