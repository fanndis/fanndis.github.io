'''Seattle''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=GT Seattle AE.ogg|s|i|ˈ|æ|t|əl}} {{respell|see|AT|əl}}) is a [[port|seaport]] city on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. It is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Seattle is the largest city in both the [[U.S. state|state]] of Washington and the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]].

Seattle is situated on an [[isthmus]] between [[Puget Sound]] (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and [[Lake Washington]]. It is the northernmost large city in the United States, located about {{convert|100|mi}} south of the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]]. A major gateway for trade with Asia, Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seaport Statistics|url=http://www.portseattle.org/About/Publications/Statistics/Seaport/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Port of Seattle|access-date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>

The Seattle area was inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers.<ref name=Discovery_Park>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Feel-the-beat-of-history-in-the-park-and-concert-1251579.php|title=Feel the beat of history in the park and concert hall at two family-friendly events|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=October 4, 2007|author=Doree Armstrong|access-date=November 1, 2007}}</ref> [[Arthur A.

Today, Seattle has high populations of Native, [[Scandinavian Americans|Scandinavian]], [[Asian American]] and [[African American]] people, as well as a [[LGBT culture in Seattle|thriving LGBT community]] that ranks sixth in the United States by population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/data-show-seattle-metros-lgbt-population-at-173000/|title=Survey ranks Seattle area 5th for LGBT population – so many people is that?|publisher=The Seattle Times|author=Gene Balk|date=March 20, 2015}}</ref>

[[Logging]] was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to [[Alaska]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. Growth after [[World War II]] was partially due to the local [[Boeing]] company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a [[list of technology centers|technology center]] from the 1980s onwards with companies like [[Microsoft]] becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]] is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline [[Alaska Airlines]] is based in [[SeaTac, Washington]], serving Seattle's international airport, [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]]. The stream of new software, [[biotechnology]], and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000. Owing largely to its rapidly increasing population in the 21st century, Seattle and the state of Washington have some of the [[Minimum wage in the United States|highest minimum wages in the country]], at $15 per hour for smaller businesses and $16 for the city's largest employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/minimum-wage-climbs-to-16-per-hour-for-seattles-largest-employers/281-38add31e-76be-4db5-bad4-fa580c8c525a|title=Minimum wage climbs to $16 per hour for Seattle's largest employers|publisher=King 5 News|date=30 December 2018}}</ref>

Seattle has a noteworthy musical history. From 1918 to 1951, nearly two dozen [[jazz]] nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of [[Ray Charles]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Ernestine Anderson]], and others. Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician [[Jimi Hendrix]], as well as the origin of the bands [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Foo Fighters]] and the [[alternative rock]] movement [[grunge]].<ref name=Seattle_Sound>{{cite book|last=Heylin|first=Clinton|title=Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge|publisher=Conongate|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84195-879-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/babylonsburningf0000heyl/page/606 606]|url=https://archive.org/details/babylonsburningf0000heyl/page/606}}</ref>

After a difficult winter, most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present-day [[Pioneer Square, Seattle|Pioneer Square]],<ref name=founding/> naming this new settlement ''Duwamps''.

Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location, reestablished their old land claim and called it "New York", but renamed "New York Alki" in April 1853, from a [[Chinook Jargon|Chinook]] word meaning, roughly, "by and by" or "someday".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Seattle-at-150-Charles-Terry-s-unlimited-energy-1069610.php|title=Seattle at 150: Charles Terry's unlimited energy influenced a city|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|author=James R.

The name "Seattle" appears on official [[Washington Territory]] papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first [[plat]]s for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a [[trustee model of representation|board of trustees]] managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a [[mayor–council government]].<ref name=founding/><ref>{{cite web|author=Greg Lange|author2=Cassandra Tate|date=November 4, 1998|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=168|title=Legislature incorporates the Town of Seattle for the first time on January 14, 1865.|publisher=HistoryLink|access-date=October 14, 2007}}</ref> The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date "1869" and a likeness of Chief Si'ahl in left profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/facts/symbols.htm|title=Seattle City Symbols|publisher=City of Seattle|access-date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>

Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.<ref name=shear>

The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. During this period the road now known as [[Yesler Way]] won the nickname "Skid Road," supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to [[Henry Yesler]]'s sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as ''[[Skid Row]]''.<ref name=yesler>

The second and most dramatic boom resulted from the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which ended the depression that had begun with the [[Panic of 1893]]. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the ''S.S. Portland'' docked with its famed "ton of gold," and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]]. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than [[mother lode]]s for extraction, of precious metals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=687|title=Klondike Gold Rush|publisher=HistoryLink.org|date=January 14, 1999|author=Greg Lange|access-date=October 1, 2007}}</ref> The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old [[James E. Casey]] borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the [[American Messenger Company]] (later [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include [[Nordstrom]] and [[Eddie Bauer]].<ref name=Klondike-foundings/> Seattle brought in the [[Olmsted Brothers]] landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/parks/parkspaces/olmsted.htm|title=Park History – Olmsted Parks|publisher=Seattle Parks and Recreation|access-date=November 30, 2015}}</ref>

A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I, making Seattle somewhat of a company town.

Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression, experiencing some of the country's harshest labor strife in that era.

The [[Great Depression]] in Seattle affected many minority groups, one being the Asian Pacific Americans; they were subject to racism, loss of property, and failed claims of unemployment due to citizenship status.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nash|first=Phil|date=2009|title=Asian Pacific Americans During the Great Depression|journal=AsianWeek|volume=5|pages=4|id={{ProQuest|367348258}}}}</ref>

Seattle was one of the major cities that benefited from programs such as the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], UCL, and [[Public Works Administration|PWA]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Building Washington|last1=Dorpat|first1=Paul|last2=McCoy|first2=Genevieve|publisher=Tartu Publications|year=1998|location=Seattle}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Seattle 1921-1940: From Boom to Bust|last=Berner|first=Richard|publisher=Charles Press|year=1992|location=Seattle}}</ref> The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as [[Los Angeles]] prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], but lost to LA as well. Seattle's eastern farm land faded due to [[Oregon]]'s and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]'s, forcing people into town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933|url=https://archive.org/details/depressionurbanw0000mull|url-access=registration|last=Mullins|first=William|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|location=Indianapolis}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=San Francisco and Seattle During the Hoover Years of the Depression: 1929-1933|last=Mullins|first=William|publisher=University of Washington|year=1975|location=Seattle}}</ref>

The famous ''[[Hooverville]]'' arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle's growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very very few children and no women. With work projects close to the city, Hooverville grew and the WPA settled into the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hooverville: A Study of a Community of Homeless Men in Seattle|last=Roy|first=Donald|publisher=University of Washington|year=1935|location=Seattle}}</ref>

A movement by women arose from Seattle during the Depression. Fueled by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s book ''It's Up to the Women'', women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals ''Working Woman'' and ''The Woman Today'', women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orleck|first=Annelise|date=1993|title=We Are the Mythical Thing Called the Public|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=19|pages=147–172|doi=10.2307/3178357|jstor=3178357}}</ref>

Seattle's [[University of Washington]] was greatly affected during the Depression era. As schools across Washington lost funding and attendance, the UW actually prospered during the time period. While [[Seattle Public Schools|Seattle public schools]] were influenced by Washington's superintendent Worth McClure,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schools in the Great Depression|url=https://archive.org/details/schoolsingreatde0000more|url-access=registration|last=Moreo|first=Dominic|publisher=Garland Publishing|year=1996|location=New York}}</ref> they still struggled to pay teachers and maintain attendance. The UW, despite academic challenges that plagued the college due to differing views on teaching and learning, focused on growth in student enrollment rather than improving the existing school.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The First Century at the University of Washington|url=https://archive.org/details/firstcenturyatun0000gate|url-access=registration|last=Gates|first=Charles|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1961|location=Seattle}}</ref>

Seattle was also the home base of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]] who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting [[vaudeville]] acts and silent movies. His activities soon expanded, and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America's greatest theater and movie tycoons. Between Pantages and his rival [[John Considine (Seattle)|John Considine]], Seattle was for a while the western United States' vaudeville mecca. [[B. Marcus Priteca]], the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born and Seattle-based architect, built several theaters for Pantages, including some in Seattle. The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses, but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S., often retaining the ''Pantages'' name. Seattle's surviving [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle)|Paramount Theatre]], on which he collaborated, was not a Pantages theater.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the [[Japanese American internment]]. After the war, the local economy dipped.

==Geography==
Situated at latitude 47°36'35"N, Seattle is the northernmost U.S. city with at least 500,000 people, farther north than Canadian cities such as [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Montreal]], and at about the same latitude as [[Salzburg|Salzburg, Austria]]. It has a land area of 83.9 square miles (217.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).

The topography of Seattle is hilly. The city lies on several hills, including Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Magnolia, Denny Hill, and Queen Anne. The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound, while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington. The city has over {{convert|5540|acres|0|abbr=on}} of parkland.

Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city's chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] and [[Olympic Mountains]] on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] suburbs, are [[Lake Sammamish]] and the [[Cascade Range]]. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] (consisting of two man-made canals, [[Lake Union]], and the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] at [[Salmon Bay]], ending in [[Shilshole Bay]] on Puget Sound).

The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/chapter_3_native_american_cultures.htm|title=Chapter Three – Native American Cultures|publisher=Four Directions|work=The First Americans|access-date=October 20, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Hunters and Gatherers|editor=Richard B.

The highest point within city limits is at [[High Point, Seattle|High Point]] in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.

North of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: [[Lake Union]], Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and [[Union Bay (Seattle)|Union Bay]].

Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent [[Puget Sound]], greater [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[Lake Washington]]. Thus extreme heat waves are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about {{convert|15|F|C}}). The Seattle area is the cloudiest region of the United States, due in part to frequent storms and lows moving in from the adjacent Pacific Ocean.

Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry, compressed wind from the west slopes of the Cascades,<ref name="Sistek2006a">{{cite web|title=What is offshore flow?|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-offshore-flow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126002256/http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-offshore-flow |url-status=live |archive-date=January 26, 2016|first=Scott|last=Sistek|date=October 4, 2006}}</ref> while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the [[Fraser Valley]] in [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What are the different snow scenarios?|url=http://www.komonews.com/weather/faq/4307422.html#1a|date=2015-12-25}}</ref>

From 1981 to 2010, the average annual precipitation measured at [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]] was 37.49 inches (952&nbsp;mm). Annual precipitation has ranged from {{convert|23.78|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1952 to {{convert|55.14|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1950; for water year (October 1 – September 30) precipitation, the range is {{convert|23.16|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1976–77 to {{convert|51.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1996–97.<ref name = NOWData/> Due to local variations in [[microclimate]], Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades. Around {{convert|80|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the west, the [[Hoh Rain Forest]] in [[Olympic National Park]] on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of {{convert|142|in|m|2|abbr=on}}. Sixty miles (95&nbsp;km) to the south of Seattle, the state capital [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], which is out of the Olympic Mountains' rain shadow, receives an annual average precipitation of {{convert|50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name = NOWData/> The city of [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], about {{convert|15|mi|abbr=on}} west of downtown Seattle on the other side of the Puget Sound, receives {{convert|56.4|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually.<ref name = NOWData/>

Conversely, the northeastern portion of the [[Olympic Peninsula]], which lies east of the [[Olympic Mountains]] is located within the Olympic rain shadow and receives significantly less precipitation than its surrounding areas. Prevailing airflow from the west [[adiabatic expansion|expands and cools]] as it goes over the mountain range, resulting in high levels of precipitation within the mountains and its western slopes. Once the airflow reaches the leeward side of the mountains, it then compresses and warms, and is significantly dryer. [[Sequim, Washington]], nicknamed "Sunny Sequim," is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of downtown Seattle and receives just {{convert|16.51|in|mm|abbr=out}} of annual precipitation, more comparable to that of [[Los Angeles]]. Often an area devoid of cloud cover can be seen extending out over the [[Puget Sound]] to the north and east of Sequim. On average Sequim observes 127 sunny days per year in addition to 127 days with partial cloud cover. Other areas influenced by the Olympic rain shadow include [[Port Angeles, Washington|Port Angeles]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], extending as far north as [[Victoria, British Columbia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympicrainshadow.com/|title=Olympic Rain Shadow – Information and Resources|last=olympicrainshadow.com|website=www.olympicrainshadow.com|access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref>

In November, Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation. Conversely, the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September. Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]], along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio, and Michigan.

Seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during November, December, and January, receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall (by volume) during this period. In late fall and early winter, atmospheric rivers (also known as "[[Pineapple Express]]" systems), strong frontal systems, and Pacific low-pressure systems are common. Light rain and drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year. For instance, on average, less than {{convert|1.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is less common. On occasion, Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events. One such event occurred on December 2–4, 2007, when sustained [[hurricane]]-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon.

Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare. Average annual snowfall, as measured at Sea-Tac Airport, is {{convert|6.8|in|cm|1}}. From winter season to winter season, amounts can be extremely variable. A single calendar-day snowfall of six inches (15&nbsp;cm) or greater has occurred on only 17 days since 1948, and only three times since February 17, 1990; {{convert|6.8|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} of snow officially fell at Sea-Tac airport on January 18, 2012.

Another moderate snow event occurred from December 12–25, 2008, when over one foot (30&nbsp;cm) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks, when temperatures remained below {{convert|32|°F|0}}, causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow. In February 2019, Seattle experienced its snowiest month in 50 years (since January 1969), with 20.2 inches of snow, all from February 3–11, with 6.4 inches on Feb. 8 and 6.1 more inches on Feb. 11.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seattleweatherblog.com/snow/february-2019-seattles-snowiest-month-50-years/|title=February 2019: Seattle's snowiest month in 50 years|first=Justin|last=Shaw|date=February 12, 2019}}</ref> The largest documented [[Snow-storm|snowstorm]] occurred from January 5–9, 1880, with snow drifting to {{convert|6|ft|m}} in places at the end of the snow event.

The [[Puget Sound Convergence Zone]] is an important feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in [[convection]].<ref name="Sistek2015">{{cite web|url=http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-a-puget-sound-convergence-zone|title=What is a Puget Sound Convergence Zone?|publisher=KOMO |archive-date=January 26, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126002111/http://komonews.com/weather/faq/what-is-a-puget-sound-convergence-zone|first=Scott|last=Sistek|date=December 17, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The [[Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm of 2006|Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm]] in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to {{convert|69|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}, an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.

==Government and politics==

Seattle is a [[charter city]], with a [[Mayor–council government|mayor–council form of government]].

Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people).

The [[Seattle Street Railway|first streetcars]] appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|Seattle trolleybus system]] brought the end of [[Seattle Street Railway|streetcars in Seattle]] in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.<ref name="interurbanrail">{{cite news|url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2667|title=Interurban Rail Transit in King County and the Puget Sound Region – A Snapshot History|date=September 19, 2000|publisher=HistoryLink.org|author=Walt Crowley|access-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref>
