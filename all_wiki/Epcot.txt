'''Epcot''' (stylized as '''EPCOT''') is a [[Amusement park|theme park]] at the [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Bay Lake, Florida]]. It is owned and operated by [[The Walt Disney Company]] through its [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Parks, Experiences and Products]] division. Inspired by [[EPCOT (concept)|an unrealized concept]] developed by [[Walt Disney]], the park opened on October 1, 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/disney-history/|title=Disney History - D23|publisher=The Walt Disney Corporation|access-date=December 21, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003643/https://d23.com/disney-history/|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> as '''EPCOT Center,''' and was the second of four [[theme park]]s built at Walt Disney World, after the [[Magic Kingdom]].

Epcot was originally conceived by Walt Disney during the early development of Walt Disney World, as an experimental [[planned community]] that would serve as a center for American enterprise and urban living. Known as "[[EPCOT (concept)|EPCOT]]", the idea included an urban city center, residential areas, industrial areas, schools, and a series of mass transportation systems that would connect the community. After Disney's death in 1966, the "EPCOT" concept was abandoned as the company had uncertainty about the feasibility of maintaining an operating city. In the 1970s, [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] began developing a second theme park for the resort to supplement Magic Kingdom, as that park's popularity grew. The new park reprised the idea of showcasing modern innovation through [[avant-garde]] [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]] attractions, as well as the addition of a [[Nation|world nations]] exposition. The newly-designed park, featuring two sections—Future World and World Showcase—opened as EPCOT Center in 1982. In 1994, the park was renamed to "Epcot", dropping the acronym and "Center" from the name.

In 2019, Epcot hosted 12.444 million guests, ranking it as the fourth-most-visited theme park in North America and the seventh-most-visited theme park in the world.<ref name="2019 Report"/> The park is represented by [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], a [[Geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]].

==History==
===1960s: Experimental concept===
{{main|EPCOT (concept)}}

The park's name, Epcot, was previously an acronym for [[EPCOT (concept)|Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow]], a [[Utopia|utopian city]] of the future planned by [[Walt Disney]], often interchanging "city" and "community."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patches |first1=Matt |title=Inside Walt Disney's Ambitious, Failed Plan to Build the City of Tomorrow |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/news/a35104/walt-disney-epcot-history-city-of-tomorrow/ |website=esquire.com |access-date=May 12, 2020}}</ref> In Walt Disney's words: "EPCOT will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed but will always be introducing and testing, and demonstrating new materials and new systems. And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world of the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9M3pKsrcc8|title= Walt Disney's plan for EPCOT|website= YouTube.com|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160622091943/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9M3pKsrcc8|archive-date= June 22, 2016|df= mdy-all}}</ref>

His original vision was for a model community that would have been home to twenty thousand residents and a test bed for [[city planning]] as well as organization. It was to have been built in the shape of a circle with businesses and commercial areas at its center with community buildings, schools, and recreational complexes around it while residential neighborhoods would line the perimeter. This radial plan concept is strongly influenced by British planner [[Ebenezer Howard]] and his [[Garden Cities of To-morrow]]. Transportation would have been provided by [[monorails]] and [[PeopleMover]]s (like that in Magic Kingdom's [[Tomorrowland]]). Automobile traffic would be kept underground, leaving pedestrians safe above ground. Walt Disney was not able to obtain funding and permission to start work on his Florida property until he agreed to first build Magic Kingdom. He died nearly five years before Magic Kingdom opened.{{fact|date=March 2020}}

===1970s: Concept evolves into park===
After Walt Disney's death, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city without Walt's guidance. The model community of [[Celebration, Florida]] has been mentioned as a realization of Disney's original vision, but Celebration is based on concepts of [[new urbanism]] which is radically different from Disney's [[modernist]] and [[Futurist architecture|futurist]] visions. However, the idea of EPCOT was instrumental in prompting the state of Florida to create the [[Reedy Creek Improvement District]] (RCID) and the cities of [[Bay Lake, Florida|Bay Lake]] and [[Reedy Creek, Florida|Reedy Creek]] (now [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida|Lake Buena Vista]]), a legislative mechanism allowing Disney to exercise governmental powers over Walt Disney World. Control over the RCID is vested in the landowners of the district, and the promise of an actual city in the district would have meant that the powers of the RCID would have been distributed among the landowners in EPCOT. Because the idea of EPCOT was never implemented, Disney remained almost the sole landowner in the district allowing it to maintain control of the RCID and the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista; Disney further cemented this control by deannexing Celebration from the RCID.

The original plans for the park showed indecision over the park's purpose. Some [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineers]] wanted it to represent the cutting edge of technology, while others wanted it to showcase international cultures and customs. At one point, a model of the futuristic park was pushed together against a model of a [[World's Fair]] international theme, and the two were combined. The park was originally named EPCOT Center to reflect the ideals and values of the city. It was constructed for an estimated $800&nbsp;million to $1.4&nbsp;billion and took three years to build, at the time the largest construction project on Earth.<ref name="Kurtti">{{cite book |title=Since the World Began: Walt Disney World, The First 25 Years |last=Kurtti |first=Jeff |year=1996 |publisher=[[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]] |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-7868-6248-3 |page=89 |ref=kur96}}</ref> The parking lot serving the park is {{convert|141|acres}} (including bus area) and can accommodate 11,211 vehicles (grass areas hold additional 500+ vehicles). Before it opened on October 1, 1982, Walt Disney World Ambassador Genie Field introduced [[Card Walker|E. Cardon Walker]], Disney's chairman and CEO, who dedicated EPCOT Center. Walker also presented a family with lifetime passes for the two Walt Disney World theme parks. His remarks were followed by Florida Governor [[Bob Graham]] and William Ellinghaus, president of [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]].

=== 1980s: Opening and operation ===
[[File: Opening Ceremonies for EPCOT Center.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremonies for EPCOT Center]]
As part of the opening-day ceremony, dancers and band members performed "We've Just Begun to Dream".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Veness |first1=Susan |title=The Hidden Magic of Walt Disney World: Over 600 Secrets of the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom |date=2015 |publisher=Adams Media |page=143 |isbn=9781440587818 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUXsDQAAQBAJ&q=we%27ve+just+begun+to+dream+epcot+opening&pg=PA143 |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref> The [[Sherman Brothers]] wrote a song especially for the occasion entitled "[[The World Showcase March]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Grand Opening Ceremonies for EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World |url=https://d23.com/this-day/official-grand-opening-ceremonies-for-epcot-center-at-walt-disney-world/ |website=d23.com |publisher=D23 |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref> During the finale, doves and many sets of balloons were released. Performing groups representing countries from all over the world performed in World Showcase. Water was gathered from major rivers across the globe and emptied into the park's fountain of nations ceremonial containers to mark the opening.

====Dedication====
The theme park opened on October 1, 1982.<ref name=wdw200603/> Located at the front of the park is a plaque bearing Walker's opening-day dedication:

===1990s–2000s: Decline in vision===
Despite its initial success, Epcot constantly met the challenges of evolving with worldwide progress, an issue that caused the park to lose relevance and become outdated in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2019-08-25/disney-theme-parks-marvel-star-wars-epcot|title=D23 Expo: Is Disney's intellectual property squeezing the theme out of our theme parks?|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=August 25, 2019|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 5, 2019}}</ref> To maintain attendance levels, Disney introduced seasonal events such as the [[Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival|International Flower & Garden Festival]] and the [[Epcot International Food & Wine Festival|International Food & Wine Festival]] in 1994 and 1995, respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Craig |first1=Dezern |title=DISNEY FLOWER POWER |url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1994-04-23-9404261039-story.html |access-date=May 12, 2020 |work=orlandosentinel.com |date=April 23, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Friend |first1=Samantha |title=Photos of People Getting Happily Drunk in Disney World |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ppa4vg/disneys-food-and-wine-fetival |website=vice.com |publisher=Vice |access-date=May 12, 2020}}</ref> In the mid-1990s, Disney also began to gradually phase out the park's [[Educational entertainment|edutainment]] attractions in favor of more modern and thrilling attractions.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/08/epcot-changes.html|title=Epcot's Midlife Crisis: Disney Reveals a Huge Makeover for the Park's 40th Birthday|last=Martin|first=Garrett|date=August 29, 2019|work=Paste Magazine|access-date=September 9, 2019}}</ref> As a result, many of the attractions within the Future World pavilions, were either rehauled or replaced entirely. [[Universe of Energy]] was reconfigured as [[Universe of Energy|Ellen's Energy Adventure]] in 1996, [[World of Motion]] was rethemed as [[Test Track]], and [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] was demolished in 1999 and replaced with [[Mission: Space]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How Epcot's World of Motion Became Test Track |date=March 16, 2018 |url=https://thenewswheel.com/how-epcots-world-of-motion-became-test-track/ |website=The News Wheel |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Horizons |url=https://www.extinctdisney.com/horizons/ |website=extinctdisney.com |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref> Walt Disney World held the [[Walt Disney World Millennium Celebration|Millennium Celebration]] with the central focus of the event at Epcot. The Living Seas was closed in 2005, and rethemed with the introduction of characters from ''[[Finding Nemo (franchise)|Finding Nemo]]'', as [[The Seas with Nemo & Friends]]. That same year, the [[Soarin']] attraction was added to [[The Land (Epcot)|The Land]]. [[Wonders of Life]] closed in 2007, with the pavilon being occasionally used for the park's annual festivals.

=== 2010–present: Transformation and redesign ===
In November 2016, Disney revealed that Epcot would be receiving “a major transformation” that would help transition the park into being “more Disney, timeless, relevant, family-friendly”, while keeping the original vision alive.

{{See also|List of Epcot attractions}}
Epcot is divided into two main themed areas: Future World and World Showcase. The World Showcase usually opens two hours after park opening and remains open later than the Future World section of the park. Most major attractions in Future World remain open until the park's closing time. A secondary park gate is located between the France and United Kingdom pavilions of World Showcase and is known as the International Gateway. The International Gateway is directly accessible to guests arriving from the [[Disney Skyliner]] and the nearby [[Epcot Area Resorts]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/11/first-look-disney-skyliner-gondola-at-walt-disney-world-resort/|title=First Look: Disney Skyliner Gondola at Walt Disney World Resort|website=Disney Parks Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

'''Future World''' consists of a variety of [[avant-garde]] [[pavilion]]s that explore innovative aspects and applications including technology and science, with each pavilion featuring self-contained attractions and distinct architecture in its design. Future World also serves as the park's main entrance and features [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], a large [[geodesic dome|geodesic sphere]] structure and the anchor pavilion, which also houses an eponymous [[dark ride]] attraction that depicts the history of [[communication]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pedersen |first1=R.

Originally, Future World debuted with six pavilions: Spaceship Earth, [[CommuniCore]], Imagination!, The Land, [[Universe of Energy]], and [[World of Motion]]. The [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion opened the following year, and [[The Seas with Nemo & Friends|The Living Seas]] and [[Wonders of Life]] pavilions were added in 1986 and 1989, respectively, bringing the lineup to nine. CommuniCore, World of Motion, Horizons, Wonders of Life, Universe of Energy, and Innoventions closed in 1994, 1996, 1999, 2007, 2017, and 2019, respectively. The [[Fountain of Nations]], a large circular [[musical fountain]], was closed in 2019 as well. Each pavilion was initially sponsored by a corporation which helped fund its construction and maintenance in return for the corporation's logos and some marketing elements appearing throughout the pavilion.

Additionally, each pavilion of Future World featured a unique circular logo which was featured on [[Marquee (structure)|park signage]], and throughout the attractions themselves. The pavilion logos were gradually phased out in the early 2000s, as the pavilions instead were identified by name and recognized by the main attraction(s) housed inside. Several homages remain scattered throughout the park, including merchandising. However, at D23 Expo 2019, Disney revealed that the concept of the circular pavilion logos would be revived as part of Epcot's transformation, with both classic logos revived and new logos introduced.<ref name="Epcot pavilion logos revival">{{cite web|last=Figueroa|first=Jessica|title=PHOTOS: New Epcot Pavilion Logos Revealed as Part of Exclusive Merchandise Line at D23 Expo 2019|url=https://wdwnt.com/2019/08/photos-new-epcot-pavilion-logos-revealed-as-part-of-exclusive-merchandise-line-at-d23-expo-2019/|website=WDW News Today|access-date=2019-10-05|date=2019-08-24|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===World Showcase===
'''World Showcase''' is a large area reminiscent of a permanent [[world's fair]] containing 11 pavilions, each themed and dedicated to represent a specific country. The pavilions surround the World Showcase Lagoon, a large man-made lake located in the center of World Showcase with a perimeter of {{convert|1.2|mi|km}}. In counter-clockwise order, the 11 pavilions are:

There is a small pavilion between China and Germany called the African Outpost, not included as one of the official World Showcase pavilions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kristin |title=The Outpost in Epcot |url=https://www.couponingtodisney.com/outpost-epcot/ |website=couponingtodisney.com |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

Of the 11 pavilions, only [[Morocco Pavilion at Epcot|Morocco]] and [[Norway Pavilion at Epcot|Norway]] were not present at the park's opening, as they were added in 1984 and 1988, respectively.<ref name="World Showcase theoretical expansion"/> Each pavilion contains themed architecture, landscapes, streetscapes, attractions, shops and restaurants representing the respective country's culture and cuisine. In an effort to maintain the authenticity of the represented countries, the pavilions are primarily staffed by citizens of the respective countries as part of the [[Disney International Programs#Cultural Representative Program|Cultural Representative Program]] through [[Q1 visa]] agreements. Some pavilions also contain themed [[List of Epcot attractions#World Showcase|rides, shows, and live entertainment]] representative of the respective country. The only pavilion that is directly sponsored by the government of its respective country is Morocco; the remaining pavilions are primarily sponsored by private companies with affiliations to the represented countries.

Originally, the showcase was to include partnerships with the governments of the different countries. According to Disney's 1975 Annual Report, the Showcase would:

{{quote|...offer participating countries a permanent installation for such features as themed restaurants and shops, product exhibits, industrial displays, cultural presentations, a trade center, and even special facilities for business meetings.

Major sponsorships for each participating nation will be asked to provide the capital to cover the cost of designing, developing and constructing its attraction and/or ride and all exhibits, as well as the Pavilion itself. It will also have the responsibility for funding the housing for its employees in the International Village. Its land lease will cover the cost of maintaining the attraction for a minimum of ten years.

The Disney organization will be responsible for area development, including the construction of transportation systems and utilities. We will also build and operate the internal people moving system, the Courtyard of Nations and central theater facility.<ref name="World Showcase theoretical expansion" />}}

Two of the potential locations, on either side of the United Kingdom, are currently occupied by [[Millennium Village|World ShowPlace]] (successor of Millennium Village).

====The World Showcase Adventure====
Originally based on the [[Disney Channel]] animated series ''[[Kim Possible]]'', the World Showcase Adventure is an interactive mobile attraction taking place in several pavilions throughout the World Showcase. The attraction is an electronic [[scavenger hunt]] that has guests using special "Kimmunicators" (in actuality, customized cell phones) to help teenage crime-fighters Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable solve a "crime" or disrupt an evil-doer's "plans for global domination." The "Kimmunicator" is able to trigger specific events within the pavilion grounds that provide clues to completing the adventure. Launched in January 2009 and presented by [[Verizon Wireless]], the Adventure is included in park admission. It was succeeded by [[Perry the Platypus|Agent P]]'s World Showcase Adventure, based on Disney's ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', on June 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2012/03/coming-soon-to-epcot-agent-ps-world-showcase-adventure/ | title=Coming Soon To Epcot: Agent P's World Showcase Adventure | date=March 13, 2012 | access-date=March 18, 2012 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318064228/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2012/03/coming-soon-to-epcot-agent-ps-world-showcase-adventure/ | archive-date=March 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Agent P's World Showcase Adventure was later closed on February 17, 2020 and will be replaced by the DuckTales World Showcase Adventure, based on the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 reboot of DuckTales.]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/12/disneys-ducktales-world-showcase-adventure-announced-for-play-disney-parks-mobile-app-at-epcot/ | title=Disney's DuckTales World Showcase Adventure Announced for Play Disney Parks Mobile App at Epcot | date=December 3, 2019 | access-date=December 3, 2019 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Annual events==

Epcot hosts a number of special events during the year:
*The [[Epcot International Flower and Garden Festival]], inaugurated in 1994, uses specially-themed floral displays throughout the park, including [[topiary]] sculptures of Disney characters. Guests can meet gardening experts and learn new ideas they can use in their own home gardens. The 18th annual event was scheduled for March 2&nbsp;– May 15. Each event takes more than a full year to plan and more than 20,000 cast member hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouseinfo.com/forums/wdw-news-info/93587-fun-facts-bloom-across-305-acres-2011-epcot-international-flower-garden-festival.html|title=Mouseinfo.com|access-date=October 4, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085815/http://www.mouseinfo.com/forums/wdw-news-info/93587-fun-facts-bloom-across-305-acres-2011-epcot-international-flower-garden-festival.html|archive-date=October 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
