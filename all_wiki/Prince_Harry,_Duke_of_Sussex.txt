As the younger son of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], he is sixth in the [[line of succession to the British throne]].

Born in [[St Mary's Hospital, London]], Harry was educated at [[Wetherby School]], [[Ludgrove School]], and [[Eton College]]. He spent parts of his [[gap year]] in Australia and [[Lesotho]], then underwent officer training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. He was commissioned as a [[Cornet (rank)|cornet]] into the [[Blues and Royals]], serving temporarily with his brother [[Prince William]] and completed training as a troop leader. In 2007–2008, Harry [[Operation Herrick|served for over ten weeks]] in [[Helmand]], Afghanistan. He returned to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012–2013 with the Army Air Corps. In June 2015, he resigned from the army.

Harry launched the [[Invictus Games]] in 2014 and remains the patron of its foundation.

==Early life==

Harry was born in the Lindo Wing of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] in [[Paddington]], London, on 15 September 1984 at 4:20&nbsp;pm as the second child of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] ([[heir apparent]] to the [[British throne]]) and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].<ref name="ten16sep">{{cite news|title=Princess Di gives birth to boy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V19GAAAAIBAJ&pg=1677,1656508&dq=princess+diana&hl=en|access-date=31 May 2013|newspaper=The Evening News|date=16 September 1984|agency=Associated Press|location=London}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|url=http://www.princehenryofwales.org/prince-harry/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103050106/http://www.princehenryofwales.org/prince-harry/biography|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 November 2012|title=Prince Harry – Biography|publisher=Office of the Prince of Wales|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Rumours that Harry is the son of [[James Hewitt]], with whom his mother had an affair, have been denied by Hewitt.<ref name=bbchewitt>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2273498.stm |title=Hewitt denies Prince Harry link|work=BBC News|date=21 September 2002 |access-date=28 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=mirrorhewitt>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/new-controversial-princess-diana-play-4882989 |title=New controversial Princess Diana play asks 'Is James Hewitt Prince Harry's real father?' |publisher=Mirror Group |date=28 December 2014 |access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref> Hewitt said, "I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father.

His parents announced their second son's given names would officially be Henry Charles Albert David. However, he would be known as ''Harry'' to his family and friends. As the prince grew up, he was referred to by Kensington Palace, and therefore the Press and the public at large, as Prince Harry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/24/prince-harry-called-harry-name-henry-7492717/|title=Why is Prince Harry called Harry when his name is Henry?|date=24 April 2018|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref> As a son of the Prince of Wales, he was called Prince Henry of Wales. Diana wanted Harry and his older brother, [[Prince William]], to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children. She took them to venues that ranged from [[Walt Disney World]] and [[McDonald's]] to [[AIDS|AIDS clinics]] and homeless shelters.<ref name="PeopleBio">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/prince_harry/biography|title=Prince Harry|journal=People|access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref> Harry began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html|title=The Prince of Wales – At Work – Countries Visited|publisher=Clarence House|access-date=15 October 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202113324/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html|archive-date=2 February 2009}}</ref>

Harry's parents divorced in 1996. [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|His mother died]] in a car crash in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6217366.stm|title=Timeline: How Diana Died|publisher=BBC|date=30 August 1997|access-date=11 April 2008|location=London}}</ref> At his [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's funeral]], Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer]], in walking behind the funeral cortège from [[Kensington Palace]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2502000/2502307.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 6–1997: Diana's funeral watched by millions|publisher=BBC|date=6 September 1997|location=London|access-date=26 March 2009}}</ref> In 2017, the prince acknowledged that he sought [[Grief counseling|counselling]] twenty years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/16/prince-harry-sought-counselling-death-mother-led-two-years-total/|title=Prince Harry: I sought counselling after 20 years of not thinking about the death of my mother, Diana, and two years of total chaos in my life|last=Furness|first=Hannah|date=16 April 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

==Education==
Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]]. He started at London's Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory [[Wetherby School]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Prince William in pictures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/royalty/8371264/Prince-William-in-pictures.html?image=4|access-date=23 July 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London|date=18 March 2011}}</ref> Following this, he attended [[Ludgrove School]] in Berkshire. After passing entrance exams, he was admitted to [[Eton College]]. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the past practice of the [[Mountbatten-Windsor]]s to send children to [[Gordonstoun]], which Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins had attended. It did, however, see Harry follow in his older brother's footsteps and the Spencer family, as both Diana's father and brother attended Eton.<ref name="PeopleBio" />

In June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4634031.stm|title=What is it like at Eton College?|date=4 July 2005|work=BBC News|location=London|access-date=11 October 2009}}</ref> achieving a grade B in art and D in geography, having decided to drop history of art after AS level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3150649.stm|title=Prince Harry's A-level results|date=14 August 2003|work=BBC News|location=London|access-date=11 October 2009}}</ref> He has been described as "a top tier athlete", having played competitive [[polo]] and [[rugby union]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=A Royal Brush with the Olympics|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/london-games/photos/a-royal-brush-with-the-olympics/#67|date=July–August 2012|publisher=BBC America|quote=He's not an Olympian, but Prince Harry is a top tier athlete, playing competitive polo and rugby.

After school, Harry took a [[gap year]], during which he spent time in Australia working (as his father had done in his youth) on a cattle station, and participating in the Young England vs Young Australia Polo Test match.<ref name="POWInt">{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princeharry/interests/|title=The Prince of Wales – Prince Harry – Interests|publisher=Clarence House|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616074331/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/princeharry/interests/|archive-date=16 June 2008|access-date=15 October 2008}}</ref> He also travelled to [[Lesotho]], where he worked with orphaned children and produced the documentary film ''The Forgotten Kingdom''.<ref name="PeopleBio" />

[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Officer Cadet Wales (standing next to the horse) on parade at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], 21 June 2005]]
Harry entered the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] on 8 May 2005, where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales, and joined the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst#Organisation|Alamein Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Harry begins Sandhurst training|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4526077.stm|access-date=16 October 2008}}</ref> In April 2006, Harry completed his officer training and was commissioned as a [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] ([[second lieutenant]]) in the [[Blues and Royals]], a regiment of the [[Household Cavalry]] in the British Army. On 13 April 2008, when he reached two years' seniority, Harry was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]].<ref name="LG 15 April 2008">{{London Gazette|issue=58667|date=15 April 2008|page=5736|supp=y}}</ref>

In 2006, it was announced that Harry's unit was scheduled to be deployed in Iraq the following year. A public debate ensued as to whether he should serve there. Defence Secretary [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] said that he should be allowed to serve on the front line of battle zones. Harry agreed saying, "If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4938978.stm|title=Reid defends Harry in service row|work=BBC News|access-date=30 January 2017}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and [[Clarence House]] made a joint announcement on 22 February 2007 that Harry would be deployed with his regiment to Iraq, as part of the [[1st Mechanized Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Mechanised Brigade]] of the [[3rd Mechanised Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Mechanised Division]]{{spaced en dash}}a move supported by Harry, who had stated that he would leave the army if he was told to remain in safety while his regiment went to war.<ref>{{cite news|last=Witchell|first=Nicholas|title=Harry Iraq deployment no surprise|work=BBC News|date=22 February 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6385169.stm|access-date=14 October 2008}}</ref> He said: "There's no way I'm going to put myself through Sandhurst and then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4246518.stm|title=Harry 'loves wonderful Camilla'|work=BBC News|date=7 October 2005|access-date=18 May 2018}}</ref>

The head of the British army at the time, [[Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt|General Sir Richard Dannatt]], said on 30 April 2007 that he had personally decided that Harry would serve with his unit in Iraq,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18399400/ns/world_news-europe/t/british-army-chief-prince-harry-iraq|title=British army chief: Prince Harry to Iraq|date=30 April 2007|publisher=NBC News|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=25 August 2012}}</ref> and Harry was scheduled for deployment in May or June 2007 to patrol the [[Maysan Governorate]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1712044.ece|last=Hilder|first=James|title=A 'Wild West' in the east where militias learn their deadly trade|newspaper=The Times|date=27 April 2007|access-date=14 October 2008}}</ref> By 16 May, however, Dannatt announced that Harry would not serve in Iraq;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/16/iraq.harry/index.html|title=Prince Harry will not go to Iraq|publisher=CNN|date=17 May 2007|access-date=14 October 2008}}</ref> concerns included Harry being a high-value target (as several threats by various groups had already been made against him) and the dangers the soldiers around him would face should any attempt be made on his life or if he was captured. Clarence House made public Harry's disappointment with the decision, though he said he would abide by it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_harry_deployment_update_1590048916.html|title=Prince Harry deployment update|publisher=Clarence House|date=16 May 2007|access-date=14 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928075444/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/newsandgallery/news/prince_harry_deployment_update_1590048916.html|archive-date=28 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In early June 2007, it was reported that Harry had arrived in Canada to train alongside soldiers of the [[Canadian Forces]] and British Army, at [[CFB Suffield]] near [[Medicine Hat, Alberta]]. It was said that this was in preparation for a [[tour of duty]] in Afghanistan, where Canadian and British forces were participating in the [[NATO]]-led [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/prince-harry-may-be-training-in-alberta-reports-1.243509|title=Prince Harry may be training in Alberta: reports|publisher=CTV|date=2 June 2007|access-date=14 October 2008}}</ref>

This was confirmed in February of the following year, when the British Ministry of Defence revealed that Harry had been secretly deployed as a [[Forward Air Controller]] to [[Helmand Province]] in Afghanistan for the previous ten weeks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/7269743.stm|title=Prince Harry on Afghan front line|work=BBC News|date=28 February 2008|access-date=14 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23391374|last=Associated Press|title=Prince Harry on front line in Afghanistan|publisher=NBC News|date=28 February 2008|access-date=28 February 2008}}</ref> The revelation came after the media{{spaced en dash}}notably, German newspaper ''[[Bild]]'' and Australian magazine ''[[New Idea]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1580111/How-the-Prince-Harry-blackout-was-broken.html|last=Gammell|first=Caroline|title=How the Prince Harry blackout was broken|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 February 2008 |access-date=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/new-idea/8771/prince-harry-goes-to-war-in-afghanistan|title=Prince Harry Biography – New Idea|publisher=Yahoo!|access-date=14 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304115059/http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/b/new-idea/8771/prince-harry-goes-to-war-in-afghanistan|archive-date=4 March 2008}}</ref>{{spaced en dash}}breached the blackout placed over the information by the Canadian and British authorities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/feb/28/military.afghanistan|last=Audrey|first=Gillian|author2=Tran, Mark|author3=Walker Peter|title=Harry secretly serving in Afghanistan|date=28 February 2008|work=The Guardian|location=London|access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> It was later reported that Harry helped [[Brigade of Gurkhas|Gurkha]] troops repel an attack from [[Taliban]] insurgents,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1580113/Prince-Harry-in-Taliban-gun-battle.html|title=Prince Harry in Taliban gun battle|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 February 2008|access-date=12 January 2016}}</ref> and performed patrol duty in hostile areas while in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1580118/On-patrol-with-Prince-Harry.html |title=On patrol with Prince Harry |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 February 2008 |access-date=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Katie Nicholl|title=William and Harry|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781602861404|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Weinstein Books|isbn=978-1-60286-140-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781602861404/page/242 242]–243}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Winn|title=F-15 pilots recall airstrike directed by Prince Harry|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-15-prince-airstrikes_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today |date=15 March 2008|access-date=5 November 2016}}</ref>
