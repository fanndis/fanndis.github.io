==History==
In 1925, [[Sears]] held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen. The trademark was adopted the next year. The tires' success in the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General [[Robert E. Wood]] to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.<ref name="searshist">{{cite web|url=http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/allstate.htm|title=Allstate: 1996-1995 (Sears' divestment)|date=2006-10-31|publisher=Sears|access-date=2010-07-09| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100808201656/http://www.searsarchives.com/brands/allstate.htm| archive-date= 8 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>

The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. ''Allstate Insurance Company'', named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/The_Allstate_Corp.aspx|title=Encyclopedia- Allstate Corp.|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=2011-02-23|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628234217/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/The_Allstate_Corp.aspx|archive-date=2011-06-28}}</ref>  This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as [[Sears]] sold its merchandise.<ref>“Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years”, (Louis A. Lehr, Jr.)(Amazon), p. 26</ref>

Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.<ref name="Funding Universe">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Allstate-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=Funding Universe- The Allstate Corporation- Company History|publisher=Funding Universe|access-date=2011-02-23|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711054317/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Allstate-Corporation-Company-History.html|archive-date=2011-07-11}}</ref>

In 1933, at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, Allstate's Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.<ref name="Allstate Insurance Company Digital Newsroom ">{{cite web|url=http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/channels/History-and-Timeline/pages/history-timeline|title=Allstate Insurance Company Digital Newsroom - History and Timeline|publisher=Allstate|access-date=2011-02-17|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118011405/http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/channels/History-and-Timeline/pages/history-timeline|archive-date=2010-11-18}}</ref>

In 1941, only about a quarter of US drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />

In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-7-buildings-make-citys-most-endangered-list-20130312,0,2255252.story | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130410171557/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-7-buildings-make-citys-most-endangered-list-20130312,0,2255252.story | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-04-10 | work=Chicago Tribune | title=7 buildings make Preservation Chicago most endangered list | date=2013-03-13 }}</ref>  The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition.  The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction.  This location was vacated when the company relocated in the post-war years.

The company's "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate's general sales manager Davis W. Ellis.  At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor [[Ed Reimers]].<ref name="Funding Universe" />

Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957.  Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called [[Allstate (automobile)|Allstate]].)

In 1967, the company's home office was moved from [[Skokie, Illinois|Skokie]] to [[Northbrook, Illinois]]. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, [[surety bond]]s in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.<ref name="Funding Universe" />

The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.<ref name="searshist" /> In 1991, the company went public<ref name="history" /> before becoming completely independent in 1995.<ref name="searshist" />

In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8% of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80% stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />

In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sold 19.8% of the company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-03/business/9306030069_1_concurrent-international-offering-allstate-sears|title=Allstate Initial Offering Priced At The Top|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044451/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-03/business/9306030069_1_concurrent-international-offering-allstate-sears|archive-date=2017-12-09}}</ref>  At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.

In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of [[CNA Financial]]<ref name="Allstate-Oct-1999-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/478/89905199000014/filing-main.htm |title=Allstate, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Oct 12, 1999 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date=Jan 4, 2013 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525130051/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/478/89905199000014/filing-main.htm |archive-date=2013-05-25 }}</ref> and subsequently renamed it to [[Encompass Insurance Company]] which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.<ref name="Allstate-Nov-2000-10-Q">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2855/91205700048494/filing-main.htm |title=Allstate, Form 10-Q, Quarterly Report, Filing Date Nov 13, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |access-date=Jan 4, 2013 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525143811/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2855/91205700048494/filing-main.htm |archive-date=2013-05-25 }}</ref>

In 2010, actor [[Dean Winters]] became a part of Allstate's campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.

In May 2011, Allstate announced that it was purchasing [[Esurance]] and rate-comparison site Answer Financial for approximately $1 billion. At the time, Esurance was selling policies in 30 states and was in the midst of a five-year growth period that saw them double the number of policies in force. Allstate, for its part, was losing policy holders to the three major online policy retailers: Esurance, [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive]], and [[GEICO]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-05-18/allstate-to-buy-esurance-in-1-billion-deal-as-wilson-adds-online-sales|title = Allstate to Buy Esurance for $1 Billion to Add Online Sales|date = 18 May 2011|access-date = 29 December 2015|website = Bloomberg|last = Buhayar|first = Noah}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2011/05/18/199061.htm|title = Allstate Targets Online Insurance Sales; Buys Esurance, Answer Financial|date = 18 May 2011|access-date = 29 December 2015|website = Insurance Journal|publisher = Wells Media Group}}</ref>

== Advertising ==

==="Good hands"===
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the ''Good Hands People''.

In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate's spokesman, Ed Reimers.  Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture.  For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite news |title=Ed Reimers dies at 96; Allstate placed ad campaign in his hands |date=2008-08-18 |last=McLellan |first=Dennis |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/18/local/me-ed-reimers18 |access-date=2012-02-29 |work=Los Angeles Times |url-status = live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120229081232/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/18/local/me-ed-reimers18 |archive-date=2012-02-29 }}</ref>

A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.<ref name="Ad Slogans">{{cite news |title=2000 Advertising Slogan Hall of Fame |year=2000 |url=http://www.adslogans.co.uk/site/pages/gallery/youre-in-good-hands-with-allstate.8355.php |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229173458/http://www.adslogans.co.uk/site/pages/gallery/youre-in-good-hands-with-allstate.8355.php |archive-date=2011-12-29 }}</ref>

==="Allstate's logo"===
Allstate's original hands logo was designed by Theodore Conterio in the 1950s. The employees were told whoever could come up with the best logo would win $50. Theodore Conterio came up with the design based on the slogan, "You're in good hands," and won the $50 prize.

==="Allstate's stand"===

Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate's television commercials used spokesman [[Dennis Haysbert]]. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers GEICO and Progressive.<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news |title=Presidential Allstate ads counter the gecko |date=2004-08-15 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-08-15-allstate_x.htm |access-date=2012-02-29 |work=USA Today |first1=Theresa |last1=Howard |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007035227/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2004-08-15-allstate_x.htm |archive-date=2011-10-07 }}</ref> Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.

===Mayhem===

[[File:DeanWintersOct10.jpg|thumb|150px|right|alt=Face shot of actor Dean Winters|Actor [[Dean Winters]], who portrays the advertising character Mayhem]]

'''Mayhem''' was created by [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Choi | first=Candice | url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9J4AU1O1.htm | title=Allstate's profit surges as investments improve | work=[[Businessweek]] | date=October 27, 2010 }}</ref> Burnett pitched the character to Allstate as "Mr. Mayhem", comparing him to the character Mr. White from the 1992 film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' played by [[Harvey Keitel]].<ref name="inside">{{cite news | last=Johnson | first=Steve | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-01/entertainment/ct-live-0602-allstate-mayhem-ads-20110601_1_allstate-s-mayhem-ads-leo-burnett | title=Behind the scenes with Allstate's Mayhem man | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=June 1, 2011 }}</ref>

Mayhem has been played by [[Dean Winters]] since the campaign was launched in April 2010. The character wears a black suit, white dress shirt, and black necktie and his face is usually bruised, scarred, or wearing a butterfly bandage.

The formula for almost every Mayhem commercial has been the same. To begin the commercial, Mayhem identifies the risk he is portraying. He gives context into the situation and hints at an impending disaster that he will cause, which then takes place. For instance, a 2015 ad features Mayhem playing a portable grill hastily loaded into a car before being fully extinguished, which leads to an explosion when the still-burning embers ignite an enormous bottle of lighter fluid.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.allstate.com/advertising.aspx?lid=Tools/Resources%7CAdvertising | title = Check out Allstate's latest TV commercials | work = Allstate | publisher = Allstate Insurance Company | access-date = 13 January 2016}}</ref> Once the disaster's end result is revealed, Mayhem warns that certain "cut-rate" policies lack coverage for the situation he has caused, advising the viewers to get their insurance policies through Allstate. Each commercial ends with Mayhem telling the viewers that by having Allstate, they will be "better protected from mayhem...like me." Damage to his clothing and injuries to his person carry over from one commercial to the next.

In some ads, Mayhem also has advised against going without roadside assistance. In separate advertisements, he described what could happen in the face of a catastrophe while driving; these consisted of having to stay in a creepy roadside motel overnight because one's car ran out of fuel, being forced to change a tire in a heavy downpour, being forced to stay at an awkward family gathering because one's car battery died, and potentially becoming a victim of crime due to a breakdown in the wrong neighborhood.

A series of ads in early 2018 featured Mayhem with a New Year's resolution to help keep people and property safe.<ref name=Mayhem-New-Year>{{cite news | url = https://www.marketingdive.com/news/allstates-mayhem-falls-short-of-his-new-years-goals-in-latest-ad/514339/ | title = Allstate's 'Mayhem' falls short of his New Year's goals in latest ad | first = Natalie | last = Koltun | date = 9 January 2018 | work = Marketing Dive | publisher = Industry Dive | access-date = 10 July 2018}}</ref> He took the role of various pieces of safety equipment, such as a [[lightning rod]] mounted on a house's roof to protect it during storms or a [[flare]] placed to warn drivers of a roadside vehicle breakdown.<ref name=Mayhem-New-Year /> However, less than a month into the new year, he broke his resolution and returned to his old habit of causing chaos and damage.<ref name=Mayhem-New-Year />

Allstate developed the campaign "Mayhem" and the character (Mayhem) in response to being ranked fourth in advertising spending behind [[Geico]], [[State Farm]], and [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive]]. Allstate had an existing campaign called "Our Stand" featuring [[Dennis Haysbert]] that targeted "older, more traditional customers", and the company sought to develop a campaign that would skew toward younger customers.<ref name="inside" /> Nina Abnee, executive vice president at Burnett, said "We wanted to kick [[Flo (Progressive)|Flo's]] ass."<ref>{{cite news | last=Schultz | first=E.J. | url=http://adage.com/article/news/insurance-industry-s-4-billion-advertising-brawl/148992/ | title=How the Insurance Industry Got Into a $4 Billion Ad Brawl | work=[[Advertising Age]] | date=February 21, 2011 }}</ref> The campaign was first launched in mid-June 2010. The character was featured in TV and radio spots as well as on billboards and Internet banners. Some ads were adjusted to capture local details. By mid-2011, Allstate had won around 80 industry awards for the campaign.<ref name="inside" />

==Recognition==
''Advertising Age'' reported in February 2011 that Mayhem rose to third as most-recognized insurance advertising character, behind the [[Geico gecko]] and [[Flo (Progressive Insurance)|Flo]] from [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Insurance]]. An online survey showed that the Geico gecko and Flo were each tied to their respective companies over 90% of the time. For Mayhem, the ''Age'' said, "After the top two, the most-recognized ad description was Allstate, with 65% of consumers saying they knew the ad. When those same consumers were asked to associate it with a brand, 63% correctly matched Mayhem with Allstate. Overall, among the total sample, Mayhem clocked in with only 41% of respondents being able to link him to Allstate.<ref>{{cite news | last=Pollack | first=Judann | url=http://adage.com/article/news/insurance-ad-war-consumers/148994/ | title=In the Insurance Ad War, Consumers Ask: Who's Who? | work=[[Advertising Age]] | date=February 21, 2011 }}</ref>
===Social media===
In January 2011, Allstate released ''The Lines'',<ref>Allstate produced tv drama web series "The Lines" {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXPWdqaiGeY |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-01 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721062400/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXPWdqaiGeY |archive-date=2017-07-21 }}</ref> a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving ([[Texting while driving]] in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road safety in general. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

==Criticism==
In July 2008, the [[American Association for Justice]] ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers.  This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/07/09/allstate-gets-a-spanking/ | first = Erik | last = Wemple | date = 9 July 2008 | publisher = Washington City Paper | title = Allstate Gets a Spanking | access-date = 2010-07-21 |url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605084219/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/07/09/allstate-gets-a-spanking/ | archive-date = 5 June 2011 }}</ref> Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law."<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/07/07/daily50.html Phoenix Business Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713092702/http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/07/07/daily50.html |date=2008-07-13 }}: "American Association of Justice ranks Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers"</ref>

In 2009, Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/19/news/companies/allstate_tarp.reut/index.htm | title = Allstate: No thanks to TARP money | date = May 19, 2009 | publisher = money.cnn.com | access-date = 2010-07-21 |url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110113031143/https://money.cnn.com/2009/05/19/news/companies/allstate_tarp.reut/index.htm | archive-date = January 13, 2011 }}</ref>

===Auto insurance claims===
An investigative report in February 2007 by [[CNN]] found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting [[vehicle insurance|auto insurance]] claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.<ref name="cnn-20070209">In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time-consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting its assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible.{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/09/insurance.hardball/index.html |title=Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims |publisher=CNN |date=2007-02-09 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324210950/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/09/insurance.hardball/index.html |archive-date=2010-03-24 }}</ref>  In 2010 Allstate commanded 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autoinsurancetips.com/good-deal-auto-insurance-how-find-best-affordable-coverage|title=A Good Deal on Auto Insurance: How to Find the Best Affordable Coverage|publisher=AutoInsuranceTips.com|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114072340/http://autoinsurancetips.com/good-deal-auto-insurance-how-find-best-affordable-coverage|archive-date=2010-01-14}}</ref>

===Catastrophe exposure management===
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in [[hurricane]]-prone [[Florida]]. In November 2006, the company did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor [[Charlie Crist]] and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from not renewing policies.<ref name="garcia">{{cite news |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16744640.htm |title=Date set for insurance rate filings; Insurers can resume policy cancellations as soon as they file required rate reductions in mid-March |author=Garcia, Beatrice E. |publisher=The Miami Herald |date=2007-02-21 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner [[Kevin McCarty]] clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ruling: Insurers can drop policies |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=2007-02-20 |last=Zucco |first=Tom |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/20/Business/Ruling__Insurers_can_.shtml |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222091757/http://www.sptimes.com/2007/02/20/Business/Ruling__Insurers_can_.shtml |archive-date=2007-02-22 }}</ref>

===''From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves''===
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by [[Eugene Anderson|Eugene R. Anderson]].<ref>{{cite book | title = From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves: How Allstate Changed Casualty Insurance in America | last = David | first = Berardinelli | first2 =  Michael | last2 = Freeman | publisher = Trial Guides | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-9743248-9-2 }}</ref>

The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm [[McKinsey & Company]] presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as [[Enron]]) to maximize profits. McKinsey's recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourlawyer.com/articles/title/allstate-state-farm-other-bad-faith-insurance-companies-rack-up-record-profits-by-cheating-customers |title=Allstate, State Farm, Other Bad Faith Insurance Companies Rack up Record Profits by Cheating Customers |publisher=Parker Waichman LLP |date=2007-08-03 |access-date=2017-05-17 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The book was reviewed by ''Business Week'' magazine.<ref name=bw>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm |title= In Tough Hands At Allstate  |publisher=Business Week |date=2006-05-01 |access-date=2010-07-21| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714054219/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm| archive-date= 14 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>  According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."<ref name=bw/>

Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'"  While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.<ref name=bw/>

===Use of Colossus===
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims.  In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used.  It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.<ref>{{cite news |date= October 19, 2010|title= Allstate Will Pay $10 Million|url= http://www.buffalonews.com/business/article224099.ece|work= The Buffalo News|location= Buffalo, NY|access-date= January 6, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111116054902/http://www.buffalonews.com/business/article224099.ece|archive-date= November 16, 2011}}
