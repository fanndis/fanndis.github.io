'''Yale Law School''' (often referred to as '''Yale Law''' or '''YLS''') is the [[law school]] of [[Yale University]], located in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Established in 1824, it has been the top-ranked law school in the [[United States]] by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' every year since the magazine began publishing [[law school rankings in the United States|law school rankings]] in the 1980s.<ref>[http://www.abajournal.com/weekly/its_official_yale_law_school_tops_us_news_rankings ABA Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716225349/http://www.abajournal.com/weekly/its_official_yale_law_school_tops_us_news_rankings |date=2012-07-16 }}, "It's Official: Yale Law School Tops US News Rankings," April 23, 2009 (2010 rankings).

The school's small size and prestige make its admissions process the most selective of any law school in the United States, with an acceptance rate of 6.7% in the 2017-18 cycle.<ref name="yale.edu">{{cite web|url=https://law.yale.edu/admissions/profiles-statistics/entering-class-profile|title=Entering Class Profile - Yale Law School|website=law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ilrg.com/rankings/law/1/asc/Accept |title=2017 Raw Data Law School Rankings: Acceptance Rate (Low to High) |publisher=Internet Legal Research Group |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name="tippingthescales.com">{{cite web|url=http://tippingthescales.com/2016/03/yale-crowned-top-law-school-2017-u-s-news-ranking/|title=Yale Crowned Top Law School In 2017 U.S. News Ranking |accessdate=October 2, 2016}}</ref> Its [[Yield (college admissions)|yield rate]] of 85% is consistently the highest of any law school in the United States.<ref name="yale.edu"/>

Yale Law has produced a [[list of Yale Law School alumni|significant number of luminaries]] in law and politics, including [[President of the United States|United States presidents]] [[Gerald Ford]], [[Bill Clinton]] and former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. secretary of state]] and presidential nominee, [[Hillary Clinton]]. Alumni also include current United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justices]] [[Clarence Thomas]], [[Samuel Alito]], [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]], as well as a number of former justices, including [[Abe Fortas]], [[Potter Stewart]] and [[Byron White]]; several heads of state around the world, including [[Karl Carstens]], the fifth [[president of Germany]], [[Jose P. Laurel]], the third president of the Republic of the [[Philippines]]; and [[Peter Mutharika]], the immediate former [[president of Malawi]]; five current U.S. senators; the former [[Jerry Brown|governor of California]] and current [[Gina Raimondo|governor of Rhode Island]]; and the current [[dean (education)|deans]] of three of the top fourteen-ranked law schools in the United States: [[University of Virginia School of Law|Virginia]], [[Cornell Law School|Cornell]], and [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown]].

Each class in Yale Law's three-year J.D. program enrolls approximately 200 students. Yale's flagship [[law review]] is the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', one of the most highly cited legal publications in the United States.

According to Yale Law School's [[American Bar Association|ABA]]-required disclosures, 83% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required or JD-advantage employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.[https://law.yale.edu/student-life/career-development/employment-data/class-2018-employment]

== Culture ==
[[File:Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building.jpg|thumb|Yale Law School is housed in the [[Sterling Law Building]], erected in 1931. Modeled after the English [[Inns of Court]], the law building is located at the heart of Yale's campus and contains a law library, a dining hall, and a courtyard.]]

The institution is known for its scholarly orientation; a relatively large number of its graduates (9%) choose careers in academia within five years of graduation, while a relatively low number (46%) choose to work in law firms five years after graduation.<ref>[https://www.law.yale.edu/student-life/career-development/employment-data/5th-year-career-development-survey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218024134/https://www.law.yale.edu/student-life/career-development/employment-data/5th-year-career-development-survey |date=December 18, 2015 }}</ref> Another feature of Yale Law's culture since the 1930s, among both faculty and student graduates, has been an emphasis on the importance of spending at least a few years in government service.<ref>[https://www.law.yale.edu/yls-today/news/yale-law-school-expands-public-interest-program-financial-support-graduates Statement of Dean Harold H. Koh], "Yale Law School Expands Public Interest Program, Financial Support for Graduates," April 14, 2008.</ref> A similar emphasis has long been placed on service as a judicial [[law clerk]] upon graduation.<ref>[http://www.top-law-schools.com/yale-law-school.html Top-law-schools].com.</ref> Its 7.6:1 student-to-faculty ratio is the third lowest among U.S. law schools.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yale University |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/yale-university-03027 |title=Yale University &#124; Best Law School &#124; US News |publisher=Grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}</ref>

Yale Law does not have a traditional grading system, a consequence of student unrest in the late 1960s.<ref>Kalman, Laura, ''Yale Law School and the Sixties: Revolt and Reverberations'' (Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 2005)</ref> Instead, it grades first-semester first-year students on a simple Credit/No Credit system. For their remaining two-and-a-half years, students are graded on an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail system. Similarly, the school does not rank its students. It is also notable for having only a single semester of required classes (plus two additional writing requirements), instead of the full year most U.S. schools require. Unusually, and as a result of unique Connecticut State court rules, Yale Law allows first-year students to represent clients through one of its numerous clinics; other law schools typically offer this opportunity only to second- and third-year students.

Students publish nine [[law review|law journals]] that, unlike those at most other schools, mostly accept student editors without a competition. The only exception is YLS's flagship journal, the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'', which holds a two-part admissions competition each spring, consisting of a four or five-hour "[[bluebook]]ing exam," followed by a traditional writing competition. Although the ''Journal'' identifies a target maximum number of members to accept each year, it is not a firm number. Other leading student-edited publications include the ''[[Yale Journal on Regulation]]'', the ''[[Yale Law and Policy Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Journal of International Law]]''.

In November 2013, it was announced that a $25 million donation would bring student dormitory living back onto campus, with renovations to begin in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yale Law Will Bring Back Dorms Thanks To $25M Donation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/07/yale-law-dorms-donation_n_4234910.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=8 November 2013|first=Tyler|last=Kingkade|date=2013-11-07}}</ref>

== Rankings and reputation ==
Yale Law has been ranked the number one law school in the country by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' in every year in which the magazine has published law school rankings.<ref>[http://www.top-law-schools.com/yale-law-school.html 2009 Top-law-schools.com] ("Since US News began ranking schools, Yale Law School has always held the #1 position....").

== History ==

{{recentism|date=July 2015}}
The School began in the New Haven law office of [[Seth P. Staples]] in the 1800s, who began training lawyers.  By 1810 he was operating a law school.  He took on a former student, Samuel J. Hitchcock as a law partner, and Hitchcock became the proprietor of the '''New Haven Law School''', joined by [[David Daggett]] in 1824. (The Yale Law School shield, shown at the upper right of this page, shows staples and a rampant dog, representing Seth Staples and David Daggett.) The school's affiliation with Yale began in the mid-1820s and in 1843, the school's students began receiving Yale degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.yale.edu/about-yale-law-school/glance/our-history |title=Our History – Yale Law School |publisher=Law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-02-08}}</ref>

=== Legal Realism movement ===
Beginning in this period, a special relationship or connection developed between YLS and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. Professors Clark and Frank, among others, became judges on that court. Some of the faculty members who became Second Circuit judges continued to teach courses at YLS and chose their clerks from student graduates. These judges influenced thinking in general at YLS and particularly reinforced student interest in public service, a characteristic tradition at YLS since the [[New Deal]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Early 21st century ===
The law school's 15th dean, [[Harold Koh]] (2004–2009), made [[human rights]] a focus of the law school's work, building on a tradition that had developed over the previous two decades. On March 23, 2009, the White House announced the appointment of Koh to the [[United States Department of State]] as the [[Legal Adviser of the Department of State]]. [[Robert Post (law professor)|Robert C. Post]] was selected to replace him as dean of the law school.<ref>[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/06/22/robert-post-law-77-named-law-school-dean/ Robert Post LAW ’77 named Law School dean | Yale Daily News].

== Admissions ==
Yale Law School enrolls about 200 new students a year, one of the smallest numbers among U.S. law schools. Its small class size and prestige combine to make its admissions process the most competitive in the United States. Half of the class that entered in 2015 had a GPA above 3.93 and/or an [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] score above 173 (on a possible scale of 120 to 180) or 99th percentile.<ref>{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2015-11-26 }}</ref>

After an initial round of screening by the admissions department, approximately 25% of applications are independently evaluated by three different faculty members. Each application is scored from 2–4 at the discretion of the reader. All applicants with a perfect 12 (i.e., a 4 from all three faculty members) are admitted, upon which they are immediately notified by the school. There are also 50–80 outstanding students admitted each year without going through this review process.<ref>{{cite web

The LL.M. Program and the Visiting Researchers Program at Yale Law are amongst the smallest and most selective graduate law programs in the United States. Yale Law admits around 25 LL.M. students and around 10 visiting researchers every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/printer/bulletin/pdffiles/law.pdf?|title=– p. 141|publisher=}}</ref> These programs are usually limited to those students who intend to pursue a career in legal academia.

Yale Law admitted only men until 1918.<ref>Stevens, Robert Bocking. ''Law school: legal education in America from the 1850s to the 1980s'' p. 84.
