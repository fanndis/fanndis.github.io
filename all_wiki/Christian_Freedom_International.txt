'''Christian Freedom International''' (CFI) is an international human rights organization that "helps those who are [[Persecution of Christians|persecuted for their faith]] in [[Jesus Christ]]." It is based in [[Front Royal, Virginia]].  

Christian Freedom International aids, equips, and advocates for persecuted Christians.  It provides spiritual and material support, such as Bibles and Bible training, food and medical aid, schools and training, churches and shelters, and runs programs such as child sponsorships and microenterprise.

Christian Freedom International runs micro-enterprises to provide incomes for Christian refugees. "Freedom Fighters" is a T-shirt-of-the-month club that provides jobs and training for Christian refugees and produces a new t-shirt design every month. A Center for the Blind and Disabled in Bangladesh is stocked with sewing machines and candle-making tools for Christians with disabilities to make items to sell.

The Freedom Inn in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, was established as affordable housing for Karen (Burma) Christian refugees in the U.S. The renovated motel was remodeled into apartments, and the pool transformed into a garden. Freedom Inn became a base for community volunteers to help refugees to assimilate and become U.S. citizens. 

Christian Freedom International is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization and relies on voluntary, private support from individual donors and churches throughout the United States.

Christian Freedom International originated from the Swiss-based organization Christian Solidarity International and established official independence as Christian Freedom International on April 24, 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=4944&PrintVersion=True|title=Christian Freedom International (Accredited Organization Profile) - ECFA.org|website=www.ecfa.org|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>  James Jacobson, a former policy analyst in the Reagan administration, was president from 1998 to 2017.

==Advocacy==
Christian Freedom International works to increase understanding and awareness of the worldwide persecution of Christians, how Christians live under persecution, and how people can help. CFI mobilizes Christians to pray and advocate for victims of persecution and designs materials for churches to participate in the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church.

One of CFI's largest advocacy campaigns involved the 2006 decision by the U.S. State Department to allow the resettlement of persecuted refugees from [[Burma]] into the United States.  After months of political indecision and a final waiver of restrictions under the Immigration Nationality Act, the State Department approved the applications of thousands of refugees that were seeking asylum in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://share.america.gov/|title=ShareAmerica {{!}} Connect with America|website=ShareAmerica|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>
