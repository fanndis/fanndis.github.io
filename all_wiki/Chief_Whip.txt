The '''Chief Whip''' is a political office whose task is to administer the [[Whip (politics)|whipping system]] that tries to ensure that members of the [[Political party|party]] attend and vote as the party leadership desires.

== United Kingdom ==

In [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]], the Chief Whip of the governing party in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is usually also appointed as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury]], a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] position. The Government Chief Whip has an official residence at [[12 Downing Street]]. However, the Chief Whip's office is currently located at [[9 Downing Street]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1339750/Campbell-ousts-the-Chief-Whip.html|title=Campbell ousts the Chief Whip | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|first=Sarah|last=Womack|date=7 September 2001|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

The Chief Whip can wield great power over their party's MPs, including cabinet ministers, being seen to speak at all times with the voice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] was famed for using her Chief Whip as a "cabinet enforcer".

The role of Chief Whip is regarded as secretive, as the Whip is concerned with the discipline of their own party's [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] and never appears on television or radio in their capacity as whip. An exception occurred on 1 April 2019 when [[Julian Smith (politician)|Julian Smith]] chose to criticize his own government and Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cappuro|first=Daniel|title=''Julian Smith: The beleaguered Chief Whip with a long record of mistakes''|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/01/julian-smith-beleaguered-chief-whip-long-record-mistakes/|date=1 April 2019|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=1 April 2019}}</ref>

Another exception was [[Andrew Mitchell]], the Government Chief Whip in 2012, who appeared on television to deny remarks made about himself.

Whips in the House of Commons do not, by convention, speak in debates.

The Government Chief Whip is assisted by the Deputy Chief Whip, other whips, and assistant whips. In order to give them a salary for what is, in essence, a party office, the government whips are appointed to positions in [[HM Treasury]] and in the [[Royal Household]] under the [[Lord Steward|Lord Steward of the Household]]. The whips are not fully active in either of these departments, though do undertake a number of responsibilities. The Deputy Chief Whip is [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer of HM Household]], the next two whips are [[Comptroller of the Household|Comptroller of HM Household]] and [[Vice-Chamberlain of the Household|Vice-Chamberlain of HM Household]], and the remaining whips are [[Lord High Treasurer|Lords Commissioners of the Treasury]]. Assistant whips, and whips of opposition parties, generally do not receive such appointments. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords also holds the role of [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]], while the Government Deputy Chief Whip in the Lords holds the role of [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard]]. 

Outside the government, the Official Opposition Chief Whip in the Commons, like the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], receives a stipend in addition to their parliamentary salary, because their additional responsibilities will make them unable to hold down another job.

The whips, although superficially dictatorial, act as communicators between [[backbencher]]s and the party leadership. Ultimately if backbenchers are unhappy with the leadership's position they can threaten to revolt during a vote and force the leadership to compromise.

While the whip was formally introduced to British politics by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] in the 1880s,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} in 1846 the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] advised the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] to ensure that his "whippers-in" were personally loyal.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===The whip as a party line===

In the UK Parliament the importance of a vote is indicated by underlining of items on the "whip", which is the name of the letter the Chief Whip sends to all the MPs in their party at the start of the week. This letter informs them of the schedule for the days ahead, and includes the sentence, "Your attendance is absolutely essential" next to each debate in which there will be a vote. This sentence is underlined once, twice or three times depending on the consequences that will be suffered if they do not turn up, hence the origin of the terms ''one-line whip'', ''two-line whip'' and ''three-line whip''. The actual vote they are to make is communicated to them in the chamber by hand signals during the division when the time comes (usually after the [[division bell]] has been rung). Even though it is more important to the result of any division than the debate, neither these instructions, which are visible to everyone in the chamber, nor the "whip" letter at the start of the week, are recorded in ''[[Hansard]]'', as they are considered a matter internal to the [[political party]]; indeed, the system exists because any explicit direction to an MP as to how they should vote would be a breach of [[parliamentary privilege]].

The consequences of defying the party whip depend on the circumstances, and are usually negotiated with the party whip in advance. The party whip's job is to ensure the outcome of the vote, so the situation is different and more important for a party which holds the majority, because if their members obey the whip they can always win.

If the party has a large Commons majority, it can make allowances for MPs who are away on important business, or whose political circumstances require them to take a particular issue very seriously. Theoretically at least, expulsion from the party is an automatic consequence of defying a three-line whip.

Other such offences include betraying party loyalties. An example of this during [[John Major]]'s government was when nine Conservative MPs had the whip removed after voting against the government on its stance on the [[Maastricht Treaty]], becoming known as Eurosceptics. In practice they remained Conservative MPs supporting the government on other issues. Sir Bill Cash, John Redwood and [[Iain Duncan Smith]] are still Conservative MPs. This was also the only time when MPs who were being whipped were cooperating with the opposite side's whips. In most cases the 'pairing' system enables one from each side to cancel out the other's vote if absent simultaneously. Yet despite the whip, individuals are entitled to vote according to their own beliefs, particularly when there is a "free vote" on a matter of conscience.{{efn| example of this can be a vote to bring back Hanging as a Death Penalty.}} There are some cases in which the whip is removed because an issue is a matter of conscience. These include adoption, religion and equal opportunities. The impact of a whip being imposed on a matter of conscience can be damaging for a party leader. One such case was that of Iain Duncan Smith, who imposed a three-line whip against the adoption of children by unmarried couples (which at the time meant gay couples could never adopt). Several [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs voted against the official party line, and Smith's authority was weakened.

Whips can often be brutal to backbenchers to secure their vote, and will resort to a mixture of promises, cajoling and persuading to force an unpopular vote. A whip should know major figures in an MP's local [[constituency]] party and the MP's agent. There have been cases where sick MPs were wheeled into the House from far afield to vote for the government on a crucial vote. Former MP [[Joe Ashton]] recalled a case from the dying days of [[James Callaghan]]'s government:

<blockquote>"I remember the famous case of [[Leslie Spriggs]], the then-Member for St. Helens. We had a tied vote and he was brought to the House in an ambulance having suffered a severe heart attack. The two Whips went out to look in the ambulance and there was Leslie Spriggs laid there as though he was dead. I believe that [[John Stradling Thomas]] said to [[Joseph Harper (British politician)|Joe Harper]], 'How do we know that he is alive?' So he leaned forward, turned the knob on the heart machine, the green light went around, and he said, 'There, you've lostâ€”it's 311.' That is an absolutely true story. It is the sort of nonsense that used to happen. No one believes it, but it is true."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970604/debtext/70604-49.htm#70604-49_para20|title=Hansard 14 July 1997, Column 507, Paragraph 20.}}</ref></blockquote>

For a [[Minister (government)|minister]], the consequences of defying the party whip are absolute: they are dismissed from their job immediately if they have not already resigned, and return to being a backbencher. Sometimes their votes in Parliament are called the "[[payroll vote]]", because they can be taken for granted. The consequences for a back-bencher can include the lack of future promotion to a government post, a reduction of party campaigning effort in his or her constituency during the next election, deselection by his or her local party activists, or, in extreme circumstances, "withdrawal of the whip" and expulsion from the party.

A similar arrangement exists for whips in the [[House of Lords]]. The Government Chief Whip is usually appointed [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]], while the Deputy Chief Whip is usually appointed [[Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard|Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard]]. Other whips, who are fewer in number due to the decreased importance of party discipline in the Lords, are appointed as [[Lord-in-waiting|Lords in Waiting]] if men and Baronesses in Waiting if women. As well as their duties as whips, Lords whips speak in the chamber (unlike Commons whips) to support departmental ministers or act as a spokesperson for government departments with no minister in the Lords.

=== Principal Private Secretary to the Chief Whip ===
The Government Chief Whip's office is headed by a [[Principal Private Secretary]], who also acts as a go-between for ministers and the opposition to keep parliamentary business moving. The first office-holder, [[Charles Harris (civil servant, born 1901)|Charles Harris]], was appointed privately in 1919 to assist Lord Edmund Talbot, the Conservative chief whip. He was retained by successive Conservative chief whips on a private basis, serving as their secretary during periods when the party was in government (1922â€“23, 1924â€“29 and 1935 onwards) until 1939, when the post formally became part of the civil service (as Assistant to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury) and Harris was appointed into it, with a salary of Â£850.<ref name=":0">[[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]], [https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-39577 "Harris, Sir Charles Joseph William"], ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (online ed., [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004). Retrieved 20 November 2019.</ref> He retired in 1961 and was succeeded by [[Freddie Warren (civil servant)|Freddie Warren]]; all subsequent appointees have been permanent civil servants.

== India ==
In [[Politics of India|India]], the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party's discipline and behaviour on the floor of the [[Parliament of India|house]]. Usually, he/she directs the party members to stick to the party's stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members.<ref name="Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha">{{cite news|title=Derek O'Brien is TMC's Chief Whip in Rajya Sabha|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook India]]|date=2 Aug 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014225153/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=770815|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="leaders and chief whip act">{{cite web|title=leaders and chief whips of recognised parties and groups in parliament (facilities) act, 1998 |url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf |publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat |accessdate=3 August 2012 |archivedate=3 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69dRYMQuE?url=http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/msa_section/leader_chief1998.pdf |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> However, there are some cases such as Indian presidential election where no whip can be issued directing [[Member of Parliament]] or [[Member of Legislative Assembly]] on whom to vote.<ref name="Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC">{{cite news|title=Issuing whips to MPs, MLAs in Presidential poll is an offence: EC|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/india/32617646_1_presidential-poll-mps-and-mlas-electoral-college|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=10 Jul 2012}}</ref>
