For example - The Syrian Government and SDF are, as of early 2020, not only working together, but also sharing control of several territories.

On the other hand, Turkey is no longer hostile to just the PKK, but has conducted offensives against the larged SDF as a whole.

The Free Syrian Army has long since stopped being an organization, and has instead become a title adopted by various groups with oftentimes conflicting agendas.

'''Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War''' refers to political, military and operational support to parties involved in the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War|conflict in Syria]] that began in March 2011, as well as active foreign involvement. Most parties involved in the war in Syria receive various types of support from foreign countries and entities based outside Syria.

The [[Council of Ministers (Syria)|Syrian Ba'athist government]] is politically and militarily supported by [[Iran]] and [[Russia]], and actively supported by the Lebanese [[Hezbollah]] group, the Syrian-based Palestinian group [[PFLP-GC]], and others. Since 30 September 2015, Russia, the only foreign power that has its military assets openly and legally [[Khmeimim airbase|stationed in Syria]], wages an intensive [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|air campaign]] against anti-government forces in Syria, on the side of and at the request of the Syrian government. The military activity of Russia in Syria has been criticized by the US and its regional allies; Turkey overtly [[Russia–Turkey relations#2015 jet shootdown incident|clashed]] with the Russian military in November 2015 over the alleged [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown|violation of its airspace]] by a Russian plane, as well as over Russia′s bombardment of the areas held by anti-government forces that are supported by Turkey.<ref name="Bayirbucak">{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-condemns-attack-on-syrian-turkmen-village-summons-russian-envoy-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=91459&NewsCatID=352|title=Turkey condemns attack on Syrian Turkmen village, summons Russian envoy|agency=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116011639/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-condemns-attack-on-syrian-turkmen-village-summons-russian-envoy-.aspx?pageID=238&nID=91459&NewsCatID=352|archive-date=16 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Syrian opposition]], politically represented by the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces|Syrian National Coalition]], receives financial, logistical, political and in some cases military support from major [[Sunni]] states in the [[Middle East]] allied with the U.S., most notably [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], and [[Turkey]]. From the early stages of the conflict in Syria, major Western countries such as the U.S, France, and the UK have provided political, military and logistic support to the opposition and its associated rebel groups in Syria.

The [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] of the [[Executive Council (Rojava)]], the government of [[Rojava]], have received military and logistic support from some [[NATO]] countries, the US in particular. Since July 2015, it has been attacked by the [[Turkish military]] and the [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army]], leading to the [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria]].

As a significant part of Syria′s territory was from 2014 until October 2017 [[ISIL territorial claims|controlled]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), an entity internationally [[List of designated terrorist groups|recognised as terrorist]], a number of Western and other countries, most notably the U.S., Russia, Britain, and France, have participated in direct [[Military intervention against ISIL|military action against ISIL]] in both Syria and [[Iraq]].

In 2013, the UK government revealed that British companies sold [[sodium fluoride]], which has many civil applications such as [[water fluoridation]], but is also a key ingredient in the manufacture of [[sarin]], to a Syrian firm before the conflict, from 2004 to 2010. Between July 2004 and May 2010, the British government issued five export licenses to two companies, with the last export license was issued in May 2010. The licenses are obtained prior to manufacture and the industry standard requires four to five months before the chemicals are delivered, thus allowing them to sell Syria sodium fluoride.<ref name="Norton-Taylor 2013">{{cite web | last=Norton-Taylor | first=Richard | title=UK approved more chemical exports to Syria than previously revealed | website=the Guardian | date=2013-09-11 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/uk-officials-chemical-exports-syria | access-date=2020-12-02}}</ref> In 2014, the UK government said that these chmicals had probably been used to manufacture chemical weapons used during the war.<ref name="Hopkins 2014">{{cite web | last=Hopkins | first=Nick | title=Syrian conflict: Key sarin ingredients sold by UK firms | website=BBC News | date=2014-07-09 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28212724 | access-date=2020-12-02}}</ref>

On 24 December 2014, a Jordanian fighter jet was shot down over Syria and its pilot, [[Royal Jordanian Air Force|Jordanian Air Force]] lieutenant [[Muath Al-Kasasbeh]], captured. This pilot was executed by burning in January 2015 and was later used to attempt to recover jailed terrorists. Jordan offered to make the exchange, but demanded "proof of life" first, this wasn't done, and the video of the pilot's execution was released. In response, the terrorists, [[Sajida al-Rishawi]] and [[Ziad Khalaf Raja al-Karbouly|Ziad al-Karbouli]], were executed<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/02/03/islamic-state-jordanian-pilot/22798055/ |title=Jordan executes two in response to pilot's slaying |last1=Michaels |first1=Jim |last2=Bacon |first2=John |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=Gannett Company |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=9 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418055139/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/02/03/islamic-state-jordanian-pilot/22798055/ |archive-date=18 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> and Jordan took the lead on anti-ISIL bombing raids, claiming nearly a thousand militants were killed by air strikes in a week.

=====Croatian weapons=====
In December 2012, a new wave of weapons from foreign supporters were transferred to rebel forces via the Jordanian border in the country's south. The arms included [[M79 Osa]] anti-tank weapons and M-60 [[recoilless rifle]]s purchased by Saudi Arabia from Croatia. Previously, most of the weapons were delivered via the Turkish border in the north. However, much of the arms unintentionally ended up in the hands of Islamist rebels.

=====Bandar bin Sultan=====
In August 2013 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Saudi Prince [[Bandar bin Sultan]] had been appointed to lead Saudi Arabia's efforts to topple Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]], and that the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] considered this a sign of how serious Saudi Arabia was about this aim. Bandar was described as "jetting from covert command centers near the Syrian front lines to the Élysée Palace in Paris and the Kremlin in Moscow, seeking to undermine the Assad regime." After tensions with [[Qatar]] over supplying rebel groups, Saudi Arabia switched its efforts from Turkey to Jordan in 2012, using its financial leverage over Jordan to develop training facilities there, overseen by Bandar's half-brother [[Salman bin Sultan]]. In late 2012 Saudi intelligence also began efforts to convince the US that the Assad government was using chemical weapons.<ref>ADAM ENTOUS, NOUR MALAS and MARGARET COKER, ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 25 August 2013, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323423804579024452583045962 A Veteran Saudi Power Player Works To Build Support to Topple Assad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412023555/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323423804579024452583045962 |date=12 April 2017 }}</ref> The Saudi government also would be sending prisoners sentenced to death to fight in Syria.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Shamus|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/21/saudi-inmates-fight-syria-commute-death-sentences/1852629/|title=Report: Saudis sent death-row inmates to fight Syria|publisher=USA tODAY|accessdate=12 September 2013|date=21 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921174956/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/01/21/saudi-inmates-fight-syria-commute-death-sentences/1852629/|archive-date=21 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Support for Rojava==
{{further|Foreign relations of Rojava|Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve}}
The [[Rojava conflict]] has seen substantial military and logistic support from the [[Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve]] (CJTF–OIR) coalition for the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] (SDF) since 2014. The SDF has been strongly supported with foreign air power in the [[Rojava-Islamist conflict]], but not when [[Turkish_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Turkey_and_Rojava|it has fought Turkey]], a [[NATO]] ally of many of the members of the CJTF–OIR coalition. Diplomatic support for [[Rojava]] has been limited, with the [[Syrian Democratic Council]] usually uninvited to the various international negotiations around the [[Syrian peace process]].

In April 2016 a [[France 24]] documentary reported the presence of [[Special Operations Command (France)|French]], [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British]], and [[US special forces]] cooperating with the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] to coordinate [[airstrike]]s against ISIL during the [[al-Shaddadi offensive (2016)]] in February.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aftoBdrjm7Q|title=EXCLUSIVE: Interethnic coalition takes on the IS group in Syria|work=France 24 (Youtube)|date=22 April 2016|access-date=23 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428124724/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aftoBdrjm7Q|archive-date=28 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 2011, Lebanon has absorbed [[Syrian refugees]] as well as provided humanitarian aid. According to the UNHCR, there were over 1&nbsp;million Syrian refugees who had been registered in Lebanon in 2016.<ref name="UNHCR-Lebanon">{{cite web|url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122|title=UNHCR Syria Regional Refugee Response/ Lebanon|date=18 March 2015|work=[[UNHCR]]|accessdate=21 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626091416/http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=122|archive-date=26 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, this figure is likely largely underestimated since the UNHCR has stopped registering new Syrian refugees since May 2015 and it doesn't include individuals awaiting to be registered.<ref name="UNHCR-Lebanon" /> Hence, precise figures of the number of Syrian people in Lebanon don't exist currently.
