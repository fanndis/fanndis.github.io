A terrorist attack, consisting of a [[mass shooting]] and an attempted [[bombing]], occurred at the [[Inland Regional Center]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], on December 2, 2015. The perpetrators, [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik|Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik]], a married couple living in the city of [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], targeted a [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] Department of Public Health training event and Christmas party of about 80 employees in a rented banquet room. 14 people were killed and 22 others were seriously injured. Farook was a U.S.-born citizen of [[Pakistani Americans|Pakistani descent]], who worked as a [[health department]] employee. Malik was a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]]-born [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card holder]].

After the shooting, the couple fled in a rented [[Ford Expedition]] [[sport utility vehicle]] (SUV). Four hours later, police pursued their vehicle and killed them in a shootout, which also left two officers injured.

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s investigation, the perpetrators were "homegrown violent extremists" inspired by [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|foreign terrorist groups]]. They were not directed by such groups and were not part of any [[terrorist cell]] or network. FBI investigators have said that Farook and Malik had become [[Radicalization|radicalized]] over several years prior to the attack, consuming "poison on the internet" and expressing a commitment to [[jihadism]] and [[istishhad|martyrdom]] in private messages to each other. Farook and Malik had traveled to [[Saudi Arabia]] in the years before the attack. The couple had amassed a large stockpile of weapons, ammunition, and bomb-making equipment in their home.

[[#Enrique Marquez Jr.|Enrique Marquez Jr.]], a friend and former neighbor of Farook's, was investigated in connection with his purchase of the two rifles used in the attack. Marquez was arrested in December 2015, and later pleaded guilty to [[Federal crime in the United States|federal charges]] of [[providing material support for terrorism]] and making false statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm. Marquez also admitted that, in 2011, he conspired with Farook to carry out shooting and bombing attacks, plans which were abandoned at the time. Three other people, including Farook's brother and sister-in-law, were arrested for immigration fraud in connection with a [[sham marriage]] between Marquez and Mariya Chernykh (the sister-in-law of Farook's brother). All three pleaded guilty.

The attack was the deadliest [[Mass shootings in the United States|mass shooting in the U.S.]] since the 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/san-bernardino-shooting-deadliest-newtown-n473086|title=San Bernardino Shooting is Deadliest Since Newtown|first1=Jon|last1=Schuppe|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Chuck|first3=Helen|last3=Kwong|publisher=NBC News|date=December 2, 2015|access-date=December 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203122139/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/san-bernardino-shooting-deadliest-newtown-n473086|archive-date=December 3, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35006404 |title=San Bernardino shootings investigated as terrorism – FBI |publisher=BBC News |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204210558/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35006404 |archive-date=December 4, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and the deadliest terrorist attack to occur in the U.S. since the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-1227-islamic-convention-20151227-story.html|title=San Bernardino shootings cast a somber tone over Muslim conference in Chino|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 26, 2015|accessdate=December 28, 2015|first=Cindy|last=Chang|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227210417/http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-1227-islamic-convention-20151227-story.html|archive-date=December 27, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Shortly before 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m., the event went on an unscheduled break due to a technical problem. At 10:58{{nbsp}}a.m. [[Pacific Standard Time|PST]], Farook and Malik, armed with [[semi-automatic pistol]]s and [[semi-automatic rifle|rifles]], opened fire outside the building, killing two people. Farook entered the building a minute later, firing on those in attendance.

During the shooting, many of those in attendance managed to escape the room and flee deeper into the building, while those who remained hid underneath tables or in bathrooms, closets, and cupboards. A bullet hit a [[fire sprinkler]] pipe, causing water to pour down the banquet room, making it difficult to see. The perpetrators moved between tables, shooting anyone who moved or made a sound. One person was struck by a bullet that tore through an interior wall, while another was shot while trying to escape through a glass door near where the shooters had entered. Three men attempted to stop one of the shooters, but all were shot; it was unclear if any of them survived. One victim was killed while shielding a coworker with his body. Some initially mistook the attack as an [[active shooter]] drill; some previous such drills had taken place in the same banquet room.<ref name=CalmtoChaos/><ref name=NYTimes.Clicked>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/it-finally-clicked-that-this-wasnt-an-exercise-report-recounts-san-bernardino-shooting.html|url-access=subscription|title='It Finally Clicked That This Wasn't an Exercise': Report Recounts San Bernardino Shooting|work=The New York Times|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2016|first1=Richard|last1=Pérez-Peña|first2=Adam|last2=Goldman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910004731/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/us/it-finally-clicked-that-this-wasnt-an-exercise-report-recounts-san-bernardino-shooting.html|archive-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=NPR.Piercing>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504025469/san-bernardino-shootings-signs-have-faded-but-memories-remain-piercing|title=San Bernardino Shooting's Signs Have Faded, But Memories Remain Piercing|publisher=NPR|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016|first=Nathan|last=Rott|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202112441/http://www.npr.org/2016/12/02/504025469/san-bernardino-shootings-signs-have-faded-but-memories-remain-piercing|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-bernardino-terror--20160909-snap-story.html|title='The worst thing imaginable:' Bodies and blood everywhere after San Bernardino terrorist attack, DOJ report shows|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2016|accessdate=September 9, 2016|first=Joe|last=Mozingo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910002742/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-san-bernardino-terror--20160909-snap-story.html|archive-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/10/three-men-tried-to-stop-san-bernardino-attack-report-finds.html|title=Three men tried to stop San Bernardino attack, report finds|publisher=Fox News Channel|agency=Associated Press|date=September 10, 2016|accessdate=September 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910045427/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/09/10/three-men-tried-to-stop-san-bernardino-attack-report-finds.html|archive-date=September 10, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Eventually, at 3:09:22{{nbsp}}p.m., the SUV stopped in a neighborhood about {{convert|1.7|mi|km}} away from the scene of the initial attack. The couple continued to exchange fire with police from inside their vehicle.<ref name="ABC"/> Malik opened the side passenger door and shot at the first police vehicle to stop, which was about {{convert|210|ft|m}} away from the SUV. Farook exited out of the driver's front door, stood between the two open doors, and opened fire on the same vehicle.<ref name=CalmtoChaos/>

As more officers converged, Farook walked across the street towards some homes while continuing to fire, pinning officers behind their squad cars. He intended to flank the sheriff's deputy who had first stopped. Realizing this, several officers repositioned themselves and focused their gunfire on Farook. One police officer eventually shot Farook in the right side, allowing others to flank and shoot at him. Farook fell to the ground, shot several times in the legs and upper body. He fired at the police once with a handgun as he lay wounded on the ground, injuring an officer before the gun malfunctioned. Farook was shot again several times and killed.<ref name=CalmtoChaos/><ref name=PE.Horror/> His body was handcuffed and positioned to lie face-down afterwards.<ref name=CalmtoChaos/>

Officers then fired on the SUV as Malik continued to shoot at them. During this exchange of gunfire, a second police officer was wounded.

The same day, Apple revealed that it had discussed with the FBI four methods to access data in the iPhone in early January, but one of the more promising methods was ruled out by a mistake during the investigation of the attack. After the shooter's phone had been recovered, the FBI asked San Bernardino County, the owner of the phone, to reset the password to the shooter's [[iCloud]] account in order to acquire data from the iCloud backup. However, this rendered the phone unable to back up recent data to iCloud unless its pass-code is entered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-apple-fbi-call-20160219-story.html|title=Apple and feds reveal San Bernardino shooter's iCloud password was reset hours after attack|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016|first=Paresh|last=Dave|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221034818/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-apple-fbi-call-20160219-story.html|archive-date=February 21, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/gma/san-bernardino-shooters-apple-id-passcode-changed-while-234003785--abc-news-topstories.html|title=San Bernardino Shooter's Apple ID Passcode Changed While in Government Possession, Apple Says|work=Yahoo!

==Aftermath==

===Emergency response discussion===
On March 18, 2016, [[California State Assembly]]man [[Freddie Rodriguez]] of the Joint Legislative Committee on Emergency Management conducted a hearing in which first responders were to share details of the response to the attack and possible aspects that could be improved on. During the hearing, Michael Madden, a lieutenant with the San Bernardino Police Department and one of the first responders to respond to the Inland Regional Center, requested state aid in encrypting police radio channels. He explained that police communications were playing out real-time across the U.S. during the attack, being broadcast on [[YouTube]] and other network systems. According to Madden, this put first responders at risk, as potential suspects could have been monitoring the communications and tracking the actions of law enforcement. He added that the City of San Bernardino, as well as San Bernardino County, were moving towards a radio system that will incorporate encrypted frequencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbsun.com/government-and-politics/20160318/assemblyman-hosts-hearing-today-in-san-bernardino-on-terror-attack|title=Assemblyman hosts hearing today in San Bernardino on terror attack|newspaper=San Bernardino County Sun|date=March 18, 2016|accessdate=March 18, 2016|first=Joe|last=Nelson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/radio-797436-bernardino-san.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Radio restrictions, armored vehicles discussed in terrorist attack hearing|newspaper=The Press-Enterprise|date=March 18, 2016|accessdate=March 18, 2016|first=Richard K.|last=De Atley|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320115735/http://www.pe.com/articles/radio-797436-bernardino-san.html|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Prior to the attack, a measure was sponsored by Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]]; it would allow the U.S. to ban sales of guns and explosives to people listed on [[Terrorist Screening Database|government watch lists of suspected terrorists]].

On May 31, 2016, federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit against Farook's family. This lawsuit would allow them to seize both the proceeds of two [[life insurance]] policies (and the policies themselves) held by Farook, both of which listed Farook's mother as the beneficiary. One policy worth {{US$|25,000}} was taken out by Farook in 2012 when he started working for the county, while the other, worth {{US$|250,000}}, was taken out the following year. According to [[NBC News]], "Under federal law, assets derived from terrorism are subject to forfeiture. A federal judge must approve an application before the government can seize the money."<ref name=SernaParviniHamiltonKnoll>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-attack-life-insurance-lawsuit-20160531-snap-story.html|title=Should a terrorist's family collect insurance money after he killed 14 people in the San Bernardino attack?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|first1=Joseph|last1=Serna|first2=Sarah|last2=Parvini|first3=Matt|last3=Hamilton|first4=Corina|last4=Knoll|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601020449/http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-bernardino-attack-life-insurance-lawsuit-20160531-snap-story.html|archive-date=June 1, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/feds-file-suit-against-family-san-bernardino-shooter-seize-life-n583781|title=Feds File Suit Against Family of San Bernardino Shooter to Seize Life Insurance Policies|publisher=NBC News|date=June 1, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|first1=Andrew|last1=Blankstein|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Chuck|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602025431/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/feds-file-suit-against-family-san-bernardino-shooter-seize-life-n583781|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-file-suit-to-seize-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance/|title=Feds file suit to seize San Bernardino shooter's life insurance|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602131653/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/feds-file-suit-to-seize-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance/|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the six-page lawsuit, the life insurance company claimed that Farook's mother was aware of her son's intentions to carry out the attack, and reasoned that she should not be entitled to the benefits as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/life-805336-farook-lawsuit.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Lawsuit reveals quandary over shooter's life insurance benefits|work=The Press-Enterprise|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 12, 2016|first=Joe|last=Nelson|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611131746/http://www.pe.com/articles/life-805336-farook-lawsuit.html|archive-date=June 11, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On September 2, 2016, government officials said they wanted to give the money to the victims' families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7.com/news/judge-may-decide-if-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance-money-goes-to-victims-or-mom/1496372/|title=Government Wants Money From Life Insurance Policies of San Bernardino Terror Shooter Given to Families' Victims|publisher=KABC-TV|date=September 2, 2016|accessdate=September 5, 2016|first=Rob|last=McMillan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904030659/http://abc7.com/news/judge-may-decide-if-san-bernardino-shooters-life-insurance-money-goes-to-victims-or-mom/1496372/|archive-date=September 4, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Threats against schools===
Hours after the attack, classes were canceled at [[California State University, San Bernardino]] and at [[Loma Linda University]] following a bomb threat that was called in to the university's medical center, where many injured victims were being treated.<ref name="Alexander" />

On December 15, after the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] received a threat of attack by "explosive devices" and other means, Superintendent of Schools [[Ramon Cortines]] ordered the closure of all schools in the district for the day. Cortines cited the San Bernardino incident as an influence in his decision to close the schools. New York City received the same threat, but the [[New York City Department of Education]] determined it was a hoax and took no action.<ref name=BrownSchoolsClosed>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Emma|title=All Los Angeles public schools closed due to threat to 'many' schools|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2015/12/15/all-los-angeles-public-schools-closed-due-to-threat|accessdate=December 15, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=November 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215201230/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2015/12/15/all-los-angeles-public-schools-closed-due-to-threat/|archive-date=December 15, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--none given-->|title=Threats Against 'Many Schools' Prompt LAUSD To Shut Down All Campuses|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/12/15/lausd-considers-closing-all-campuses-school-buses-recalled-to-yard|publisher=CBS Los Angeles|date=November 15, 2015|accessdate=December 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218062237/http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/12/15/lausd-considers-closing-all-campuses-school-buses-recalled-to-yard/|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Survivors===
On the one-year anniversary of the attack, it was reported that a number of survivors were accusing San Bernardino County of cutting off support for them. This included a lack of access to counseling or antidepressant medication, the injured attempting to get surgeries approved and physical therapy covered, a lack of assistance in dealing with a complex compensation workers' program, and health insurers refusing to cover injuries because they occurred during an act of workplace violence. A county spokesman denied the accusations and said, "The county is, and always has been, committed to ensuring our employees get all the care they need."<ref name=NPR.Piercing/>

===Anniversary commemoration events===
On the first anniversary of the attack, a bicycle ride hosted by the Redlands-based club “Ride Yourself Fit” was held at 7:30{{nbsp}}a.m.; dozens of local bicyclists, many of them police officers, rode {{convert|14|mi}}, with one mile representing each person killed in the attack. The remembrance bicycle ride continues to be held every December 2.  A remembrance ceremony was held at a local [[blood bank]] at 8:00{{nbsp}}a.m. Later that morning, over 200 people at the Inland Regional Center held a moment of silence outside the building. At 3:30{{nbsp}}p.m., a "Peace Garden" was opened on the campus of [[California State University, San Bernardino]]; it was dedicated in the memory of five of the victims, who were all alumni of the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-anniversary-idUSKBN13R13R|title=In San Bernardino, solemn ceremony marks mass shooting|agency=Reuters|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016|first1=Alex|last1=Dobuzinskis|first2=Patrick|last2=Fallon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202110600/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-anniversary-idUSKBN13R13R|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ktla.com/2016/12/02/memorials-to-mark-1-year-anniversary-of-san-bernardino-terror-attack/|title=Memorials Mark 1-Year Anniversary of San Bernardino Terror Attack|publisher=KTLA|date=December 2, 2016|accessdate=December 2, 2016|first1=Tracy|last1=Bloom|first2=Eric|last2=Spillman|first3=Elizabeth|last3=Espinosa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203145208/http://ktla.com/2016/12/02/memorials-to-mark-1-year-anniversary-of-san-bernardino-terror-attack/|archive-date=December 3, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County, since roughly 35 percent of the Department of Public Health employees were among those killed or wounded in the attack, and the attack left the county with very few health inspectors to do critical work.

On June 18, 2016, President Obama issued a [[Weekly Radio Address of the President of the United States|Weekly Address]] addressing the San Bernardino attack and [[Orlando nightclub shooting|a mass shooting]] that occurred at a gay nightclub six days earlier.

<blockquote>Being tough on terrorism, particularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we've seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible. That's something I'll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.</blockquote>
