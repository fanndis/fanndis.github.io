'''Horst Lorenz Seehofer''' (born 4 July 1949) is a German politician serving as [[Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community|Minister of the Interior, Building and Community]] since 2018 under Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. A member of the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), he served as the [[List of Minister-Presidents of Bavaria|18th Minister President of Bavaria]] from 2008 to 2018 and [[Leader of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] from 2008 to 2019.

First elected to the [[Bundestag]] in [[1980 West German federal election|1980]], he served as [[Federal Minister for Health and Social Security (Germany)|Minister for Health and Social Security]] in the christian-liberal cabinets of [[Helmut Kohl]] from 1992 to 1998, going to the opposition afterwards and returning to the government as [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany)|Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]] in the [[grand coalition]] cabinet of [[Angela Merkel]] from 2005 to 2008. Following a disastrous result for his party <!-- after 50 years of own majorities 40% was considered disastrous --> in the [[2008 Bavaria state election|2008 Bavarian state election]], he became both Leader of the CSU and [[List of Minister-Presidents of Bavaria|Minister President of Bavaria]], an office he had never sought, after forming a [[coalition government]] with the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP), the first coalition on state level in five decades. In [[2013 Bavaria state election|2013]] he returned his party to an absolute majority on state level. He served as [[President of the Bundesrat]] from 2011 to 2012. As such he was [[President of the Bundesrat|Acting head of state of Germany]] from the resignation of President [[Christian Wulff]] on 17 February 2012 until the election of [[Joachim Gauck]] as Wulff's successor on 18 March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aCOKp59WbZE8&refer=germany|title=Germany's Seehofer, Merkel Ally, Elected Bavarian State Premier|publisher=Bloomberg|date=27 October 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref>

In July 2018, a week-long dissent between Seehofer and Merkel [[2018 German government crisis|nearly brought down the government]] and again seriously threatened a CDU/CSU split, but they ultimately found a compromise.

==Early life and education==
After secondary school, Seehofer started working as civil servant in the local administration in [[Ingolstadt]].<ref name="Horst Seehofer – Alpha male">Toby Vogel (5 February 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/alpha-male/ Horst Seehofer – Alpha male] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>

==Political career==

===Federal Minister and Member of the Bundestag (1980–2008)===
Seehofer served as member of the German federal parliament ([[Bundestag]]) as a directly elected delegate (''Direktkandidat'') from his [[constituency]] [[Ingolstadt (electoral district)|Ingolstadt]] from 1980 until 2008. At the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]] he received 65.9 percent of the votes in his district.

Seehofer was [[Federal Minister for Health and Social Security (Germany)|Federal Minister for Health and Social Security]] from 1992 to 1998 in the [[cabinet of Germany|cabinet]] of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]].

In 1993, Seehofer ordered that Germany's 117-year-old Federal Health Agency be dissolved following a review of how the government in the 1980s handled the cases of thousands of [[Haemophilia|hemophiliacs]] who were infected through blood contaminated with [[HIV]]. The Health Ministry took over the agency's responsibilities.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/world/german-agency-says-it-erred-in-hiv-case.html German Agency Says It Erred in H.I.V.

[[File:2008-06-01 Angela Merkel und Horst Seehofer 01-045.JPG|thumb|left|Seehofer with Angela Merkel, 2008]]
After Helmut Kohl lost his bid for a fifth term in the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], in the opposition Seehofer became deputy chairman of the [[CDU/CSU]] [[parliamentary group]] of the Bundestag in October 1998, which was led at the time by Kohl's successor [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. He served as Health Minister [[Ulla Schmidt]]'s counterpart in negotiating the cross-party healthcare bill of 2003. Because of his disagreement with CDU leader [[Angela Merkel]] on flat-rate contributions (''Gesundheitsprämie'') to the federal health insurance<ref>Bertrand Benoit (17 October 2005), [https://www.ft.com/content/bc00844c-3a61-11da-b0d3-00000e2511c8 Angela Merkel’s cabinet] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> he resigned from his leadership post in the parliamentary group on 22 November 2004 but remained deputy chairman of his party and kept his Bundestag seat.

Seehofer was appointed [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection|Federal Minister of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]] in the [[Cabinet Merkel I|cabinet]] of Angela Merkel and stayed in office from 2005 to 2008.

===Minister President of Bavaria (2008–2018)===
After his party lost more than 17% of the popular vote in the [[2008 Bavaria state election|Bavarian state elections of 2008]], incumbent Minister-President [[Günther Beckstein]] and Chairman of the CSU, [[Erwin Huber]], announced their resignations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/09/30/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE48T1TH20080930|title=Bavaria's CSU leader quits after election blow|publisher=Reuters|date=30 September 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/10/01/uk-germany-csu-idUKTRE4903TQ20081001|title=Second CSU leader quits, raising risks for Merkel|publisher=Reuters|date=1 October 2008|accessdate=2011-07-09}}</ref> Seehofer was quickly proposed as their successor. At a party convention on 25 October he was affirmed as the new Chairman of the CSU with 90% of the votes, and on 27 October he was elected Minister-President by the [[Landtag of Bavaria|Landtag]] with votes from the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], forming the first [[coalition]] government in Bavaria since 1962.

During the term 2011–2012, Seehofer served as [[President of the German Bundesrat]]. As such, he functioned as Acting head of state from [[Christian Wulff]]'s resignation on 17 February 2012<ref name="bundesratspraesident">{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_235/nn_6898/DE/presse/pm/2012/024-2012.html?__nnn=true|title=Bundesratspräsident nimmt Befugnisse des Bundespräsidenten wahr|publisher=Bundesrat|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-02-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811043315/http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_235/nn_6898/DE/presse/pm/2012/024-2012.html?__nnn=true|archivedate=11 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="wullf resigns">{{cite web|title=President Wulff resigns|url=http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20120217-40809.html|publisher=[[The Local]]|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/nach-wullf-ruecktritt-staatsoberhaupt-seehofer-1.1287416|title=Staatsoberhaupt Seehofer|language=German|publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung|date=18 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article13873734/Horst-Seehofer-ist-kommissarisches-Staatsoberhaupt.html|title=Horst Seehofer ist kommissarisches Staatsoberhaupt|language=German|publisher=Welt Online|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/news/2012-02/17/bundespraesident-portraet-seehofer-kommissarisches-staatsoberhaupt-17122211|title=Porträt: Seehofer kommissarisches Staatsoberhaupt|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=17 February 2012|accessdate=2012-03-20}}</ref> until the [[2012 German presidential election|election]] of [[Joachim Gauck]] on 18 March 2012.

Under Seehofer's leadership, the State of Bavaria took to the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] in 2012 in order to dispute the legality of Germany's post-World War II system of financial redistribution among the country's 16 states. Bavaria, a beneficiary of the system until 1988, had paid more in 2011 than it got out in the 40 years it was a net recipient.<ref>Rainer Buergin (17 July 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-07-17/bavaria-to-challenge-germany-s-postwar-system-of-state-finances Bavaria to Challenge Germany’s Postwar System of State Finances] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref> The State of [[Hesse]], another per-capita contributor, joined the lawsuit.<ref>Joseph de Weck (5 February 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-05/two-richest-german-states-challenge-system-of-paying-for-poor Richest German States Challenge System of Paying for Poor] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

Also under Seehofer's leadership, the CSU won an absolute majority in the [[2013 Bavarian state election|2013 state elections]], heralding strong momentum for the conservative parties in the [[2013 German federal election|federal elections]] the following week.<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/bavarian-election-victory-for-conservatives-gives-merkel-a-boost-a-922407.html CSU Triumph: Bavarian Vote Gives Merkel Pre-Election Boost] ''[[Spiegel Online]]'', 16 September 2013.</ref> Together with Angela Merkel and [[Sigmar Gabriel]], he later led the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] on the national level.

In early 2015, under pressure from younger rivals, Seehofer announced he would retire at the next state elections in 2018.<ref name="Stefan Wagstyl 2015">Stefan Wagstyl (7 October 2015), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9cc055a8-6c24-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html Bavarian ally proves a thorn in Merkel’s side on refugees] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Later that year, when was chosen the fifth time as leader of the CSU, he received 87.2 percent of the vote, some 8 percent down on the result he achieved in 2013.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/bavarian-premier-seehofer-re-elected-csu-party-leader/a-18866331 Bavarian premier Seehofer re-elected CSU party leader] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 21 November 2015.</ref>

[[File:Reuven Rivlin visit to Germany, September 2017 (3410).jpg|thumb|Horst Seehofer and Israeli President [[Reuven Rivlin]], 2017]]
In August 2016, Seehofer said he may break with party unity and run a separate campaign in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 national elections]], a move widely seen as an effort to keep pressure on Merkel to shift to a more restrictive refugee policy in the [[European migrant crisis]].<ref>Rainer Buergin (1 August 2016), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-01/merkel-s-bavarian-ally-hints-at-snub-of-chancellor-in-2017-vote Merkel’s Bavarian Ally Hints at Snub of Chancellor in 2017 Vote] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> He also announced to stay on as CSU leader beyond 2018.<ref>Joern Poltz and Paul Carrel (24 April 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics/merkel-ally-seehofer-staying-on-for-difficult-german-election-idUSKBN17Q1EF Merkel ally Seehofer staying on for 'difficult' German election] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> When the CSU's share of the vote in Bavaria fell 10 percentage points compared with 2013, to below 39 per cent, Seehofer faced demands to resign.<ref>Guy Chazan (27 September 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/b1e1493c-a35f-11e7-b797-b61809486fe2 Bavarian party chief faces resignation calls over poll result] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> On 4 December 2017, he announced to step down as Minister President and not run as leading candidate in the 2018 state elections;<ref>Guy Chazan (4 December 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/421ba572-d8e6-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482 Bavarian PM Horst Seehofer steps down in CSU power struggle] ''[[Handelsblatt]]''</ref> instead, he said he would hand over the office to [[Markus Söder]] in the first quarter of 2018.<ref>Emily Schultheis (4 December 2017), [https://www.politico.eu/article/horst-seehofer-to-step-down-as-bavarian-state-premier-csu-germany-elections/ Seehofer to quit as Bavarian premier to end power struggle] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

===Return to federal cabinet (2018–present)===

{{Main article|2018 German government crisis}}
Under Seehofer's master plan Germany would reject migrants who have already been deported or have an entry ban and would instruct police to turn away all migrants who have registered elsewhere in the EU, no matter if these countries agreed to take them back.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/germany-interior-minister-merkel-ultimatum-migrants-180618093627915.html</ref><ref>https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/germany-s-interior-minister-horst-seehofer-wants-quick-action-on-migra-dgtl-238561</ref> Merkel feared that unilaterally sending migrants back to neighbouring countries without seeking a multilateral European agreement could endanger the stability of the European Union. In June 2018, Seehofer backed down from a threat to bypass her in the disagreement over immigration policy until she would come back on July 1 from attempts to find a solution at European level. During these weeks the media was speculating not only on a government fall down but also on a split of the CDU/CSU alliance, which consists of the CSU in Bavaria and the CDU in the remaining 15 states. It would have meant that the CSU would run for elections all over Germany and the CDU would run in Bavaria, which they have never done before.

On 1 July 2018, Seehofer rejected the agreement Merkel had obtained with EU countries as too little and declared his resignation during a meeting of his party's executive, but they refused to accept it.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/merkel-coalition-crisis-seehofer-offers-quit-migration-180702052457364.html</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44674945</ref><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/01/merkel-fights-to-save-coalition-from-division-over-migration</ref> During the night of 2 July 2018, Seehofer and Merkel announced they had settled their differences and agreed to instead accept a compromise of tighter border control.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/merkel-faces-showdown-over-migrant-policy-1530539359 Germany’s Merkel Secures Deal on Migrants, Averts Government Collapse] The Wall Street Journal</ref><ref>Nadine Schmidt and Judith Vonberg (2&nbsp;July 2018).

Seehofer was criticised for almost bringing the government down while the monthly number of migrants targeted by that policy was in single figures.

In 2010, remarks made by Seehofer according to which Turkish and Arab migrants were no longer needed in Germany were strongly criticized by the Turkish community and by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.<ref>Judy Dempsey (11 October 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/12/world/europe/12iht-germany.html German Politician Makes Anti-Immigrant Remarks] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In 2011, Seehofer took the debate further when he said those who wanted to stay in Germany should be ready to sign up to German values. He proposed a change to the Bavarian Constitution so that the authorities in the state would be under obligation to help with the integration process but that minorities, too, should be prepared to actively support the integration process.<ref name="nytimes.com">Judy Dempsey (9 March 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/europe/10iht-germany10.html Merkel Ally Assails Turkey on Human Rights] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In late 2015, Seehofer and the CSU sharply criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel's refugee policy, as the party's home turf of Bavaria was the main entry point for refugees and other migrants arriving in Germany.<ref name="wsj.com"/> Under pressure from Seehofer and his allies, Merkel later restricted cash benefits for refugees and added [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]] to the list of "safe" countries to which migrants can be returned.<ref name="Stefan Wagstyl 2015"/> He repeatedly called on the federal government to set a cap on the number of refugees Germany should be taking in,<ref name="Ruth Bender 2016"/> saying that the country was able to manage only "200,000 applicants [per year] for asylum … at the most."<ref>Janosch Delcker (6 January 2016), [http://www.politico.eu/article/merkel-seehofer-play-nice-cdu-csu-trouble-coalition-migration-refugees/ Merkel and Seehofer play nice, but alliance is under strain] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref> Seehofer later threatened to file a complaint against the government's refugee policy with Germany's [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]].<ref name="reuters.com"/> In September 2019, Seehofer said that he was willing to accept 25 per cent of the migrants who reach Italy by sea, only if everything goes as discussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.660citynews.com/2019/09/14/the-latest-germany-ready-to-take-1-4-of-rescued-migrants/|title=The Latest: Germany ready to take 1/4 of rescued migrants|accessdate=14 September 2019|website=660 News}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Seehofer is opposed to [[Turkey]]'s becoming a member of the [[European Union]].<ref name="nytimes.com"/> In 2009, he stated that Turkey "as a self-proclaimed representative of the Muslim world, clearly doesn't fit in".<ref name="ft.com">Ben Hall and Chris Bryant (9 April 2009), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c46c2286-249f-11de-9a01-00144feabdc0.html France and Germany play politics with accession] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

In December 2010 and November 2011, Seehofer was the first Minister-President of Bavaria who visited the neighbouring [[Czech Republic]]; this was considered an important step in the dispute over the expulsion of the [[Sudeten Germans]] after the Second World War. In February 2013, Seehofer received [[Petr Nečas]] as the first Czech Prime Minister for an official visit to Bavaria.

In an interview with news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in late 2014, Seehofer warned Germany's foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] and his fellow Social Democrats ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) against pursuing a more friendly approach towards Russia in the [[Ukraine crisis 2014|Ukrainian crisis]], arguing that "if Mr. Steinmeier is pursuing his own form of diplomacy alongside the chancellor, that would be highly dangerous."<ref>Michael Nienaber (22 November 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/22/ukraine-crisis-germany-russia-idUSL6N0TC0MO20141122#LxlKwHRYYiCpHkuB.97 Merkel ally warns SPD against own diplomacy towards Russia] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Stefan Wagstyl and Roula Khalaf (26 November 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93e5e066-757a-11e4-b1bf-00144feabdc0.html Merkel offers Russia trade talks olive branch] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> He added that, even within his own party, there was already too much friendly sentiment towards Russia that had to be kept in check.<ref>Nikolaus Blome, Peter Müller, Christian Neef, Ralf Neukirch and Christoph Schult (25 November 2014), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/german-government-shows-faults-in-stance-on-russia-a-1004754.html Relations at Rock Bottom: Cracks Form in Berlin Over Russia Stance] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref> However, in 2015, he held that it would be "[[Realpolitik]]" to try to involve Russia in tackling global crises.<ref>Arne Delfs (21 November 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-21/merkel-s-bavarian-ally-plans-putin-visit-in-bid-for-global-stage Merkel's Bavarian Ally Plans Putin Visit in Bid for Global Stage] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref> In early 2016, his joint visit with [[Edmund Stoiber]] to Moscow for talks with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] was met by harsh criticism, even from CDU politicians.<ref name="reuters.com"/> By early 2017, Seehofer reiterated his calls to lift the [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|EU sanctions]] against Russia.<ref>Andrea Shalal (28 January 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-germany-idUSKBN15D005 Merkel's Bavarian ally calls for quick end to Russian sanctions] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In September 2018, a few days after [[2018 Chemnitz protests|Chemnitz protests against migrants and refugees]], Seehofer criticized the debate on migration again saying it is "the mother of all political problems" in Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/migration-mother-of-all-political-problems-says-german-interior-minister-horst-seehofer/a-45378092|title=Migration 'mother of all political problems,' says German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref>

===European integration===
In 2012, Seehofer demanded that the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German constitution]] be changed to permit [[referendum]]s on decisions to deepen [[European integration]] and transfer powers to [[Institutions of the European Union|European institutions]]. That same year, he criticized [[International Monetary Fund]] managing director [[Christine Lagarde]]'s proposal for measures that would result in a mutualization of [[Eurozone]] debt, arguing that shared liability for [[sovereign debt]] and a banking union would remove pressure from governments to carry out economic policy changes.<ref>Rainer Buergin (29 June 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-29/lagarde-wrong-to-urge-mutualized-debt-germany-s-seehofer-says Lagarde Wrong to Urge Mutualized Debt, Germany’s Seehofer Says] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

In 2013, Seehofer made [[Peter Gauweiler]] a deputy leader of the CSU in a bid to court the party's euro critics; however, Gauweiler quit after two years in protest against the extension of [[Greece]]'s aid program.<ref>Rainer Buergin and Patrick Donahue (31 March 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-31/euro-critic-quits-merkel-s-german-coalition-in-protest German Euro Critic Quits Merkel Caucus in Greece Protest] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Seehofer is married to [[Karin Seehofer]] and resides in the Ingolstadt district of [[Gerolfing]].
