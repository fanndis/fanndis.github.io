'''Kensington''' is an affluent [[district]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] in the [[West End of London|West]] of central London.

The district's commercial heart is [[Kensington High Street]], running on an east–west axis. The north-east is taken up by [[Kensington Gardens]], containing the [[Albert Memorial]], the [[Serpentine Gallery]] and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke]]'s monument. [[South Kensington]] and [[Gloucester Road, London|Gloucester Road]] are home to [[Imperial College London]], the [[Royal College of Music]], the [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[Natural History Museum, London|National Historical Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]. The area is also home to many international embassies and consulates and the residence of many politicians and billionaires.

==Name==
The [[manor]] of ''Chenesitone'' is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7576097|title=DocumentsOnline|website=www.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}</ref> which in the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] language means "Chenesi's [[List of generic forms in place names in Ireland and the United Kingdom|ton]]" (homestead/settlement).  One early spelling is  ''Kesyngton'', as written in 1396.<ref>{{citation |chapter-url=http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT6/R2/CP40no541a/bCP40no541adorses/IMG_0349.htm |chapter=CP 40/541; year 1396 |title=Plea Rolls |publisher=Court of Common Pleas}}—  with county margination "midd". Kesyngton is the place where the trespass (taking animals) occurred (line 3)</ref>

==History==
[[File:Kensington from the air in 1909.jpg|alt=B&W photo of Kensington from the air|thumb|Kensington photographed by scientist Sir Norman Lockyer in 1909 from a helium balloon. (This is a mirrored image of Kensington)]]
The [[manor]] of Kensington in the county of [[Middlesex]], was one of several hundred granted by King [[William the Conqueror]] (1066-1089) to [[Geoffrey de Montbray]] (or Mowbray), [[Bishop of Coutances]] in Normandy, one of his inner circle of advisors and one of the wealthiest men in post-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest England]]. He granted the tenancy of Kensington to his follower [[Aubrey de Vere I]], who was holding the manor from him as [[overlord]] in 1086, according to the [[Domesday Book]]. The bishop's heir, Robert de Mowbray, rebelled against King [[William Rufus|William II]] and his vast [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] was forfeited to the Crown.  [[Aubrey de Vere I]] thus became a [[tenant-in-chief]], holding directly from the king after 1095, which increased his status in feudal England.<ref>''Victoria County History of England'', Middlesex, vol. 1, pp. 116–7</ref> He granted the church and an estate within the manor to [[Abingdon Abbey]] in [[Oxfordshire]], at the deathbed request of his eldest son Geoffrey.<ref>''Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon'', vol 2, pp. 55–6</ref>  As the de Veres became [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]], their principal manor at Kensington came to be known as Earl's Court, as they were not resident in the manor, and their manorial business was not conducted in the [[great hall]] of a [[manor house]] but in a court house. In order to differentiate it, the new sub-manor granted to Abingdon Abbey became known as ''Abbot's Kensington'' and the church ''[[St Mary Abbots]]''.

The original [[Kensington Barracks]], built at Kensington Gate in the late 18th century, were demolished in 1858 and new barracks were built in Kensington Church Street.<ref>{{citation|url=http://collage.cityoflondon.gov.uk/view-item?i=85700&WINID=1474797132944|title=Kensington Barracks|publisher=London Picture Archive|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==

The focus of the area is [[Kensington High Street]], a busy commercial centre with many shops, typically upmarket. The street was declared London's second best shopping street in February 2005 due to its wide range and number of shops.<ref>{{citation| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4289237.stm |title=Best shopping street' in London  |accessdate=2008-10-23 |work=BBC News |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |date=23 February 2005 }}</ref> However, since October 2008 the street has faced competition from the [[Westfield London|Westfield]] shopping centre in nearby White City.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/rbkcdirect/rdcouncilpriorities/cp1001_core.asp|title=Core Strategy:Putting the neighbourhood first|publisher=Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|accessdate=2010-05-14}}</ref>

Kensington's second group of commercial buildings is at [[South Kensington]], where several streets of small to medium-sized shops and service businesses are situated close to [[South Kensington tube station]]. This is also the southern end of [[Exhibition Road]], the thoroughfare which serves the area's museums and educational institutions.

The boundaries of Kensington are not well-defined; in particular, the southern part of Kensington has conflicting and complex borders with Chelsea (another ancient manor) whether electoral or postal definitions are used, and has similar architecture. To the west, a border is clearly defined by the line of the Counter Creek marked by the [[West London Line|West London railway line]]. To the north, the only obvious border line is Holland Park Avenue, to the north of which is the district of Notting Hill (another ancient manor), usually classed as within "North Kensington".

In the north east is situated the large public [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Park]] of [[Kensington Gardens]] (contiguous with its eastern neighbour, [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]). The other main green area in Kensington is [[Holland Park]], on the north side of the eastern end of Kensington High Street. Many residential roads have small communal [[Parks and open spaces in London#Garden squares|garden squares]], for the exclusive use of the residents.

South Kensington also largely comprises private housing. [[North Kensington]] and [[West Kensington, London|West Kensington]] are largely devoid of features to attract the visitor.

Kensington is, in general, an extremely affluent area, a trait that it shares with Chelsea, its neighbour to the south. The area has some of London's most expensive streets and garden squares, and at about the turn of the 21st century the Holland Park neighbourhood became particularly high-status. In early 2007 houses sold in Upper Phillimore Gardens, immediately east of [[Holland Park]], for over £20 million. [[Brompton, Kensington|Brompton]] is another definable area of Kensington.

The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea forms part of the most densely populated local government district in the United Kingdom. This high density has come about through the subdivision of large mid-rise [[Georgian era|Georgian]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] terraced houses (generally of four to six floors) into flats. The less-affluent northern extremity of Kensington has [[high-rise]] residential buildings, while this type of building in the southern part is only represented by  the [[Holiday Inn]]'s London Kensington Forum Hotel in [[Cromwell Road]], a 27-storey building.

Notable attractions and institutions in Kensington include: [[Kensington Palace]] in Kensington Gardens; the [[Royal Albert Hall]] opposite the [[Albert Memorial]] in Hyde Park; the [[Royal College of Music]]; the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]; the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]; the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; [[Heythrop College]]; [[Imperial College, London|Imperial College]]; the [[Royal College of Art]] and [[Kensington and Chelsea College]]. The [[Olympia, England|Olympia]] Exhibition Hall is just over the western border in [[West Kensington, London|West Kensington]].

==Administration==
[[Image:Kensington Gardens Of London Summer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kensington Gardens]] in the summer]]
Kensington is administered within the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and lies within the [[Kensington (UK Parliament constituency)|Kensington]] parliamentary constituency.

==Media sector==

The head office of newspaper group [[Daily Mail and General Trust|DMGT]] is located in Northcliffe House off Kensington High Street<ref>"[http://www.dmgt.co.uk/contact Contacts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809140931/http://www.dmgt.co.uk/contact |date=9 August 2011 }}."

In addition to housing the offices for the DMGT newspapers ''[[Daily Mail]]'', ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' and ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'', Northcliffe House also accommodates the offices of the newspapers owned by [[Evgeny Lebedev]]: ''[[The Independent]]'', ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', and the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]''.<ref name="Ponsford">Ponsford, Dominic.

The building also houses Lebedev's TV channel [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]], with its news studio situated in part of the former department store, using [[St Mary Abbots]] church and Kensington Church Street as live backdrop.

==Transport==
Kensington is crossed east–west by three main roads, the most important of which is the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]] ''Cromwell Road'' which connects it to [[Central London]] on the east and to  [[Hounslow]] and [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] on the west. Parallel to the north is Kensington Road (of which Kensington High Street forms the eastern part), linking central London and Hammersmith and [[Hounslow]] to the area. To the south is Fulham Road, which connects South Kensington with [[Fulham]] to the south-west. North-south connections are not as well-developed and there is no obvious single north–south route through the area.

[[File:High Street Kensington tube station, platform 1 - geograph.org.uk - 809853.jpg|thumb|left|[[High Street Kensington tube station]] is served by the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle]] and [[District line]]s]]

Kensington is well served by [[public transport]]. Most of Kensington is served by three stations in the [[Travelcard Zone 1]]: [[High Street Kensington tube station|High Street Kensington]], [[Gloucester Road tube station|Gloucester Road]] and [[South Kensington tube station|South Kensington]]. All three are served by the [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] which connects them to London's railway terminals. The [[District line]] also serves all three stations, albeit on different branches; it links the latter two to [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and the [[City of London|City]]. The [[Piccadilly line]] also links South Kensington and Gloucester Road to the [[West End of London|West End]] in about 10 minutes, and in the other direction to [[Chiswick]], [[Ealing]], [[Hounslow]] and [[Heathrow Airport]] in around 20–40  minutes, depending on the area of choice. In addition [[Kensington (Olympia)]] in [[Travelcard Zone 2]] serves the western part of Kensington, with District line trains to [[Earl's Court]] and High Street Kensington. Nearby [[West Kensington station]] takes its name from the former boundaries with Hammersmith and is not in the Borough.

A number of local bus services link Kensington into the surrounding districts, and key hubs are Kensington High Street and South Kensington station. These bus services were improved in frequency and spread from 2007 until 2010 when the western extension of the [[London congestion charge]] area existed (which required drivers of cars and vans during the charging hours Monday-Friday to pay a daily fee of £8).

==Sports==
Kensington has one football team, [[Kensington Borough F.C.]], which currently plays in the [[Combined Counties Football League]].
