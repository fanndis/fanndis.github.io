"'''I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby'''" is an American popular song and [[jazz standard]] by [[Jimmy McHugh]] (music) and [[Dorothy Fields]] (lyrics). The song was introduced by [[Adelaide Hall]] at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in January 1928 in [[Lew Leslie]]'s ''Blackbird Revue'', which opened on Broadway later that year as the highly successful ''[[Blackbirds of 1928]]'' (518 performances), wherein it was performed by Adelaide Hall, [[Aida Ward]], and Willard McLean.

==Background==
[[Jimmy McHugh]] and [[Dorothy Fields]] had written the score for a revue at Les Ambassadeurs Club on 57th Street, New York, which featured the vocalist [[Adelaide Hall]]. However, the producer [[Lew Leslie]] believed that they still missed a 'smash' tune. The team pondered for a while before finally playing Leslie "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby". This was the song Leslie had been looking for and he immediately included it in the revue.<ref name="Underneath">{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Iain Cameron |title=Underneath a Harlem Moon |date=2002 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |isbn=0826458939 |pages=129–139 |edition=1}}</ref> One advertisement called it "the song success of the Nation."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Brothers|first=Thomas|title=Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-06582-4|location=New York, NY|pages=329}}</ref>

''Blackbird Revue'' opened on January 4, 1928 with Adelaide Hall singing "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" solo. Later on, Fields and McHugh wrote a second half for the revue and Leslie expanded the production. With extra songs and extra performers added (including the vocalist [[Aida Ward]]), Leslie renamed the revue [[Blackbirds of 1928]] and took the full production for a tryout in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where it appeared at Nixon's Apollo Theatre. On May 9, 1928, Blackbirds of 1928 opened at the [[Liberty Theatre]], Broadway.

The idea behind the song came during a stroll Fields and McHugh were taking one evening down [[Fifth Avenue]]; they saw a young couple window-shopping at [[Tiffany's]]. McHugh and Fields understood that the couple did not have the resources to buy jewelry from Tiffany's, but nevertheless they drew closer to them. It was then they heard the man say, "Gee, honey I'd like to get you a sparkler like that, but right now, i can't give you nothin' but love!" Hearing this, McHugh and Fields rushed to a nearby [[Steinway Tunnel]], and within an hour they came up with "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby".<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Burton |first=Jack |title=The Honor Roll of Popular Songwriters: No. 62&nbsp;— Jimmy McHugh|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher= William H. Donaldson|date=May 27, 1950|page=42|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

Some controversy surrounds the song's authorship. [[Andy Razaf]]'s biographer Harry Singer offers circumstantial evidence that suggests [[Fats Waller]] might have sold the melody to McHugh in 1926 and that the lyrics were by Andy Razaf.<ref>[http://www.jazzstandards.com/compositions-1/icantgiveyouanythingbutlove.htm "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby" at Jazz Standards]</ref> Alternatively, [[Philip Furia]] has pointed out that Fields' verse is almost identical to the end of the second verse of [[Lorenz Hart]]'s and [[Richard Rodgers]]' song "Where's That Rainbow?" from ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'', the 1926 musical comedy with book by Fields' brother [[Herbert Fields|Herbert]] and produced by their father [[Lew Fields|Lew]]:<ref>{{cite book |last=Furia |first=Philip|author-link=Philip Furia|title=The Poets of Tin Pan Alley: A History of America's Great Lyricists |url=https://archive.org/details/poetstinpanalley00furi |url-access=limited |year= 1990 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/poetstinpanalley00furi/page/n228 216]–17 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195074734}}</ref>

'I Can't Give You Anything but Love' is a great example; Tony Bennett might be 88, but it's Gaga who hasn't sounded this alive in years."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/08/best-new-music-of-the-week-benjamin-booker.html?mid=imdb|title=9 Best New Songs of the Week|last=Fox|first=Jesse David|date=August 20, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}</ref>

===Music video and promotion===
An official [[music video]] for the song was released on August 26, 2014. The video was shot in the recording studio and the first half showed Gaga in numerous outfits and wigs, while recording the song and roaming around. Bennett joins the studio sessions later on, singing the song. The final chorus finds the two singers belting together, described as "join[ing] forces for a peculiar, yet potent blend of styles that transcends generations and genres". Along with the music video a remix by [[Giorgio Moroder]] was released exclusively in October 2014 to [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] website. The chords of the original version was changed, with Moroder adding synths and a bassline, complementing the vocals of Bennett and Gaga.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7565401/giorgio-moroder-remix-tony-bennett-lady-gaga-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-listen|title=Giorgio Moroder's Remix Of Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga's 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love': Idolator Premiere|last=Daw|first=Robbie|date=October 6, 2014|access-date=October 6, 2014|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]}}</ref>

Jon Blistein from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' complimented the video, saying that it "proves [Gaga and Bennett] exude a unique, adorable brand of musical chemistry".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-video-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-20140826|title=See Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett's Chemistry at Work in the Duo's New Video|last=Blistein|first=John|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Maurice Bobb from [[MTV News]] noticed the "bare essence" of the duo in the video and added that Gaga appeared "overwhelmingly subdued", but felt that "her playful energy still shines through as she preens and shimmies to [Bennett's] smooth crooning."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1913487/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-video/|title=Lady Gaga And Tony Bennett Strip Down For The 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love' Video|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|publisher=MTV News}}</ref> Nolan Feeney from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that Gaga appeared normal in the video and added that "she’s still fun to watch even when she’s just hanging out in the vocal both (and dressed like a relatively normal human, no less)."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3183199/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-video/|title=Lady Gaga Acts Like a Normal Person in the Video for Her Tony Bennett Duet|last=Feeney|first=Nolan|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|work=Time}}</ref> Katie Atkinson from ''Billboard'' declared that "If you love the adorable friendship between glam pop queen Lady Gaga and classic crooner Tony Bennett, you'll definitely want to see the breezy behind-the-scenes studio video of the pair for 'I Can't Give You Anything but Love'."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6229409/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-video|title=Watch Lady Gaga & Tony Bennett Feeling the 'Love' in Studio Video|last=Atkinson|first=Katie|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|work=Billboard}}</ref> Idolator's Mike Wass described the video in detail, calling it the "perfect antidote for Gaga's overwhelming, more-is-more ''[[Artpop]]'' visuals... The swingin' standard is a nice fit for Gaga and Tony. It allows them to riff off each other and ham it up (ever so slightly). Those shenanigans are captured in the studio-based video, which finds Mother Monster modeling a variety of wigs and smoking a cigar. Her suave companion looks a little bemused but he's clearly having a good time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7532877/lady-gaga-tony-bennett-i-cant-give-you-anything-but-love-video|title=Lady Gaga & Tony Bennett Jam In Their Low-Key 'I Can't Give You Anything But Love' Video: Watch|last=Wass|first=Mike|date=August 26, 2014|access-date=August 28, 2014|publisher=Idolator}}</ref>
