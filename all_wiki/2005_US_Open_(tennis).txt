The '''2005 US Open''' was the fourth and final Grand Slam of 2005. It was held between August 29, 2005 and September 11, 2005. The "9/11/01" sign to remember the 9/11 attacks was not featured on the court. It was, however, featured during the 2011 U.S. Open final between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, and the 2016 U.S. Open final between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka, respectively.

[[Roger Federer]] was successful in defending his 2004 title, defeating [[Andre Agassi]] in the final. [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] was unsuccessful in her title defence, losing in the first round against compatriot [[Ekaterina Bychkova]]. [[Kim Clijsters]] won her first Grand Slam title after four previous Grand Slam final losses. It was the first of three US Open titles for Clijsters, also winning in 2009 and 2010. This was the first time that future [[US Open (Tennis)]] champion [[Andy Murray]] was featured in the tournament.
