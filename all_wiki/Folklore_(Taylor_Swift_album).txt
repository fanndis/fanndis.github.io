'''''Folklore''''' (stylized in [[all lowercase]]) is the eighth [[studio album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was a [[surprise album]], released through [[Republic Records]] on July 24, 2020, eleven months after its predecessor, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019).

Featuring production from [[Aaron Dessner]] and [[Jack Antonoff]], ''Folklore'' eschews the upbeat [[Pop music|pop]] production of Swift's previous albums for mellow [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] driven by piano and guitar. Critics mostly describe the album as [[indie folk]], [[alternative rock]], and [[electro-folk]], while a few classify it as pop. Swift wrote and recorded the album during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], conceiving it as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of [[consciousness]]" rising out of her imagination. As opposed to her trademark autobiographical themes, ''Folklore'' manifests vivid [[storytelling]] mostly from [[Third-person perspective|third-person perspectives]] that detail [[escapism]], [[introspection]] and [[nostalgia]], which reflects in the rustic [[cottagecore]] aesthetic of the project.

''Folklore'' received universal acclaim, with emphasis on its relaxed atmosphere, emotional weight, and poetic lyricism. Many critics dubbed it a triumphant "[[COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns|lockdown]] album" and a bold move for Swift to experiment with [[indie rock|indie]] genres unconventional to her usual styles. At the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]], the album and its tracks garnered five nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. ''Folklore'' broke numerous records on [[streaming media|streaming services]], including the ''[[Guinness World Record]]'' for the biggest opening day for an album by a female artist on [[Spotify]]. According to Republic Records, ''Folklore'' sold two million copies in its first week globally, 1.3&nbsp;million of which were sold on its first day. It reached number one in Australia, Canada, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and several other territories.

Debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, ''Folklore'' gave Swift her seventh consecutive number-one album in the United States, and instantly became the best-selling album of 2020. It spent eight weeks at number one, making it the longest-running chart-topper of 2017 to 2020. All its 16 tracks entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] simultaneously, with three in the top-10: the lead single "[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]" debuted at the top spot and marked Swift's sixth number-one single in the US, making her the first act in history to debut atop both the ''Billboard'' 200 and Hot 100 simultaneously, while "[[The 1]]" arrived at number four and the [[Bon Iver]] duet "[[Exile (Taylor Swift song)|Exile]]" at number six; the three tracks opened inside the top-10 in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the UK, as well. A [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the making of ''Folklore'' with a performance of its songs, ''[[Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions]]'', was released on November 25, 2020, alongside its live album.

==Background==
On July 23, 2020, nine photos were uploaded to Swift's [[Instagram]] account, all without captions, forming an image of the singer standing alone in a forest. Subsequently, she made another post across all her [[social media]] accounts, announcing that her eighth studio album will be released at midnight; Swift stated: "Most of the things I had planned this summer didn't end up happening, but there is something I hadn't planned on that DID happen. And that thing is my 8th studio album, ''Folklore''". She confirmed the image as the album's cover artwork and revealed the track-list.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Kane|first=Caitlin|date=July 23, 2020|title=Taylor Swift announces surprise album, recorded "in isolation"|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-folklore-new-album-surprise-recorded-isolation/|url-status=live|access-date=September 3, 2020|website=[[CBS News]]|language=en-US|archive-date=August 2, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802193701/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/taylor-swift-folklore-new-album-surprise-recorded-isolation/}}</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' stated the surprise announcement "caught fans and the music business off-guard".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shah|first=Neil|date=July 23, 2020|title=Taylor Swift's New Album 'Folklore' Is Making a Surprise Debut|language=en-US|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-swifts-new-album-folklore-is-making-a-surprise-debut-11595538735|url-status=live|access-date=September 3, 2020|archive-date=September 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909231822/https://www.wsj.com/articles/taylor-swifts-new-album-folklore-is-making-a-surprise-debut-11595538735}}</ref> ''Folklore'' was released eleven months after Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019)—the fastest turnaround for a Swift studio album, beating the one year and nine months gap between ''Reputation'' and ''Lover''. In another post, Swift announced that the music video for the track "[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]" would debut at the same time as the album's release.<ref name="Reilly">{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-to-release-surprise-eighth-album-folklore-tonight-2713735|title=Taylor Swift to release surprise eighth album 'Folklore' tonight|last=Reilly|first=Nick|website=[[NME]]|date=July 23, 2020|accessdate=July 23, 2020|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806100753/https://www.nme.com/news/music/taylor-swift-to-release-surprise-eighth-album-folklore-tonight-2713735|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[YouTube]] premiere countdown to the "Cardigan" music video, Swift hinted that the album lyrics contained many of her signature [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]]: "One thing I did purposely on this album was put the Easter eggs in the lyrics, more than just the videos. I created character arcs and recurring themes that map out who is singing about who... For example, there's a collection of three songs I refer to as the Teenage Love Triangle. These three songs explore a love triangle from all three people's perspectives at different times in their lives".<ref name=":12">{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Leaves Her Comfort Zones Behind on the Head-Spinning, Heartbreaking 'Folklore'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/taylor-swift-leaves-her-comfort-zones-behind-on-the-head-spinning-heart-breaking-folklore-1033533/|access-date=July 27, 2020|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724155901/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/taylor-swift-leaves-her-comfort-zones-behind-on-the-head-spinning-heart-breaking-folklore-1033533/|archive-date=July 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> She referred to the album as "[[Wistfulness|wistful]] and full of [[escapism]].

==Conception==
Swift was scheduled to begin her [[Lover Fest]] concert tour in April 2020 in support of ''Lover'',<ref name="Mylrea" /> but the tour dates were cancelled or postponed due to the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name="Lipshutz">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9423659/taylor-swift-folklore-review-first-listen|title=Taylor Swift's 'Folklore': There's Nothing Quiet About This Songwriting Tour De Force|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724042030/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9423659/taylor-swift-folklore-review-first-listen|archive-date=July 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> While in isolation during the [[COVID-19 lockdown|lockdown]], she let her imagination "run wild", ensuing in a set of imageries and "visuals that popped into [her] mind and piqued [her] curiosity", which consequently became ''Folklore''. Some of the imageries the singer developed include: "An [[exile]]d man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize.

{{Quote|text=It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity. Stars drawn around scars. A [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. [[Battleships]] sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of "let's run away" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored [[disco ball]] hovering above a dance floor. A [[whiskey]] bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.

How will this song sound on radio?" If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is ''Folklore''". While making the album, the singer watched numerous films, such as ''[[The Last Dance (miniseries)|The Last Dance]]'' (2020), and "was reading so much more" than she ever did, books that "dealt with times past, a world that doesn't exist anymore", such as ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' (1938) by English novelist [[Daphne du Maurier]].<ref name=":30" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Warner|first=Denise|date=November 25, 2020|title=11 Things We Learned From Taylor Swift's 'Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9490082/folklore-the-long-pond-studio-sessions-taylor-swift-things-learned-taylor-swift|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|language=en}}</ref>

==Writing and production==
Swift drifted towards a direction of [[escapism]] and [[romanticism]] in terms of her songwriting,<ref name=":30" /> and enlisted two producers to achieve her desired sound—her longtime collaborator [[Jack Antonoff]], who previously worked with her on ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019), and first-time collaborator [[Aaron Dessner]], guitarist of the American [[indie rock]] band [[The National (band)|the National]].<ref name="PitchforkCredits"/> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift, Antonoff and Dessner [[Quarantine|quarantined]] remotely, separate from each other. Hence, the singer created music during [[COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns|the lockdown]] by constantly exchanging digital files of instrumentals and vocals with her producers, mailing them back and forth, which eventually resulted in an album—''Folklore''.<ref name=":31">{{cite news|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=November 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift to Release New 'Folklore' Film, 'The Long Pond Studio Sessions'|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-folklore-movie-long-pond-studio-sessions-1094615/|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>

According to Antonoff, with whom Swift worked on five songs from the album, he worked from New York City while engineer Laura Sisk recorded Swift's vocals from Los Angeles. Antonoff compared the writing process of "Mirrorball" and "August" to that of "[[Out of the Woods (song)|Out of the Woods]]" from ''1989''; he sent tracks to Swift, who returned them with completed lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|title=jack antonoff on Instagram: "folklore :: working with taylor is a full connection to all of the wonder of making music. knowing her and making work with her gives me…"|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDB0Gz3pIeY/|access-date=August 4, 2020|website=Instagram|language=en|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910132326/https://www.instagram.com/p/CDB0Gz3pIeY/|url-status=live}}</ref> Swift wrote "Mirrorball" following the cancellation of [[Lover Fest]], her fifth concert tour, as an ode to her fans finding solace in her music and concerts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hess|first=Liam|date=November 27, 2020|title=5 Things We Learned Watching Taylor Swift's Surprise New Folklore Documentary|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/folklore-documentary-takeaways|access-date=November 30, 2020|website=[[British Vogue]]|language=en-GB}}</ref> In late April, Swift approached Dessner to co-write some songs remotely.

After a few weeks, when Swift and Dessner had written "six or seven" songs, Swift explained her concept of ''Folklore'' to Dessner.<ref name="DessnerRS"/> She also told Dessner about ideas she had earlier worked on with Antonoff, adding she thinks both bodies of work fit well together for an album.<ref name="DessnerVulture"/> Other songs Swift and Dessner wrote include "[[The Last Great American Dynasty]]", "Mad Woman", and "Epiphany".

The last two songs Swift wrote for the album were "[[The 1]]" and "Hoax", the first and last songs on the album respectively.

Swift wrote two songs with Bowery, "[[Exile (Taylor Swift song)|Exile]]" and "[[Betty (Taylor Swift song)|Betty]]". Swift developed "Exile" as a [[duet]], and Dessner recorded a draft of her singing both the male and females parts.<ref name="DessnerRS"/> Swift and Dessner ran through candidates for the male partner, and Swift liked the voice of Bon Iver's [[Justin Vernon]], who is one half of the experimental indie folk rock band [[Big Red Machine (band)|Big Red Machine]] along with Dessner.<ref name="DessnerPitchfork"/> Dessner sent the song to Vernon, who liked the song, added his own lyrics and sang his part.<ref name="DessnerVulture"/> "Betty" is the only song on the album worked on by both Dessner and Antonoff; Swift used [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1963 album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', as a reference point,<ref name="DessnerRS"/> while also drawing from Dylan's 1967 album, ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]''.<ref name="DessnerVulture" /> Bowery appeared to have no online presence and was assumed to be a [[pseudonym]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|title=Hear Taylor Swift's New Album 'Folklore'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=July 23, 2020|accessdate=July 29, 2020|archive-date=July 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725062452/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9422960/taylor-swift-releasing-surprise-eighth-album-folklore|title=Taylor Swift Was Bummed About Her Summer Plans Not Panning Out, So She's Releasing A New Album...

In a November 2020 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview with [[Paul McCartney]], Swift stated that she also began using words in the lyrics of ''Folklore'' that she always wanted to use, not worrying about whether it would suit radio. She made use of "bigger, flowerier, prettier words" such as "[[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]", "[[elegies]]" and "[[Divorce|divorcée]]", just because they "sound beautiful". The singer disclosed that she maintains lists of such words, and recalled using one such—"[[kaleidoscope]]"—in her 2014 song "[[Welcome to New York (song)|Welcome to New York]]".<ref name=":30" />

{{Quote|text=I always thought, "Well, that'll never track on [[pop radio]]", but when I was making this record, I thought, "What tracks? Nothing makes sense anymore.

''Folklore'' was written and recorded in secrecy.

== Music and lyrics ==
{{Quote|text=A tale that becomes [[folklore]] is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about.

''Folklore'' was written and produced by Swift, Dessner, and Antonoff, with additional writing credits to [[Joe Alwyn]] (under the [[pseudonym]] William Bowery) on "Exile" and "[[Betty (Taylor Swift song)|Betty]]", and [[Justin Vernon]], the lead vocalist of Bon Iver, on "Exile".<ref name="PitchforkCredits">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-releases-new-album-folklore-listen-and-read-the-full-credits/|title=Taylor Swift Releases New Album ''folklore'': Listen and Read the Full Credits|last1=Strauss|first1=Matthew|last2=Minsker|first2=Evan|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910132536/https://pitchfork.com/news/taylor-swift-releases-new-album-folklore-listen-and-read-the-full-credits/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="TheLakes" /> It is Swift's first album to carry an [[Parental Advisory|explicit content label]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Urbanek|first=Sydney|date=November 26, 2020|title=Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions review – A triumphant debut from Taylor Swift|url=https://lwlies.com/reviews/folklore-the-long-pond-studio-sessions/|access-date=November 29, 2020|website=[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]]|language=en}}</ref>

The imaginary narratives described in ''Folklore'' include a ghost finding its murderer at its funeral, a seven-year-old girl with a traumatized friend, an old widow spurned by her town, recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholics]], and a [[love triangle]] between three fictitious characters—Betty, James, and an unnamed woman—as depicted in the tracks "Cardigan", "Betty" and "August", with each of the three songs written from the perspective of each of those characters in different times in their lives.<ref name="Rolling Stone" /> Commenting on the maturity of the album's lyrical execution, [[NPR]]'s Ann Powers compared ''Folklore'' to releases by other contemporary artists when they were thirty years-old, such as: [[The Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972), [[Joni Mitchell]]'s ''[[Court and Spark]]'' (1974), [[Stevie Wonder]]'s ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' (1976), [[Elliott Smith]]'s ''[[Either/Or (album)|Either/Or]]'' (1997), and [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|date=July 28, 2020|title=Let's Talk About Taylor Swift's 'Folklore'|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/07/28/896193188/taylor-swift-folklore-critics-roundtable|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730020352/https://www.npr.org/2020/07/28/896193188/taylor-swift-folklore-critics-roundtable|archive-date=July 30, 2020|access-date=July 30, 2020|website=NPR|language=en}}</ref> Many songs on ''Folklore'' incorporate a cinematic quality to their lyrics.<ref name=":11">{{cite web|last=Ahlgrim|first=Callie|date=July 30, 2020|title=Every detail and Easter egg you may have missed on Taylor Swift's new album 'Folklore'|url=https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-folklore-lyrics-easter-eggs-2020-7|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910132404/https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-folklore-lyrics-easter-eggs-2020-7|archive-date=September 10, 2020|access-date=August 5, 2020|website=[[Insider Inc.|Insider]]}}</ref>

[[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' lauded Swift's songwriting abilities that brought out her "deepest wit, compassion, and empathy", making ''Folklore'' her most intimate album so far.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> Also noting the vivid, well-crafted storytelling filled with imagination and American imagery, ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''<nowiki/>'s Jillian Mapes considered the album a mature step in Swift's artistry while retaining her core as a celebrated songwriter.<ref name="Pitchfork"/> Mark Savage of [[BBC]] classified ''Folklore'' as an indie record dealing with nostalgia and mistakes "that chimes perfectly with the times".<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53518044|title=Taylor Swift's Folklore sees the singer go indie|last=Savage|first=Mark|website=[[BBC News]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|archive-date=September 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200910132443/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-53518044|url-status=live}}</ref> Katie Moulton from ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' appreciated Swift's lyrical maturity on the album, particularly the employment of third-person perspectives that had been uncommon on her previous releases.<ref name="CoS">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/07/album-review-taylor-swift-folklore/|title=Taylor Swift's folklore Dismantles Her Own Self-Mythologizing: Review|last=Moulton|first=Katie|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724185604/https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/07/album-review-taylor-swift-folklore/|archive-date=July 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Others who were impressed with the album's lyricism include ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''<nowiki/>'s [[Neil McCormick]],<ref name="McCormick" /> ''[[I (newspaper)|i]]''{{'}}s Sarah Carson,<ref name="Carson">{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|title=Taylor Swift, Folklore, review: a dazzling, timeless surprise album|last=Carsom|first=Sarah|website=[[i (newspaper)|i]]|date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724041853/https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|archive-date=July 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'''s Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen,<ref name="Nguyen"/> all of whom gave the album full score ratings. Describing the album as a bold attempt, Hannah Mylrea of ''[[NME]]'' praised Swift's ability to evoke vivid imagery with her songwriting, although she found the 16-song run to be sluggish in places.<ref name="Mylrea" />

Several reviewers welcomed Swift's new musical direction. In the words of Chris Willman from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the album is a reminder Swift is among the few pop stars who are willing to experiment with different musical styles.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift's 'Folklore': Album Review|url=https://variety.com/2020/music/reviews/taylor-swift-folklore-album-review-1234715520/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724065836/https://variety.com/2020/music/reviews/taylor-swift-folklore-album-review-1234715520/|archive-date=July 24, 2020|access-date=July 24, 2020|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|language=en}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]''<nowiki/>'s Laura Snapes complimented the album for being both the most cohesive and the most experimental among Swift's releases.<ref name="Snapes"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Maura Johnston deemed the album a bold move for a pop star like Swift to challenge its audience.<ref name="EW"/> Roisin O'Connor of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the album's "exquisite, piano-based poetry" which she found unconventional for Swift's catalog.<ref name="O'Connor">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/taylor-swift-folklore-review-lyrics-album-stream-jack-antonoff-aaron-dessner-a9635496.html|title=Taylor Swift, Folklore review: New album is exquisite, piano-based poetry|last=O'Connor|first=Roisin|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=July 24, 2020|date=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724070730/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/taylor-swift-folklore-review-lyrics-album-stream-jack-antonoff-aaron-dessner-a9635496.html|archive-date=July 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some reviewers were more reserved in their praise. [[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] was overall positive towards the album but felt the new musical styles of the album not really "precisely new tricks" for Swift.<ref name="AllMusic"/> Sharing the same viewpoint, Annie Zaleski from ''[[The A.V.

Despite being "striking", he singled out "The Last Great American Dynasty" as the only intolerable song for how it reminds him "all too much of Taylor Swift the showbiz plutocrat".<ref name="xgau">{{cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=September 9, 2020|url=https://robertchristgau.substack.com/p/consumer-guide-september-2020|title=Consumer Guide: September, 2020|work=And It Don't Stop|publisher=[[Substack]]|accessdate=September 13, 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref>
