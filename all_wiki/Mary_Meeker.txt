==Career==
In 1982, Meeker joined [[Merrill Lynch]] as a [[stockbroker]]. After [[graduate school]], she began as an analyst covering the technology sector at [[Salomon Brothers]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/meeker-leaving-morgan-stanley/|title=Mary Meeker leaving Morgan Stanley|first=Susanne|last=Craig|work=The New York Times|date=2010-11-29|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> She worked for [[Cowen Group|Cowen]] from 1990-1991 before moving to [[Morgan Stanley]] to specialize in covering the [[personal computer]] and consumer software industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/07/20/the-ten-most-influential-women-in-technology/slide/mary-meeker/|title=The Ten Most Influential Women in Technology|first=Sam|last=Gustin|publisher=Time|date=2012-07-19|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref>

===Morgan Stanley===

In August 1995, Morgan Stanley served as lead manager for the [[initial public offering]] of [[Netscape]]. Later that year, Meeker and Chris DePuy at Morgan Stanley, published The Internet Report, a landmark Morgan Stanley industry report which became known as "the bible" for investors in the [[Dot com boom]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_39/b3648032.htm|title=Mary G. Meeker|first=Heather|last=Green|publisher=Businessweek|date=September 27, 1999|accessdate=2015-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221354/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_39/b3648032.htm|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and went into popular circulation &mdash; as a book, and on the web. Over the years, Morgan Stanley published similar landmark reports led by Meeker on online advertising, [[e-commerce]], evolution of [[search engine technology|search]], the [[Internet in China]], and the [[mobile Internet]].

Meeker was vilified in the press as one of a number of star analysts who were questioned in fraud investigations after the bursting of the [[dotcom bubble]] in 2000 to 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,24064,00.html |title=Mary Meeker Speaks, But Probably Shouldn't |first=Deborah |last=Asbrand |publisher=The Industry Standard |date=2001-04-27 |accessdate=2015-10-02 |archivedate=2006-04-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425084308/http://www.thestandard.com/article/0%2C1902%2C24064%2C00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meeker was not charged with any wrongdoing. Morgan Stanley and nine other investment firms were compelled to participate in a [[Global Analyst Research Settlements|global legal settlement]].

In August 2004, Morgan Stanley (with Meeker as research analyst) served as lead manager for the initial public offering of [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newsweek-interview-mary-meeker-morgan-stanley-stock-analyst-71696332.html|title=Newsweek Interview|publisher=Newsweek|date=2004-08-22|accessdate=2015-10-05}}{{dead link|date=June 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Meeker was characterized by [[Andrew Serwer]] in [[Fortune magazine]] in 2006 as "absolutely first rate when it comes to spotting big-picture trends before they come into focus. She gathers massive amounts of data and assembles it into voluminous reports that, while sometimes rambling and overambitious, are stuffed with a million jumping-off points."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/05/15/8376845/index.htm|title=Mary Meeker 2.0|first=Andy|last=Serwer|publisher=Fortune|date=2006-05-15|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> Meeker is often credited for her comprehensive, rapid fire, annual Internet industry overviews at the [[Web 2.0 Summit|Web 2.0 conference]]s in [[San Francisco]] each autumn.

During Morgan Stanley's tumultuous period in April 2005 when CEO [[Philip J. Purcell|Phil Purcell]]'s management decisions were being intensely scrutinized, Meeker, along with colleagues [[Stephen S. Roach|Steve Roach]], Byron Wien, and Henry McVey, wrote a letter to then co-presidents [[Zoe Cruz]] and Steve Crawford that expressed their concerns about the damage to the culture of the firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111560152239327841|title=At Morgan Stanley, Some Worry Clash Endangers Culture|first1=Randall|last1=Smith|first2=Ann|last2=Davis|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2005-05-09|accessdate=2015-10-05}}</ref> The letter served as an important catalyst in increasing the focus of the board of directors on the depth of challenges facing Morgan Stanley at the time. In June 2005, [[John J. Mack]] was named CEO of Morgan Stanley, replacing [[Philip J. Purcell|Phil Purcell]]. A copy of the letter is included in Patricia Beard's book ''[[Blue Blood and Mutiny: The Fight for the Soul of Morgan Stanley]]'' published by HarperCollins, 2007. Meeker was named "one of the ten smartest people in tech" by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/technology/1007/gallery.smartest_people_tech.fortune/11.html|title=The smartest people in tech|publisher=Fortune|accessdate=2015-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726235802/http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/technology/1007/gallery.smartest_people_tech.fortune/11.html|archivedate=2013-07-26}}</ref>

===Kleiner Perkins===

In December 2010 Meeker left her position as a [[managing director]] at Morgan Stanley and head of the bank's global technology research team to become a partner at the venture capital firm of [[Kleiner Perkins]], where she has participated in over 20 different deals. Meeker serves on the boards of electronic signature provider [[DocuSign]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/12/docusign-raises-47-5-million-adds-mary-meeker-to-board/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714052158/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/12/docusign-raises-47-5-million-adds-mary-meeker-to-board/ |archive-date=2012-07-14|title=DocuSign raises $47.5 million, adds Mary Meeker to board|first=Miguel|last=Helft|work=Fortune|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>, mobile payments company [[Square, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite web |url= https://squareup.com/about#board|title=Square Board of Directors|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref>, and [[Peer-to-peer lending]] company [[Lending Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/2012/06/06/mary-meeker-breaks-her-investment-fast/ |title=Mary Meeker Breaks Her Investment Fast|first=Sarah|last=McBride|work=Reuters|date=6 June 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref>

In February 2011, Meeker created and compiled [http://s3.amazonaws.com/kpcbweb/files/USA_Inc.pdf 'USA Inc.,'] a non-partisan report that looked at the U.S. government (and its financials) from a business perspective. Successful stocks Meeker championed early on included [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Intuit]], [[Netscape]], [[AOL]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Yahoo!]], [[eBay]] and [[Google]]. Failed picks included [[AOL]] after its [[takeover]] of [[Time Warner]], [[Excite@Home]], and [[drugstore.com]].

Meeker was one of the witnesses in the [[Ellen Pao gender discrimination lawsuit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/03/23/a-whos-who-of-the-kleiner-perkins-ellen-pao-trial/|title=A who's who of the Kleiner Perkins-Ellen Pao trial|first=Noah|last=Kulwin|publisher=Recode|date=2015-03-23|accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref>
