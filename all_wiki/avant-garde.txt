The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many [[artists]] have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement, and still continue to do so, tracing their history from [[Dada]] through [[Situationist International|the Situationists]] and to postmodern artists such as the [[Language poets]] around 1981.<ref>[http://www.ubu.com/ UBU Web] List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the [[Saint Simonian]] [[Olinde Rodrigues]] in his essay "L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel" ("The artist, the scientist and the industrialist", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of "avant-garde" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to "serve as [the people's] avant-garde", insisting that "the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way" to social, political and economic reform.<ref>Matei Calinescu, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/five-faces-of-modernity/ The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism]'' (Durham: [[Duke University Press]], 1987).{{Page needed|date=May 2016}}</ref>

== History ==
The term was originally used by the [[French Armed Forces|French military]] to refer to a small [[Reconnaissance|reconnoitre]] group that scouted ahead of the main force. It also became associated with [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] French radicals in the nineteenth century who were agitating for [[political reform]]. At some point in the middle of that century the term was linked to art through the idea that art is an instrument for [[social change]]. Only toward the end of the nineteenth did ''l'art d'avant-garde'' begin to break away from its identification with left-wing social causes to become more aligned with cultural and artistic issues. This trend toward increased emphasis on [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] issues has continued to the present. ''Avant-garde'' today generally refers to groups of intellectuals, writers, and artists, including architects, who voice ideas and experiment with artistic approaches that challenge current cultural values. ''Avant-garde'' ideas, especially if they embrace [[social issue]]s, often are gradually assimilated by the societies they confront. The radicals of yesterday become mainstream, creating the environment for a new generation of radicals to emerge.<ref>{{cite book|title=Archispeak : an illustrated guide to architectural terms|author=Porter, Tom |date=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=0415300118|location=London|oclc=53144738}}</ref>

Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist [[Renato Poggioli]] provides one of the earliest analyses of [[vanguardism]]{{clarify|date=July 2019}}<!--The linked term has a narrow political focus. Is this really what Poggioli analyzes?--> as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book ''Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia'' (''The Theory of the Avant-Garde'').<ref>Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=suPzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA21 The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906–1940)]'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. {{ISBN|9042019093}}.</ref> Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of vanguardism, Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees  vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of [[Bohemianism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Renato Poggioli|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde|publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]|year=1968|isbn=0-674-88216-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/theoryofavantgar00pogg_0/page/11 11]|url=https://archive.org/details/theoryofavantgar00pogg_0/page/11}}, translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald</ref> Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The [[Germans|German]] literary critic Peter Bürger's ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'' (1974) looks at [[the Establishment]]'s embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, "art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work."<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Bürger|title=Theorie der Avantgarde|publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag|year=1974}} English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90.</ref>

Bürger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]] (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry'' (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.<ref>Benjamin Buchloh, ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-02454-3}}.</ref> Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions.<ref>

==Relation to mainstream society==
{{See|Mainstream}}
{{see also|Media culture|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'' by New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first= Clement|date=Fall 1939 |title=Avant-Garde and Kitsch |url=http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/collections/partisan-review/search/detail?id=283920 |magazine=The Partisan Review |pages=34–49 |volume=6 |issue=5 |access-date=24 January 2018}}</ref> Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to "high" or "mainstream" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized [[mass culture]] that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of [[capitalism]]—they are all now substantial industries—and as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore ''[[kitsch]]'': phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from [[surrealism]], but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal.

[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (front left), [[Theodor Adorno]] (front right), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the background, right, in 1965 at [[Heidelberg]], [[West Germany]].]]

Various members of the [[Frankfurt School]] argued similar views: thus [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] in their essay ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment|The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception]]'' (1944), and also [[Walter Benjamin]] in his highly influential "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935, rev. 1939).<ref>Walter Benjamin, "[http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013822/http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html |date=5 December 2006 }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}<!--Place, publisher, translator, etc. needed.--></ref> Where Greenberg used the German word ''[[kitsch]]'' to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term "[[mass culture]]" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged [[culture industry]] (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).<ref name=":0">[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf Theodor W. Adorno (1963)], "[[Culture Industry Reconsidered]]: Selected Essays on Mass Culture", London: Routledge, 1991</ref> They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled.<ref name=":0" />

The avant-garde's [[Recuperation (politics)|co-option]] by the global capitalist market, by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economies, and by what [[Guy Debord]] called ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's ''Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde'' demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by [[Richard Schechner]] in his analyses of avant-garde performance.<ref>Richard Schechner, "The Conservative Avant-Garde." ''New Literary History'' 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895–913.</ref>

Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno, and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term "avant-garde" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as "avant-garde", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as [[Matei Calinescu]] in ''Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism'' (1987),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} and Hans Bertens in ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'' (1995),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new [[post-modern]] age, when the former [[modernist]] ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.<ref>Calinescu 1987,{{page needed|date=September 2012}}; Bertens 1995.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}</ref>

Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the late 1960s.<ref>Harold Rosenberg, ''The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 {{ISBN|0-226-72673-8}}. Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973.</ref> Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called "avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, "a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it."<ref>George Dickie, "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Arts/Arts-idx?type=turn&id=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2&entity=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2.p0074&isize=text "Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski]", ''Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture'' 12, no. 2 (Summer–Fall 1975): p. 232.</ref>

There is another definition of "Avant-gardism" that distinguishes it from "modernism": Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the "institution of art" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors.<ref name="Samson" /> According to the composer and musicologist [[Larry Sitsky]], modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include [[Elliott Carter]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], and [[Luciano Berio]], since "their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience."<ref name="Sitsky_xv">Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.</ref>

The 1960s saw a wave of free and avant-garde music in [[jazz]] genre, represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]], [[John Coltrane]] and [[Miles Davis]].<ref>Anon.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Experimental theatre}}

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Neo-Dada]].
