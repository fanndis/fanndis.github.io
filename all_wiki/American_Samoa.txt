'''American Samoa''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-American Samoa.ogg|s|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|ə}} ({{IPAc-en|local|ˈ|s|ɑː|m|oʊ|ə}}; {{lang-sm|Amerika Sāmoa}}, {{IPA-all|aˈmɛɾika ˈsaːmʊa|}}; also ''{{lang|sm|Amelika Sāmoa}}'' or ''{{lang|sm|Sāmoa Amelika}}'') is an [[unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory of the United States]] located in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]], southeast of (the independent nation of) [[Samoa]].<ref name=CIAfactbook/> Its location is centered on {{coord|14.3|S|170.7|W|region:AS_type:isle|display=inline}}. It is east of the [[International Date Line]], while Samoa is west of the Line.

American Samoa consists of five main islands and two coral [[atoll]]s. The largest and most populous island is [[Tutuila]], with the [[Manu'a|Manu{{okina}}a]] Islands, [[Rose Atoll]], and [[Swains Island]] also included in the territory. All islands except for Swains Island are part of the [[Samoan Islands]], west of the [[Cook Islands]], north of [[Tonga]], and some 300 miles (500{{nbs}}km) south of [[Tokelau]]. To the west are the islands of the [[Wallis and Futuna]] group.

As of 2020 the population of American Samoa is approximately 55,212 people.<ref name="worldometers"/><ref name="pri"/><ref name="nbcnews"/>
Most American Samoans are bilingual and can speak [[American English|English]] and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] fluently.<ref name=CIAfactbook /><ref name="census detailed"/>

The total land area is {{convert|199|sqkm|1|sp=us}}, slightly more than [[Washington, D.C.]] American Samoa is the southernmost territory of the United States and one of two U.S. territories south of the Equator, along with the uninhabited [[Jarvis Island]]. Tuna products are the main exports, and the main trading partner is the rest of the United States.

American Samoa has been a member of the [[Pacific Community]] since 1983.

American Samoa is noted for having the highest rate of military enlistment of any U.S. state or territory. As of September 9, 2014, the local [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] recruiting station in [[Pago Pago]] was ranked first in production out of the 885 Army recruiting stations and centers under the [[United States Army Recruiting Command]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samoanews.com/content/en/local-us-army-recruiting-station-ranked-1-world|title=Local US Army recruiting station ranked #1 in the world – Samoa News|access-date=March 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131529/http://www.samoanews.com/content/en/local-us-army-recruiting-station-ranked-1-world|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==History==

{{Main|History of Samoa|History of American Samoa|Tui Manu'a}}
Traditional [[oral literature]] of Samoa and Manu'a talks of a widespread [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] network or [[Confederation|confederacy]] (or "empire") that was prehistorically ruled by the successive Tui Manu'a dynasties. Manuan genealogies and religious oral literature also suggest that the Tui Manu'a had long been one of the most prestigious and powerful paramounts of Samoa. Oral history suggests that the Tui Manu'a kings governed a confederacy of far-flung islands which included [[Fiji]], [[Tonga]] <ref>{{Cite book|last1=Calder|first1=Alex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIXSBlCRk3EC|title=Voyages and Beaches: Pacific Encounters, 1769–1840|last2=Lamb|first2=Jonathan|last3=Orr|first3=Bridget|date=1999-04-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2039-8|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Journal of the Polynesian Society: An Experiment In Tongan History, By E.

Commerce and exchange routes between the western Polynesian societies is well documented and it is speculated that the Tui Manu'a dynasty grew through its success in obtaining control over the oceanic trade of currency goods such as finely woven ceremonial mats, whale [[ivory]] "[[tabua]]", [[obsidian]] and [[basalt]] tools, chiefly red feathers, and seashells reserved for royalty (such as polished [[nautilus]] and the egg [[cowry]]).The Manu'a islands were grouped with [[Tutuila]] and Aunu'u as the United States possession now called American Samoa.[[File:Samoa islands 2002.gif|thumb|upright=1.8|Samoa Islands]]

===18th century: First Western contact===

Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. Dutchman [[Jacob Roggeveen]] was the first known European to sight the [[Samoan Islands]] in 1722, calling them the "Baumann Islands" after one of his captains. This visit was followed by French explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]] who named them the "Îles des Navigateurs" in 1768. British explorer [[James Cook]] recorded the island names in 1773, but never visited.<ref name="Keating">{{cite book|last1=Keating|first1=Barbara|editor1-last=Keating|editor1-first=Barbara|editor2-last=Bolton|editor2-first=Barrie|title=The Geology of the Samoan Islands, in Geology and Offshore Mineral Resources of the Central Pacific Basin, Circum-Pacific Council for Energy and Mineral Resources Earth Science Series, Vol. 14|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387977716|pages=128–129}}</ref>

The 1789 visit by [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|La Perouse]] ended in [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse#South Pacific|an attack]] and resulted in the death of his second in command [[Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle|Capt. de Langle]] and several of his crew on a [[Tutuila]] water collection expedition. La Perouse named the island "Massacre Island", and the bay near [[Aasu, American Samoa|Aasu]] is still called "Massacre Bay".<ref name=Keating/>

[[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']], under the command of [[Edward Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Edwards]], visited the island in 1791 during its search for the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|H.M.S. ''Bounty'' mutineers]]. [[Otto von Kotzebue|Von Kotzebue]] visited in 1824.<ref name=Keating/>

===19th century===

[[Christian mission|Mission work]] in the Samoas had begun in late 1830 when [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] arrived from the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson |first=R.M. |title=History of Samoa: The Advent of the Missionary.

Nevertheless, by the late nineteenth century, French, British, German, and American vessels routinely stopped at Samoa, as they valued [[Pago Pago|Pago Pago Harbor]] as a refueling station for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

====Early 20th century====

At the turn of the twentieth century, international rivalries in the latter half of the century were settled by the 1899 [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention]] in which Germany and the United States partitioned the [[Samoan Islands]] into two:<ref>Ryden, George Herbert.

Originally published at New Haven: Yale University Press, 1928), p. 574. The Tripartite Convention (United States, Germany, Great Britain) was signed at Washington on December 2, 1899, with ratifications exchanged on February 16, 1900.</ref> the eastern island group became a territory of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904)<ref name="DoI">{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/american-samoa|title=American Samoa Office of Insular Affairs|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior|date=June 11, 2015|website=www.doi.gov|access-date=August 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054757/https://www.doi.gov/oia/islands/american-samoa|archive-date=March 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and is today known as American Samoa; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known as [[German Samoa]], after Britain gave up all claims to Samoa and in return accepted the termination of German rights in [[Tonga]] and certain areas in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[West Africa]].<ref>Ryden, p. 571</ref> Forerunners to the [[Tripartite Convention]] of 1899 were the Washington Conference of 1887, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1889)|Treaty of Berlin of 1889]] and the Anglo-German Agreement on Samoa of 1899.

====American colonization====

[[File:BenjaminFranklinTilley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rear Admiral]] [[Benjamin Franklin Tilley]], the [[List of governors of American Samoa|first]] Governor of American Samoa (1900–1901)]]

The following year, the U.S. formally [[Annexation|annexed]] its portion, a smaller group of eastern islands, one of which contains the noted harbor of [[Pago Pago, American Samoa|Pago Pago]].<ref name="Americans, Almost and Forgotten">Lin, Tom C.W., [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3454210 Americans, Almost and Forgotten], 107 California Law Review (2019)</ref> After the [[United States Navy]] took possession of eastern Samoa for the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], the existing [[coaling station]] at Pago Pago Bay was expanded into a full [[Naval base|naval station]], known as [[United States Naval Station Tutuila]] and commanded by a commandant. The Navy secured a [[Deed of Cession of Tutuila]] in 1900 and a [[Deed of Cession of Manuʻa]] in 1904 on behalf of the U.S. government. The last sovereign of Manuʻa, the [[Tui Manua Elisala|Tui Manuʻa Elisala]], signed a Deed of Cession of Manuʻa following a series of U.S. naval trials, known as the "Trial of the Ipu", in Pago Pago, Taʻu, and aboard a [[Pacific Squadron]] gunboat.<ref name = "ejgsbn">{{cite book |author=Joanne Barker |title=Sovereignty Matters: Locations of Contestation and Possibility in Indigenous Struggles for Self-determination |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHp7-BTy57MC&pg=PA109 |date=2005 |publisher=U of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-5198-X |page=109 |chapter=Passive Resistance of Samoans to US and Other Colonialisms}}</ref> The territory became known as the [[United States Naval Station Tutuila|U.S. Naval Station Tutuila]].

On July 17, 1911, the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila, which was composed of Tutuila, [[Aunu'u]] and Manu'a, was officially renamed American Samoa.<ref name=tapuitea>{{cite news |first=Stan |last=Sorensen |title=Historical Notes|page =2 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2006/Tapuitea60712.pdf |work=[[Tapuitea]] |date=July 12, 2006 |access-date=August 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926183511/http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2006/Tapuitea60712.pdf |archive-date=September 26, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=snews>{{cite news |title=Manu'a celebrates 105 years under the U.S. Flag |url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=7779 |work=[[Samoa News]] |date=July 16, 2009 |access-date=August 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012532/http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=7779 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> People of [[Manu'a]] had been unhappy since they were left out of the name "Naval Station Tutuila". In May 1911, Governor [[William Michael Crose]] authored a letter to the Secretary of the Navy conveying the sentiments of Manu'a.

The traditional leaders chose “American Samoa”, and, on July 7, 1911, the [[Solicitor General of the Navy|solicitor general of the Navy]] authorized the governor to proclaim it as the name for the new territory.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|209}}

====World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic====

[[File:Gov12.JPG|thumb|upright|[[John Martin Poyer|Commander John Martin Poyer]] served as the [[List of governors of American Samoa|12th]] Governor of American Samoa (1915–1919).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150926160343/http://www.highlinehistory.org/oral_histories/Life_in_Samoa.pdf Life in Samoa from 1916 to 1919] (archived from [http://www.highlinehistory.org/oral_histories/Life_in_Samoa.pdf the original] on 2015-09-26).</ref>]]

In 1918, during the final stages of [[World War I]], the [[Spanish flu|flu pandemic]] had taken its toll, spreading rapidly from country to country. American Samoa became one of the only places in the world (the others being [[New Caledonia]] and [[Marajó|Marajó island]] in Brazil) to have proactively prevented any deaths during the pandemic through the quick response from [[John Martin Poyer|Governor John Martin Poyer]] after hearing news reports of the outbreak on the radio and requesting [[quarantine ships]] from the U.S. mainland. The result of Poyer's quick actions earned him the [[Navy Cross]] from the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]. With this distinction, American Samoans regarded Poyer as their hero for what he had done to prevent the deadly disease. The neighboring New Zealand territory at the time, [[Samoa|Western Samoa]], suffered the most of all [[Pacific Islands|Pacific islands]], with 90% of the population infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. Poyer offered assistance to help his New Zealand counterparts, but was refused by the administrator of Western Samoa, [[Robert Logan (politician)|Robert Logan]], who became outraged after witnessing the number of quarantine ships surrounding American Samoa. Angered by this, Logan cut off communications with his American counterparts.

====Interwar period====
=====American Samoa Mau movement=====

After World War I, during the time of the [[Mau movement]] in Western Samoa (then a [[League of Nations]] mandate governed by New Zealand), there was a corresponding American Samoa Mau movement led by Samuelu Ripley, a World War I veteran who was from [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]] village, Tutuila. After meetings in the United States mainland, he was prevented from disembarking from the ship that brought him home to American Samoa and was not allowed to return because the American Samoa Mau movement was suppressed by the U.S. Navy. In 1930 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] sent a committee to investigate the status of American Samoa, led by Americans who had a part in the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

=====Annexation of Swains Island=====

[[Swains Island]], which had been included in the list of guano islands [[wikt:appertain|appertain]]ing to the United States and bonded under the [[Guano Islands Act]], was [[Annexation|annexed]] in 1925 by Pub. Res. 68–75.<ref>Pub. Res. 68–75, {{USStat|43|1357}}, enacted March 4, 1925.</ref>

====World War II and aftermath====

During [[World War II]], [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] stationed in Samoa outnumbered the local population and had a huge cultural influence. Young Samoan men from age 14 and above were combat trained by [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military personnel]]. Samoans served in various capacities during World War II, including as combatants, medical personnel, code personnel, and ship repairmen.

In 1949, Organic Act 4500, a [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Department of Interior]]–sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was introduced in Congress. It was ultimately defeated, primarily through the efforts of Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota.<ref>''Story of the Legislature of American Samoa''. 1988.</ref> The efforts of these chiefs led to the creation of a territorial legislature, the [[American Samoa Fono]], which meets in the village of [[Fagatogo]]. In 1950 the Department of the Interior began to administer the American Samoa.<ref name=" Pettey">{{cite book| first = Janice Gow | last = Pettey |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5a6WtHIiEXkC&q=Guamanian+migration+to+the+united+states&pg=PA22 |title= Cultivating Diversity in Fundraising |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc.|date=2002| isbn = 978-0471226017|page=22 }}</ref>

====1951–1999====

[[File:Splashdown 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Locations of [[Pacific Ocean]] splashdowns of American spacecraft]]

By 1956, the U.S. Navy–appointed governor was replaced by [[Peter Tali Coleman]], who was locally elected. Although technically considered "unorganized" since the U.S. Congress has not passed an [[Organic Act]] for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a [[Constitution of American Samoa|constitution]] that became effective on July 1, 1967. The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], a listing which is disputed by the territorial government officials, who do consider themselves to be self-governing.

American Samoa and [[Pago Pago International Airport]] had historic significance with the [[Apollo Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Tavita_Herdrich/apollosummary.html |title=Apollo Splashdowns Near American Samoa |work=Tavita Herdrich and News Bulletin |access-date=July 7, 2010}}</ref> The [[astronaut]] crews of [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 13|13]], [[Apollo 14|14]], and [[Apollo 17|17]] were retrieved a few hundred miles from Pago Pago and transported by helicopter to the airport prior to being flown to Honolulu on [[C-141 Starlifter]] military aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17steen.html |title=Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal – Kevin Steen |work=Eric M.

While the two Samoas share language and ethnicity, their cultures have recently followed different paths, with American Samoans often emigrating to [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and the U.S. mainland, and adopting many U.S. customs, such as the playing of [[American football]] and [[baseball]]. [[Samoans]] have tended to emigrate instead to [[New Zealand]], whose influence has made the sports of [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]] more popular in the western Samoan islands. Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] noted that there were marked differences between the societies in [[Samoa]] and American Samoa.

===Pre-20th century===

[[File:Death of Langle.png|thumb|Death of [[Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle|Fleuriot de Langle]] in 1787]]

On December 10, 1787, French navigator [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]] landed two exploration parties on Tutuila's north shore: one from the ship ''[[French ship Boussole (1781)|La Boussole]]'' at Fagasa, and the other from ''[[French ship Astrolabe (1781)|L'Astrolabe]]'' at [[A'asu, American Samoa|A'asu]]. One of the cooks, David, died of "scorbutic dropsy". On December 11, twelve members of Lapérouse's crew (including First Officer [[Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle]]) were killed by angry Samoans at A'asu Bay, Tutuila, thereafter known as "Massacre Bay", which Lapérouse described as "this den, more fearful from its treacherous situation and the cruelty of its inhabitants than the lair of a lion or a tiger". This incident gave Samoa a reputation for savagery that kept Europeans away until the arrival of the first Christian missionaries four decades later. On December 12, at A'asu Bay, Lapérouse ordered his gunners to fire one cannonball in the midst of the attackers who had killed his men the day before, and were now returning to launch another attack. He later wrote in his journal "I could have destroyed or sunk a hundred canoes, with more than 500 people in them: but I was afraid of striking the wrong victims; the call of my conscience saved their lives."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tamug.edu/samoa/a_asu/history.htm |title=A Brief History of "A'asu" |publisher=Tamug.edu |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201233013/http://www.tamug.edu/samoa/a_asu/history.htm |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Marchant |first=Leslie R. |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/la-perouse-jean-francois-de-galaup-2329 |title=Biography – Jean-François de Galaup La Pérouse – Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adb.anu.edu.au |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514154001/http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/la-perouse-jean-francois-de-galaup-2329 |archive-date=May 14, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:SADIE THOMPSON BUILDING.jpg|thumb|right|250px|English author [[W. Somerset Maugham]] stayed at [[Sadie Thompson Inn]] during his six-week visit to [[Pago Pago]] in 1916.]]

On December 15, 1916, English writer [[William Somerset Maugham]] arrived in Pago Pago, allegedly accompanied by a missionary and Miss Sadie Thompson. His visit inspired his short story "Rain" which later became plays and three major Motion Pictures. The building still stands where Maugham stayed and has been renamed the [[Sadie Thompson Building]]. Today it is a prominent restaurant and inn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sadieshotels.com/hotels/sadie-thompson-inn |title=Sadie Thompson Inn &#124; Sadie's Hotels |publisher=Sadieshotels.com |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232212/http://sadieshotels.com/hotels/sadie-thompson-inn |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

On November 3, 1920, American Samoa's 12th [[List of governors of American Samoa|naval governor]], Commander [[Warren Jay Terhune]], died by suicide with a pistol in the bathroom of the government mansion, overlooking the entrance to Pago Pago Harbor. His body was discovered by Government House's cook, SDI{{clarify|date=November 2017}} First Class Felisiano Debid Ahchica, USN. His ghost is rumored to walk about the grounds at night.

On August 11, 1925, [[Margaret Mead]] arrived in American Samoa aboard the SS ''Sonoma'' to begin fieldwork for her doctoral dissertation in anthropology at Columbia University, where she was a student of Professor [[Franz Boas]]. Her work ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' was published in 1928, at the time becoming the most widely read book in the field of [[anthropology]]. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy. Mead returned to American Samoa in 1971 for the dedication of the [[Jean P. Haydon Museum]].

In 1938, the noted aviator [[Ed Musick]] and his crew died on the [[Pan American World Airways]] S-42 ''[[Samoan Clipper]]'' over Pago Pago, while on a survey flight to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. Sometime after takeoff, the aircraft experienced trouble, and Musick turned it back toward Pago Pago. While the crew dumped fuel in preparation for an emergency landing, an explosion occurred that tore the aircraft apart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clipperflyingboats.com/pan-am-pilots/edwin-musick |title=Edwin Musick – Pan Am Captain Ed Musick |publisher=Pan Am Clipper Flying Boats |access-date=February 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225015253/http://www.clipperflyingboats.com/pan-am-pilots/edwin-musick |archive-date=December 25, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On November 24, 1939, American Samoa's last execution was carried out. Imoa was convicted of stabbing Sema to death and was [[Hanging|hanged]] in the [[Custom house|Customs House]].

On January 11, 1942, at 2:26{{nbs}}am, a Japanese submarine surfaced off Tutuila between Southworth Point and [[Fagasa, American Samoa|Fagasa]] Bay and fired about 15 shells from its 5.5-inch deck gun at the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila over the next 10 minutes. The first shell struck the rear of Frank Shimasaki's store, ironically owned by one of Tutuila's few Japanese residents. The store was closed, as Mr. Shimasaki had been interned as an enemy alien. The next shell caused slight damage to the naval dispensary, the third landed on the lawn behind the naval quarters known as "Centipede Row," and the fourth struck the stone seawall outside the customs house. The other rounds fell harmlessly into the harbor. As one writer described it, "The fire was not returned, notwithstanding the eagerness of the Samoan Marines to test their skill against the enemy{{nbs}}...

{{See also|Elections in American Samoa|Political party strength in American Samoa}}

Politics of American Samoa takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[List of American Samoa Governors|Governor]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. American Samoa is an unincorporated and [[unorganized territory]] of the United States, administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]. In 1966, the [[United Nations]] gave American Samoa the option of joining the independent country of [[Samoa]], but American Samoa chose to stay in the United States.<ref name="ASamoafacts">https://www.factretriever.com/american-samoa-facts {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033720/https://www.factretriever.com/american-samoa-facts |date=December 1, 2017 }} ''42 Fun Facts About American Samoa''. Tayja Kuligowski. Factretriever.com. Retrieved November 24, 2017.</ref> American Samoa's constitution was ratified in 1966 and came into effect in 1967. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the governor. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The [[Political parties in the United States|American political parties]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) exist in American Samoa, but few politicians are aligned with the parties. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[legislature]].

There is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the "[[fa'amatai]]" and the "[[fa'asamoa]]", which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the "fono" (council) and the chief system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters.

The [['aiga]] is the family unit of Samoan society, which differs from the Western sense of a family in that it consists of an 'extended family' based on the culture's communal [[Political sociology|socio-political]] organisation. The head of the 'aiga is the matai. The matai (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are [[Commune|communal]]. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent Samoa.

In 2010, voters rejected a [[American Samoan constitutional referendum, 2010|package of amendments]] to the territorial constitution, which would have, among other things, allowed U.S. citizens to be legislators only if they had Samoan ancestry.

In 2012, both the Governor and American Samoa's delegate to the U.S. Congress [[Eni Faleomavaega]] called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/american-samoa-must-consider-independence-congressman/946070 |title=American Samoa must consider independence – congressman |publisher=Radioaustralia.net.au |date=May 18, 2012 |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030112711/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/american-samoa-must-consider-independence-congressman/946070 |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-05-18/call-for-independence-discussion-for-american-samoa/946016 |title=Call for independence discussion for American Samoa |publisher=Radioaustralia.net.au |date=May 18, 2012 |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030115729/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-05-18/call-for-independence-discussion-for-american-samoa/946016 |archive-date=October 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Immigration law====

Unique among U.S. territories, American Samoa has its own immigration law, separate from the [[List of United States immigration laws|laws that apply]] in other parts of the United States. While U.S. nationals can freely move to American Samoa, the American Samoan government, via the Immigration Board of American Samoa, controls the migration of aliens to the islands.<ref>[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b57f0.html Title 41 Citizenship, Alienage and Immigration; Immigration Laws of American Samoa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116132125/http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b57f0.html |date=November 16, 2017 }}.

Unlike all other permanently inhabited U.S. jurisdictions ([[U.S. state|states]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]), American Samoa is not considered a U.S. state for the purposes of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act. This means that alien [[lawful permanent residents (United States)|lawful permanent residents]] of the United States may be considered to have abandoned permanent residence if they have moved to live in American Samoa, and time spent there does not count for naturalization.<ref>{{uscsub|8|1101|a|36}}; {{uscsub|8|1101|a|38}}; INA sections 101(a)(36) and 101(a)(38)</ref><ref>Note that until November 28, 2009, the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] was also treated as "not a state" for the purposes of maintaining one's permanent residence or naturalization: [https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartD-Chapter3.html Volume 12{{snd}}Citizenship & Naturalization, Part D{{snd}}General Naturalization Requirements.

U.S. nationals without U.S. citizenship (the status of most American Samoans) have the right to reside in all parts of the United States without immigration restrictions. They also have the same rights as lawful permanent residents to sponsor foreign family members to immigrate to the United States (they may sponsor spouses and unmarried children), but not the same rights as U.S. citizens (who may also sponsor parents, married children and siblings).<ref>[https://www.uscis.gov/system/files_force/files/form/i-130instr.pdf Instructions for Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative], U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</ref>

====Official protest to naming of neighboring Samoa====

The U.S. Embassy in Samoa notes that: "In July 1997 the Constitution was amended to change the country's name from Western Samoa to Samoa. Samoa had been known simply as Samoa in the United Nations since joining the organization in 1976. The neighboring U.S. territory of American Samoa protested the move, feeling that the change diminished its own Samoan identity. American Samoans still use the terms Western Samoa and Western Samoans."<ref>[https://ws.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/samoan-history/ Samoan history], U.S. Embassy in Samoa.</ref>

==Climate==

American Samoa has a [[tropical climate]] all year round with two distinct [[Season#Tropics|seasons]], the [[Wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]. The wet season is usually between December and March and the dry season from April through to September with the average daily temperature around {{convert|81–83|F|C}} all year round.
<!-- A start: <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/npsa/what2pack.htm |title=Climate |publisher=[[National Park of American Samoa]] |date=December 22, 2004 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129184828/http://www.nps.gov/archive/npsa/what2pack.htm |archive-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> -->

The climate is warm, tropical, and humid, averaging around {{convert|80|F|C|1|disp=or}}, with a variation of about {{convert|15|F-change|C-change|0|disp=or}} during the year. The southern hemisphere winter, from June to September, is the coolest time of the year. The summer months of December to March bring hotter temperatures, while the months from April to November are considered the “dry” season. Throughout the year, however, rain follows clouds blown in by the trade winds that rise from the east almost daily. The mountains of the [[Pago Pago]] area, standing protectively over [[Pago Pago Harbor]], catch these clouds, bringing an average of {{convert|200|in|mm|-2|disp=or}} of rainfall per year.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|4}}

The economic health of American Samoa reflects the trends in other populated U.S. territories, which are in turn dependent on federal appropriations. Federal dollars enter the economy through congressional appropriations, categorical grants, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] payments, and payments to Samoans retired from the [[United States Military|Military]]. Tuna canning is the backbone of the American Samoa economy. Cannery employment and local auxiliary businesses provide additional revenues for the territorial government. In the mid-1960s, efforts began to develop a tourism industry in American Samoa. These efforts have been delayed due to issues such as inconsistent airlines services, insufficient high-quality accommodations, and the lack of well-trained workers in the hospitality and tourism industries. Agriculture and fishing still provide sustenance for local families.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|8–9}}

Employment on the island falls into three relatively equal-sized categories of approximately 5,000 workers each: the [[public sector]], the single remaining [[tuna]] [[cannery]], and the rest of the [[private sector]].

There are only a few [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] employees in American Samoa and a few [[active duty]] military personnel, except members of the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]], military recruiters, and some Full Time Support staff at the Pele Army Reserve unit that maintains the facility and provides cadre, training, and logistics support.

The overwhelming majority of public sector employees work for the American Samoa territorial government. The one tuna cannery is [[StarKist Tuna|StarKist]], which exports several hundred million dollars worth of canned tuna to the United States each year. The other tuna cannery was Samoa Packing, a [[Chicken of the Sea]] [[subsidiary]], but it closed in 2009 due to American Samoans being granted [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]].<ref name=minimumwage>{{cite web |url=http://www.europac.net/commentaries/congress_sacks_samoan_economy |title=Congress Sacks Samoan Economy |publisher=Europac.net |date=January 22, 2010 |access-date=November 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028174335/http://www.europac.net/commentaries/congress_sacks_samoan_economy |archive-date=October 28, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In early 2007, the Samoan economy was highlighted in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] at the request of [[Eni Faleomavaega]], the Samoan delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives]], as it was not mentioned in the [[minimum wage]] bill.{{clarify|date=October 2010}}

From 2002 to 2007, [[Real gross domestic product|real GDP]] of American Samoa increased at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent. The annual growth rates of real GDP ranged from −2.9 percent to +2.1 percent. The volatility in the growth rates of real GDP was primarily accounted for by changes in the exports of canned tuna. The tuna canning industry was the largest private employer in American Samoa during this period. In 2017, GDP in American Samoa decreased by 5.8%, but in 2018 it increased by 2.2%.<ref>https://www.bea.gov/news/2019/american-samoa-gdp-increases-2018 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828222719/https://www.bea.gov/news/2019/american-samoa-gdp-increases-2018 |date=August 28, 2019 }} BEA.gov.

From 2002 to 2007, the population of American Samoa increased at an average annual rate of 2.3 percent, and real GDP per capita decreased at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent.

Agricultural production serves as a cover for domestic needs and only a small share of fruits and vegetables are exported. According to figures as of 2013, the ratio between import and export is almost balanced. Many residents rely on transfer payments from relatives living in the mainland or from federal subsidies.<ref>Schyma, Rosemarie (2013). ''Südsee''.

[[File:ZION_CHURCH_IN_LEONE,_AMERICAN_SAMOA.jpg|thumb|Zion Church in [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]]]]

Major [[Christian denomination]]s on the island include the [[Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa]], the [[Catholic Church]], The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and the Methodist Church of Samoa. Collectively, these churches account for the vast majority of the population.

[[J. Gordon Melton]] in his book claims that the [[Methodists]], [[Congregationalists]] with the [[London Missionary Society]], and Roman Catholics led the first Christian missions to the islands. Other denominations arrived later, beginning in 1895 with the [[Seventh-day Adventists]], various [[Pentecostals]] (including the [[Assemblies of God]]), [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

According to [[Pew Research Center]], 98.3% of the total population is Christian. Among Christians, 59.5% are [[Protestant]], 19.7% are [[Roman Catholic]] and 19.2% are [[List of Christian denominations|other Christians]]. A major Protestant church on the island, gathering a substantial part of the local Protestant population, is the [[Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa]], a [[Reformed]] denomination in the [[Congregational church|Congregationalist tradition]]. {{As of|2017|8}}, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] website claims membership of 16,180 (one-quarter of American Samoa's entire population), with 41 congregations and four family history centers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/american-samoa |title=LDS Newsroom |publisher=Mormonnewsroom.org |access-date=August 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628010131/https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/facts-and-statistics/country/american-samoa |archive-date=June 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] claim 210 "ministers of the word" and three congregations.<ref>{{cite web|title=American Samoa: How Many Jehovah's Witnesses Are There?|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/worldwide/AS/|website=JW.ORG|access-date=13 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Education===

[[File:Leone high school.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leone High School]]]]

The island contains 23 [[primary school]]s. Of the ten [[secondary school]]s, five are operated by the [[American Samoa Department of Education]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.as/ |title=Welcome to ASDOE Website |publisher=Doe.as |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919171445/http://www.doe.as/ |archive-date=September 19, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> the other five are either administered by [[Parochial school|religious denominations]] or are [[Private school|privately owned]]. [[American Samoa Community College]], founded in 1970, provides [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] on the islands.

American Samoa was home to one high school as of 1961, which existed due to the matai's pressure on the naval governor to transform the old Marine barracks at [[Utulei]] into a school. The teenagers of well-off and more politically connected families attended the school, which would later be known as [[Samoana High School]]. With a median age of 15, the demand for more high schools was increasing, and three new high schools were established by 1968. Another two soon followed, and by 1979, 2,800 high school students were attending six public and private high schools in American Samoa. Looking for a cost-effective way for educational reformation, Governor [[H. Rex Lee]] introduced the public television system in 1964.<ref name=Ruck />

==Culture==

[[File:Jean p haydon museum.png|thumb|right|[[Jean P. Haydon Museum]] in [[Pago Pago]]]]

The Samoan culture has developed over 3,500 years and largely withstood interaction with European cultures. It was adapted well to the teachings of [[Christianity in American Samoa|Christianity]]. The Samoan language is still in use in daily exchange; however, English is widely used and also the legal official language. Besides [[Samoan language]] classes and cultural courses, all instructions in public schools are in English. The basic unit of the American Samoa culture is the ''aiga'' (family). It consists of both immediate and extended family.

The ''matai'', or chief, is the head of the aiga. The chief is the custodian of all aiga properties. A village (nu'u) is made up of several or many aiga with a common or shared interest. Each aiga is represented by their chief in the village councils.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|5–6}}

The [[1997 South Pacific Mini Games]] were the biggest international event ever to take place in American Samoa. The bid to host the games for the 23 participating countries was approved in May 1993. In January 1994, Governor [[A. P. Lutali]] appointed Fuga Teleso to head the task force charged with game preparations, including the construction of a stadium. Groundbreaking was in January 1994. The Governor later handed the task force on preparations to Lieutenant Governor Togiola. The task force merged with the American Samoa National Olympics Committee to better coordinate and facilitate preparations. V.P. Willis Construction built the 1,500 seat stands. The [[American Samoa Department of Public Safety|Department of Public Safety]] trained its force for special games security. The opening ceremony became extravagant where the [[U.S. Army Reserve]] carried the torch from [[Tula, American Samoa|Tula]] and [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]].<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|357–358}}

About 2,000 athletes, coaches, and sponsors attended from 19 countries and competed in 11 sports at the game. American Samoa fielded a team of 248 athletes. The team won 48 medals, 22 of which were gold medals, and American Samoa came in fourth overall in the ratings. [[American Samoa Rotary Club]] honored Fuga Tolani Teleso with the community's top award, the Paul Harris Fellowship Award, for his work on constructing the [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (Pago Pago)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]].<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|359}}

In 1982, yachters competed in the Hobie World Championship held in [[Tahiti]]. American Samoa beat the [[Apia]] team by half a point and won the Samoa Cup. In 1983, a team coached by Dr. Adele Satele-Galeai brought home the winning trophy from the Regional Women's Volleyball Tournament in [[Hawai'i]]. Also in 1983, the [[South Pacific Games]] were held in Apia. American Samoa received 13 medals: four gold, four silver, and five bronze. That same year, three junior golfers made the cut out of 1,000 players to attend the World Junior Golf Tournament in [[San Diego, California]].<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|338}}

In 1987, American Samoa became the 167th member of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. The first South Pacific Junior Tennis Tournament was held at the [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] courts in January 1990.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|339}}

Six-time [[All-Pro]] [[Junior Seau]] was one of the most famous Americans of Samoan heritage ever to play in the NFL, having been elected to the [[NFL 1990s All-Decade Team]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] safety [[Troy Polamalu]], though born and raised in the mainland United States, is another famous American of Samoan heritage to have played in the NFL, not having his hair cut since 2000 (and only because a [[USC Trojans football|USC]] coach told him he had to) and wearing it down during games in honor of his heritage.

====Rugby union====

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}

[[Rugby union in American Samoa|Rugby union]] is a growing sport in American Samoa. The first rugby game recorded in American Samoa was in 1924, since then the development of the game had been heavily overshadowed by the influence of [[American Football]] during the 1970s. The highest governing body of rugby in American Samoa is the [[American Samoa Rugby Union]] which was founded in 1990 and was not affiliated into the [[World Rugby|IRB]] until 2012. Internationally, two American Samoans have played for the [[New Zealand]] national rugby union team, known as the [[All Blacks]]. [[Frank Solomon]] (born in [[Pago Pago]]) became the first American national of Samoan descent to play for a New Zealand team. Considered a pacific pioneer in New Zealand rugby,{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} Solomon scored a try against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in the inaugural [[Bledisloe Cup]] match in 1932, which New Zealand won 21–13.

The second American Samoan to play for the All Blacks is [[Jerome Kaino]] (born in [[Faga'alu]]). A native of [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]], Kaino moved to New Zealand when he was four. In 2004, at age 21, he played his first match for New Zealand against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] where he scored his first try, contributing to New Zealand's 47–19 victory that resulted in him becoming man of the match. He also played a crucial role in the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]] playing every match in the tournament. He scored four tries in the event which led to New Zealand winning the final against [[France national rugby union team|France]] 8–7. Kaino was also a key member of the [[Rugby World Cup 2015|2015 Rugby World Cup]] squad, where he played every match including a try he scored in the quarterfinals against [[France national rugby union team|France]] which New Zealand won 62–13. He scored again in the semifinals against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], which New Zealand won 20–18. He played in the World Cup final against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] where New Zealand won again 34–17 to become world champions for a record three times (1987, 2011 and 2015). Kaino is one of twenty New Zealand rugby players to have won the [[Rugby World Cup]] twice, back to back in 2011 and 2015.

A team from the [[Bureau of Outdoor Recreation]] conducted a parks survey on American Samoa in the 1960s. Their team recommended sites at [[Cape Taputapu]], [[Le'ala Shoreline|Le'ala]] at [[Vailoatai, American Samoa|Vailoatai]], [[A'oloau|A'oloau Fou]] (the plateau), Matautuloa Point, [[Nu'uuli]], [[Matafao Peak]], [[Pago Pago]], [[Vai'ava Strait]], Anasosopo, [['Aoa]], Cape Matautuloa, and [[Aunu'u|Aunu'u Island]]. After an initial objection, Secretary Le'iato gave his support and was appointed Chairman of the Territorial Parks and Recreation Committee. The first field meeting for a parkland acquisition was held between Judge Morrow on behalf of the government and the village council of [[Vatia, American Samoa|Vatia]] to make the [[Pola Island]] area a public park. The dredge ''Palolo'' was hired from [[Upolu]] in January 1966 in order to dredge sand for [[Utulei|Utulei Beach]]. A specialist in beach developments, Ala Varone of the Army, directed the project. The centerpiece of the park was to be at the head of [[Pago Pago Harbor]], where it proposed a 13-acre site created by the dredge. The park would have facilities for sports and recreation as well as facilities for boats and the growing number of Asian immigrants arriving from Korea, Japan and China.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|285}}

The Department of Parks and Recreation was created by law in 1980 and the Parks Commission was also established.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|315}} In 1981, Governor [[Peter Tali Coleman]] appointed Fuga Tolani Teleso as Director of Parks and Recreation. On May 25, 1984, a groundbreaking ceremony was held at the Onesosopo reclamation to initiate work on the first park in the [[Eastern District, American Samoa|Eastern District]].<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|332}}

At the urging of Dr. Paul Cox, High Chief Nafanua of [[Falealupo]], and the Bat Preservers Association, Congressman [[Fofó Iosefa Fiti Sunia]] introduced a bill in 1984 which would enter American Samoa into the Federal Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. The purpose of the bill was to protect the ancient [[paleotropical]] rainforests and the [[Flying fox]] [[megabat]]. The signing marked the beginning of American Samoa's entry into the U.S. [[National Park System]]. In July 1987, the National Park Service began establishing a federal park. An initial appropriation of $400,000 was made in 1989. It contains one of the world's most remarkable rain forest and coastal reef ecologies and spreads across three islands. One of the most popular sites on [[Tutuila|Tutuila Island]] include Pola Rock, a rise of sheer rock formations that protrudes over 400{{nbs}}feet (120{{nbs}}m) above the ocean's surface. It is located off the shores of [[Vatia, American Samoa|Vatia]].<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|332}} On September 19, 1991, Governor [[Peter Tali Coleman]] and [[Department of the Interior]] secretary [[Manuel Lujan]] signed leases formalizing the establishment of the fiftieth U.S. National Park.<ref name="Sunia-2009"/>{{rp|335}}

===Fruit bats===

[[File:Pteropus_samoensis2-2-2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Samoa flying fox]] is only found in Fiji and the Samoan Islands.]]

[[Megabat]]s are the only native mammal in American Samoa. The islands are home to two species of fruit bats: [[Pacific Flying Fox]] and [[Samoa flying fox]]. The [[Sheath-tailed bat]] is another species found here, which is a smaller insect-eating bat. In 1992, the American Samoa Government banned the hunting of fruit bats to help their populations recover.<ref>Haberle, Simon and Janelle Stevenson (2010).

===Avifauna===

[[File:Vini_australis_-London_Zoo,_England-8a.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Blue-crowned lorikeet]] is the only parrot found in American Samoa.]]

Sixteen of the Samoan Islands’ 34 bird species are found nowhere else on Earth. This includes the critically endangered [[Tooth-billed pigeon]].<ref>Stanley, David (1982). ''South Pacific Handbook''.

There are more species of birds than all species of reptiles, mammals and amphibians combined. Native land birds include two honeyeaters: [[Cardinal honeyeater]] and [[Wattled honeyeater]]. Cardinal honeyeaters only occur on Tutuila Island. The only endemic land bird to American Samoa is the [[Samoan starling]]. Four pigeons are native to American Samoa: [[Pacific imperial pigeon]], [[Many-colored fruit dove]], [[White-capped fruit dove]], and [[Shy ground dove]]. The local government banned all pigeon hunting in 1992.<ref>Haberle, Simon and Janelle Stevenson (2010). ''Altered Ecologies: Fire, Climate and Human Influence on Terrestrial Landscapes''.
