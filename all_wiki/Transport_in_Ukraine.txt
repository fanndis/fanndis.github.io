'''Transport in [[Ukraine]]''' includes ground transportation (road and rail), water (sea and river), air transportation, and pipelines. The transportation sector accounts for roughly 11% of the country's gross domestic product and 7% of total employment.

==Economy ==
===Transport Infrastructure===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
Today the transport sector in [[Ukraine]] generally meets only the basic needs of the economy and population. The level of safety, quality and efficiency of passenger and freight transport, as well as the infrastructure's amount of energy usage, and the technological burden it places on the environment do not meet modern-day requirements.

Due to the low level of demand, the country's existing transit potential and advantageous geographical position is not fully utilised. There is thus a lag in the development of transport infrastructure, transport and logistics technologies and [[multimodal transport]]. All this has made Ukraine uncompetitive as the high costs of transport across the country make the cost of production in the country uncommonly high.

===International Transport Corridors===
The advantageous geographical position of Ukraine allows for the location of a number of International Transport Corridors on its territory, in particular :
* [[Pan-European corridors|Pan-European transport corridors]] № 3, 5, 7, 9;
* Rail Co-Operation Corridors (ORC) № 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and
* European Transport Corridors – Caucasus – Asia ([[TRACECA]]) and Europe – Asia.

=== Transport Industry ===
{{update|section|date=September 2013}}
The share of the transport sector in Ukraine's gross domestic product (according to Goskomstat) as of 2009 was 11.3%. The number of workers employed in the sector is almost 7% of total employment. The transportation infrastructure of Ukraine is adequately developed overall, however it is obsolete and in need of major modernization. A remarkable boost in the recent development of the country's transportation infrastructure was noticed after winning the right to host a major continental sport event the [[UEFA Euro 2012]].

In 2009, Ukrainian infrastructure provided for the transportation of 1.5 billion tons of cargo and 7.3 billion passengers. As the global financial crisis took hold and demand for major export commodities in 2009 fell, the volume of freight traffic decreased by 17.6% when compared with figures from 2008; passenger transport fell by 12.7%.

The public railways in Ukraine are managed by the state railway company [[Ukrzaliznytsia]]<ref>Industrial railways and [[rapid transit|metro]]s in cities are managed independently.</ref>

===Network length (2010)===
The length of the railway network Ukraine ranks third in Europe (21.7000 kilometres of track).

* [[Transportation in Poland|Poland]] ([[break-of-gauge]]: {{RailGauge|1520mm}} / {{RailGauge|1435mm}} plus a standard gauge cross-border cargo line)

===Rolling stock and service===
Ukrainian trains and rail infrastructure are incapable of speeds more than 160 kilometres per hour. However, the number of railway passengers and freight is increasing. The government had made large investments in rail transportation in preparation for [[Euro 2012]]. There are intercity trains between [[Euro 2012]] cities ([[Kyiv]], [[Lviv]], [[Kharkiv]] and formerly [[Donetsk]]).

[[File:Автодорога Київ — Одеса, с. Віта-Поштова 003.jpg|thumb|Section of the <span class="nowrap">[[European route E95 in Ukraine|E95]]</span> / <span class="nowrap">[[Highway M05 (Ukraine)|M05]]</span> highway near [[Kyiv]].]]
The development of public roads in Ukraine is currently lagging behind the pace of motorisation in the country. During 1990-2010 the length of the highways network hardly increased at all. The density of highways in Ukraine is 6.6 times lower than in France (respectively 0.28 and 1.84 kilometres of roads per square kilometre area of the country). The length of express roads in Ukraine is 0.28 thousand km (in Germany – 12.5 thousand kilometres in France – 7.1 thousand kilometres), and the level of funding for each kilometre of road in Ukraine is around 5.5 – 6 times less than in those locations.

This is due to a number of objective reasons, including that the burden of maintaining the transport network per capita is significantly higher than in  European countries because of Ukraine's relatively low [[population density]] (76 people per square kilometre), low [[purchasing power]] of citizens (1/5 of the [[Eurozone]]'s purchasing capacity), relatively low car ownership and the nation's large territory.

The operational condition of roads is very poor; around 51.1% of roads do not meet minimum standards, and 39.2% require major rebuilds. The average speed on roads in Ukraine 2–3 times lower than in Western countries.
As of 2016, many of Ukraine's major provincial highways are in very poor condition, with an Ukravtodor official stating that 97% of roads are in need of repair.  The road repair budget was set at about 20 billion [[hryvnia]]s, but [[Corruption in Ukraine|corruption]] causes the budget to be poorly spent and overweight trucks are common place rapidly causing more road damage.<ref name=foreignpolicy-20160616>{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/06/16/ukraines-broken-road-to-europe/ |title=Ukraine's Broken Road to Europe |author=Dan Peleschuk |newspaper=Foreign Policy |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}</ref>
