It evolved from the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP),  which never entered into force due to the withdrawal of the United States. At the time of its signing, the eleven countries' combined economies represented 13.4 percent of the global [[gross domestic product]] (approximately {{US$|13.5}} trillion), making the CPTPP the third largest [[free-trade area]] in the world by GDP after the [[United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement]], the [[European Single Market]],<ref name=diplomat>{{cite news |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/tpp-2-0-the-deal-without-the-us/ |title=TPP 2.0: The Deal Without the US |first=Zachary |last=Torrey |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=2018-02-03 |access-date=2018-04-13 }}</ref> and possibly after the 2020 signed [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]].

The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was signed on 4 February 2016, but never entered into force, as [[Donald Trump]] withdrew the US from the agreement soon after being elected.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/23/news/economy/tpp-trump-china/ |title=Trump's decision to kill TPP leaves door open for China |last=Riley |first=Charles |date=23 January 2017 |work=[[CNN Business|CNN Money]] |accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref> All original TPP signatories except the US agreed in May 2017 to revive it<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/tpp-nations-agree-to-pursue-trade-deal-without-us.html |title=TPP nations agree to pursue trade deal without US |first1=Sri |last1=Jegarajah |first2=Craig |last2=Dale |first3=Leslie |last3=Shaffer |date=2017-05-21 |work=[[CNBC]] |access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/saving-the-trans-pacific-partnership-what-are-the-tpps-prospects-after-the-us |title=Saving the Trans-Pacific Partnership: What are the TPP's prospects after the US withdrawal? |author=Staff writers |date=2017-05-21 |work=[[The Straits Times]] |access-date=2017-05-21}}</ref> and reached agreement in January 2018 to conclude the CPTPP.

Two-thirds of the provisions in the signed CPTPP are identical to the TPP draft at the time the US left the negotiating process. The chapter on [[state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) is unchanged, requiring signatories to share information about SOEs with each other, with the intent of engaging with the issue of state intervention in markets. It includes the most detailed standards for intellectual property of any trade agreement, as well as protections against intellectual property theft against corporations operating abroad.<ref name="CSIS">{{Cite news|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/tpp-cptpp|title=From TPP to CPTPP|last=Goodman|first=Matthew P.|date=2018-03-08|work=[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

Twenty-two TPP provisions that were priorities of the US but not other negotiating partners were suspended or modified in the CPTPP.<ref name="CSIS"/> One of the most contested provisions advocated for by the US, was for an increase in the ability of companies to sue national governments, in particular over strict regulations over oil and gas developments. Another was the US insistence that [[copyright]] be extended to the author's lifetime plus 70 years; this requirement was removed in the CPTPP.<ref name="diplomat"/> Japan did extend the copyright period to life plus 70 years,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/10/national/japan-extend-copyright-period-works-including-novels-paintings-70-years-Dec-30/ |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Japan to extend copyright period on works including novels and paintings to 70 years on Dec. 30 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |agency=[[Jiji Press]] |date=2018-12-10 |access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> which was a requirement stemming from the [[EU–Japan Economic Partnership Agreement]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0193&from=EN |quote=The term of protection for rights of an author of a literary or artistic work within the meaning of Article 2 of the Berne Convention shall run for the life of the author and for 70 years after the author's death |publisher=[[European Commission]] |title=Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan, Article 14.13}}</ref>

== Negotiations ==
During the round of negotiations held concurrently with the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum [[APEC Vietnam 2017|in Vietnam in November 2017]], Canadian PM [[Justin Trudeau]] refused to sign the agreement in principle, stating reservations about the provisions on culture and automotives. Media outlets in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, which strongly supported quick movement on a deal, strongly criticized what they portrayed as Canadian sabotage.<ref name="cbc_20171111">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-tpp-canada-not-ready-apec-1.4398824|title='We weren't ready' to close deal: Trudeau defends Canada's actions on TPP |publisher=CBC News|date=2017-11-11|access-date=2018-04-14 }}</ref>

Canada insisted that cultural and language rights, specifically related to its French-speaking minority, be protected.<ref name="cbc_20180123">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tpp-champagne-deal-1.4499616|title=Canada reaches deal on revised Trans-Pacific Partnership |publisher=CBC News|date=2018-01-23|access-date=2018-04-14 }}</ref>

However, Canada's major reservation was a conflict between the percentage of a vehicle that must originate in a CPTPP member nation to enter tariff-free, which was 45% under the original TPP language and 62.5% under the NAFTA agreement. Japan, which is a major automobile part exporter, strongly supports lower requirements.<ref name="cbc_20171111"/> In January 2018, Canada announced that it would sign the CPTPP after obtaining binding side letters on culture with every other CPTPP member country, as well as bilateral agreements with Japan, Malaysia, and Australia related to non-tariff barriers. Canada's [[Auto Parts Manufacturers' Association]] sharply criticized increasing the percentages of automobile parts that may be imported tariff-free, noting that the United States was moving in the opposite direction by demanding stricter importation standards in the ongoing NAFTA renegotiation.<ref name="cbc_20180123"/>

In February 2019, Canada's Jim Carr, Minister of International Trade Diversification, delivered a keynote address at a seminar concerning CPTPP - Expanding Your Business Horizons, reaching out to businesses stating the utilisation of the agreement provides a bridge that will enable people, goods and services to be shared more easily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2019/02/minister-carr-calls-on-manitoba-businesses-to-expand-their-horizons-with-the-help-of-the-cptpp.html |title=Minister Carr calls on Manitoba businesses to expand their horizons with the help of the CPTPP |publisher=Government of Canada|date=2019-02-13|access-date=2019-06-14 }}</ref>

On 17 April 2019, the CTPPP was approved by the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile]]. The final round of approval in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] was scheduled for November 2019, after being approved by its Commission of Constitution. However, one of the demands of the [[2019 Chilean protests]] was the rejection of the treaty,<ref>https://ruptly.tv/en/videos/20190822-006</ref>{{dubious|date=July 2020}} so the Senate decided to suspend the session regarding the CTPPP on 11 November 2019.

== Potential future members ==
===United Kingdom===
In January 2018, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] stated it was exploring membership of the CPTPP to stimulate exports after [[Brexit]] and has held informal discussions with several of the members.<ref name=":37">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/03/britain-in-talks-to-join-the-tpp-to-boost-trade-after-brexit|title=Britain exploring membership of the TPP to boost trade after Brexit|last=Gregory|first=Julia|date=2018-01-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The country has an overseas territory, the [[Pitcairn Islands]], in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lowe |first1=Sam |title=TPP: The UK is having a Pacific pipe dream |url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/another-week-wishful-thinking-from-the-department-for-international-trade |accessdate=3 November 2018 |work=Prospect |date=5 January 2018 |quote=For one, unless we are planning on assigning far greater significance to the Pitcairn Islands (which form the last British overseas territory in the region) the UK is not a Pacific power, so the name of the trade deal would need to change.}}</ref> In October 2018, Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] said he would welcome the United Kingdom joining the partnership post-Brexit.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McCurry |first1=Justin |title=UK welcome to join Pacific trade pact after Brexit, says Japanese PM |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/08/uk-welcome-to-join-pacific-trade-pact-after-brexit-says-japanese-pm |accessdate=8 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=8 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In a joint [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] article with [[Simon Birmingham]], [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]], and [[Chan Chun Sing]], the trade ministers of Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, UK Secretary of State for Trade, Liz Truss, expressed the United Kingdom's intent to join the CPTPP.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Truss|first=Liz|date=2020-04-28|title=Enemies of free trade must not be allowed to use coronavirus to bring back protectionism|language=en-GB|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/04/28/enemies-free-trade-must-not-allowed-use-coronavirus-bring-back/|access-date=2020-04-30|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

The UK Department for Trade's chief negotiator [[Crawford Falconer]] helped lead the [[New Zealand]] negotiations for the predecessor [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] before leaving the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6682181/Diplomats-take-the-gloves-off |title=Diplomats take the gloves off |last=Watkins |first=Tracy |date=3 April 2012 |website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200915191511/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/6682181/Diplomats-take-the-gloves-off |url-status=live |archive-date=15 September 2020 |access-date=15 September 2020}}</ref>

In June 2020, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] issued a policy paper<ref>"UK Government: UK approach to joining the CPTPP trade agreement" https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-approach-to-joining-the-cptpp-trade-agreement</ref> reaffirming the UK's position on accession to the CPTPP. There were three reasons given:
* Securing increased trade and investment opportunities that will help the UK economy overcome the unprecedented challenge posed by [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus]]. Joining CPTPP would open up new opportunities for UK exporters in strategically important sectors and helping to support an industrial revival in the UK.
* Helping the United Kingdom diversify trading links and supply chains, and in doing so increasing economic security at a time of heightened uncertainty and disruption in the world.
* Assisting the UK's future place in the world and advancing the UK's longer-term interests. CPTPP membership is an important part of our strategy to place the UK at the centre of a modern, progressive network of free trade agreements with dynamic economies. Doing so would turn the UK into a global hub for businesses and investors wanting to trade with the rest of the world.

Furthermore, the UK government stated that in 2019, each region and nation of the UK exported at least £1 billion ($1.25 billion) worth of goods to CPTPP member countries.<ref>"Office for National Statistics: Foreign direct investment involving UK companies: outward" https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessinnovation/datasets/foreigndirectinvestmentinvolvingukcompaniesoutwardtables</ref> The UK government also highlighted that UK companies held close to £98 billion worth of investments in CPTPP countries in 2018<ref>"Office for National Statistics: UK total trade: all countries, non-seasonally adjusted" https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/datasets/uktotaltradeallcountriesnonseasonallyadjusted</ref> and that in 2019, the UK did more than £110 billion ($137 billion) worth of trade with countries in the CPTPP free trade area.<ref>"HM Revenue & Customs: UK Imports and Exports by Region, year to March 2020" https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/RTS/Pages/default.aspx</ref>

The UK government has not produced an impact assessment that explains or quantifies the benefits it expects for the UK economy from accession to CPTPP. <ref>https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/trade-cptpp</ref> As such, it is a matter of dispute in UK as to whether accession is worth pursuing for economic reasons. <ref>https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/TUC%20CPTPP%20consultation%20final%20response_0.pdf</ref> Farmer, environmental and consumer groups have all raised concerns that the UK government will need to agree to lowering standards on pesticides, pig welfare and food labelling. <ref>https://www.nfuonline.com/news/latest-news/food-standards-petition/</ref> These concerns have also been raised by the Scottish government.<ref>https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/consultation-analysis/2018/12/trade-policy-response-uk-government-consultation-future-free-trade-agreements/documents/00543644-pdf/00543644-pdf/govscot%3Adocument/00543644.pdf</ref>

===United States===
On 25 January 2018, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] in an interview announced his interest in possibly rejoining the TPP if it were a "substantially better deal" for the United States. He withdrew the U.S. from the original agreement in January 2017.<ref name=":35" /> On 12 April 2018, he told the [[White House National Economic Council]] Director [[Larry Kudlow]] and U.S. Trade Representative [[Robert Lighthizer]] to look into joining the new deal.<ref name="Trump to explore entering Pacific trade pact he once called 'a disaster'">{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/382867-trump-orders-officials-to-look-into-re-entering-tpp-trade-pact|title=Trump to explore entering Pacific trade pact he once called 'a disaster'|first=Geoffrey|last=Rowland|date=12 April 2018|website=TheHill|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref> U.S. Wheat Associates President Vince Peterson had said in December 2018 that American wheat exporters could face an “imminent collapse” in their 53% market share in Japan due to CPTPP. Peterson added, “Our competitors in Australia and Canada will now benefit from those [CPTPP] provisions, as US farmers watch helplessly.” The [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]] stated that exports of beef to Japan, America's largest export market, would be at a serious disadvantage to Australian exporters as their tariffs on exports to Japan would be cut by 27.5% during the first year of CPTPP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trade-tpp-idUSKCN1OT00C|title=Pacific trade pact takes off with tariffs cut in six nations|date=30 December 2018|accessdate=30 December 2018|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/us-farmers-helpless-as-tpp-boosts-aust|title=US farmers 'helpless' as TPP boosts Aust|website=SBS News|accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>
