The majority of Serbs live in their [[nation state]] of [[Serbia]], as well as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Kosovo]].{{efn|name=status}} They also form significant minorities in [[North Macedonia]] and [[Slovenia]]. There is a large [[Serb diaspora]] in [[Western Europe]], and outside [[Europe]] and there are significant communities in [[North America]] and [[Australia]].

The Serbs share many cultural traits with the rest of the peoples of [[Southeast Europe]]. They are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] by religion. The Serbian language is official in Serbia, co-official in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is spoken by the plurality in Montenegro.

==Ethnology==

The identity of Serbs is rooted in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and traditions. In the 19th century, the [[Serbian national identity]] was manifested, with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Three elements, together with the legacy of the [[Nemanjić dynasty]], were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], the [[Serbian language]], and the [[Kosovo Myth]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ana S.

The history of the early medieval [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Serbian Principality]] is recorded in the 10th-century work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', which describes the Serbs as a people living in [[Dalmatia (theme)|Roman Dalmatia]], subordinate to the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|pp=153–155}} Numerous small Serbian states were created, chiefly under [[Vlastimirović dynasty|Vlastimorović]] and [[Vojislavljević dynasty|Vojislavjević]] dynasties, located in modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], and [[Serbia]], but the population's Serbian ethnic identity remains unclear and a matter of dispute.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Živković|first=Tibor|authorlink=Tibor Živković|title=De conversione Croatorum et Serborum: A Lost Source|year=2012|location=Belgrade|publisher=The Institute of History|url=https://www.academia.edu/1231887|pages=161–162, 181–196}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Budak|first=Neven|title=Prva stoljeća Hrvatske|year=1994|location=Zagreb|publisher=Hrvatska sveučilišna naklada|url=http://inet1.ffst.hr/_download/repository/Budak_1994.pdf|pages=58–61|quote=Glavnu poteškoću uočavanju etničke raznolikosti Slavena duž jadranske obale činilo je tumačenje Konstantina Porfirogeneta, po kojemu su Neretvani (Pagani), Zahumljani, Travunjani i Konavljani porijeklom Srbi.

Over the next 140 years, Serbia expanded its borders, from numerous smaller principalities, reaching to a unified [[Serbian Empire]]. Its cultural model remained Byzantine, despite political ambitions directed against the empire. The medieval power and influence of Serbia culminated in the reign of [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stefan Dušan]], who ruled the state from 1331 until his death in 1355.

In 1688, [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|the Habsburg army took Belgrade]] and entered the territory of present-day [[Central Serbia]]. [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] called Serbian Patriarch [[Arsenije III Čarnojević]] to raise arms against the Turks; the Patriarch accepted and returned to the liberated Peć. As Serbia fell under Habsburg control, Leopold I granted Arsenije nobility and the title of duke. In early November, Arsenije III met with Habsburg commander-in-chief, [[General Enea Silvio Piccolomini]] in [[Prizren]]; after this talk he sent a note to all Serb bishops to come to him and collaborate only with Habsburg forces.

A [[Great Migration of the Serbs (1690)]] to Habsburg lands was undertaken by Patriarch Arsenije III.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983|p=145}} The large community of Serbs concentrated in Banat, southern Hungary and the Military Frontier included merchants and craftsmen in the cities, but mainly refugees that were peasants.{{sfn|Jelavich|1983|p=145}}

More than half a million Serbs were killed in the territory of Yugoslavia during World War II.

Modern demographic distribution of ethnic Serbs throughout [[Serbian lands|homeland and native]] regions, as well as in [[Serbs in diaspora|Serbian ethnic disapora]], represents an outcom of several historical and demographic processes, shaped both by [[economic migrations]] and [[forced displacements]] during the recent [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991-1999).

===Serbs in homelands===
There are nearly 8&nbsp;million Serbs living in their native homelands, within the geographical borders of former [[Yugoslavia]]. In Serbia itself, around 6&nbsp;million people identify themselves as ethnic Serbs, and constitute about 83% of the population. More than a million live in [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (predominantly in the [[Republika Srpska]]), where they are one of the three [[Nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent ethnic groups]]. Serbs in [[Serbs in Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegro]] also have recognized collective rights, and number some 186,000 and 178,000 people, respectively, while another estimated 96,000 live in the disputed area of [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo]].<ref name="Cocozelli"/> Smaller minorities exist in [[Serbs in Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Serbs of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]], some 36,000 and 39,000 people, respectively.

Outside of the former Yugoslavia, but within their historical and migratory areal, Serbs are officially recognized as national minority in [[Serbs in Albania|Albania]],{{sfn|Djordjević|Zaimi|2019|p=53-69}} [[Serbs in Romania|Romania]] (18,000), [[Serbs in Hungary|Hungary]] (7,000), as well as in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Serbs of Slovakia|Slovakia]].

There are over 2&nbsp;million Serbs in [[diaspora]] throughout the world; some sources put that figure as high as 4&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biz – Vesti – Srbi za poslom idu i na kraj sveta|publisher=B92|url=http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|accessdate=17 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213053823/http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2012&mm=04&dd=30&nav_id=605046|archivedate=13 December 2014}}</ref> There is a large diaspora in Western Europe, particularly in [[Serbs in Germany|Germany]], [[Serbs in Austria|Austria]], [[Immigration from the former Yugoslavia to Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Serbs in France|France]], and [[Swedish Serbs|Sweden]]. Outside Europe, there are significant Serb communities in the [[Serbian American|United States]], [[Serbian Canadians|Canada]], [[Serbian Australian|Australia]], [[South America]] and [[Southern Africa]]. The existence of a large diaspora is mainly a consequence of either economic or political ([[coercion]] or expulsions) reasons. There were several waves of Serb emigration:

* The first wave took place since the end of the 19th century and lasted until [[World War II]] and was caused by economic reasons; particularly large numbers of Serbs (mainly from peripheral ethnic areas such as [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and [[Lika]]) emigrated to the United States.
* The second wave took place after the end of [[World War II]]. At this time, members of royalist [[Chetniks]] and other political opponents of communist regime fled the country mainly going overseas ([[United States]] and [[Australia]]) and, to a lesser degree, [[United Kingdom]].
* The third wave, by far the largest, consisted of economic emigration beginning in the 1960s when several Western European countries signed bilateral agreements with Yugoslavia, allowing the recruitment of industrial workers to those countries; this lasted until the end of the 1980s. The major  destinations for migrants were [[West Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], and to a lesser extent [[France]] and [[Sweden]]. That generation of diaspora is collectively known as ''gastarbajteri'', after German ''[[gastarbeiter]]'' ("guest-worker"), since most of the emigrants headed for German-speaking countries.
* Later emigration took place during the 1990s, and was caused by both political and economic reasons. The [[Yugoslav wars]] caused many Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to leave their countries in the first half of the 1990s. The [[Sanctions against Serbia|economic sanctions]] imposed on Serbia caused an economic collapse with an estimated 300,000 people leaving Serbia during that period, 20% of which had a higher education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|title=Serbia seeks to fill the '90s brain-drainage gap|publisher=EMG.rs|date=5 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529021627/http://www.emg.rs/en/news/serbia/61642.html|archivedate=29 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="survey">{{cite web|url=http://www.pregled-rs.com/article.php?pid=208&id=19625&lang=en|title=Survey S&M 1/2003|publisher=Yugoslav Survey}}</ref>

Serbian is an official language in Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and is a recognized minority language in Montenegro (although spoken by a plurality of population), Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia.

==Culture==
[[Literature of Serbia|Literature]], [[icon]] painting, music, dance and medieval architecture are the artistic forms for which Serbia is best known. Traditional [[Art of Serbia|Serbian visual art]] (specifically [[fresco]]es, and to some extent [[icon]]s), as well as ecclesiastical architecture, are highly reflective of Byzantine traditions, with some Mediterranean and Western influence.<ref>Димитрије Оболенски ''„Византијски комонвелт“'', Београд. 1991</ref>

Many Serbian monuments and works of art have been lost forever due to various wars and peacetime marginalizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kadijević|first=Aleksandar Đ.|year=2017|title=About typology and meaning of the Serbian public architectural monuments (19–20th centuries)|journal=Matica Srpska Journal for Fine Arts|volume=45}}</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main article|Serbian literature}}
{{See also|Serbian epic poetry|Serbian comics}}

Most literature written by early Serbs was about religious themes. Various [[gospel]]s, [[psalters]], [[menologies]], [[hagiographies]], and essays and sermons of the founders of the Serbian Orthodox Church were written. At the end of the 12th century, two of the most important pieces of Serbian medieval literature were created– the [[Miroslav Gospels]] and the [[Vukan Gospels]], which combined handwritten Biblical texts with painted initials and small pictures.{{sfn|Cox|2002|p=20}} Notable [[Baroque]]-influenced authors were [[Andrija Zmajević]], [[Gavril Stefanović Venclović]], [[Jovan Rajić]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and others. [[Dositej Obradović]] was the most prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while the most notable Classicist writer was [[Jovan Sterija Popović]], although his works also contained elements of Romanticism. Modern Serbian literature began with [[Vuk Karadžić]]'s collections of [[folk song]]s in the 19th century, and the writings of [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Njegoš]] and [[Branko Radičević]]. The first prominent representative of Serbian literature in the 20th century was [[Jovan Skerlić]], who wrote in pre–World War I [[Belgrade]] and helped introduce Serbian writers to literary modernism. The most important Serbian writer in the [[inter-war period]] was [[Miloš Crnjanski]].{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=565–567}}

===Names===
{{Main article|Serbian naming customs}} <!-- Popular names -->
There are several different layers of Serbian names. Serbian given names largely originate from [[Slavic names|Slavic roots]]:
e.g., [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]], [[Bojan]], [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]], [[Zoran]], [[Dragan]], [[Milan (given name)|Milan]], [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]], [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]], [[Slobodan]], [[Dušan]], [[Milica]], [[Nevena]], [[Vesna (name)|Vesna]], [[Radmila]]. Other names are of Christian origin, originating from the bible ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], through Greek), such as [[Lazar (name)|Lazar]], [[Mihailo]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Ilija (given name)|Ilija]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], [[Ivana]]. Along similar lines of non-Slavic Christian names are [[Greeks|Greek]] ones such as: [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Nikola]], [[Aleksandar]], [[Philip (name)|Filip]], [[Đorđe]], [[Andrej]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]], while those of [[Latin]] origin include: [[Marko (given name)|Marko]], [[Anthony (given name)|Antonije]], [[Srđan]], [[Marina (given name)|Marina]], [[Petar]], [[Paul (name)|Pavle]], [[Natalia (given name)|Natalija]], [[Igor (given name)|Igor]] (through Russian).

Most Serbian surnames are paternal, maternal, occupational or derived from personal traits. It is estimated that over two thirds of all Serbian surnames have the suffix ''[[-ić]]'' (-ић) ({{IPA-sh|itɕ|}}), a Slavic diminutive, originally functioning to create patronymics. Thus the surname [[Petrović]] means the "son of Petar" (from a male progenitor, the root is extended with possessive ''-ov'' or ''-ev''). Due to limited use of international typewriters and unicode computer encoding, the suffix may be simplified to ''-ic'', historically transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch'' in foreign languages. Other common surname suffixes found among Serbian surnames are ''-<u>ov</u>'', ''-<u>ev</u>'', ''-<u>in</u>'' and ''-<u>ski</u>'' (without ''-ić'') which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov.  Other, less common suffices are ''-alj/olj/elj'', ''-ija'', ''-ica'', ''-ar/ac/an''. The ten most common surnames in Serbia, in order, are [[Jovanović]], [[Petrović]], [[Nikolić]], [[Marković]], [[Đorđević]], [[Stojanović]], [[Ilić]], [[Stanković]], [[Pavlović]] and [[Milošević]].<ref name=Politika>{{cite web |author=Tanjug |url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |title=Srbija, zemlja Milice i Dragana : Društvo : POLITIKA |work=Politika |accessdate=17 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616001236/http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html |archivedate=16 June 2014  }}</ref>

Serbs are predominantly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]]. The [[autocephaly]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], was established in 1219, as an Archbishopric, and raised to the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|Patriarchate]] in 1346.{{sfn|Fotić|2008b|p=519–520}} It is led by the [[List of heads of the Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Patriarch]], and consists of three archbishoprics, six metropolitanates and thirty-one eparchies, having around 10&nbsp;million adherents. Followers of the church form the largest religious group in Serbia and Montenegro, and the second-largest in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. The church has an archbishopric in [[North Macedonia]] and dioceses in Western Europe, North America, South America<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pravoslavie.cl/sr/o-nama/|title=О НАМА {{!}} Православна Црква у Чилеу|website=www.pravoslavie.cl|access-date=8 February 2020}}</ref> and Australia.{{sfn|Cvetković|2012|p=130}}

The identity of ethnic Serbs was historically largely based on Orthodox Christianity and on the Serbian Church in particular. The conversion of the South Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]]. After the Schism, those who lived under the Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic.

With the arrival of the [[Ottoman Empire]], some Serbs converted to [[Islam]]. This was particularly, but not wholly, the case in [[Ottoman Bosnia|Bosnia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML-aXrrBrv8C&q=world+and+its+people+western+balkans&pg=PA1594|title=World and Its Peoples|date=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=9780761479031|language=en}}</ref> Since the second half of the 19th century, a small number of Serbs converted to Protestantism,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bjelajac|first=Branko|title=Protestantism in Serbia|url=https://www.academia.edu/1084811|journal=Religion, State and Society|language=en|volume=30|issue=3|pages=169–218|issn=0963-7494|doi=10.1080/0963749022000009225|year=2002|s2cid=144017406}}</ref> while historically some Serbs were Catholics (especially in [[Bay of Kotor]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/431408/Nisu-svi-Srbi-pravoslavne-vere|title=Nisu svi Srbi pravoslavne vere|website=Politika|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> and [[Dalmatia]]; e.g. [[Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik]]).<ref name="Hidden">{{cite book |author1=Christian Promitzer |author2=Klaus-Jürgen Hermanik |author3=Eduard Staudinger |name-list-style=amp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbwXKXeCGPIC&pg=PA183 |title=(Hidden) Minorities: Language and Ethnic Identity Between Central Europe and the Balkans |year=2009 |publisher=The Lit Verlag in 2009 |isbn=9783643500960 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102074805/https://books.google.com/books?id=nbwXKXeCGPIC&pg=PA183 |archivedate=2 January 2016  }}</ref> In a personal correspondence with author and critic dr.

===Symbols===
{{see also|National symbols of Serbia}}

Among the most notable national and ethnic symbols are the [[flag of Serbia]] and the [[coat of arms of Serbia]]. The flag consists of a red-blue-white [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]], rooted in [[Pan-Slavism]], and has been used since the 19th century. Apart from being the national flag, it is also used officially in [[Republika Srpska]] (by Bosnian Serbs) and as the official ethnic [[Flag of Serbs of Croatia]]. The coat of arms, which includes both the [[Serbian eagle]] and [[Serbian cross]], has also been officially used since the 19th century, its elements dating back to the Middle Ages, showing Byzantine and Christian heritage. These symbols are used by various Serb organisations, political parties and institutions. The [[Three-finger salute (Serbian)|Three-finger salute]], also called the "Serb salute", is a popular expression for ethnic Serbs and Serbia, originally expressing [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodoxy]] and today simply being a symbol for ethnic Serbs and the Serbian nation, made by extending the thumb, index, and middle fingers of one or both hands.

Serbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous, with heavy Oriental, Central European and Mediterranean influences.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Despite this, it has evolved and achieved its own culinary identity. Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and feast days, i.e., ''[[slava]]''.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Traditionally, three meals are consumed per day. Breakfast generally consists of eggs, meat and bread. Lunch is considered the main meal, and is normally eaten in the afternoon. Traditionally, [[Turkish coffee]] is prepared after a meal, and is served in small cups.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}} Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer [[bread and salt]] to guests, and also ''[[slatko]]'' (fruit preserve). Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include ''[[kajmak]]'' (a dairy product similar to [[clotted cream]]), ''[[proja]]'' (cornbread), ''[[kačamak]]'' (corn-flour porridge), and ''[[gibanica]]'' (cheese and kajmak pie). [[Ćevapčići]], caseless grilled and seasoned sausages made of minced meat, is the [[national dish]] of Serbia.{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=328–330}}
