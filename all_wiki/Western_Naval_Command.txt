==History==
After the [[independence of India|independence]] and the [[partition of India]] on 15 August 1947, the ships and personnel of the [[Royal Indian Navy]] were divided between the [[Dominion of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. The division of the ships was on the basis of two-thirds of the fleet to India, one third to Pakistan.<ref>Bhatia (1977), p. 28: "Consequent on the partition of the country on 15 August 1947, two thirds of the undivided fleet and associated assets came to India."</ref> Two new appointments were created, the  Rear Admiral Commanding Indian Naval Squadron (RACINS), the commander of the surface fleet of the Navy, and the Commodore-in-Charge Bombay, a [[One-star rank|one-star]] officer who headed the shore establishments on the western coast. To bring the service more in line with other navies, on 1 May 1952 the Rear Admiral Commanding Indian Naval Squadron was re-designated Flag Officer Commanding (Flotillas), Indian Fleet,<ref>{{cite web|title=Change of Titles in Indian Navy|url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1952-JULY-DEC-MIN-OF-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1952-04-27_107.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|date=27 April 1952|access-date=31 January 2020}}</ref> 

On 30 December 1957, the office of Flag Officer Commanding (Flotillas) was re-designated Flag Officer Commanding Indian Fleet (FOCIF), while the command of the shore establishments was upgraded to the [[Two-star rank|Two Star]] appointment of Flag Officer Bombay (FOB) in June 1958.<ref name="Gazette_1958"/> The FOCIF and FOB reported to the [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff]]. On 1 March 1968, the FOB was upgraded to the [[Three-star rank|Three Star]] of [[Vice Admiral]] and was re-designated Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command (FOC-in-C WNC). The Indian Fleet was renamed as [[Western Fleet (India)|Western Fleet]] with the [[Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet]] (FOCWF) reporting into the FOC-in-C WNC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hiranandani |first1=G M |title=Transition to triumph : history of the Indian Navy, 1965-1975 |year=2000 |publisher=Lancer Publishers |isbn=978-1897829721 |pages=615}}</ref><ref name="reorganisation">{{cite web|title=Reorganisation of Naval Commands|url=http://pibarchive.nic.in/archive/ArchiveSecondPhase/DEFENCE/1968-JAN-APR-DEFENCE/PDF/DEF-1968-03-02_089.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive|date=2 March 1968|access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>

==Area of responsibility==
The Western Naval Command (WNC) is the sword arm of the Indian Navy and naval operations conducted on the western seaboard would be central to the outcome of any conflict at sea against [[Pakistan]]. The [[Western Fleet (India)|Western Fleet]] is the two-star level operational formation of the Western Naval Command. It utilises [[Mumbai]] and [[Karwar]] as its home ports, with INS Kunjali, its HQ in [[Mumbai]].
The fleet at the WNC is based under Flag Officer Maharashtra Area (FOMA) and provides naval defence in the sensitive north [[Arabian Sea]] adjacent to Pakistan.
[[INS Kadamba|INS ''Kadamba'']], a large naval base, was constructed under Project Seabird and completed in 2005. This [[naval base]], at [[Karwar]] in [[Karnataka]], is used exclusively by the Indian Navy.<ref name=inwc />

== Capabilities ==
The Flagship carrier of the [[Western Fleet (India)|Western Fleet]] is INS ''Vikramaditya''. The WNC is equipped with submarine pens, a carrier dock and main maintenance dockyards. The Carrier Battle Group of the Western Fleet consists of [[INS Vikramaditya|INS ''Vikramaditya'']], [[Delhi class destroyer|''Delhi'' class destroyer]]s, [[Talwar class frigate|''Talwar'' class frigate]]s, [[Brahmaputra class frigate|''Brahmaputra'' class frigate]]s, [[INS Kolkata]] Indian navy's brand new destroyer<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.firstpost.com/india/delay-mars-main-air-defence-weapon-deployment-ins-kolkata-1662943.html|title = Delay mars main air defence weapon deployment on INS Kolkata|date = 13 August 2014}}</ref> and [[Sindhughosh class submarine|''Sindhughosh'' class submarine]]s.
