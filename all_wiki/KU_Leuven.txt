==History==
=== Previous universities in Leuven ===
The city of Leuven was the seat of three different universities.

The old University of Leuven (or [[Studium Generale Lovaniense]]), founded in 1425 by the civil authorities of Brabant duke John IV of Brabant, as well as the municipal administration of the city of Leuven,<ref>Nicolaus Vernulaeus, ''Academia Lovaniensis'', Louvain, chez Petrus Sassenus, édition de 1667, p. 1 : ''Primus Academiae Conditor fuit Ioannes Quartus, Lotharingiae, Brabantiae, et Limburgiae Dux, Marchio Sacri Imperii, Hannoniae, Hollandiae, Zelandiae Comes, et Dominus Frisiae, Religionis et optimarum Artium Princeps amantissimus. Movit illum miseratio imprimis primariae in Brabantia Urbis Lovanii, quae intestinis afflicta seditionibus, dilapsisque in Angliam et aliò mercimoniis, ac diminuto Civium artificumque numero vacua pene facta erat, ut iterum instauraretur frequentareturque''. En : Emiel Lamberts and Jan Roegiers, ''Leuven University'', Louvain, 1990, p. 21 : « The foundation of Louvain was the work of both ducal and municipal authorities. John IV, the Duke of Brabant, encouraged by two of his councillors, Engelbert van Nassau and Edmund van Dynter, strongly favoured the etablishment of a higher centre of Learning in his dukedom ».  Édouard Van Even, ''Louvain dans le passé et le présent'', pp. 551-552: « C'est à Jean IV que les historiens ont attribué la gloire de cette fondation. ....Or, dans les comptes, nous avons constaté que l'université fut érigée par l'édilité louvaniste et que Jean IV n'a pas fait beaucoup plus que de permettre à son secrétaire d'adresser une supplique à la cour de Rome et de placeter les bulles d'érection ».</ref> despite the initial opposition of the chapter of Sint-Pieter,<ref>Édouard Van Even, ''Louvain dans le passé et le présent'', p. 552: « On avait également besoin du concours de l'écolâtre du chapitre de Saint-Pierre, maître Guillaume Neve, alors le chef de l'instruction à Louvain. Dans le principe, ce fonctionnaire se montra hostile au projet. C'était, sans doute, affaire d'intérêt personnel. Quoi qu'il en soit, la ville se vit obligée de recourir à l'intervention d'un prêtre, appelé Rutger Reppen, pour conquérir l'écolátre à sa cause. Cet ecclésiastique dut rencontrer chez le fonctionnaire du chapitre une résistance sérieuse ».</ref> was formally integrated into the French Republic when the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, ceded the South Netherlands to France by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]]<ref>Jules Delhaize, ''La domination française en Belgique'', Brussels, 1909, tome III, p. 171 : « Les articles 3 et 4 du traité de Campo-Formio consacrèrent enfin, au point de vue international, la réunion de la Belgique à la France. Voici ces articles. Art. 3 - Sa Majesté l'Empereur, Roi de Hongrie et de Bohême, renonce pour elle et ses successeurs en faveur de la République française, à tous ses droits et titres sur les ci-devant provinces belgiques, connues sous le nom de Pays-Bas autrichiens. La République française possédera ces pays à perpétuité, en toute souveraineté et propriété, et avec tous les biens territoriaux qui en dépendent»</ref> signed on 17 October 1797. A law dating to 1793, which mandated that all universities in France be closed, came into effect.<ref>The law of 15 September 1793 had decreed the suppression of all the colleges and universities in France, but the universities remain de facto until the new law of 7 ventôse year III (25 February 1795) creating the [[Écoles centrales]]. In accordance with this law the University of Louvain was abolished by Decree of the Departement of the Dijle. Louis Trénard, ''De Douai à Lille, une université et son histoire'', Presses Universitaires du Septentrion, 1978, p.37 note 6.</ref> The old University of Leuven was abolished by decree of the [[Dyle (department)|Département of the Dyle]] on October 25, 1797.<ref>Jan Roegiers et al., ''Leuven University'', Leuven, Leuven University Press, 1990, p. 31: "''With the Law of 3 Brumaire of Year IV, which reorganized higher education in the French Republic, there was no place for the University of Louvain, and it was abolished by Decree of the Departement of the Dijle on 25 october'' (1797)".</ref>

A few years after [[First French Empire|French rule]] came to an end, when Belgium was part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], king [[William I of the Netherlands]] founded in 1817 a secular university in Leuven, the [[State university of Leuven]], where many professors of the old University of Leuven have taught. This university was also abolished in 1835.

=== The Catholic University ===
[[File:Castle Arenberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven adj.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kasteel van Arenberg]], purchased by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven's predecessor in 1921.]]
{{For|the history of the pre-1970 university|Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)#History}}
The [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] was founded in 1834 in [[Mechelen]]<ref>''Souvenir du XXVe anniversaire de la '''fondation''' de l'Université catholique : Novembre 1859'', Louvain, typographie Vanlinthout et Cie, 1860 : "Inaugurée à Malines, le 4 novembre 1834, l'Université catholique a célébré à Louvain, le jeudi 3 novembre 1859, sa vingt-cinquième année d'existence"[https://books.google.be/books?id=brlLAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fr#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Souvenir du XXVe anniversaire de la fondation de l'Université catholique: Novembre 1859''].</ref> by the bishops of Belgium, after an official [[Papal Brief]] of [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. This new Catholic university stayed only briefly in Mechelen, as the bishops already moved the university headquarters to [[Leuven]] on 1 December 1835, where it took the name Catholic University of Leuven, intended to continue the heritage and tradition of the [[Studium Generale Lovaniense]] founded by [[Pope Martin V]] in the [[Papal Bull]] Sapientiae Immarcessibilis of 9 December 1425. This occurred after the closure of the [[State university of Leuven]] in 1835, where many professors of the old University of Leuven have taught. KU Leuven is generally (but controversially) identified as a continuation of the older institution; controversy lays in the fact that the continuation is mainly of a sociocultural and ecclesiastical nature, but cannot be maintained from a purely juridical perspective<ref name="auto">Ruling of the Cour de Cassation of Belgium of 26 November 1846: "''The Catholic University of Leuven can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Leuven''", in, ''Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850'', Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: ''Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés'', 1861, p. 166.</ref> as the old University was suppressed under French rule.{{ref|caveat|C}} In its statutes, KU Leuven officially declares to be the continuation of the [[Old University of Leuven|Studium Generale Lovaniense]] established in 1425,<ref>https://admin.kuleuven.be/reglementen/en/organisation-structure/kuleuven-statutes</ref> and it sets out to celebrate its 600th anniversary in 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kuleuven.be/english/about-kuleuven/history|title=History|website=www.kuleuven.be|access-date=Oct 4, 2020}}</ref>

In 1968, tensions between the Flemish-speaking and French-speaking communities led to the [[Split of the Catholic University of Leuven|splitting]] of the bilingual Catholic University of Leuven into two "sister" universities, with the Flemish-language university becoming a fully functioning independent institution in Leuven in 1970, and the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] departing to a newly built greenfield campus site in the French-speaking part of Belgium. KU Leuven's first rector after the split was [[Pieter De Somer]].

In 1972, the KUL set up a separate entity Leuven Research & Development (LRD) to support industrial and commercial applications of university research. It has led to [http://lrd.kuleuven.be/en/spinoff/spin-off-companies numerous spin-offs], such as the technology company Metris, and manages tens of millions of euros in investments and venture capital.

The university's electronic learning environment, TOLEDO, which started in September 2001, was gradually developed into the central electronic learning environment at the KUL. The word is an acronym for ''TOetsen en LEren Doeltreffend Ondersteunen'' (English: "effectively supporting testing and learning"). It is the collective name for a number of commercial software programs and tools, such as [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]]. The project offers the Question Mark Perception assignment software to all institution members and has implemented the [[Ariadne (software)|Ariadne KPS]] to reuse digital learning objects inside the Blackboard environment.

On 11 July 2002, the KU Leuven became the dominant institution in the "KU Leuven Association" (see below).

KU Leuven is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]] (a network of leading European universities) as well as of the [[LERU|LERU Group]] (League of European Research Universities). Since November 2014, KU Leuven's Faculty of Economics and Business is accredited by [[European Quality Improvement System]], which is a leading accreditation system specializing in higher education institutions of management and business administration.<ref name="equis">{{Cite web|url=http://feb.kuleuven.be/home/equis|title=EFMD EQUIS Accreditation for KU Leuven's Faculty of Economics and Business|access-date=Oct 4, 2020}}</ref> As of academic year of 2012–2013, the university held Erasmus contracts with 434 European establishments. It also had 22 central bilateral agreements in 8 countries: the United States, China, South Africa, Japan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Vietnam, Poland, and the Netherlands. The vast majority of international EU students came from the Netherlands, while most non-EU ones come from China.

KU Leuven is financially independent from the Catholic Church. Although a representative from the Church sits in its Board of Governors, their function is observational and has no voting power. Its management and academic decisions are similarly autonomous.<ref name=":2" />

In December 2011, the university changed its official name to KU Leuven in all official communications and branding.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/ku-leuven-drops-%E2%80%9Ccatholic%E2%80%9D-its-name|title=KU Leuven drops "Catholic" from its name {{!}} Flanders Today|website=www.flanderstoday.eu|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2011/12/26/leuven_universitychangesitsname-1-1184056/|title=Leuven University changes its name|last=News|first=Flanders|date=2011-12-26|website=vrtnws.be|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref> While its legal name remains to be Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the university uses KU Leuven in all communications, including academic research publications.<ref name=":0" /> The long name is only used in contracts and only on the first instance, according to university's communication guidelines. According to its then rector, the change is intended as a way to emphasize its history of freedom of academic inquiry and its independence from the Church, without erasure of its Catholic heritage.<ref name=":1" />

Since August 2017, the university has been led by [[Luc Sels]] who replaced former [[rector (academia)|rector]] [[Rik Torfs]]. The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[archbishop]], [[André-Joseph Léonard]] is the current ''Grand Chancellor'' and a member of the university [[school board|board]].

KU Leuven hosts the world's largest [[banana]] [[Gene bank|genebank]], the [[Bioversity International]] ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre, that celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017 and was visited by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Development Cooperation, [[Alexander De Croo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.decroo.belgium.be/en/belgian-support-innovative-agricultural-research|title=Belgian support for innovative agricultural research}}</ref>

Historically, the Catholic University of Leuven has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology. The university is dedicated to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], under her traditional attribute as "[[Seat of Wisdom]]", and organizes an annual celebration on [[Candlemas|2 February]] in her honour. On that day, the university also awards its [[honorary doctorate]]s. The seal used by the university shows the medieval statue [[Sedes Sapientiae, Leuven|Our Lady of Leuven]] in a [[vesica piscis]] shape.

== Campus ==
[[File:AGORA_Leuven.jpg|thumb|Students study in learning center AGORA at KU Leuven.]]
KU Leuven's main campus is in [[Leuven]] where school faculties, libraries, institutes, residence halls, the university hospital [[UZ Leuven]], and other facilities are interspersed throughout the city proper, as well as just outside its ring road in Heverlee borough.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Student Services Leuven|url=https://www.kuleuven.be/english/studentservices/studentservicesleuven/index.html|website=www.kuleuven.be|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> Its intercultural meeting center Pangaea is located in the city center.

Public transport within the city is primarily served by the De Lijn bus system. Leuven is a main hub in Belgium's and nearby country's train network. Leuven station is located in the northeast edge of the city.

KU Leuven has campuses in [[Kortrijk]], [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], [[Ostend]], [[Geel]], [[Diepenbeek]], [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]], [[Sint-Katelijne-Waver]], [[Brussels]].

==Organization and academics==
Academics at KU Leuven is organized into three groups, each with its own faculties, departments, and schools offering programs up to doctoral level. While most courses are taught in Flemish, many are offered in English, particularly the graduate programs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Faculties, departments and schools|url=https://www.kuleuven.be/english/faculties_schools|website=www.kuleuven.be|language=en|access-date=2020-05-09}}</ref> Notable divisions of the university include the [[Higher Institute of Philosophy]] and the [[Rega Institute for Medical Research]].

The students of the university are gathered together in the student's council Studentenraad KU Leuven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Studentenraad KU Leuven|url=http://www.sturakuleuven.be/|access-date=14 July 2018}}</ref> They have representatives in most meetings at the university, including the Board of Directors. It was separated from {{Interlanguage link multi|LOKO|nl|3=Leuvense Overkoepelende KringOrganisatie}} in 2012-2013 when the different locations outside of Leuven became part of the university. LOKO remained the overarching student organisation for all students in the city of Leuven.

</ref> In the solar hydrogen panel the hydrogen and [[oxygen]] evolution [[Chemical reaction|reactions]] are performed in the [[Phase (matter)|gas phase]] in [[cathode]] and [[anode]] compartments separated by a [[membrane]]. [[Ion exchange|Anion exchange]] membranes provide an [[alkaline]] environment enabling the use of [[Abundance of the chemical elements|earth abundant materials]] as [[electrocatalyst]]s.<ref name="SustainableEnergyAndFuels2017" />

According to [[IEEE Spectrum]] in 2019 this is a giant leap from 0.1% efficiency 10 years earlier.<ref name="IEEESpectrumHydrogenPanel2019" />

This technology bypasses the conversion losses of the classical [[solar–hydrogen energy cycle]] where [[solar power]] is first harvested via a [[solar panel]] and only then to converted to hydrogen with [[electrolysis]] plants.
