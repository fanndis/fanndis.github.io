'''Elizabeth Ann Warren''' ([[née]] '''Herring'''; born June 22, 1949) is an American politician and former law professor (specializing in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy law]]) who is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senate|United States senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], serving since 2013.

She was a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].

Warren is a graduate of the [[University of Houston]] and [[Rutgers Law School]] and has taught law at several universities, including the [[University of Houston Law Center|University of Houston]], the [[University of Texas School of Law|University of Texas at Austin]], the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Harvard Law School|Harvard University]]. She was one of the most influential professors of bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written eleven books and more than 100 articles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elizabeth Warren |url=https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10935/Warren/publications |website=Harvard Law School |publisher=The President and Fellows of Harvard College |access-date=13 February 2020 |archive-date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221051744/https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10935/Warren/publications |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name = eleven/>

Her first foray into [[public policy]] began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals]]. During the late 2000s, Warren's national profile grew following her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent [[banking regulations]] after the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. She served as chair of the [[Oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program|Congressional Oversight Panel]] of the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]], and she proposed and established the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], for which she served as the first special advisor under President [[Barack Obama]].

In 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts. She won reelection by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee [[Geoff Diehl]]. On February 9, 2019, Warren announced [[Elizabeth Warren 2020 presidential campaign|her candidacy]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election]].<ref name=CNNkickoff>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-campaign-kickoff-massachusetts/index.html |title=Elizabeth Warren kicks off presidential campaign with challenge to super-wealthy – and other Democrats |first1=MJ |last1=Lee |first2=Gregory |last2=Krieg |date=February 9, 2019 |website=[[CNN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101171408/https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/elizabeth-warren-campaign-kickoff-massachusetts/index.html |archive-date=January 1, 2020 |access-date=February 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled.

In 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school (see above), Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/elizabeth-warren|title=Elizabeth Warren biography|website=[[The Biography Channel]]|access-date=September 19, 2012|archive-date=April 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419192957/https://www.biography.com/political-figure/elizabeth-warren|url-status=live}}</ref>
During law school, Warren worked as a summer associate at [[Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft]]. After she received her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] and passed the [[bar examination]], she decided to offer legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.<ref name="bberg"/><ref name="conversations" />

In the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to [[bankruptcy]] and middle-class [[personal finance]].<ref name="conversations" /> She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.

===Academic===
Warren began her career in academia as a lecturer at [[Rutgers University–Newark|Rutgers University, Newark]] [[Rutgers School of Law – Newark|School of Law]] (1977–78). She then moved to the [[University of Houston Law Center]] (1978–83), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained [[tenure]] in 1981. She taught at the [[University of Texas School of Law]] as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] from 1983 to 1987<ref name=WarrenCV2008>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/ewarren/Warren%20CV%20062508.pdf |title=''Curriculum Vitae'' |last=Warren |first=Elizabeth |publisher=Harvard Law School |year=2008 |access-date=September 21, 2019 |archive-date=April 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418053208/http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/ewarren/Warren%20CV%20062508.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> and was also a visiting professor at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1985.

[[File:Elizabeth Warren in 1987 Peregrinus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Warren in [[University of Texas School of Law]]'s 1987 yearbook.]]

Warren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the [[law and economics]] movement, which aimed to apply [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]] to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the ''[[Notre Dame Law Review]]'', argued that [[public utility|public utilities]] were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted.<ref name=politico /> But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.<ref name=Neyfakh>{{cite news |last1=Neyfakh |first1=Leon |title=Elizabeth Warren's unorthodox career |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2011/10/22/elizabeth-warren-unorthodox-career/3AFEDVW9B40rgbF1bhBXoM/story.html |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=February 22, 2015 |date=October 22, 2011 |archive-date=February 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222030246/http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2011/10/22/elizabeth-warren-unorthodox-career/3AFEDVW9B40rgbF1bhBXoM/story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/opinion/elizabeth-warren-policy.html |title=Elizabeth Warren and Her Party of Ideas: She's what a serious policy intellectual looks like in 2019 |first=Paul |last=Krugman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 7, 2019 |access-date=January 7, 2019 |archive-date=January 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108003615/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/opinion/elizabeth-warren-policy.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues [[Teresa A. Sullivan]] and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book ''As We Forgive Our Debtors'' in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as "worse than disillusionment" and "like being shocked at a deep-down level".<ref name=politico /> In 2004, she published an article in the ''[[Washington University Law Review]]'' in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|date=January 1, 2004|title=The Over-Consumption Myth and Other Tales of Economics, Law, and Morality|url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol82/iss4/8|journal=Washington University Law Review|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1485–1511|issn=2166-7993|access-date=August 23, 2019|archive-date=July 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190710154011/https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_lawreview/vol82/iss4/8/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Warren joined the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an [[endowed chair]] in 1990, becoming the [[William A. Schnader]] Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at [[Harvard Law School]] as [[Robert Braucher]] Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become [[Leo Gottlieb (lawyer)|Leo Gottlieb]] Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996 she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions.<ref name="Crimson">{{cite news |last1=Hickey |first1=Adam |title=Harvard's Top Five Salaries Total More Than $1.5M |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/9/19/harvards-top-five-salaries-total-more/ |access-date=October 9, 2019 |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=September 19, 1997 |archive-date=October 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007003751/https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/9/19/harvards-top-five-salaries-total-more/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=WarrenCV2008/> {{as of|2011}}, she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university.<ref name=Neyfakh/> Warren was a highly influential law professor.

The bureau was established by the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law by President Obama in July 2010.

Warren received a prime-time speaking slot at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that "has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered". According to Warren, "People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged." Warren said Wall Street CEOs "wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs" and that they "still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them".<ref>{{cite news |first1=Gregory J. |last1=Krieg |first2=Elizabeth |last2=Hartfield |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-democratic-national-convention-system-rigged/story?id=17150134 |date=September 5, 2012 |title=Elizabeth Warren: 'The System Is Rigged' |website=ABC News |access-date=October 12, 2014 |archive-date=November 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109005308/http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-democratic-national-convention-system-rigged/story?id=17150134 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323230824/http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2012-09-05/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-ceos-still-strut-around-congress/ |date=September 5, 2012 |archive-date=March 23, 2013 |url=http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2012-09-05/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-ceos-still-strut-around-congress/|title=Elizabeth Warren: 'Wall Street CEOs' Still 'Strut Around Congress'|work=Political Capital |publisher=Bloomberg |first=Mark |last=Silva |access-date=October 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kirchgaessner|first=Stephanie|title=Warren attacks CEOs who 'wrecked economy'|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5718c926-f7d4-11e1-ba54-00144feabdc0.html|work=Financial Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908033052/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5718c926-f7d4-11e1-ba54-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date=September 8, 2012|date=September 6, 2012 |access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>

At Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'."

Warren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including [[working class in the United States|working class]] families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government:

{{quote |text=It won't be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration. We can't afford to just tinker around the edges—a tax credit here, a regulation there.

Following her candidacy announcement, Warren released several policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, and plans to address opioid addiction.

Warren is widely regarded as a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]. In 2012, the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' named Warren among the "top 20 U.S. progressives".<ref name=newstatesman/>

==Books and other works==
In 2004, Warren and her daughter, [[Amelia Tyagi]], wrote ''[[The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke]]''. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as [[mortgage]]s, [[health care]], [[transportation]], and [[child care]] had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|title=All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan|year=2005|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-6987-2|author2=Amelia Warren Tyagi|pages=[https://archive.org/details/allyourworthulti00warr/page/1 1–12]|url=https://archive.org/details/allyourworthulti00warr/page/1}}</ref>

In an article in ''The New York Times'', [[Jeff Madrick]] said of the book:
{{quote| The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children&nbsp;... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.<ref>{{cite news |last=Madrick |first=Jeff |title=Necessities, not luxuries, are driving Americans into debt, a new book says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/business/economic-scene-necessities-not-luxuries-are-driving-americans-into-debt-new-book.html |date=September 4, 2003 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 3, 2009 |archive-date=December 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212182413/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/04/business/economic-scene-necessities-not-luxuries-are-driving-americans-into-debt-new-book.html |url-status=live }}</ref> }}
