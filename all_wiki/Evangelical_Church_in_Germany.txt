The '''Evangelical Church in Germany''' ({{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland}}, abbreviated '''EKD''') is a [[federation]] of twenty [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed]] ([[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) and [[united and uniting churches|United]] (e.g. [[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]]) [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Landeskirche|regional]] churches and [[Christian denomination|denominations]] in [[Germany]], which collectively encompasses the vast majority of Protestants in that country. In 2019, the EKD had a membership of 20,713,000 members, or 24.9% of the German population.<ref name=EKD19/> It constitutes [[List of the largest Protestant churches|one of the largest national Protestant bodies]] in the world. Church offices managing the federation are located in [[Herrenhausen|Hannover-Herrenhausen]], [[Lower Saxony]]. Many of its members consider themselves Lutherans.

Historically, the first formal attempt to unify German Protestantism occurred during the [[Weimar Republic]] era in the form of the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]], which existed from 1922 until 1933. Earlier, there had been successful royal efforts at unity in various German states, beginning with [[Prussia]] and several minor German states (e.g. [[Duchy of Nassau]]) in 1817. These unions resulted in the first united and uniting churches, a new development within Protestantism which later spread to other parts of the world.

When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, his administration tried to reorganize the old confederation into a unified [[German Evangelical Church]] as Hitler wanted to use a single Protestant church to further his own ambitions. This utterly failed, with the [[Confessing Church]] and the [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]]-led [[German Evangelical Church|Reichskirche]] opposing each other. Other Protestant churches aligned themselves with one of these groups, or stayed neutral in this church strife.

The postwar church council issued the [[Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt]] on October 19, 1945, confessing guilt and declaring remorse for indifference and inaction of German Protestants in the face of atrocities committed by Hitler's regime as means to address the [[German collective guilt]]. In 1948, the Evangelical Church in Germany was organized in the aftermath of [[World War II]] to function as a new umbrella organization for German Protestant churches. As a result of tensions between [[West Germany|West]] and [[East Germany]], the regional churches in East Germany broke away from the EKD in 1969. In 1991, following [[German reunification]], the East German churches rejoined the EKD.

The member churches (''Gliedkirchen''), while being independent and having their own theological and formal organisation, share full [[pulpit and altar fellowship]], are united in the EKD [[synod]], and are individual members of the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC) and the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]] (CPCE). Boundaries of EKD churches within Germany partially resemble those of the states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[History of Germany|successor forms]] of German statehood (to the most part [[Congress of Vienna|1815 borders]]), due to the historically close relationship between individual German states and churches.

As for church governance, the Lutheran churches typically practise an [[episcopal polity]], while the Reformed and the United ones a mixture of [[Presbyterian polity|presbyterian]] and [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalist]] polities. Most member churches are led by a (state) [[bishop]]. Only one member church, the [[Evangelical Reformed Church in Germany]], is not restricted to a certain territory. In some ways, the other member churches resemble [[diocese]]s of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches, from an organisational point of view.

==Name==
The German term {{lang|de|evangelisch}} here more accurately corresponds to the broad English term ''Protestant''<ref>Peter Terrell, ''Harper Collins German Unabridged Dictionary'', 4th ed., (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1999), 273 ''sub loco''.</ref> rather than to the narrower ''[[evangelical]]'' (in German called {{lang|de|evangelikal}}), although the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of England]] use the term in the same way as the German church. Literally, {{lang|de|evangelisch}} means "of the Gospel", denoting a [[Protestant Reformation]] emphasis on {{lang|la|[[sola scriptura]]}}, "by scripture alone". [[Martin Luther]] encouraged the use of this term alongside ''Christian''.

==History==
[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of the [[Peace of Augsburg]], which laid the legal groundwork for two co-existing religious confessions ([[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]]) in the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire.]]
From the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 to the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the collapse of the [[German Empire]], some Protestant churches were [[state church]]es. Each {{lang|de|[[Landeskirche]]}}<ref name="ekd.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.ekd.de/english/4247.html|title=Short History|author=EKD-Internearbeit|date=5 May 2015|access-date=8 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709215759/http://www.ekd.de/english/4247.html|archive-date=9 July 2015}}</ref> (state or regional church) was the official church of one of the [[States of the German Empire (1871)|states of Germany]], while the respective ruler was the church's formal head (e.g. the [[List of rulers of Prussia|King of Prussia]] headed the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia's older Provinces]] as supreme governor), similar to the [[British monarch]]'s role as the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

This changed somewhat with growing religious freedom in the 19th century, especially in the [[republicanism|republican]] states of [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] (1857), [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]], and [[Hamburg]] (1860). The greatest change came after the [[German Revolution]], with the formation of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the abdication of the [[Prince#Prince as generic for ruler|princes]] of the German states. The system of state churches disappeared with the [[Weimar Constitution]] (1919), which brought about [[disestablishment]] by the [[separation of church and state]], and there was a desire for the Protestant churches to merge. In fact, a merger was permanently under discussion but never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation into [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]], and [[United and uniting churches]].

During the Revolution, when the old church governments lost power, the People's Church Union ({{lang|de|Volkskirchenbund}}) was formed and advocated unification without respect to theological tradition and also increasing input from [[laymen]]. However, the People's Church Union quickly split along territorial lines after the churches' relationship with the new governments improved.<ref name=statusofprotchurches>D. Karl Bornhausen, "The Present Status of the Protestant Churches in Germany," ''The Journal of Religion'', Vol. 3, No. 5 (Sep. 1923), 501-524.</ref>

It was realised that one mainstream Protestant church for all of Germany was impossible and that any union would need a federal model. The churches met in [[Dresden]] in 1919 and created a plan for federation, and this plan was adopted in 1921 at [[Stuttgart]]. Then in 1922 the then 28 territorially defined Protestant churches founded the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund}}, DEK). At the time, the federation was the largest Protestant church federation in Europe with around 40&nbsp;million members.<ref name="statusofprotchurches"/> Because it was a federation of independent bodies, the Church Union's work was limited to foreign missions and relations with Protestant churches outside Germany, especially German Protestants in other countries.

In July 1933, the German Evangelical Church ({{lang|de|Deutsche Evangelische Kirche}}, DEK) was formed under the influence of the [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]], a pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] religious movement. They had much influence over the decisions of the first National [[Synod]], via their unambiguous partisanship in successfully backing [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)|Ludwig Müller]] for the office of Reich bishop. He did not manage, however, to prevail over the {{lang|de|Landeskirchen}} in the long term. The [[Confessing Church]] arose in resistance to the Nazi regime's ideology. After the installation of [[Hanns Kerrl]] as minister for church matters in a Führer-directive of 16 July 1935 and the foundation of the – in the end not materialising – [[Protestant Reich Church]], the DEK played more or less no further role.

[[File:Deutsche Christen Bekennende Kirche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Synod#Lutheran usage|Synodal]] elections 1933: [[German Christians (movement)|German Christians]] and [[Confessing Church]] campaigners in [[Berlin]].]]
In 1948, freed from the German Christians' influence, the Lutheran, Reformed and United churches came together as the Evangelical Church in Germany at the Conference of Eisenach. In 1969, the regional Protestant churches in [[East Germany]] and [[East Berlin]]<ref>The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church of Silesia(n Upper Lusatia)|Evangelical Church of the Görlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, Görlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).</ref> broke away from the EKD and formed the [[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Herrnhut District. In June 1991, following [[German reunification]], the BEK merged with the EKD.

While the members are no longer state churches, they enjoy constitutional protection as [[statutory corporation]]s, and they are still called {{lang|de|Landeskirchen}}, and some have this term in their official names. A modern English translation, however, would be ''regional church''. Apart from some minor changes, the territories of the member churches today reflect Germany's political organisation in the year 1848, with regional churches for states or provinces that often no longer exist or whose borders changed since. For example, between 1945 and 1948, the remaining six ecclesiastical provinces ({{lang|de|Kirchenprovinzen}}), each territorially comprising one of the [[Provinces of Prussia|Old Prussia provinces]], within the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union]] assumed independence as a consequence of the estrangement among them during the Nazi [[Kirchenkampf|struggle of the churches]]. This turned the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union into a mere umbrella, being itself a member of EKD (and the BEK, 1969–1991) but covering some regional church bodies, which were again themselves members of EKD (and the BEK, 1969–1991).

Since 1973, when many Protestant churches in Europe, including the EKD members, concluded the [[Leuenberg Agreement]], also the then 21 EKD members<ref>The Western churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Baden]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, West Ambit, for West Berlin), [[Evangelical Church of Bremen|Bremian Evangelical Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eutin]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Hamburg State]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Hanover]], [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]], [[Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck]], [[Church of Lippe]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lübeck]], [[Evangelical Reformed Church in Northwestern Germany]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg]], [[Evangelical Church of the Palatinate]], [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Schaumburg-Lippe]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (West Region, for EKiBB-West Ambit, Rhineland, and Westphalia), [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Evangelical Church in Württemberg]].</ref> introduced [[full communion]] for their parishioners and ministry among each other.

Since also the regional Protestant churches in East Germany had signed the Leuenberg Agreement, thus the then ten members of the Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic practised full communion with the EKD members too. [[Ordination of women]] is practised in all 20 member churches with many women having been ordained in recent years. There are also several women serving as bishops. [[Margot Käßmann]], former bishop of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover]] and Chairperson of the Council of the EKD from 2009 until February 2010, was the first woman to head the EKD.<ref>Deutsche Welle, 2009-10-28.

The EKD has undergone a split in the 20th century and lost a bulk of its adherents in [[East Germany]] due to [[state atheist]] policies of the former East German government. After 1990, membership was counted and amounted to around the same number as the Roman Catholic Church. In the 21st century, membership in both the Evangelical Church and the Roman Catholic Church stagnates as more people are becoming religious nones.

Protestantism is the major religion in [[Northern Germany|Northern]], Eastern and [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Middle Germany]], with the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] branch predominating in the extreme northwest and [[Lippe]], the [[Lutheran]] branch in the north and south, and the [[United and uniting churches|United]] branch in Middle and [[Western Germany]]. While the majority of Christians in [[Southern Germany]] are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], some areas in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]] are predominantly Protestant, e.g. [[Middle Franconia]] and the [[Stuttgart (region)|government region of Stuttgart]]. The vast majority of German Protestants belong to a member church of the EKD. With 25,100,727 members in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekd.de/english/4329-christians_in_germany.html|title=Christians in Germany 2006|author=EKD-Internearbeit|date=6 January 2011|access-date=8 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230416/http://www.ekd.de/english/4329-christians_in_germany.html|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> around 30 percent of all Germans belong to a member church of the EKD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html|title=EKD: Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland - Christen in Deutschland|author=EKD Internetredaktion|access-date=8 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430195847/http://www.ekd.de/statistik/mitglieder.html|archive-date=30 April 2011}}</ref> Average church attendance is lower, however, with only around a million people attending a service on Sunday.<ref name=services>[http://www.ekd.de/english/4329-service_workship_holy_communion.html EKD: Services of Worship and Holy Communion 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617055546/http://www.ekd.de/english/4329-service_workship_holy_communion.html |date=2011-06-17 }}.

The regional Protestant church bodies accept each other as equals, despite denominational differences. No member church runs congregations or churches in the area of another member church, thus preventing competing with each other for parishioners. The only exception is the Evangelical Reformed Church, which combines Reformed congregations within the ambits of usually Lutheran member churches, which themselves do not include the eventual local Reformed congregations. Thus, for example, a Lutheran moving from a place where their parish belongs to a Lutheran member church, would be accepted in their new place of domicile by the locally competent congregation within another member church, even if this church and its local parish are Reformed or of united Protestant confession, with Lutheran being exchangeable with the two other respective Protestant confessions within the EKD. This is due to full [[pulpit and altar fellowship]] between all EKD member churches.

In this the ambits of the member churches resemble [[diocese]]s of the [[Anglican]] or [[Roman Catholic]] churches, however, else there is no common hierarchy supervising the member churches, who are legally independent equals with the EKD being their umbrella. Members of congregations within the member churches – like those of parishes within Catholic dioceses and those enrolled in Jewish congregations also enjoying statutory corporation status – are required to pay a [[church tax]], a surcharge on their normal income tax collected by the states of Germany and passed on to the respective religious body.

==Structure==
The structure of the EKD is based on [[Federation|federal]] principles. Each regional church is responsible for Christian life in its own area while each regional church has its own special characteristics and retains its independence. The EKD carries out joint tasks with which its members have entrusted it. For the execution of these tasks, the Church has the following governing bodies, all organised and elected on democratic lines:

===Synod===
The [[Synod]] is the legislature of the EKD. It has 126 members: 106 elected by ''Landeskirchen'' synods and 20 appointed by the council.<ref>§ 24 of the Basic Order (Grundordnung) of the Evangelical Church (http://www.kirchenrecht-ekd.de/showdocument/id/3435#s1.100042)</ref> These 20 are appointed for their importance in the life of the Church and its agencies. Members serve six year terms and the synod meets annually.

===Praesides of the Synod===
