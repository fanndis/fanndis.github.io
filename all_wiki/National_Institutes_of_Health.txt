The '''National Institutes of Health''' ('''NIH''') ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|n|.|aɪ|.|ˈ|eɪ|tʃ}}) is the primary agency of the [[United States government]] responsible for [[biomedical]] and [[public health]] research. It was founded in the late 1880s and is now part of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]. The majority of NIH facilities are located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its [[NIH Intramural Research Program|Intramural Research Program]] (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.

{{As of| 2013}}, the Intramural Research Program (IRP) had 1,200 [[principal investigator]]s and more than 4,000 [[postdoctoral]] fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |title=Organization and Leadership &#124; NIH Intramural Research Program |publisher=Irp.nih.gov |date= April 4, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424005609/http://irp.nih.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership |archive-date=April 24, 2013  }}</ref> while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.<ref name="Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade">{{cite web |first=Neil |last=Osterweil |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |title=Medical Research Spending Doubled Over Past Decade |website=MedPage Today |date=September 20, 2005 |accessdate=September 15, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016073042/http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/HealthPolicy/1767 |archive-date=October 16, 2015  }}</ref>

The NIH comprises [[List of institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health|27 separate institutes and centers]] of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent [[tooth decay]], the use of [[lithium (medication)|lithium]] to manage [[bipolar disorder]], and the creation of [[vaccines]] against [[hepatitis]], ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' (HIB), and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).<ref>NIH Sourcebook {{cite web |url=http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105120850/http://sourcebook.od.nih.gov/oir/IRP_transition.pdf |archive-date=January 5, 2012  }}</ref>

In 2019, the NIH was ranked number two in the world, behind [[Harvard University]], for biomedical sciences in the Nature Index, which measured the largest contributors to papers published in a subset of leading journals from 2015 to 2018.<ref name="Nature Index Biomedical Sciences 2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/top-ten-research-institutions-universities-biomedical-sciences-twenty-eighteen |title=The top 10 institutions in biomedical sciences in 2018|accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name= "Nature Index FAQs">{{cite web|url=https://www.natureindex.com/faq#introduction1 |title=Introduction to the Nature Index |website = natureindex.com}}</ref>

NIH's roots extend back to the [[Marine Hospital Service]] in the late 1790s that provided medical relief to sick and disabled men in the U.S. Navy. By 1870, a network of marine hospitals had developed and was placed under the charge of a medical officer within the Bureau of the Treasury Department. In the late 1870s, Congress allocated funds to investigate the causes of epidemics like cholera and yellow fever, and it created the National Board of Health, making [[medical research]] an official government initiative.<ref>{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#eighteenhundred History: Chronology of Events: 1800–]}}</ref>
 
In 1887, a laboratory for the study of bacteria, the Hygienic Laboratory, was established at the Marine Hospital in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |title=A Short History of the National Institutes of Health (1 of 13) |publisher=history.nih.gov |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515022655/http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/history/index.html |archive-date=May 15, 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |title=SIC 9431 Administration of Public Health Programs |publisher=Referenceforbusiness.com |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510114137/http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Public-Administration/Administration-Public-Health-Programs.html |archive-date=May 10, 2011  }}</ref> In the early 1900s, Congress began appropriating funds for the Marine Hospital Service. By 1922, this organization changed its name to Public Health Services and established a Special Cancer Investigations laboratory at [[Harvard Medical School]]. This marked the beginning of a partnership with universities. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was re-designated as the National Institute of Health by the [[Ransdell Act]], and was given $750,000 to construct two NIH buildings. Over the next few decades, Congress would markedly increase funding of the NIH, and various institutes and centers within the NIH were created for specific research programs.<ref>{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteenten History: Chronology of Events: 1900–]}}</ref> In 1944, the [[Public Health Service Act]] was approved, and the [[National Cancer Institute]] became a division of NIH. In 1948, the name changed from National Institute of Health to National Institutes of Health.

In the 1960s, virologist and cancer researcher [[Chester M. Southam]] injected [[HeLa]] cancer cells into patients at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital.<ref name="Broadway Paperbacks">{{cite book|last1=Skloot|first1=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|date=2010|publisher=Broadway Paperbacks|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|130}} When three doctors resigned after refusing to inject patients without their consent, the experiment gained considerable media attention.<ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/>{{rp|133}} The NIH was a major source of funding for Southam's research and had required all research involving human subjects to obtain their consent prior to any experimentation.<ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/>{{rp|135}} Upon investigating all of their grantee institutions, the NIH discovered that the majority of them did not protect the rights of human subjects. From then on, the NIH has required all grantee institutions to approve any research proposals involving human experimentation with review boards.<ref name="Broadway Paperbacks"/>{{rp|135}}

In 1967, the Division of Regional Medical Programs was created to administer grants for research for heart disease, cancer, and strokes. That same year, the NIH director lobbied the White House for increased federal funding in order to increase research and the speed with which health benefits could be brought to the people. An advisory committee was formed to oversee further development of the NIH and its research programs. By 1971 cancer research was in full force and President Nixon signed the [[National Cancer Act]], initiating a National Cancer Program, President's Cancer Panel, National Cancer Advisory Board, and 15 new research, training, and demonstration centers.<ref>{{cite web| title=History of the National Cancer Institute| publisher=National Cancer Institute{{snd}}National Institutes of Health| url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| accessdate=June 29, 2017| url-status=live| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628185858/https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/overview/history#1971| archive-date=June 28, 2017| df=mdy-all| date=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research, and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.<ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146">{{cite journal|title= A Medical Anthropologist's Ruminations on NIH Funding|author=Laurie J.

By the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the [[Human Genome Project]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/25520329/online-education-kit-1990-launch-of-the-human-genome-project/|title=Online Education Kit: 1990: Launch of the Human Genome Project|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|language=en-US|access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref>

===Public Access Policy===
{{main|NIH Public Access Policy}}
In 2008 a Congressional mandate called for investigators funded by the NIH to submit an electronic version of their final manuscripts to the [[National Library of Medicine]]'s research repository, [[PubMed Central]] (PMC), no later than 12 months after the official date of publication.<ref name="NIH Public Access Policy">{{cite web|last=National Institutes of Health|title=NIH Public Access Policy Details|url=http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=January 30, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101151816/http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm|archive-date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>  The [[NIH Public Access Policy]] was the first public access mandate for a U.S. public funding agency.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=An open access mandate for the National Institutes of Health|journal=Open Medicine|date=April 16, 2008|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e39–41|pmc=3090178|pmid=21602938}}</ref>

===NIH Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee===
On February 13, 2012, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced a new group of individuals assigned to research pain. This committee is composed of researchers from different organizations and will focus to "coordinate pain research activities across the federal government with the goals of stimulating pain research collaboration… and providing an important avenue for public involvement" ("Members of new," 2012). With a committee such as this research will not be conducted by each individual organization or person but instead a collaborating group which will increase the information available. With this hopefully more pain management will be available including techniques for arthritis sufferers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Members of new Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee announced|website=nih.gov|url=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/members-new-interagency-pain-research-coordinating-committee-announced|date=2012-02-13|accessdate=2019-07-13}}</ref>

===Economic return===
In 2000, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress reported NIH research, which was funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, that some econometric studies had given a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US. It found that of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact on society introduced between 1965 and 1992, public funding was "instrumental" for 15.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Joint Economic Committee |date=May 2000 |url=http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |title=The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412003136/http://www.faseb.org/portals/2/pdfs/opa/2008/nih_research_benefits.pdf |archive-date=April 12, 2015 }}</ref> As of 2011 NIH-supported research helped to discover 153 new FDA-approved drugs, vaccines, and new indications for drugs in the 40 years prior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=A.

===Notable discoveries and developments ===
Since its inception, the NIH intramural research program has been a source of many pivotal scientific and medical discoveries. Some of these include:
* 1908 – [[George W. McCoy]]'s discovery that rodents were a reservoir of [[bubonic plague]].
* 1911 – George W. McCoy, Charles W. Chapin, William B. Wherry, and B. H. Lamb described the previously-unknown [[tularemia]].
* 1924 – Roscoe R. Spencer and Ralph R. Parker developed a vaccine against [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].
* 1930 – [[Sanford Rosenthal|Sanford M. Rosenthal]] developed a treatment for [[mercury poisoning]] used widely before the development of dimercaptoethanol.
* 1943 – Wilton R. Earle pioneered the [[cell culture]] process and published a paper describing the production of malignancy in vitro, Katherine K. Sanford developed the first clone from an isolated cancer cell, and Virginia J. Evans devised a medium that supported growth of cells in vitro.
* 1940s-50s – Bernard Horecker and colleagues described the [[pentose phosphate pathway]].
* 1950s – [[Julius Axelrod]] discovered a new class of enzymes, [[cytochrome P450]] monooxygenases, a fundamental of drug metabolism.
* 1950 – [[Earl Reece Stadtman|Earl Stadtman]] discovered phosphotransacetylose, elucidating the role of [[acetyl CoA]] in [[fatty acid metabolism]].
* 1960s – Discovered the first human slow virus disease, kuru, which is a degenerative, fatal infection of the central nervous system. This discovery of a new mechanism for infectious diseases revolutionized thinking in microbiology and neurology.

====NIH Toolbox====
In September 2006, the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research started a contract for the [[NIH Toolbox]] for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function to develop a set of state-of-the-art measurement tools to enhance collection of data in large cohort studies. Scientists from more than 100 institutions nationwide contributed. In September 2012, the NIH Toolbox was rolled out to the research community. NIH Toolbox assessments are based, where possible, on [[Item Response Theory]] and adapted for testing by computer.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

====Coronavirus vaccine====
The NIH partnered with [[Moderna]] in 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] to develop a vaccine. The final phase of testing began on 27 July with up to 30,000 volunteers assigned to one of two groups — one receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine and the other receiving salt water injections — and will continue until there have been about 150 cases of COVID-19 among the participants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/27/895672859/us-vaccine-candidate-heads-to-widespread-testing-in-people|title=COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate Heads To Widespread Testing In U.S.|publisher=NPR}}</ref>

To allocate funds, the NIH must first obtain its budget from Congress. This process begins with institute and center (IC) leaders collaborating with scientists to determine the most important and promising research areas within their fields. IC leaders discuss research areas with NIH management who then develops a budget request for continuing projects, new research proposals, and new initiatives from the Director. NIH submits its budget request to the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and the HHS considers this request as a portion of its budget. Many adjustments and appeals occur between NIH and HHS before the agency submits NIH's budget request to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB).  OMB determines what amounts and research areas are approved for incorporation into the President's final budget. The President then sends NIH's budget request to Congress in February for the next fiscal year's allocations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Funding|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060502/http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33695.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref>  The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees deliberate and by fall, Congress usually appropriates funding.

==== Historical funding ====
Over the last century, the responsibility to allocate funding has shifted from the OD and Advisory Committee to the individual ICs and Congress increasingly set apart funding for particular causes. In the 1970s, Congress began to earmark funds specifically for cancer research, and in the 1980s there was a significant amount allocated for AIDS/HIV research.<ref name="Funding" />

Funding for the NIH has often been a source of contention in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that "variants of a human cancer virus called HTLV-III are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)," a new epidemic that gripped the nation.<ref>{{harvnb|NIH Almanac|2011|loc=[http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/historical/chronology_of_events.htm#nineteeneighty History: Chronology of Events: 1980–]}}</ref>
 
In 1992, the NIH encompassed nearly 1 percent of the federal government's operating budget and controlled more than 50 percent of all funding for health research and 85 percent of all funding for health studies in universities.<ref name="Laurie J. Price 1992 128–146"/> From 1993 to 2001 the NIH budget doubled. For a time, funding essentially remained flat, and for seven years following the financial crisis, the NIH budget struggled to keep up with inflation.<ref>[https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 NIH Appropriations (Section 1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507125120/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-1 |date=May 7, 2017 }} and [https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 NIH Appropriations (Section 2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105133440/https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/appropriations-section-2 |date=January 5, 2018 }} April 7, 2016, retrieved May 4, 2016, U.S. Department of Health and Human Service</ref>

===Extramural research===
{{main|NIH grant}}
Researchers at universities or other institutions outside of NIH can apply for [[NIH grants|research project grants]] (RPGs) from the NIH. There are numerous funding mechanisms for different project types (e.g., basic research, clinical research, etc.) and career stages (e.g., early career, postdoc fellowships, etc.). The NIH regularly issues "requests for applications" (RFAs), e.g., on specific programmatic priorities or timely medical problems (such as [[Zika virus]] research in early 2016). In addition, researchers can apply for "investigator-initiated grants" whose subject is determined by the scientist.

The total number of applicants has increased substantially, from about 60,000 investigators who had applied during the period from 1999 to 2003 to slightly less than 90,000 in who had applied during the period from 2011 to 2015.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|title=How Many Researchers?|last=Lauer|first=Mike|date=May 31, 2016|website=Open Mike|publisher=NIH|access-date=June 6, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825174823/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/05/31/how-many-researchers/|archive-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Due to this, the "cumulative investigator rate," that is, the likelihood that unique investigators are funded over a 5-year window, has declined from 43% to 31%.<ref name=":0" />

R01 grants are the most common funding mechanism and include investigator-initiated projects. The roughly 27,000 to 29,000 R01 applications had a funding success of 17-19% during 2012 though 2014. Similarly, the 13,000 to 14,000 R21 applications had a funding success of 13-14% during the same period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|title=Looking at Recent Data on R21 and R01-equivalent Grants|last=Rockey|first=Sally|date=April 10, 2015|website=Rock Talk|publisher=NIH|access-date=October 2, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008215446/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/04/10/looking-at-recent-data-on-r21-and-r01-equivalent-grants/|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref> In FY 2016, the total number of grant applications received by the NIH was 54,220, with approximately 19% being awarded funding.<ref name=2016funding>{{cite web|title=NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT)|url=https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|website=report.nih.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202133251/https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/Success_ByIC.cfm|archive-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> Institutes have varying funding rates. The National Cancer Institute awarded funding to 12% of applicants, while the National Institute for General Medical Science awarded funding to 30% of applicants.<ref name=2016funding/>

===Funding criteria===
NIH employs five broad decision criteria in its funding policy. First, ensure the highest quality of scientific research by employing an arduous peer review process. Second, seize opportunities that have the greatest potential to yield new knowledge and that will lead to better prevention and treatment of disease. Third, maintain a diverse research portfolio in order to capitalize on major discoveries in a variety of fields such as cell biology, genetics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Fourth, address public health needs according to the disease burden (e.g., prevalence and mortality). And fifth, construct and support the scientific infrastructure (e.g., well-equipped laboratories and safe research facilities) necessary to conduct research.<ref>{{cite web |title=Statement on Funding Allocation for Disease Research by Harold Varmus, M. D., Director, National Institutes of Health |publisher=Assistant Secretary for Legislation, Department of Health and Human Services |url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.htm |date=May 6, 1999}}</ref>

Advisory committee members advise the institute on policy and procedures affecting the external research programs and provide a second level of review for all grant and cooperative agreement applications considered by the Institute for funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |title=National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke Council (NANDSC) |publisher=Ninds.nih.gov |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428004009/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/find_people/nands/index.htm |archive-date=April 28, 2013  }}</ref>

====Gender and sex bias====

In 2014, it was announced that the NIH is directing scientists to perform their experiments with both female and male animals, or cells derived from females as well as males if they are studying cell cultures, and that the NIH would take the balance of each study design into consideration when awarding grants.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news |first=Roni Caryn |last=Rabin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |title=Labs Are Told to Start Including a Neglected Variable: Females |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 14, 2014 |accessdate=September 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906202122/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/health/nih-tells-researchers-to-end-sex-bias-in-early-studies.html |archive-date=September 6, 2015  }}</ref> The announcement also stated that this rule would probably not apply when studying sex-specific diseases (for example, ovarian or testicular cancer).<ref name="nytimes.com"/>

===Stakeholders===

====General public====
One of the goals of the NIH is to "expand the base in medical and associated sciences in order to ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research."<ref>{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125135014/http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm|archive-date=November 25, 2011|date=October 31, 2014}}</ref>  Taxpayer dollars funding NIH are from the taxpayers, making them the primary beneficiaries of advances in research. Thus, the general public is a key stakeholder in the decisions resulting from the NIH funding policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stakeholders |url=http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114231545/http://acd.od.nih.gov/Roster.asp |archive-date=November 14, 2011 }}</ref>  However, some in the general public do not feel their interests are being represented, and individuals have formed patient advocacy groups to represent their own interests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stakeholders|url=https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104113818/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990506a.html|archive-date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>

====Extramural researchers and scientists====
Important stakeholders of the NIH funding policy include researchers and scientists. Extramural researchers differ from intramural researchers in that they are not employed by the NIH but may apply for funding. Throughout the history of the NIH, the amount of funding received has increased, but the proportion to each IC remains relatively constant. The individual ICs then decide who will receive the grant money and how much will be allotted.

Policy changes on who receives funding significantly affect researchers. For example, the NIH has recently attempted to approve more first-time NIH R01 applicants or the research grant applications of young scientists. To encourage the participation of young scientists, the application process has been shortened and made easier.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Science |year=2008 |volume=322 |issue=5905 |pages=1187–8 |doi=10.1126/science.322.5905.1187c |title=Changes to NIH grant system may backfire |vauthors=Karp PD, Sherlock G, Gerlt JA, Sim I, Paulsen I, Babbitt PC, Laderoute K, Hunter L, Sternberg P, Wooley J, Bourne PE |pmid=19023064}}</ref>  In addition, first-time applicants are being offered more funding for their research grants than those who have received grants in the past.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Acad Med |date=May 2010 |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=775–9 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181d74256 |pmid=20520024 |title=Perspective: is NIH funding the "best science by the best scientists"?

==Commercial partnerships==
In 2011 and 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General published a series of audit reports revealing that throughout the fiscal years 2000–2010, institutes under the aegis of the NIH did not comply with the time and amount requirements specified in appropriations statutes, in awarding federal contracts to commercial partners, committing the federal government to tens of millions of dollars of expenditure ahead of appropriation of funds from Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | title = Appropriations Funding for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Contract N01-AI-15416 With the University of California at San Francisco Audit (A-03-10-03120) | accessdate = June 25, 2011 | date = June 2011 | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015190017/http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/region3/31003120.pdf | archive-date = October 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}
