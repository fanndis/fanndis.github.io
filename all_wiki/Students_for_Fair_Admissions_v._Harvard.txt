'''''Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard''''' is a lawsuit concerning [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]] in [[College admissions in the United States|student admissions]]. The lawsuit was filed by the organization [[Students for Fair Admissions]] and other plaintiffs, in the U.S. [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|federal district court in Massachusetts]] in 2014, against [[Harvard University]], claiming that Harvard discriminates against [[Asian Americans|Asian-American]] applicants in its undergraduate admissions process.

On October 1, 2019, judge [[Allison Dale Burroughs|Allison D.

== Background ==
Harvard is a private university, but it receives federal funding, making it subject to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which outlaws racial discrimination.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Riley|first=Jason L.|date=2019-10-08|title=Opinion {{!}} Harvard’s Asian Quotas Repeat an Ugly History|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvards-asian-quotas-repeat-an-ugly-history-11570575962|access-date=2020-05-13|issn=0099-9660|archive-date=May 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200514173901/https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvards-asian-quotas-repeat-an-ugly-history-11570575962|url-status=live}}</ref> Race-conscious admissions policies are legal so long as they pass the “strict scrutiny," which requires that the use of race serve a “compelling governmental interest” — like the educational benefits that stem from diversity — and be “narrowly tailored” to satisfy that interest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Federal Judge Rules Harvard's Admissions Policies Do Not Discriminate Against Asian American Applicants {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/2/admissions-suit-decision/|website=www.thecrimson.com|access-date=2020-05-13|archive-date=May 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519163157/https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/2/admissions-suit-decision/|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Since the Supreme Court's ruling in [[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|''Regents of the University of California v.

== Lawsuit ==

[[Students for Fair Admissions]] (SFFA) filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Harvard University on November 17, 2014, representing a group of anonymous Asian-American plaintiffs rejected from Harvard.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|title=The lawsuit against Harvard that could change affirmative action in college admissions, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/18/17984108/harvard-asian-americans-affirmative-action-racial-discrimination|last=Lockhart|first=P.

Certain Asian American advocacy groups filed amicus briefs in support of SFFA, believing that they or their children are discriminated against in college admission processes.<ref name=":1" /> Other Asian American advocacy groups filed amicus briefs in support of Harvard.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Rise and Fall of Affirmative Action|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-affirmative-action|last=Hsu|first=Hua|website=The New Yorker|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13|archive-date=May 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513195605/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-affirmative-action|url-status=live}}</ref> 
=== Personal ratings of Asian-Americans ===

==== Plaintiff allegations ====
In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs claimed that Harvard imposes a soft [[racial quota]], which keeps the numbers of Asian-Americans artificially low.<ref name=":1" /> The percentage of Asians admitted to Harvard, plaintiffs maintained, was suspiciously similar year after year despite dramatic increases in the number of Asian-American applicants and the size of the Asian-American population.<ref name=":1" />

During the lawsuit, the plaintiffs gained access to Harvard's individualized admissions files from 2014 to 2019 and aggregate data from 2000 to 2019.<ref name=":4" /> The plaintiffs also interviewed and deposed numerous Harvard officials.<ref name=":4" /> From these sources, the plaintiffs revealed that Harvard consistently rated Asian-American applicants as a group lower than others on traits like positive personality, likability, courage, kindness and being widely respected.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> Asian-Americans scored higher than applicants of any other racial or ethnic group on other admissions measures like test scores, grades and extracurricular activities, but the students’ personal ratings significantly dragged down their admissions chances.<ref name=":2" /> The plaintiffs also claimed that alumni interviewers gave Asian-Americans personal ratings comparable to white applicants and Harvard's admissions staff testified that they did not believe that Asian applicants had weaker personal traits as a group, but Harvard's admissions office nonetheless rates Asians with the worst personal scores of any racial group.<ref name=":2" /> 

[[Peter Arcidiacono]], a [[Duke University|Duke]] economist testifying on behalf of the plaintiffs, concluded that Asian-American applicants as a group performed stronger on objective measures of test scores, academic achievement, and extracurricular activities.<ref name=":4">Peter S. Arcidiacono, ''Expert Report of Peter S. Arcidiacono'', Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Harvard No. 14-cv-14176-ADB (D. Mass).</ref> Despite this, they received a significant penalty relative to White applicants in the personal score and overall score assigned by Harvard officials. In addition, after taking into account the scores themselves, Asian-American applicants still suffer a statistically significant penalty relative to white applicants.<ref name=":4" /> As a result, Asian-American applicants have the lowest chance of admission despite scoring highest in all objective measurements.<ref name=":4" /> Arcidiacono testified that removing the personal score penalty of Asian applicants relative to White applicants would result in a 16% increase in the number of admitted Asian-Americans.<ref name=":4" />

Arcidiacono suggested that the applicant's race plays a significant role in admissions decisions.<ref name=":4" /> According to his testimony, if an Asian-American applicant with certain characteristics (like scores, GPAs, and extracurricular activities, family background) would result in a 25% statistical likelihood of admission, the same applicant, if White, will have a 36% likelihood of admission.<ref name=":4" /> A Hispanic and Black applicant with the same characteristics will have a 77% and 95% predicted chance of admission, respectively.<ref name=":4" /> 	 
	
Harvard itself found a bias against Asian-American applicants in an internal investigation in 2013, but had never made the findings public or acted on them.<ref name=":2" /> Plaintiffs and commentators have compared the [[Asian quota|treatment of Asians]] with the [[Jewish quota#United States|Jewish quota]] in place in the early 20th century, which used deficient personalities as the reason for excluding Jews in elite universities.<ref>Riley, Jason L.

==== Defendant responses ====
Harvard denies engaging in discrimination and said its admissions philosophy complies with the law. The school said the percentage of Asian-American students admitted has grown from 17% to 21% in a decade while Asian-Americans represent around 6% of the U.S. population.<ref name="NPR">{{Cite web|title=Is Harvard Showing Bias Against Asian-Americans?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/05/20/408240998/is-harvard-showing-bias-against-asian-americans|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-05-13|archive-date=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112223519/https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/05/20/408240998/is-harvard-showing-bias-against-asian-americans|url-status=live}}</ref> Various students, alumni and external groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs on both sides.<ref>Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Amicus Brief https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SFFA-v-Harvard-Amicus-Brief.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327194718/https://lawyerscommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SFFA-v-Harvard-Amicus-Brief.pdf |date=March 27, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=NAACP LDF AMICI CURIAE BRIEF|url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/cdh_brief.pdf|last=|first=|date=July 30, 2018|website=projects harvard /files/diverse-education/files/cdh_brief.pdf|archivedate=November 9, 2018|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109234726/https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/cdh_brief.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=July 31, 2018|title=Standing with Harvard in admissions case|language=en-US|work=Harvard Gazette|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/07/standing-with-harvard-in-admissions-case/|access-date=November 9, 2018|archive-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108191515/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/07/standing-with-harvard-in-admissions-case/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Well-known UC Berkeley economist David Card testified on behalf of Harvard and indicated in a report that SFFA's analysis of the personal ratings excluded personal essays and letters of recommendation from teachers and guidance counselors, and that the difference as an aggregate was almost negligible compared to white students.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=David |title=REPORT OF DAVID CARD, Ph.D. |url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/expert_report_-_2017-12-15_dr._david_card_expert_report_updated_confid_desigs_redacted.pdf |website=Harvard Projects |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=July 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724041207/https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/expert_report_-_2017-12-15_dr._david_card_expert_report_updated_confid_desigs_redacted.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Furthermore, that report found that in SFFA's modeling of the academic rating, Asian American ethnicity had an unexpected positive and significant effect on that rating, which would add complexity to the claim that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans.

=== Decision and appeal ===

The case was paused until the Supreme Court issued its decision in [[Fisher v. University of Texas (2016)|''Fisher II'']] on June 23, 2016. The case resumed, and oral arguments were heard in [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Massachusetts federal district court]] [[John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse|in Boston]] in October 2018.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 21, 2018|title=Question at center of Harvard trial: What counts as discrimination?|work=Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/10/21/question-center-harvard-trial-what-counts-discrimination/vDGQ0yU1uoyix9ZeLGXgRJ/story.html|access-date=March 18, 2019|archive-date=March 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329025257/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/10/21/question-center-harvard-trial-what-counts-discrimination/vDGQ0yU1uoyix9ZeLGXgRJ/story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2019, federal judge [[Allison Dale Burroughs|Allison D. Burroughs]] ruled that Harvard College’s admissions policies do not discriminate against Asian Americans.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Hartocollis|first=Anemona|date=2020-02-18|title=The Affirmative Action Battle at Harvard Is Not Over|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/affirmative-action-harvard.html|access-date=2020-05-13|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=May 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200519190057/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/us/affirmative-action-harvard.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While the system is “not perfect,” the judge ruled, it nonetheless passes constitutional muster.<ref name=":3" /> In her ruling, Judge Burroughs states that there are “no quotas” in place at Harvard, despite acknowledging that the school “uses the racial makeup of admitted students to help determine how many students it should admit overall.

In February 2020, SFFA filed an appeal in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit Court of Appeals]].<ref name=":3" /> The appeals court is required to take the case and will likely hear oral arguments.<ref name=":3" /> The Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing that Harvard University unlawfully discriminates against Asian Americans through racial quotas and imposing a “a racial penalty by systematically disfavoring Asian-American applicants."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Justice Department argues Harvard’s use of race in admissions violates civil rights law|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/02/26/justice-department-argues-harvards-use-race-admissions-violates-civil-rights-law/|last=Anderson|first=Nick|date=February 26, 2020|website=Washington Post|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712064814/https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/02/26/justice-department-argues-harvards-use-race-admissions-violates-civil-rights-law/|archive-date=July 12, 2020|access-date=2020-05-13}}</ref>

== Response by Asian American groups ==
Asian Americans remain divided by this case and affirmative action in general. 

On May 15, 2015, a coalition of more than 60 Asian-American organizations filed federal complaints with the [[United States Department of Education]] and [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] against [[Harvard University]]. The coalition asked for a civil rights investigation into what it described as Harvard's discriminatory admission practices against [[Asian-American]] applicants.<ref name="Harvard Accused of Discrimination">[http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/22498/ Asian American Coalition, ASIAN-AMERICAN GROUPS ACCUSE HARVARD OF DISCRIMINATION IN FEDERAL COMPLAINT] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607061456/http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/22498/ |date=June 7, 2015 }}.</ref><ref name="IBTIMES">[http://www.ibtimes.com/harvard-admissions-discrimination-coalition-accuses-university-bias-against-asian-1925779 Harvard Admissions Discrimination: Coalition Accuses University Of Bias Against Asian-Americans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607041845/http://www.ibtimes.com/harvard-admissions-discrimination-coalition-accuses-university-bias-against-asian-1925779 |date=June 7, 2015 }}.</ref><ref name="BOSTONGLOBE">[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/15/harvard-faces-admissions-bias-complaint-from-asian-americans/gILV3A3eWCxIGSNzMQUbZK/story.html Harvard faces bias complaint from Asian-American groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604070108/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/15/harvard-faces-admissions-bias-complaint-from-asian-americans/gILV3A3eWCxIGSNzMQUbZK/story.html |date=June 4, 2015 }}.</ref> The complaints at the Department of Education were dismissed in July 2015 because a lawsuit making similar allegations had already been filed by [[Students for Fair Admissions]] (SFFA) in November 2014. 

However, in 2017, the coalition resubmitted their complaints to the Department of Justice under the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]. It opened an investigation into allegations against Harvard’s policies, and that investigation was ongoing as of February 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Justice Department Files Amicus Brief Explaining that Harvard’s Race-Based Admissions Process Violates Federal Civil-Rights Law |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-amicus-brief-explaining-harvard-s-race-based-admissions-process |website=Department of Justice |publisher=US Government |accessdate=24 August 2020 |archive-date=August 24, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824084104/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-amicus-brief-explaining-harvard-s-race-based-admissions-process |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund]] also filed a brief on behalf of 25 Harvard student and alumni organizations representing “thousands of Asian American, Black, Latinx, Native American, and white students and alumni."
