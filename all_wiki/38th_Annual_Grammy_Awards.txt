The '''38th Annual Grammy Awards''' were held on February 28, 1996, at [[Shrine Auditorium]], Los Angeles. The awards recognized accomplishments by musicians from the previous year. [[Alanis Morissette]] was the main recipient, being awarded four trophies, including Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1995&genre=All|title=1995 Grammy Award Winners|publisher=Grammy.com|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Boyz II Men]] opened the show with their Record of the Year nominated "One Sweet Day".

The ceremony was controversial for its unexpected snub of [[Mariah Carey]]'s [[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|''Daydream'']] album, which proved to be one of the bestselling and most acclaimed albums of 1995.<ref name=Nickson152>Nickson 1998, p. 152{{incomplete short citation|date=September 2019}}</ref> When the Grammy Award nominees were announced, and ''Daydream'' was nominated for six different awards, critics began raving how it would be "cleaning up" that year.<ref>Nickson 1998, p. 154{{incomplete short citation|date=September 2019}}</ref> Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with [[Boyz II Men]], she sang a live rendition of "[[One Sweet Day]]", to a very positive response.<ref name=Shapiro98>Shapiro 2001, p. 98{{incomplete short citation|date=September 2019}}</ref> However, as the award winners were announced one by one, Carey watched as her name was not called up even once.<ref name=Nickson152 /> ''Daydream'' had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the "album of the year".<ref name=Shapiro98 /> With every passing loss, the television cameras continued to zoom on Carey's face, who was finding it more difficult to retain her smile. By the end of the night, Carey had not won a single award. The disappointment on her face was painfully obvious. Carey did not perform again until the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards|2006 ceremony]], when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]''.<ref>"Complete list of Grammy Award nominations and winners".

The ceremony is also significant for [[Tupac Shakur]] introducing [[Peter Criss]], [[Ace Frehley]], [[Gene Simmons]], and [[Paul Stanley]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] for the first time in full makeup and costume since 1979. Shakur said “And I’ve seen just about everything now,” in response to seeing Kiss walk on stage to announce the nominees  for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-grammys-1996/|title=When Kiss Made a Surprise Comeback at the Grammys|last=Christopher|first=Michael|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>
