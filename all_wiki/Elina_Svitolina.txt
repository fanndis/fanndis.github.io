Svitolina topped the group by winning both her matches, advancing to the semifinals where she lost to Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√°.

At the [[2016 BNP Paribas Open|BNP Paribas Open]] in Indian Wells, 17th-seed Svitolina defeated Annika Beck, before losing in straight sets to ninth-seed [[Roberta Vinci]]. Then, in Miami, after defeating Australian Open quarterfinalist [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]], Svitolina scored one of the biggest victories of her career, coming from a break down in the third set to defeat former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|WTA number one]], [[Caroline Wozniacki]], in three sets in the third round. Svitolina subsequently lost in the fourth round to Ekaterina Makarova, who beat her at the same tournament the prior year.

Entering the [[2016 French Open|French Open]] in poor form, Svitolina beat Romanian qualifier [[Sorana C√Ærstea]] and wildcard [[Taylor Townsend (tennis)|Taylor Townsend]] before beating nemesis and former world No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/news/articles/2016-05-28/svitolina_ends_former_champions_run.html|title=Svitolina ends former champion's run|website=Roland Garros|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> She then lost in the fourth round to world No. 1, defending champion, and eventual finalist Serena Williams.

Svitolina failed to follow up her landmark victory in the next round, however, losing to eventual bronze medalist Petra Kvitov√°.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-10/rio-2016-samantha-stosur-serena-williams-out-of-tennis-singles/7712628?section=sport|title=Rio 2016: Australian Samantha Stosur, top-ranked Serena Williams out of Olympic women's singles|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=10 August 2016|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>

American hard-court season began with a run to the third round of [[2016 Rogers Cup|Montr√©al]], losing to Angelique Kerber. After a disappointing early loss to Daria Gavrilova in [[2016 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]], she rebounded at [[2016 Connecticut Open|New Haven]], reaching the final before losing to Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska. At the [[2016 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Svitolina reached the third round for the second consecutive year with wins over [[Mandy Minella]] and [[Lauren Davis]], but she lost to Petra Kvitov√° once again.

The Asian swing proved to be fruitful for Svitolina, reaching the semifinals of both [[2016 Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]], where she was defeated by Naomi Osaka, and [[2016 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]], her first semifinal at Premier-Mandatory level, losing to eventual champion Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska. As a result, her ranking was propelled back up to 15, one place shy of her career high, and guaranteed her a place in [[2016 WTA Elite Trophy|Zhuhai]] for the second year running. Her good form continued at the last Premier event of the season in [[2016 Kremlin Cup|Moscow]], where she reached the semifinals, her third in four tournaments, before bowing out to eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.

Svitolina began her 2017 season with a strong showing in [[2017 Brisbane International|Brisbane]], defeating world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, in the quarterfinals, before losing to eventual champion Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√° in the following round. The victory over Kerber signified her third win over a number-one-ranked player in five months. Svitolina was seeded 11th at the [[2017 Australian Open|Australian Open]], her highest seeding to date. She equalled her best showing in Melbourne, reaching the third round with victories over [[Galina Voskoboeva]] and [[Julia Boserup]], before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Svitolina won her fifth career title at the [[2017 Taiwan Open|Taiwan Open]], fending off four match points in her quarterfinal encounter with Ons Jabeur, before defeating Peng Shuai in the final. Svitolina next competed in Ukraine's [[2017 Fed Cup World Group II|Fed Cup]] tie against Australia, where she won both of her singles rubbers to help Ukraine set up a play-off against Germany. Svitolina continued her strong start to the season in [[2017 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], where she defeated Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets in the final to capture her first title at Premier 5-level. This win propelled her into the WTA top 10 for the first time in her career, making her the first Ukrainian ever to do so. Svitolina failed to carry her momentum into the American hard-court swing, losing in the fourth round of [[2017 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] to Garbi√±e Muguruza, and the second round of [[2017 Miami Open|Miami]] to [[Bethanie Mattek-Sands]].

She began the clay-court season by capturing her third title of the year in [[2017 ƒ∞stanbul Cup|ƒ∞stanbul]]. Rebounding from a disappointing loss to [[Zheng Saisai]] in the first round of [[2017 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]], Svitolina then proceeded to reach her second Premier-5-level final of the year, and fourth overall, in [[2017 Italian Open (tennis)|Rome]]. After defeating two top-5 players en route in Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√° and Garbi√±e Muguruza, she faced off against [[Simona Halep]], whom she defeated in three sets to claim the title. The win propelled her to a career high of No. 6 in the singles rankings, as well as to the top spot in the Race to Singapore. She then started her campaign at the [[2017 French Open|French Open]] as one of the favourites to win the tournament. Svitolina progressed through her first three matches with relative ease, defeating Yaroslava Shvedova, [[Tsvetana Pironkova]] and [[Magda Linette]] respectively. Svitolina then overcame qualifier [[Petra Martiƒá]] in a tight three set encounter to advance to her second major quarterfinal. She faced Simona Halep in a rematch of the [[2017 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Italian Open]] final. Svitolina led by a set and 5‚Äì1 and held a match point against the 2014 finalist, but lost in three sets (the third set at love).

At [[2017 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], she surpassed her previous performances by reaching the fourth round, defeating Birmingham finalist and potential dark horse [[Ashleigh Barty]] in the first round. She then eased past [[Francesca Schiavone]] and [[Carina Witth√∂ft]], before bowing out to 13th seed and French Open champion [[Jeƒºena Ostapenko]] in straight sets.

Her fifth title of the year, and third successive at Premier 5-level, came in [[2017 Rogers Cup|Toronto]], where she defeated four top-10 players en route in Venus Williams, Garbi√±e Muguruza, Simona Halep and Caroline Wozniacki. Svitolina's first loss of the season at Premier-5-level came the following week in the third round of [[2017 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]], losing to [[Julia G√∂rges]].

She entered the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] knowing that a run to the semifinals would see her claim the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked tennis players|world-number-one ranking]] for the first time. She overcame [[Kate≈ôina Siniakov√°]] in a rain-interrupted three-set encounter, before easing past [[Evgeniya Rodina]] and [[Shelby Rogers]] to reach the round of 16 at the US Open for the first time. She was then defeated by eventual runner-up [[Madison Keys]] in three sets.

Despite missing a large part of the Asian swing, Svitolina still secured her place at the year-end [[2017 WTA Finals|WTA Finals]] in Singapore, making her the first Ukrainian ever to do so. As the third seed in [[2017 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]], she progressed to her eighth quarterfinal of the year with relative ease, defeating wildcard Zhu Lin, recent Wuhan finalist Ashleigh Barty and Elena Vesnina. There, she was defeated by Caroline Garcia on a final-set tiebreak.

Svitolina was drawn into the Red Group at the WTA Finals, alongside Halep, Wozniacki and Caroline Garcia. Despite earning her fifth career win over a number-one-ranked player by defeating Halep, Svitolina lost her other two matches, including a two-set drubbing by eventual champion Wozniacki, which ultimately placed her third in the group. She finished the year ranked at No. 6.

===2018: WTA Finals champion===
[[File:Svitolina RG18 (86) (42260263064).jpg|thumb|upright|Svitolina at the 2018 French Open]]
Svitolina began her 2018 season by capturing the [[2018 Brisbane International|Brisbane International]] title, defeating qualifier [[Aliaksandra Sasnovich]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web| title=Svitolina stops Sasnovich, wins first title in Brisbane | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/svitolina-stops-sasnovich-wins-first-title-brisbane | date = 6 January 2018 | accessdate = 8 January 2018}}</ref> She then competed at the [[2018 Australian Open|Australian Open]] as the fourth seed. She faced qualifier [[Ivana Joroviƒá]] and won in straight sets. Against Kate≈ôina Siniakov√°, Svitolina prevailed in three sets. She then had two straight-sets wins over qualifier and compatriot [[Marta Kostyuk]] and [[Denisa Allertov√°]] to advance to her first Australian Open quarterfinal where she was upset by Belgian [[Elise Mertens]] in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web| title=Magical Mertens stuns Svitolina to make Aussie Open semis | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/magical-mertens-stuns-svitolina-make-aussie-open-semis | date = 23 January 2018 | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}</ref>

Svitolina's 11th career title came after a successful defence of her crown in [[2018 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], where she brushed aside [[Daria Kasatkina]] in the final. After losing to Carla Su√°rez Navarro in the third round of [[2018 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], she produced her best ever result in [[2018 Miami Open|Miami]], reaching the quarterfinals before falling to eventual runner-up Jeƒºena Ostapenko in straight sets.

Rebounding from a second-round loss in [[2018 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] to Su√°rez Navarro, Svitolina claimed her second straight [[2018 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] crown, defeating top seed Simona Halep in two sets, in a rematch of the previous year's final.<ref>{{cite web| title=Svitolina slides to second straight Rome title over Halep | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/svitolina-slides-second-straight-rome-title-over-halep | date = 20 May 2018 | accessdate = 2 June 2018}}</ref> At the [[2018 French Open|French Open]], Svitolina posted wins against [[Ajla Tomljanoviƒá]] and [[Vikt√≥ria Ku≈æmov√°]], before being upset in the third round by [[Mihaela BuzƒÉrnescu]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Buzarnescu blows by Svitolina in stunning Paris upset | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/buzarnescu-blows-svitolina-stunning-paris-upset | date = 1 June 2018 | accessdate = 2 June 2018}}</ref>

She began her grass-court season with a run to the quarterfinals of [[2018 Birmingham Classic|Birmingham]], losing again to BuzƒÉrnescu.<ref>{{cite web| title=Buzarnescu bounces Svitolina from Birmingham | url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/buzarnescu-bounces-svitolina-birmingham | date = 22 June 2018 | accessdate = 23 June 2018}}</ref> Svitolina was then upset in the first round of [[2018 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] by recent [[2018 Mallorca Open|Mallorca]] champion [[Tatjana Maria]].

She enjoyed moderate success during the [[2018 US Open Series|US Open Series]], reaching the semifinals in [[2018 Rogers Cup|Montr√©al]], where she was the defending champion, and the quarterfinals of [[2018 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]], losing there to eventual champion Kiki Bertens. She reached the round of 16 at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] for the second straight year, losing to [[Anastasija Sevastova]] in three sets.

Svitolina's struggles with form continued into the Asian swing, with back-to-back opening round losses to eventual champion [[Aryna Sabalenka]] in [[2018 Wuhan Open|Wuhan]], and [[Aleksandra Kruniƒá]] in [[2018 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]], despite opening up a 6‚Äì0, 3‚Äì0 lead in the latter match. A quarterfinal defeat in [[2018 Hong Kong Tennis Open|Hong Kong]] to in-form [[Wang Qiang (tennis)|Wang Qiang]], coupled with Svitolina's decision not to play in the final week of the year at either [[2018 Kremlin Cup|Moscow]] or [[2018 BGL Luxembourg Open|Luxembourg City]], meant that qualification for the WTA Finals in Singapore would rest on the performances of Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√° and Kiki Bertens in Moscow. Pl√≠≈°kov√°'s defeat in the second round ensured that Svitolina would qualify for Singapore for the second successive year.

As the sixth seed, she was drawn into the White Group, alongside defending champion Caroline Wozniacki, and Czechs Pl√≠≈°kov√° and Petra Kvitov√°. She won all three of her round-robin matches, first snapping a seven-match losing streak against Kvitov√°, defeating her in straight sets. She then defeated both Pl√≠≈°kov√° and Wozniacki in three sets to secure her place in the semifinals alongside Pl√≠≈°kov√°. She defeated Kiki Bertens in three sets, and in the final, she came from a set down to beat Sloane Stephens, winning the biggest title of her career. Svitolina ended the year as the world No. 4.

===2019: Two Grand Slam semifinals===
Svitolina opened the season with an unsuccessful title defense in [[2019 Brisbane International|Brisbane]]; she lost her first match to the previous year's finalist, [[Aliaksandra Sasnovich]].

Seeded sixth at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]], she defeated qualifier [[Viktorija Golubic]], [[Vikt√≥ria Ku≈æmov√°]], Zhang Shuai, and 17th seed Madison Keys to make her second consecutive quarterfinal at the Australian Open. She was, however, afflicted by a neck and shoulder injury and was defeated by fourth seed and eventual champion Naomi Osaka in straight sets. Svitolina then reached back-to-back semifinals in [[2019 Qatar Total Open|Doha]], losing with the lead in the final set against Simona Halep, and [[2019 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], where she was the two-time defending champion, losing in a third-set tiebreak to eventual champion Belinda Bencic.

Svitolina reached her third consecutive semifinal of the year at [[2019 BNP Paribas Open ‚Äì Women's Singles|Indian Wells]]. In her first Premier Mandatory semifinal since 2016, she lost in three sets to 18-year-old wildcard and eventual champion [[Bianca Andreescu]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Andreescu surprises Svitolina to reach biggest final of career at Indian Wells | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/andreescu-surprises-svitolina-reach-biggest-final-career-indian-wells | work=WTA Tennis | date = 16 March 2019 | accessdate = 24 March 2019}}</ref> The next week at the [[2019 Miami Open ‚Äì Women's Singles|Miami Open]], she suffered a surprise defeat in her opening match against [[Wang Yafan]].<ref>{{cite web| title=In-form Wang Yafan springs Svitolina surprise in Miami | url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/form-wang-yafan-springs-svitolina-surprise-miami | work=WTA Tennis | date = 23 March 2019 | accessdate = 24 March 2019}}</ref> Svitolina later revealed that she had been struggling with knee pain for several weeks and announced she would take a short break to recover.

Svitolina's clay-court season began with back-to-back opening round losses to Pauline Parmentier in [[2019 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] and to Victoria Azarenka in [[2019 Italian Open (tennis)|Rome]], where she was the two-time defending champion and had held a match point leading in the final set. At the [[2019 French Open ‚Äì Women's Singles|French Open]], Svitolina was defeated in the third round by the 2016 champion, Garbi√±e Muguruza.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/muguruza-slides-past-svitolina-paris-fourth-round|title=Muguruza slides past Svitolina into Paris fourth round|last=Juzwiak|first=Jason|date=2019-05-31|website=WTA Tennis|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>

After losing in her opening round at both [[2019 Birmingham Classic|Birmingham]] and [[2019 Eastbourne International|Eastbourne]], Svitolina proceeded to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon with victories over Daria Gavrilova, [[Margarita Gasparyan]], [[Maria Sakkari]], Petra Martiƒá and [[Karol√≠na Muchov√°]], becoming the first Ukrainian ever to do so.<ref>{{cite news |title=Svitolina reaches first career Grand Slam semi-final with victory over Muchova |url=https://asia.eurosport.com/tennis/wimbledon-women/2019/wimbledon-2019-elina-svitolina-v-karolina-muchova-live-text-updates_sto7363432/story.shtml |accessdate=9 July 2019 |work=Eurosport |date=9 July 2019}}</ref> There, she faced eventual champion Simona Halep and was defeated in two sets.

Svitolina's North American hard-court season began at [[2019 Silicon Valley Classic|San Jose]], where as the top seed, she fell to Maria Sakkari in the quarterfinals. She would then fall to [[Sofia Kenin]] in both the quarterfinals of [[2019 Rogers Cup|Toronto]] and the Round of 16 at [[2019 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]]. Entering the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the No. 5 seed, Svitolina defeated [[Whitney Osuigwe]], Venus Williams, [[Dayana Yastremska]] and Madison Keys to reach her first US Open quarterfinal. There, she defeated Johanna Konta in straight sets for a spot in her second successive Grand Slam semifinal. She was then defeated in straight sets by Serena Williams. She subsequently returned to her career-high ranking position of number three.

Svitolina reached three consecutive quarterfinals in the season-closing Asian swing, losing to [[Kristina Mladenovic]] in [[2019 Zhengzhou Open|Zhengzhou]], eventual runner-up Alison Riske in [[2019 Wuhan Open|Wuhan]], and Kiki Bertens in [[2019 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]]. Despite failing to reach a final during the season, Svitolina's overall consistency managed to secure her spot as the eighth seed at the WTA Finals in [[2019 WTA Finals|Shenzhen]] for the third successive year. She was drawn into the Purple Group alongside Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√°, US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, who was later replaced by Sofia Kenin, and Wimbledon champion Simona Halep. Svitolina topped her group, winning all three matches without dropping a set. Her semi-final match against Belinda Bencic was cut short when Bencic retired with a leg injury down 4‚Äì1 in the final set, meaning that Svitolina would advance to the final for the second year in succession, as well as her first final since winning the title in 2018. She failed to defend her title, however, losing in straight sets to Ashleigh Barty. This meant Svitolina failed to win a title during the year for the first time since 2012.

===2020: Monterrey and Strasbourg titles===
At her first tournament of the year in [[2020 Brisbane International ‚Äì Singles|Brisbane]], Svitolina lost in the first round to [[Danielle Collins]] in straight sets. At the [[2020 Australian Open ‚Äì Women's Singles|Australian Open]], Svitolina defeated [[Katie Boulter]] and [[Lauren Davis]], before falling to eventual runner-up Garbi√±e Muguruza. Svitolina's slow start to the season continued, being upset in the quarterfinals of [[2020 Thailand Open|Hua Hin]] by [[Nao Hibino]], and in the first round of both [[2020 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]] by [[Jennifer Brady]] and [[2020 Qatar Total Open|Doha]] by [[Amanda Anisimova]]. She rebounded at the [[2020 Monterrey Open|Monterrey Open]], where she easily reached the final without dropping a set. She then defeated [[Marie Bouzkov√°]] in the final in three sets, capturing her 14th singles title, and her first since her WTA Finals win over 16 months ago.

Following the suspension of the WTA Tour due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Svitolina declined to participate in the [[2020 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] due to safety concerns. Her first tournament was the [[2020 Italian Open ‚Äì Women's Singles|Italian Open]], where she defeated [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]] and [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] to reach the quarterfinals, where she lost to [[Mark√©ta Vondrou≈°ov√°]], winning just three games. She next participated at [[2020 Internationaux de Strasbourg ‚Äì Singles|Strasbourg]], where she defeated [[Magda Linette]], [[Jil Teichmann]], and [[Aryna Sabalenka]] to reach the final. There, she won her 15th WTA singles title, defeating [[Elena Rybakina]] in three tight sets.

==Playing style, equipment, and coaches==
Svitolina was coached by S√©bastien Mathieu in 2013 and 2014. She then worked with Iain Hughes for two and a half years, and chose to split from him in November 2016.<ref name="ITF"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/6076287/title/svitolina-splits-with-coach-iain-hughes|title=Svitolina Splits With Coach Iain Hughes|website=Women's Tennis Association|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> In February 2016, she added former world No. 1 [[Justine Henin]] to her coaching team.<ref>[http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5340234/title/henin-to-help-rising-svitolina "Henin to help rising Svitolina." Women's Tennis Association.] Published February 11, 2016.</ref> In late 2016, Svitolina announced that [[Gabriel Urp√≠]] would be her new coach, with [[Thierry Ascione]] replacing Henin as her new coaching consultant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/6150706/title/svitolina-announces-new-coaching-team-led-by-gabriel-urpi|title=Svitolina Announces New Coaching Team, Led By Gabriel Urpi|website=Women's Tennis Association|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref> Ascione coached Svitolina until the 2018 US Open, and she has since begun working with [[Nick Saviano]], whilst still being accompanied on a weekly basis by hitting partner Andrew Bettles. Bettles became her full-time coach for the 2018 season, and former player [[Marcos Baghdatis]] began working with her for the 2020 season.

Svitolina has a complete baseline game and is mostly a defensive player. She can turn defense into offense when given the chance. Her groundstrokes are very consistent and are hit with moderate-to-big power. Her backhand is her stronger side, especially down the line and on the run, but both her groundstrokes penetrate the court well. She demonstrates good movement around the court and can hit very accurate shots on the run. Her serve improved in 2016 and 2017, and she became one of the leaders of service points won in 2018.<ref name=Matchfacts>{{cite web|work=wtatour.com|title=WTA MATCHFACTS|url=http://wtafiles.wtatennis.com/pdf/rankings/WTAMatchStats.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref> She has been known to struggle with volleying at the net, but has good reactions and can accelerate well across the court to deal with short balls. Her favourite surfaces are [[Tennis court#Grass courts|grass]] and [[Tennis court#Clay courts|clay]],<ref name="ITF"/> although she is yet to reach a singles final on grass.

Svitolina uses [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]] racquets and is sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. She was formerly sponsored by [[Ellesse]] and [[Lacoste]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/NIKE-signs-up-rising-Ukrainian-star-Elina-Svitolina-articolo29115.html|title=NIKE signs up rising Ukrainian star Elina Svitolina|publisher=Tennis World|date=3 January 2016|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Since 2019, Svitolina has been in a relationship with [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tennis player [[Ga√´l Monfils]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gatto |first1=Luigi |title=Elina Svitolina shares how she and Gael Monfils fell in love |url=https://www.tennisworldusa.org/tennis/news/Tennis_Interviews/74793/elina-svitolina-shares-how-she-and-gael-monfils-fell-in-love/ |website=tennisworldusa.org |accessdate=2 September 2019 |date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>
