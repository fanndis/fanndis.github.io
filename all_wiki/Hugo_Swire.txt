===Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs===
Swire was made Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 4 September 2012. On 6 September 2013, Swire sent letters to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' and ''[[Ming Pao]]'', commenting on the [[universal suffrage]] of [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR]], emphasising the importance of democracy. Moreover, he added that he would provide any support towards the establishment of universal suffrage in Hong Kong.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In January 2015, Hong Kong's leaders caused diplomatic ‘outrage’ after declining  to meet him to discuss political reform.  Swire believed the Chinese government feared it would cause pro-democracy unrest, though the purpose of the visit was also to support trade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1690869/british-diplomats-fuming-over-hong-kongs-snub-hugo-swire?page=all|title=British diplomats fuming over Hong Kong's snub of Hugo Swire|author=Bryan Harris and Danny Lee|work=South China Morning Post|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> Swire resigned from his ministerial post on 15 July 2016 following the sacking of several other ministers who were considered to be close to David Cameron.

The tumbrils are rolling again!"<ref>{{cite news|title=More heads roll in next round of Theresa May's 'ruthless' reshuffle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/15/more-heads-roll-in-next-round-of-theresa-may-ruthless-reshuffle|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 February 2018|author=|date=16 July 2016}}</ref>

===Conservative Middle East Council===
Swire became Chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council (CMEC) in September 2016, having previously been a member of the group. In June 2016, he accepted a donation of £10,000 from the wife of a billionaire with links to the leadership of Saudi Arabia. The journalist [[Peter Oborne]] has criticised the direction of CMEC away from its earlier focus on Palestine, to greater interest on the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/why-uk-conservative-party-ignoring-palestine-cmec-focus-on-gulf-bahrain-uae-saudi-libya-israel-1824625298|title=Why is the Conservative Party ignoring Palestine? |work=Middle East Eye |date=6 February 2018}}</ref>

===Expenses===
Various aspects of Swire's parliamentary expenses have generated adverse comments from critics. He was criticised for having the joint highest Additional Cost Allowance in the country in 2002/03, but argued that it was legal and that he had not financially benefited from the arrangement as he only rented the property in his constituency that the bulk of the costs related to.<ref>{{cite news|title=MP Hugo talks candidly to Sidmouth Herald over expenses|url=http://www.sidmouthherald.co.uk/news/mp-hugo-talks-candidly-to-sidmouth-herald-over-expenses-1-461443|work=[[Sidmouth Herald]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=12 June 2009}}</ref> He was featured in articles on questionable expenses claims in ''The Telegraph'',<ref>{{cite news|title=MPs' expenses: 25 most ludicrous claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5581638/MPs-expenses-25-most-ludicrous-claims.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=20 June 2009}}</ref> ''The Guardian''<ref>{{cite news|title=MPs' expenses: critics attack censorship as redactions black out documents |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jun/18/mps-expenses-censorship-black-out|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=19 June 2009}}</ref> and BBC website<ref>{{cite news|title=MP pays back money for laptop bag|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8108027.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=18 June 2009}}</ref> in 2009, with attention made to his claims for a designer laptop case, an opera booklet and a satellite navigation system. Swire argued that the claims were sound and that he had not been asked to pay any of them back.<ref>{{cite news|title=MP pays back money for laptop bag|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/8108027.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=18 June 2009}}</ref>  
   
Although Parliament banned new MPs from employing family members from June 2017, Swire continued to employ his wife as his Senior Researcher/Parliamentary Assistant until his retirement.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} He stated in 2009 that family members could add value and that his wife has an 'extraordinary knowledge of the constituency having worked for me'.<ref>{{cite news|title=MP Hugo talks candidly to Sidmouth Herald over expenses|url=http://www.sidmouthherald.co.uk/news/mp-hugo-talks-candidly-to-sidmouth-herald-over-expenses-1-461443|work=[[Sidmouth Herald]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|author=|date=12 June 2009}}</ref>

Although a [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|eurosceptic]], Swire supported the official position of his party and campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union before the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|EU membership referendum]] on 23 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hugoswire.org.uk/news/blog-eu-referendum-my-personal-view|title=The Rt Hon Hugo Swire MP |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> Since the result was announced, Swire has continued to support the party leadership and now advocates leaving the European Union.<ref>{{cite web |title=MPs debate Brexit deal ahead of vote |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-parliaments-47529293 |website=BBC News}}</ref>
