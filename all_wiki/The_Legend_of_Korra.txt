'''''The Legend of Korra''''' (also known as '''''Avatar: The Legend of Korra''''') is an American [[Animated series|animated television series]] created by [[Bryan Konietzko]] and [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] for [[Nickelodeon]]. A sequel to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by [[anime]]. ''The Legend of Korra'' ran for 52 episodes ("chapters"), separated into <!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change "seasons" to "books"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each "book" as a "season". See consensus at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra/Archive_2#Book_2_and_season_2 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra#Books_vs._Seasons -->four seasons ("books"), from April 14, 2012 to December 19, 2014. It has been continued as a [[The Legend of Korra (comics)|comics series]].

As with its predecessor, the series is set in a [[fictional universe]] in which some people can manipulate, or "bend", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the "Avatar," can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar [[Korra]], the successor of [[Aang]] from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.

The main characters are voiced by [[Janet Varney]], [[Seychelle Gabriel]], [[David Faustino]], [[P. J. Byrne]], [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Mindy Sterling]], and supporting voice actors include [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Kiernan Shipka]], [[Lisa Edelstein]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Anne Heche]] and [[Zelda Williams]]. Several people involved in the creation of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (such as designer [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], writer Tim Hedrick and composers [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] and [[Benjamin Wynn]]) returned to work on ''The Legend of Korra''. 

Like its predecessor, ''The Legend of Korra'' received critical acclaim. The series has been praised for its writing and production values, and has been nominated for and won awards such as the [[Annie Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]], and a [[Gracie Award]]. The series was also praised for addressing [[sociopolitical]] issues such as [[social unrest]] and [[terrorism]], as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]].

==Series overview==
{{main|List of The Legend of Korra episodes}}
''The Legend of Korra'' was initially conceived as a twelve-episode [[miniseries]]. Nickelodeon declined the creators' [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for an ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' follow-up animated movie based on what then became the three-part comics ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;– The Promise|The Promise]], [[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;– The Search|The Search]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;– The Rift|The Rift]]'', choosing instead to expand ''Korra'' to 26 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Avatar: The Search' was pitched as a movie by Mike DiMartino, but Nick opted for 'Korra' Book 2|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=March 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514003635/http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|archivedate=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons ("Books") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes ("Chapters") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. ''The Legend of Korra'' concluded with the fourth season.<ref name="season2">{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Konietzko|title=I'm Sure This Meme Is Dead By Now But It Still|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716052845/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Setting===
{{see also|Avatar: The Last Airbender#Series overview|label 1=Avatar: The Last Airbender series overview}}
''The Legend of Korra'' is set in the fictional world of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'', 70 years after the events of that series. The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.  The distinguishing element of the series is "bending", the ability of some people to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] manipulate the classical element associated with their nation ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], or [[Air (classical element)|air]]). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a result of a [[genocide]] in the series's [[backstory]], there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.

Only one person, the "[[Avatar]]", can bend all four elements. Cyclically [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] among the world's four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. ''The Legend of Korra'' focuses on Avatar [[Korra (The Legend of Korra)|Korra]], a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar [[Aang]] from ''The Last Airbender''.

The first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of ''The Last Airbender''. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as "if [[Manhattan]] had happened in Asia" by the series' creators,<ref name="Korra Nation fan questions">{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|last2=DiMartino|first2=Michael Dante|title=The Legend of Korra: All Answered Questions|url=http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|work=Korra Nation|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150736/http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}} ([http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150624/http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the |date=September 26, 2013 }})</ref> and its residents are united by their passion for "pro-bending", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/|title=Politics and Privilege in The Legend of Korra|work=The Artifice|date=July 15, 2013|first=Kevin|last=Wong|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004752/https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/#|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season adds the southern polar region, home of the Southern Water Tribe, as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.

===Synopsis===
The first season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'', sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], Avatar [[Aang]]'s son. She joins a pro-bending team alongside the brothers [[Bolin (The Legend of Korra)|Bolin]] and [[Mako (The Legend of Korra)|Mako]], and befriends [[Asami Sato]], heiress to a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the "Equalists", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong, unmask Amon as a waterbender himself and Tarrlok's brother, ending the Equalists' coup.

In the second season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'', Korra's uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, seizes power in the southern tribe. While Korra's friends seek support against Unalaq, Korra learns of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison Vaatu, the spirit of darkness. Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. After defeating Unalaq, Korra chooses to leave open the portals between the material world and the spirit world, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.

The third season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'', begins as nonbenders begin developing airbending powers as a result of Harmonic Convergence, and Tenzin, Korra, and her friends attempt to recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads. One new airbender is Zaheer, the leader of the anarchist Red Lotus society. The Red Lotus assassinates the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and captures Korra to attempt to kill her and end the Avatar cycle. They are defeated by Korra's friends and the new airbenders, but Korra is severely injured and psychologically traumatized.

The final season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 4)|Book Four: Balance]],'' takes place three years later. Korra slowly recovers from her mental and physical trauma. The metalbender Kuvira, assigned to reunite the fractured Earth Kingdom, declares herself head of the new, authoritarian "Earth Empire". Kuvira builds a spirit-powered superweapon and attempts to conquer Republic City. When Korra and her friends destroy the weapon, defeating Kuvira, the blast creates another portal to the Spirit World. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, as Korra and Asami leave together for a vacation in the spirit world.

The second season, ''[[Book Two: Spirits]]'', premiered on September 13, 2013 and concluded on November 22, 2013. It consists of fourteen episodes. Animation work was done by the South Korean animation studio [[Studio Mir]] as well as the Japanese animation studio [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=Noel|title=The Legend of Korra "Peacekeepers" Review: Every Which Way But Korra's|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-peacekeepers-review-every-which-way-but-korras-138092087939/|publisher=tv.com|accessdate=April 20, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142831/http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-peacekeepers-review-every-which-way-but-korras-138092087939/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Studio Mir was expected to solely work on ''Book 2'', but executive director Jae-myung Yoo decided that Studio Mir would animate ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' instead because the animation process was less rigorous. Pierrot was eventually called in to fill the void and animate ''Book 2''. According to Jae-myung Yoo, Studio Mir was later contacted and re-asked to animate ''Book 2''. Yoo feared that, if ''Book 2'' failed, Studio Mir and Korean animators would have their reputations tarnished for Pierrot's failures. Consequently, Studio Mir accepted the offer and worked alongside Pierrot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shah|first=Keval|title=Which Studio Animated Book 2 of The Legend of Korra&nbsp;– Mir or Pierrot?|url=http://avatarthelegendofkorraonline.com/which-studio-animated-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-mir-or-pierrot-we-have-an-answer/2907/|work=Avatar: The Legend of Korra Online|accessdate=December 31, 2013|date=June 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101113143/http://avatarthelegendofkorraonline.com/which-studio-animated-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-mir-or-pierrot-we-have-an-answer/2907/|archivedate=January 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''[[Book Four: Balance]]'', the final season, was produced in parallel to the previous two seasons. The crew, at one point, worked on approximately 30 episodes at the same time: post-production for season 2, production for season 3 and pre-production for season 4.<ref>{{cite web|title=KORRACAST Interviews MIKE & BRYAN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMVq08LMQ0|author=YumChunks|accessdate=December 5, 2014|date=November 23, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519123721/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgMVq08LMQ0|archivedate=May 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some production steps, such as color correction and retakes, continued up until the date of the series finale, December 19, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|title=DECEMBER 5, 2014|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/104462825022/1028-days-ago-i-started-this-blog-with-a-post|accessdate=December 6, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219220557/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/104462825022/1028-days-ago-i-started-this-blog-with-a-post|archivedate=December 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Season 4 started online distribution a few months after the third season's finale on October 3, 2014.

Concerning the development of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they would not be able to get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and found them supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands, to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior and the pose made by Aang and Katara in the finale of ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|title=Korrasami is Canon.|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/105916338157/korrasami-is-canon-you-can-celebrate-it-embrace|website=Tumblr|accessdate=December 23, 2014|date=December 22, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223021915/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/105916338157/korrasami-is-canon-you-can-celebrate-it-embrace|archivedate=December 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Animation style===
''The Legend of Korra'' was produced mainly as [[traditional animation]], with most frames drawn on paper in South Korea by the animators at Studio Mir and scanned for digital processing. Each episode comprises about 15,000 drawings.<ref name=creator>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/13/150566153/airbender-creators-reclaim-their-world-in-korra|title='Airbender' Creators Reclaim Their World In 'Korra'|author=Ulaby, Neda|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=April 13, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624031248/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/13/150566153/airbender-creators-reclaim-their-world-in-korra|archivedate=June 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series makes occasional use of [[computer-generated imagery]] for complex scenes or objects, most noticeably in the animations of the pro-bending arena or the mecha-suits of the later seasons.

While ''The Legend of Korra'' was produced in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("[[anime]]") in the strict sense, ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) and the quality of its voice acting as well as the visual style are similar to those of leading anime series such as ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood]]'', ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' or ''[[Trigun]]''.<ref name="The Escapist 30 July 2012">{{cite news|last=O'Brien|first=Chris|title=Can Americans Make Anime?|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9829-Can-Americans-Make-Anime|accessdate=August 15, 2012|newspaper=The Escapist|date=July 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018071546/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9829-Can-Americans-Make-Anime|archivedate=October 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to [[J-pop]] songs;<ref name="The Escapist 30 July 2012" /> to save broadcast time, ''The Legend of Korra''{{'}}s openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the [[Anime#Attributes|visual tropes]] characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.

As in ''Avatar'', the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in [[traditional Chinese characters]], without translating it. For example, on the "Wanted" posters seen in the episode "The Stakeout", the names of the protagonists are written as 寇拉 (Korra), 馬高 (Mako) and 愽林 (Bolin).

===Music===
''The Legend of Korra'' is set to music by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], who previously wrote the music for ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' with [[Benjamin Wynn]]. For ''The Legend of Korra'', Zuckerman is the sole composer while Wynn is the lead [[sound designer]]; the two collaborate with [[Foley (filmmaking)|Foley]] artist Aran Tanchum and showrunner Mike DiMartino on the soundscape of the series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schick|first=Michal|title=SeptBender Interview: Jeremy Zuckerman discusses music-bending on 'The Legend of Korra'|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/23/the-legend-of-korra-jeremy-zuckerman-track-team-interview/|accessdate=September 23, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=September 23, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111052/http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/23/the-legend-of-korra-jeremy-zuckerman-track-team-interview/|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Konietzko and DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend [[traditional Chinese music]] with [[Jazz#1920s and 1930s|early jazz]]. On that basis, Zuckerman composed a score combining elements of [[Dixieland]], traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration. It is performed mainly by a [[string sextet]] and various Chinese solo instruments,<ref>{{cite news|title=Eagle Rock and Silver Lake musical duo hit the right note with animated series|url=http://www.theeastsiderla.com/2012/09/eagle-rock-and-silver-lake-musical-duo-hit-the-right-note-with-animated-series/|accessdate=September 20, 2012|newspaper=The Eastsider LA|date=September 18, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923193538/http://www.theeastsiderla.com/2012/09/eagle-rock-and-silver-lake-musical-duo-hit-the-right-note-with-animated-series/|archivedate=September 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> including a [[Dizi (instrument)|dizi (flute)]], [[paigu]] (drums), a [[guqin]], an [[erhu]] and a Mongolian [[matouqin]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Patches|first=Matt|title=Listen to Two Exclusive Clips From the Legend of Korra Soundtrack|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/2-exclusive-legend-of-korra-soundtrack-clips.html|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=Vulture|date=July 11, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714121555/http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/2-exclusive-legend-of-korra-soundtrack-clips.html|archivedate=July 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> <ref>https://open.spotify.com/episode/4oQA5HfTIlkiMAOMY5KnYK</ref>

The first season (''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'') aired in the United States on [[Nickelodeon]] on Saturday mornings between April 14, 2012 and June 23, 2012.

The second season (''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'') began airing on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 13, 2013 on Friday evenings. The season ended on November 22, 2013.

The third season (''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'') began airing on Nickelodeon in the United States on June 27, 2014, also on Friday evenings, two episodes at a time.

After the first seven episodes aired to low ratings, Nickelodeon removed the last five episodes from its broadcast schedule. The remainder of the episodes were then distributed online via Amazon Video, Google Play, Xbox Video and Hulu as well as the Nickelodeon site and apps.<ref name=cartoon>{{cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/nick-pull-korra-airwaves-web-7820/|title=Nick Pull Korra from Airwaves; Web Only|first=Dave|last=Koch|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=July 27, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140806185830/http://blog.bcdb.com/nick-pull-korra-airwaves-web-7820/|archivedate=August 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' compared ''The Legend of Korra'' to ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' as "a [[Friday night death slot|Friday night]] genre series with a loyal fan following built up from previous works by the creators that is taken off the air after the network fails to advertise it properly or broadcast episodes in a logical manner."<ref name="The Escapist 24 July 2014"/> Series creator Michael DiMartino said that the series' move to online distribution reflected a "sea change" in the industry: While ''Korra'' did not fit in well with Nickelodeon's other programming, the series did extremely well online, with the season 2 finale having been Nickelodeon's biggest online event.<ref name="io9 26 July 2014">{{cite news|last1=Trendacosta|first1=Katharine|title=Creators of The Legend of Korra Explain the Show's Not-Cancellation|url=http://io9.com/creators-of-the-legend-of-korra-explain-the-shows-not-c-1611119124/+nathangrayson|accessdate=July 26, 2014|work=[[io9]]|date=July 26, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727201129/http://io9.com/creators-of-the-legend-of-korra-explain-the-shows-not-c-1611119124/+nathangrayson|archivedate=July 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2017, the [[Kenya Film Classification Board]] banned ''The Legend of Korra'', together with the cartoon series ''[[Loud House]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold]]'', ''[[Steven Universe]]'', ''[[Clarence (American TV series)|Clarence]]'' and ''[[Adventure Time]]'', from being broadcast in Kenya. According to the Board, the reason was that these series were "glorifying homosexual behavior".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Anyango|first1=Jennifer|title=Films board bans six TV programs 'for promoting homosexuality'|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001243666/films-board-bans-six-tv-programs-for-promoting-homosexuality|accessdate=23 June 2017|work=The Standard|date=15 June 2016|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617070626/https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001243666/films-board-bans-six-tv-programs-for-promoting-homosexuality|archivedate=June 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The series premiere averaged 4.5 million viewers, ranking it as basic cable's number-one kids' show and top animated program for the week with total viewers.

''Book Two: Spirits'' premiered with 2.6 million viewers. Suggested explanations for the reduced number of broadcast viewers were: the long period between seasons, a change in time slot (Friday evening instead of Saturday morning), the increased availability of digital download services, and generally reduced ratings for the Nickelodeon channel.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schick|first=Michal|title='The Legend of Korra' season 2 premiere brings in low ratings|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/17/legend-korra-season-2-premiere-brings-low-ratings/|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=September 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922102605/http://www.hypable.com/2013/09/17/legend-korra-season-2-premiere-brings-low-ratings/|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Style and production values====
David Hinckley of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' wrote that the "visually striking" series is "full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor, but nothing prevents civilians from enjoying it as well."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-14/news/31340888_1_avatar-naga-world | title=Nickelodeon's new 'Legend of Korra' puts a kick into animated female heroes | work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] | accessdate=April 19, 2012 | author=April 14, 2012}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'', Matt Patches highlighted the second season's loose, handheld-style cinematography&nbsp;– challenging for an animated series&nbsp;– and the "weird, wonderful", wildly imagined spirits fought by Korra; "a [[Kaiju]] parade with beasts that mirror [[velociraptor]]s".<ref name="Vulture 14 September 2013">{{cite news|last=Patches|first=Matt|title=The Legend of Korra Season Two Premiere Recap: Rebel Spirits/The Southern Lights|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/legend-of-korra-season-two-premiere-recap.html|accessdate=September 14, 2013|newspaper=Vulture|date=September 14, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915205534/http://www.vulture.com/2013/09/legend-of-korra-season-two-premiere-recap.html|archivedate=September 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Max Nicholson for IGN described the third season as "easily the show's most consistent season to date, delivering complex themes, excellent storylines and unmatched production values."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/29/the-legend-of-korra-book-three-review|title=The Legend of Korra: Book Three Review|work=IGN|accessdate=October 5, 2014|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140929181130/http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/08/29/the-legend-of-korra-book-three-review#|archive-date=September 29, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> And Oliver Sava, for ''[[The A.V.

The styling of the setting – a fusion of Asian and early 20th century American elements – was noted by critics as "beautiful and innovative", but criticized for [[cultural appropriation]] by a non-[[Cultural diversity|diverse]] creative team and voice cast, and for jettisoning "authentic cultural traditions in favor of embracing white industrialized civilization".<ref name=":0" />

Before the first season's finale, Scott Thill of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' hailed ''The Legend of Korra'' as "the smartest cartoon on TV," able to address adults' spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an "alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]], [[steampunk]] grandeur, kinetic conflicts, sci-fi weaponry and self-aware comedy."<ref name="Wired 23 June 2012">{{cite news|last=Thill|first=Scott|title=Why Legend of Korra Is the Smartest Cartoon on TV|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/06/legend-of-korra-finale|accessdate=June 23, 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=June 23, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623190719/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/06/legend-of-korra-finale/|archivedate=June 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Julie Beck characterized the series as "some of the highest quality fantasy of our time", appreciating it for combining nuanced social commentary with ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''{{'}}s "warmth, whimsy, and self-referential wit".<ref name="The Atlantic 20 September 2013">{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Julie|title=The Legend of Korra: A TV Show for Kids With Serious Appeal for Adults|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/-em-the-legend-of-korra-em-a-tv-show-for-kids-with-serious-appeal-for-adults/279842/|accessdate=September 20, 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=September 20, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054819/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/09/-em-the-legend-of-korra-em-a-tv-show-for-kids-with-serious-appeal-for-adults/279842/|archivedate=September 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that the series "represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids, and perhaps a few adults with the geek gene."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2012/tv/reviews/the-legend-of-korra-1117947378/| title=''The Legend of Korra'' review | work=Variety | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=March 2, 2020 | first=Lowry|last=Brian | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419212325/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947378 | archivedate=April 19, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

At [[TV.com]], Noel Kirkpatrick commented favorably on how the second season of "one of television's best programs" handled the necessary quantity of exposition, and on its introduction of the theme of conflict between [[spiritualism]] and [[secularism]].<ref name="TV.com 14 September 2013">{{cite news|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Noel|title=The Legend of Korra Book 2 Premiere Review: Smells Like Angry Spirit|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-book-2-premiere-review-smells-like-angry-spirit-137894654072/|accessdate=September 14, 2013|newspaper=TV.com|date=September 14, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915223047/http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-book-2-premiere-review-smells-like-angry-spirit-137894654072/|archivedate=September 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Covering the third season, Scott Thill at ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' described Korra as one of the toughest, most complex female characters on TV, despite being in a cartoon, and considered that the "surreal, lovely sequel" to ''Avatar'' "lastingly and accessibly critiques power, gender, extinction, spirit and more&nbsp;— all wrapped up in a kinetic 'toon as lyrical and expansive as anything dreamt up by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] or [[George Lucas]]".<ref name="Salon.com 19 July 2014">{{cite news|last1=Thill|first1=Scott|title="You gotta deal with it!": The TV writers behind the powerful female character no one is talking about|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/07/18/you_gotta_deal_with_it_the_tv_writers_behind_the_powerful_female_character_no_one_is_talking_about/|accessdate=July 19, 2014|work=[[Salon.com]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719060301/http://www.salon.com/2014/07/18/you_gotta_deal_with_it_the_tv_writers_behind_the_powerful_female_character_no_one_is_talking_about/|archivedate=July 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> David Levesley at ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' recommended the series to those looking for "beautifully shot and well-written fantasy on television" after the end of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''{{'}}s most recent season, noting that in both series "the fantastical and the outlandish are carefully balanced with human relationships and political intrigue".<ref name="The Daily Beast 2014-07-01">{{cite news|last1=Levesley|first1=David|title='Game of Thrones' Withdrawal?

Several reviewers noted the [[sociopolitical]] issues that, unusually for an animated series on a children's channel, run through ''The Legend of Korra''. According to ''Forbes'', by telling "some of the darkest, most mature stories" ever animated, ''The Legend of Korra'' has created a new genre, "the world's first animated television drama".<ref>{{cite news|last=Barr|first=Merrill|title=Has 'The Legend Of Korra' Created A New Television Genre?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2013/11/23/has-the-legend-of-korra-created-a-new-television-genre/|accessdate=January 11, 2014|date=September 23, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111212340/http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2013/11/23/has-the-legend-of-korra-created-a-new-television-genre/|archivedate=January 11, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Thill proposed that the Equalists' cause in season 1 reflected the recent appearance of the [[Occupy movement]], and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before [[Occupy Wall Street]] began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted "a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power."<ref name="Wired April 13, 2012">{{cite news|last=Thill|first=Scott|title=The Legend of Korra Upgrades Avatar's Mythic Bending Epic|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/legend-of-korra/|accessdate=September 11, 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=April 13, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720075110/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/legend-of-korra|archivedate=July 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Beck wrote that ''The Legend of Korra'' used magic to illustrate "the growing pains of a modernizing world seeing the rise of technology and capitalism, and taking halting, jerky steps toward [[self-governance]]", while portraying no side of the conflict as entirely flawless.<ref name="The Atlantic 20 September 2013" /> Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of [[John Rawls]]' "[[luck egalitarianism]]", praising the series for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.<ref name="Rosenberg March 27, 2012">{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|title='The Legend of Korra' Tackles Class and Urbanization, Is Amazing|url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/03/27/452177/avatar-the-legend-of-korra-tackles-class-and-urbanization-is-amazing/|website=[[ThinkProgress]]|accessdate=September 11, 2012|date=March 27, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701154615/http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/03/27/452177/avatar-the-legend-of-korra-tackles-class-and-urbanization-is-amazing/|archivedate=July 1, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Rosenberg May 16, 2012">{{cite web|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|title=Guest Post: 'The Legend of Korra' Takes On Redistribution|url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/05/16/484827/guest-post-the-legend-of-korra-takes-on-redistribution/|website=ThinkProgress|accessdate=September 11, 2012|date=May 16, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014151953/http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/05/16/484827/guest-post-the-legend-of-korra-takes-on-redistribution/|archivedate=October 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Writing for ''The Escapist'', Mike Hoffman noted how the series respected its younger viewers by explicitly showing, but also giving emotional weight to the death of major characters, including "one of the most brutal and sudden deaths in children's television" in the case of P'Li in season 3. By portraying Korra's opponents not as stereotypical villains, but as human beings with understandable motivations corrupted by an excess of zeal, the series trusted in viewers to be able to "resolve the dissonance between understanding someone's view and disagreeing with their methods". And, Hoffman wrote, by showing Korra to suffer from "full-on [[Depression (mood)|depression]]" at the end of the third season, and devoting much of the fourth to her recovery, the series helped normalize mental health issues, a theme generally unaddressed in children's television, which made them less oppressive for the viewers.<ref name="The Escapist 8 January 2015" />

====Gender, race and sexual orientation====
[[File:The Legend of Korra S04E12 - Asami and Korra holding hands.jpg|thumb|The series' final shot, intended to show Asami and Korra becoming a romantic couple, was seen as pushing the boundaries of [[LGBT]] representation in children's TV.<ref name="AV Club 19 December 2014" />]]
Summing up Book Four, Joanna Robinson for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' described it as "the most subversive television event of the year", noting how much of the season and series pushed the boundaries of what is nominally children's television by "breaking racial, sexual, and political ground": It featured a dark-skinned female lead character as well as a bevy of diverse female characters of all ages, focused on challenging issues such as [[weapons of mass destruction]], [[PTSD]] and [[fascism]], and was infused with an Eastern spirituality based on tenets such as balance and mindfulness.<ref name="Vanity Fair 19 December 2014">{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Joanna|title=How a Nickelodeon Cartoon Became One of the Most Powerful, Subversive Shows of 2014|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/korra-series-finale-recap-gay-asami|accessdate=December 19, 2014|work=Vanity Fair|date=December 19, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219230600/http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/12/korra-series-finale-recap-gay-asami|archivedate=December 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Levesley also highlighted the "many examples of well-written women, predominantly of color" in the series.<ref name="The Daily Beast 2014-07-01" /> Oliver Sava at ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' noted that the series had "consistently delivered captivating female figures"; he considered it to be first and foremost about women, and about how they relate to each other "as friends, family, and rivals in romance and politics".<ref name="AV Club 19 December 2014" />

Moreover, according to Robinson, the series' final scene, in which Korra and Asami gaze into each other's eyes in a shot mirroring the composition of ''Avatar''{{'}}s final moments in which Aang and Katara kiss, "changed the face of TV" by going further than any other work of children's television in depicting same-sex relationships<ref name="Vanity Fair 19 December 2014" />&nbsp;– an assessment shared by reviewers for [[TV.com]],<ref name="TV.com 19 December 2014">{{cite news|last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=Noel|title=The Legend of Korra Series Finale Review: New Beginnings|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-series-finale-book-4-episode-12-episode-13-day-of-the-colossus-the-last-stand-141886896821/|accessdate=December 20, 2014|work=[[TV.com]]|date=December 19, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221013308/http://www.tv.com/shows/avatar-the-legend-of-korra/community/post/the-legend-of-korra-series-finale-book-4-episode-12-episode-13-day-of-the-colossus-the-last-stand-141886896821/|archivedate=December 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''The A.V.

</ref> Mike Hoffman, on the other hand, felt that Korra and Asami's relationship was not intended as particularly subversive, but as something the writers trusted younger viewers, now often familiar with same-sex relationships, to be mature enough to understand.<ref name="The Escapist 8 January 2015" /> Megan Farokhmanesh of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], the series even avoided the error of assuming [[sexual orientation]], as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between "gay" and "straight".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Farokhmanesh|first1=Megan|title=The Legend of Korra achieved more in under a minute than most shows do in their lifetime|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/23/7439921/the-legend-of-korra-series-finale-asami-couple|accessdate=December 23, 2014|work=Polygon|date=December 23, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223230315/http://www.polygon.com/2014/12/23/7439921/the-legend-of-korra-series-finale-asami-couple|archivedate=December 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2018, ''[[io9]]'' ranked the series' final scene #55 on its list of "The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-100-most-important-pop-culture-moments-of-the-last-1822145186|title=The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years: #41-60|work=[[io9]]|date=January 17, 2018|author=io9 Staff|access-date=January 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130204453/https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-100-most-important-pop-culture-moments-of-the-last-1822145186#|archive-date=January 30, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As ''Korra'' was made widely available again on [[Netflix]] in 2020, Janet Varney called her role as the voice of Korra "the most profound and meaningful part of my career" on account of the impact the ending had on queer fans.<ref name=":0" />

===Influence===
The ''A.V. Club'' and ''io9'' noted that the live-action TV series ''Warrior'', for which [[NBC]] ordered a pilot in early 2015, has a premise almost identical to that of ''The Legend of Korra'': It is to be about "a damaged heroine" who "works undercover with physical and spiritual guidance from a mysterious martial arts master to bring down an international crime lord" in a "contemporary multicultural and sometimes magical milieu".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barsanti|first1=Sam|title=NBC is developing a magical martial arts drama|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/nbc-developing-magical-martial-arts-drama-213692|accessdate=January 12, 2015|date=January 11, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112153310/http://www.avclub.com/article/nbc-developing-magical-martial-arts-drama-213692|archivedate=January 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bricken|first1=Rob|title=NBC Is Going To Make A Martial Arts Fantasy Show Because Why Not|url=http://io9.com/nbc-is-going-to-make-a-martial-arts-fantasy-show-becaus-1679053703|accessdate=January 12, 2015|date=January 12, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113004833/http://io9.com/nbc-is-going-to-make-a-martial-arts-fantasy-show-becaus-1679053703|archivedate=January 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
