These essential components of democracy can be threatened in different ways; thus, the concept of democratic backsliding can take various forms.

Political scientist [[Nancy Bermeo]] has written that blatant forms of democratic backsliding, such as classic, open-ended [[coups d'état]] and [[Electoral fraud|election-day fraud]], have declined since the end of the [[Cold War]], while more subtle and "vexing" forms of backsliding have increased. The latter forms of backsliding entail the debilitation of democratic institutions from within. These subtle forms are especially effective when they are [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimized]] through the very institutions that people expect to protect democratic values.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Bermeo|first=Nancy|date=January 2016|title=On Democratic Backsliding|url=https://sites.unimi.it/carbone/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Democratic-backsliding-Bermeo-JOD-2016.pdf|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=27|issue=1|pages=5–19|doi=10.1353/jod.2016.0012|s2cid=155798358|issn=1086-3214}}</ref>

== Forms ==
Democratic backsliding can occur in a number of common ways. Backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, and uses tactics that are "incremental rather than revolutionary."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment|last1=Kyle|first1=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change}}</ref> Because this process involves democracy breaking down "slowly, in barely visible steps" it is difficult to pinpoint a single specific moment at which a government no longer democratic, as [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]] point out.<ref name=":1" /> [[Ozan Varol]] uses the phrase ''stealth authoritarianism'' to describe the practice of an authoritarian leader (or a would-be authoritarian leader) using "seemingly legitimate legal mechanisms for anti-democratic ends  ... concealing anti-democratic practices under the mask of law."<ref name=Varol>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=[[Ozan Varol|Ozan O.

===Promissory coups===
In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections in order to restore democracy. In these situations, coup-makers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=":02" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that "The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward."<ref name=":02" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that "Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies."<ref name=":02" />

===Executive aggrandizement===
This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=":02" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last1=Levitsky|first1=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|location=United States|pages=76–78}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=":02" />

Over time, there has been a decline in [[Coup d'état|active coups]] (in which a power-seeking individual, or small group, seizes power through forcibly, violently removing an existing government) and [[self-coup]]s (involving "a freely elected chief executive suspending the constitution outright in order to amass power in one swift sweep") and an increase in ''executive aggrandizement''.<ref name=":02" /> Political scientist [[Nancy Bermeo]] notes that executive aggrandizement occurs over time, through institutional changes legitimized through legal means, such as new [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]], [[Referendum|referenda]], or "existing courts or legislatures ... in cases where supporters of the executive gain majority control of such bodies."<ref name=":02" /> Bermeo notes that these means mean that the aggrandizement of the executive "can be framed as having resulted from a democratic mandate."<ref name=":02" /> Executive aggrandizement is characterized by the presence of distress in axes of democracy, including institutional or horizontal accountability;<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/legitimacy-9780198825265?cc=nl&lang=en&|title=Legitimacy: The State and Beyond|date=2019-04-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-882526-5|editor-last=Sadurski|editor-first=Wojciech|editor-link=Wojciech Sadurski|location=Oxford, New York|editor-last2=Sevel|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Walton|editor-first3=Kevin}}</ref> and executive or discursive accountability.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=III Factors, 25 Populism versus Democratic Governance|title=Constitutional Democracy in Crisis?|url=https://oxcon.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law/9780190888985.001.0001/law-9780190888985-chapter-25|isbn=9780190888985|last=Issacharoff|first=Samuel|editor3-first=Tushnet|editor3-last=Mark|editor2-first=Levinson|editor2-last=Sanford|editor1-first=Graber|editor1-last=Mark a|website=Oxford Constitutions|year=2018|language=en|doi=10.1093/law/9780190888985.001.0001|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref>

===Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections===
This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=":02" />

==Causes and characteristics of democratic backsliding==

===Populism===
[[Pippa Norris]] of the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[University of Sydney]] argues that the two "twin forces" pose the largest threat to [[Western world|Western]] [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]: "sporadic and random [[terrorist attack]]s on domestic soil, which damage feelings of security, and the rise of [[populist]]-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] forces, which feed parasitically upon these fears."<ref name="Norris">{{Cite web |url=http://journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |title=Is Western Democracy Backsliding? Diagnosing the Risks |last=Norris |first=Pippa |author-link=Pippa Norris |date=April 2017 |website=Journal of Democracy |series=Online Exchange on “Democratic Deconsolidation” |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |language=en |type=Scholarly response to column published online |access-date=28 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411111001/https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/media/Journal%20of%20Democracy%20Web%20Exchange%20-%20Norris_0.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Norris defines populism as "a governing style with three defining features":
#A rhetorical emphasis on the idea that "legitimate political authority is based on [[popular sovereignty]] and majority rule";
#Disapproval of, and challenges to the legitimacy of, established holders of "political, cultural, and economic power";
#Leadership by "maverick outsiders" who claim "to speak for the ''[[vox populi]]'' and to serve ordinary people."<ref name="Norris"/> 
Some, but not all, populists are also authoritarian, emphasizing "the importance of protecting [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional]] lifestyles against perceived threats from 'outsiders', even at the expense of civil liberties and [[minority rights]]."<ref name="Norris"/> According to Norris, the reinforcement of the insecurities from the "twin forces" has led to more support for populist-authoritarian leaders, and this latter risk is especially pronounced in the United States during the [[presidency of Donald Trump]]. For example, Norris argues that Trump has benefited from the mistrust of "[[the establishment]]" and that he continuously seeks to undermine faith in the legitimacy of the media and the [[Judicial independence|independence of the court]]s.<ref name="Norris"/>

In 2017, [[Cas Mudde]] and Cristóbal Rovire Kaltwasser wrote that:

<blockquote>Populism does not have the same effect in each stage of the democratization process. In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of an electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies. Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and  minority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orbán]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Chávez]] in Venezuela) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Cristóbal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp.95-96. {{isbn|978-0-19-023487-4}}</ref></blockquote>

A 2018 analysis by political scientists [[Yascha Mounk]] and Jordan Kyle links populism to democratic backsliding, showing that since 1990, "13 right-wing populist governments have been elected; of these, five brought about significant democratic backsliding. Over the same time period, 15 left-wing populist governments were elected; of these, the same number, five, brought about significant democratic backsliding."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/hard-data-populism-bolsonaro-trump/578878/|title=What Populists Do to Democracies|last=Kyle|first=Yascha Mounk, Jordan|date=26 December 2018|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>

A December 2018 report by the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]] concluded that populist rule, whether left- or right-wing, leads to a significant risk of democratic backsliding. The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of the press, civil liberties, and political rights.<ref name=":3" />

In a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Seán Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babiš]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are "a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state."<ref name="Cianetti"/>

In a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, [[Shawn Rosenberg]] argues that right-wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that "democracy is likely to devour itself."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right-Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=1 January 2019|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>

===Economic inequality and social discontent===
Many [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James A. Robinson]], have investigated the effect of income inequality on the democratic breakdown.<ref name=":2" /> Studies of democratic collapse show that economic inequality is significantly higher in countries that eventually move towards a more authoritarian model.<ref name=":4" /> Hungary is an example of a country where a large group of unemployed, low-educated people were dissatisfied with the high levels of inequality, especially after the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]. [[Viktor Orbán]] used this dissatisfaction of a relatively large segment of the population to his advantage, winning popular support by using national-populist rhetoric.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greskovitz|first=Béla|date=2015|title=The Hollowing and Backsliding of Democracy in East-Central Europe|journal=Global Policy|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28–37|doi=10.1111/1758-5899.12225}}</ref>

=== Personalism ===
A 2019 study found that personalism had an adverse impact on democracy in Latin America: "presidents who dominate their own weakly organized parties are more likely to seek to concentrate power, undermine horizontal accountability, and trample the rule of law than presidents who preside over parties that have an independent leadership and an institutionalized bureaucracy."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rhodes-Purdy|first1=Matthew|last2=Madrid|first2=Raúl L.|date=27 November 2019|title=The perils of personalism|journal=Democratization|volume=0|issue=2|pages=321–339|doi=10.1080/13510347.2019.1696310|s2cid=212974380|issn=1351-0347}}</ref>

===Other===
The 2019 Annual Democracy Report of the V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]] identified three challenges confronting global democracy: (1) "Government manipulation of media, civil society, rule of law, and elections"; (2) rising "toxic polarization," including "the division of society into distrustful, antagonistic camps"; diminishing "respect for opponents, factual reasoning, and engagement with society" among political elites; and increasing use of [[hate speech]] by political leaders; and (3) foreign disinformation campaigns, primarily digital, and mostly affecting Taiwan, the United States, and former [[Soviet bloc]] nations such as [[Latvia]].<ref name=2019VDem>{{Cite report|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges: V-Dem Annual Democracy Report 2019|publisher=V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]]|date=May 2019}}</ref>

According to [[Suzanne Mettler]] and [[Robert C.

A 2020 study, which used [[World Values Survey]] data, found that cultural conservatism was the ideological group most open to authoritarian governance within Western democracies.

== Prevalence and trends==
A study by the Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) of the V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]], which contains more than eighteen-million data points relevant to democracy, measuring 350 highly specific indicators across 174 countries as of the end of 2016, found that the number of democracies in the world modestly declined from 100 in 2011 to 97 in 2017; some countries moved toward democracy, while other countries moved away from democracy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mechkova|first1=Valeriya|last2=Lührmann|first2=Anna|last3=Lindberg|first3=Staffan I.|s2cid=158736288|date=2017|title=How Much Democratic Backsliding?|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=162–169|doi=10.1353/jod.2017.0075|issn=1086-3214}}</ref> V-Dem's 2019 Annual Democracy Report found that the trend of autocratization continued, while "24 countries are now severely affected by what is established as a 'third wave of autocratization'" including "populous countries such as Brazil, India and the United States, as well as several Eastern European countries" (specifically Bulgaria and Serbia).<ref name=2019VDem/>  The report found that an increasing proportion of the world population lived in countries undergoing autocratization (2.3 billion in 2018).<ref name=2019VDem/> The report found that while the majority of countries were democracies, the number of liberal democracies declined to 39 by 2018 (down from 44 a decade earlier).<ref name=2019VDem/> The research group [[Freedom House]], in reports in 2017 and 2019, identified democratic backsliding in a variety of regions across the world.<ref name=":5">{{Cite report|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat|title=Democracy in Retreat|date=2019|publisher=Freedom House}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Esther King|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/democratic-backsliding-threatens-international-order-report/|title=Democratic backsliding threatens international order|date=31 January 2017|work=Politico}}</ref> Freedom House's 2019 ''Freedom in the World'' report, show ''Democracy in Retreat'', showed freedom of expression declining each year over the preceding 13 years, with sharper drops since 2012.<ref>{{Cite report|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2019/democracy-in-retreat |title=Democracy in Retreat: Freedom in the World 2019|year=2020|publisher=Freedom House}}</ref>

====Poland====
{{see also|2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis|Judiciary of Poland#Reforms of late 2010s and consequences}}
In the Polish case, the [[European Commission]] stated in December 2017 that in the two preceding years, the Polish legislature had adopted "13 laws affecting the entire structure of the justice system in Poland" with the "common pattern [that] the executive and legislative branches [were] systematically enabled to politically interfere in the composition, powers, administration, and functioning of the judicial branch."<ref name="CE_20171220" /> In February 2020, [[Věra Jourová]], [[Vice President of the European Commission]] for Values and Transparency, described the disciplining of judges in Poland as "no longer a targeted intervention against individual black sheep, similar to other EU member states, but a case of carpet bombing. ... This is no reform, it's destruction."<ref name="ThomReut_PL_carpet_bombing" /> In late September 2020, 38 European and other law professors called on the [[President of the European Commission]] to take action in Poland, stating, "Polish authorities continue to openly abuse, harass and intimidate judges and prosecutors who are seeking to defend the rule of law. In addition, Polish authorities continue to openly defy the authority of the [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] by refusing to follow its judgments. ... judges who are attempting to apply EU law are being threatened and punished while those who flaunt violations of EU law are being rewarded. ... The rule of law in Poland is not merely being attacked. It is being destroyed in plain sight."<ref name="RuleOfLawPl_OpenLetter_Leyer" />

The 2019 annual democracy report of the V-Dem Institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]] found that the U.S. under Trump was among the world's liberal democracies experiencing "democratic erosion" (but not full-scale "democratic breakdown"). The report cited an increase in "polarization of society and disrespect in public deliberations" as well as Trump's attacks on the media and opposition and attempts to contain the judiciary and the legislature.<ref name=2019VDem/> The report concluded, however, that "American institutions appear to be withstanding these attempts to a significant degree," noting that Democrats had [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|won a majority the House of Representatives]] in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 midterm elections]], which "seems to have reversed the trajectory of an increasingly unconstrained executive."<ref name=2019VDem/> The V-Dem Institute's 2020 report found that the U.S. had "registered a substantial decline in liberal democracy" under Trump; the report also found that "the United States of America is the only country in Western Europe and North America suffering from substantial autocratization."<ref name=VDem2020/>

According to a 2020 study in the ''American Political Science Review'', Americans value democracy but are frequently willing to prioritize partisan political gains over democracy if the two are in conflict.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=Matthew H.|last2=Svolik|first2=Milan W.|date=2020|title=Democracy in America?

==Effects of judicial independence==
A 2011 study examined the effects of [[judicial independence]] in preventing democratic backsliding. The study, which analyzed 163 nations from 1960 to 2000, concluded that established independent judiciaries are successful at preventing democracies from drifting to authoritarianism, but that states with newly formed courts "are positively associated with regime collapses in both democracies and nondemocracies."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Douglas M.
