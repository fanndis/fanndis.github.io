Disagreement exists also about the number of those injured that day. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, over 1,400 Palestinians suffered injuries.

During the week of 30 March 2018, two Palestinians were killed in two different incidents. In the first, a Palestinian member of the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP) was shot by Israeli forces after he breached the fence and entered Israel. The IDF published a video from an observation camera, showing the man hitting the fence with what seems to be a metal pipe when four other people stand behind him. He then breaches the fence and enters along with another man, which is when warning shots were probably fired. The video cuts before the man was shot and it is unclear in what circumstances was he shot and killed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-say-man-shot-dead-by-israeli-troops-on-gaza-border|title=IDF shoots, kills Palestinian who broke through Gaza fence|date=3 April 2018|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=10 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409121853/https://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinians-say-man-shot-dead-by-israeli-troops-on-gaza-border/|archive-date=9 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In another incident, an Israeli aircraft attacked an allegedly armed Palestinian who approached the fence.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Khoury|first1=Jack|last2=Ben Zikri|first2=Almog|title=Israeli Aircraft Attacks Armed Palestinian Near Gaza Border|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-jet-fighter-attacks-armed-palestinian-near-gaza-border-1.5977033|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=5 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521022552/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-jet-fighter-attacks-armed-palestinian-near-gaza-border-1.5977033|archive-date=21 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The IDF published a video from an observance camera, showing the man walking slowly towards the fence, holding what appears to be an assault rifle.

===Characterization of the injuries caused by Israeli fire===
The Commissioner General of the [[UNRWA|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA) stated that the ammunition used by Israel caused severe internal damage to internal organs, muscle tissue and bones. A Palestinian doctor interviewed by CNN stated that about a half of the wounded people would never walk normally again. The head of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Shifa Hospital in Gaza wrote a letter to ''[[The BMJ|The British Medical Journal]]'' stating that "from the appearance of the wounds there appears to have been systematic use by [IDF] snipers of ammunition with an expanding 'butterfly' effect.", and stated that since the surgical procedures and rehabilitation facilities are not available in Gaza due to 2014 conflict and the blockade of Gaza, "mass lifelong disability is now the prospect facing Gazan citizens, largely young." The Israeli military stated that they only used normal sniper ammunition, and fired at the feet and legs to minimize civilian casualties.<ref name="CNNCrippledGaza">{{Cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/08/middleeast/gaza-wounded-israel-intl/index.html |title=Hundreds in months-long Gaza protests crippled for life by Israeli gunfire |last=Wedeman |first=Ben |date=2018-06-08 |website=CNN |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611174011/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/08/middleeast/gaza-wounded-israel-intl/index.html |archive-date=11 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="BMJLetterGazaPlastic">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6644/rr-0 |title=The Gaza shootings: a massive orthopaedic crisis and mass disability |last=Abu-Shaban |first=Nafiz |date=2018-06-06 |website=The British Medical Journal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614030844/https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6644/rr-0 |archive-date=14 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

According to [[Amnesty International]], who interviewed military experts and a forensic pathologist, "many of the wounds observed by doctors in Gaza are consistent with those caused by high-velocity Israeli-manufactured Tavor rifles using 5.56mm military ammunition. Other wounds bear the hallmarks of US-manufactured M24 Remington sniper rifles shooting 7.62mm hunting ammunition, which expand and mushroom inside the body. The nature of these injuries shows that Israeli soldiers are using high-velocity military weapons designed to cause maximum harm to Palestinian protesters who do not pose an imminent threat to them."<ref name="AIOctoberReport" />
