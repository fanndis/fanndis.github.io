"'''Independent Women Part I'''" is a song by American [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]]. It was written and produced by production duo [[Poke & Tone]], consisting of [[Trackmasters|Samuel Barnes]] and [[Trackmasters|Jean-Claude Olivier]], along with [[Cory Rooney]], and band member [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. The song first appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 [[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (2000), serving as its lead single, and was later included on the group's third studio album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001). "Independent Women" was Destiny's Child's first single to feature vocals from band member [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] who had joined the band in January 2000.

Released as the soundtrack's [[lead single]] in September 2000, the song held the number one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for eleven consecutive weeks from November 2000 to February 2001. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' likened the song's release strategy to being influenced by [[Janet Jackson]]'s "[[Doesn't Really Matter]]", saying the group "began planting the seeds for the upcoming release" in a similar vein.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA146|title=Between the Bullets|work=Billboard|publisher=Mayfield, Geoff|date=December 8, 2001|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref> The song appeared in ''[[The Proud Family]]'' episode "Don't Leave Home Without It". Most recently in 2014, a [[Target Corporation|Target]] back to school commercial featured this song performed with classroom instruments.

==Chart performance==
"Independent Women" was a chart success in the United States. The single reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single held the top position in the following week, which was seen as buoyed by the strong box office performance of the film and the [[heavy rotation]] it received.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=875928|title='Women' Rules The Hot 100 Again|date=2000-11-16|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-10-10}} {{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The song had a massive radio airplay, staying almost ten weeks at the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay]],<ref name="JeckellStays">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80803/independent-stays-on-top |title='Independent' Stays On Top |last=Jeckell |first=Barry |date=2001-01-04 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=2008-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208222143/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/80803/independent-stays-on-top |archivedate=February 8, 2013 }}</ref> significantly contributing to the performance of the single on the main chart.

"Independent Women" also topped the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] chart for three weeks, becoming Destiny's Child fourth number one single on this chart.<ref name="JeckellStays" /> 
"Independent Women" had entered the Billboard Hot 100 top 40 at number 33 on October 14, three weeks after its release. It climbed steadily, week on week, before overtaking their previous hit "Jumpin' Jumpin'" and reaching number one on November 18. The song's 11-week run at the top lasted through to February 3, 2001, making it the first #1 Billboard Hot 100 song of the new millennium. It managed to fend off strong challenges by [[Mýa]] ("[[Case of the Ex]]") and [[Dream]] ("[[He Loves U Not]]") before making way for [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]]'s "[[It Wasn't Me]]". "Independent Women" dropped to no.2 and culminated its top 40 run on March 31 after 28 weeks ( as their follow-up "Survivor" was ascending to no.2).

"Independent Women" debuted at number one in the United Kingdom in the week of December 2, 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=875889|title='Women' Puts Destiny's Child Atop U.K. Chart|date=2000-11-27|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-10-10}} {{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_singles_song.php?id=883 |title=Destiny's Child – Independent Women Part 1 |publisher=The Official UK Charts Company |accessdate=2008-10-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913062646/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_singles_song.php?id=883 |archivedate=September 13, 2009 }}</ref> The [[British Phonographic Industry]] has certified the single platinum for sales of over 600,000 physical singles. The song spent just one week at the top (deposed by [[S Club 7]]´s "[[Never Had a Dream Come True (S Club 7 song)|Never Had a Dream Come True]]"). It eventually managed 11 weeks in the UK top 40 - including 7 in the top 10 - before dropping out on February 17, 2001. The song was the 25th best selling of 2000 in the UK.

It also reached the number one position in Canada and New Zealand. It is also Destiny's Child's most successful single to date.

==Music video==
The music video was shot in Los Angeles from August 27 to September 1, 2000 and directed by [[Francis Lawrence]]. Destiny's Child take part of a futuristic ''Charlie's Angels'' boot camp and sit in a classroom to watch footage of ''Charlie's Angels''. They learn from them and try out the challenges in several steps: [[agility]] (dancing), [[altitude]] ([[Parachuting|skydiving]]), [[combat]] ([[martial arts]] fighting) and speed ([[Motorcycle|motorbike]]). At the end, the women are greeted by the ever-mysterious "Charlie". The band also performs in a huge disco set in between the scenes.

The music video premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Making the Video]]'' and is featured on the [[DualDisc]] edition of the album ''[[Number 1's (Destiny's Child album)|#1's]]'' and on the DVD release of ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]''.
