'''''New Girl''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] created by [[Elizabeth Meriwether]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] that originally aired between 2011 and 2018. The series revolves around a quirky teacher, Jess ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), after she moves into a [[Los Angeles]] loft with three men, Nick ([[Jake Johnson]]), Schmidt ([[Max Greenfield]]), and Winston ([[Lamorne Morris]]); Jess' best friend Cece ([[Hannah Simone]]) is also part of the series. The show combines comedy and drama elements as the characters, who are in their early thirties, deal with maturing relationships and career choices. ''New Girl'' is a joint production between Elizabeth Meriwether Pictures and [[20th Century Fox Television]] and syndicated by [[20th Television]].

Produced in Los Angeles as a [[single-camera]] comedy, ''New Girl'' is an ensemble show aimed at a general audience. Most episodes are anchored around Jess, who, according to series creator Meriwether, would have played a side character on other shows. The show's first marketing push was on Zooey Deschanel and the promotional tagline "Simply Adorkable". The producers rejected early criticism of Jess's girlishness, insisting that Jess was not meant to be emblematic of all women. Instead, they aimed to portray realistic, emotionally driven characters and to approach the show from that angle rather than simply firing off punchlines.

''New Girl'' has received acclaim from critics and was named one of the best new comedies of the 2011 fall season. The pilot episode drew 10.28 million U.S. viewers and a 4.8 adults 18–49 demo rating, making it the highest-rated fall debut for a Fox scripted show since 2001. Particular praise has been given to the performances of Deschanel, Greenfield, Simone, Johnson and Morris. Max Greenfield was considered the show's breakout star in season 1, before critics named Jake Johnson the breakout star of season 2. The show has been nominated for several awards, including five [[Golden Globe Award]]s and five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.

On May 14, 2017, Fox renewed the series for a seventh and final season consisting of eight episodes, which premiered on April 10, 2018. The show has garnered an increased cult following since its inclusion on Netflix, becoming one of the most popular shows on the platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/girl-renewed-final-season-7-165944833.html|title=New Girl Renewed for (Final) Season 7 — How Many Episodes Are We Getting?|author=|date=|website=yahoo.com|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/04/new-girl-final-season-7-premiere-date-series-finale-announced-fox/|title=New Girl Season 7 Premiere Date Set|publisher=TVLine|first=Ryan|last=Schwartz|date=January 4, 2018|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/new-girl-season-7-spoilers-time-jump-features-schmidt-stay-home-dad-1563500|title='New Girl' season 7 spoilers: Time jump features Schmidt as stay-at-home dad|date=January 8, 2018|publisher=}}</ref> The series finale aired on May 15, 2018.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of New Girl episodes}}
Jessica "Jess" Day ([[Zooey Deschanel]]) is a bubbly and quirky teacher in her early 30s who comes home to find her boyfriend, Spencer, with another woman and leaves him immediately to look for elsewhere to live. After answering an ad for a new roommate on Craigslist, she finds herself moving into a loft in Los Angeles with three men around her own age: Nick, Schmidt, and Coach. After the [[Pilot (New Girl)|pilot episode]], Winston, a former roommate and Nick's childhood friend, replaces Coach, who had vacated the apartment to live with his girlfriend. Cece, Jess's childhood best friend and a successful fashion model, frequently visits Jess and the guys.

The series follows the group's interactions with each other and their romantic relationships. Midway through season 1, Schmidt and Cece get involved in a mostly sexual relationship but break up at the end of the season. In Season 2, Jess is laid off from her teaching job; she and the others get involved in mostly temporary relationships, although Cece enters an arranged marriage engagement to [[List of New Girl characters#Shivrang|Shivrang]] ([[Satya Bhabha]]) that is broken up at their wedding in the season 2 finale. Jess and Nick become romantically attracted to each other, making their relationship official at the end of season 2, and it lasts through most of season 3. Coach returns to the loft in season 3 after revealing that he had broken up with his girlfriend and stays through season 4 where he moves out to be with another girl. After bouncing around several random jobs, Winston works to become a police officer with [[Los Angeles Police Department|the LAPD]], and falls in love with his partner [[#Aly Nelson|Aly]]. At the end of season 4, Schmidt proposes to Cece, and they marry at the end of season 5. Also, in season 5, while Jess is on jury duty, the group brings in temporary roommate [[List of New Girl characters#Reagan Lucas|Reagan Lucas]], whom Nick becomes interested in. In season 6, Schmidt and Cece buy a house together that they have to remodel, living with the gang in the meantime. Season 7 advances the storyline three years later where Schmidt and Cece have a three-year-old daughter named Ruth, Winston and Aly are expecting their first baby, and Nick proposes to Jess.

==Production==

===Conception===
[[File:Flickr - Genevieve719 - Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, Elizabeth Meriwether, Zooey Deschanel (cropped).jpg|thumb|Executive producers [[Dave Finkel]], [[Brett Baer]], [[Elizabeth Meriwether]] and producer/actress Zooey Deschanel at Paley Fest 2012.]]
[[20th Century Fox Television]] first approached playwright [[Elizabeth Meriwether]] in 2008 to develop a pilot that was eventually shelved. After Meriwether's success with the 2011 romantic comedy film '' [[No Strings Attached (2011 film)|No Strings Attached]]'', 20th Century Fox approached her once more, and she pitched an idea for a TV sitcom about an "offbeat girl moving in with three single guys",<ref name=wga_em /> inspired by her experience of "bouncing from [[Craigslist]] sublet to Craigslist sublet, for four years in L.A." when she was in her twenties.<ref name=collider_nginterview /> This show was initially called ''Chicks and Dicks'', and two of the characters were already similar to the final characters of Jess and Schmidt.<ref name=antilena /> The initial idea was a ''[[Will & Grace]]''-style comedy inspired by Meriwether's close friendship with a guy after their exes started dating each other.<ref name=ew_attitude /> The FOX network liked the script and pursued [[Zooey Deschanel]] for the role of Jess,<ref name=antilena /> to whose story Meriwether felt most connected.<ref name=avclub_pain /> As the script developed, the plot moved on from being about the sexual endeavors of the roommates and became more socially oriented, so the title was changed to ''New Girl''.<ref name=3news_chicksdicks />

As Fox greenlit the show in 2011<ref name=antilena /> and ordered an initial 13 episodes,<ref name=playboy_jj /> Meriwether approached [[Jake Kasdan]], whom she admired for his work on ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' blending comedy and emotion, to shoot the pilot and subsequent episodes.<ref name=antilena /><ref name=nytimes_emanswers /> ''[[30 Rock]]''{{'s}} [[Brett Baer]] and [[Dave Finkel]] became co-showrunners, although Meriwether is still regarded as the voice behind ''New Girl''.<ref name=antilena /> According to ''[[The New Republic]]'', Kasdan "helped develop the feel of the show, which is lit more darkly and cinematically than the average sitcom",<ref name=antilena /> and Meriwether found the show working best "when you're laughing, but you're a little sad about it".<ref name=nytimes_emanswers /> The show attempts to combine "comedy and drama as the five characters explore the difficulties of the decade between 30 and 40, which is when many people take their biggest steps toward maturity" in regards to relationships and careers,<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /> which, unlike ''[[Friends]]'', is giving the show a "built-in biological clock".<ref name=avclub_s2part1 /> Kasdan said that "Their lives are moving forward, [but] they're still trying to hang on to some kind of crazy youth" although he does not "want them ever to seem pathetic."<ref name=antilena />

Screenwriters Stephanie Counts and Shari Gold filed an 87-page lawsuit in January 2014, claiming that ''New Girl'' was based on their 2006 script for a proposed television series.<ref name=thr_stealing /> There were a number of similarities, including the number of roommates, similar backgrounds, appearance, and ethnicity.  Additionally, Jess's long term partner in the New Girl pilot had the same name (Spencer) and they broke up for similar reasons (partner's infidelity).  Fox and talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment LLC responded in April 2014 that in their view, the two works were not substantially similar and that any other similarities stemmed from non-protectable ideas, or ''scenes a faire''. Thus, they pleaded that the judge dismiss the case.<ref name=thr_judge />  The case was dismissed with leave to amend in 2014.  An amended complaint was filed in 2014 and decided by summary judgment against Counts and Gold on December 30, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2671316-NewGirl-Ruling.html|title=NewGirl-Ruling|first=Eriq Gardner (The Hollywood|last=Reporter)|date=|website=www.documentcloud.org|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref>  In March 2016, Counts and Gold were ordered to pay approximately $800,000 in attorney's fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/769849/fox-william-morris-win-fees-after-beating-new-girl-ip-suit|title=Fox, William Morris Win Fees After Beating 'New Girl' IP Suit - Law360|author=|date=|website=www.law360.com|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>

===Casting===
Movie actress and singer-songwriter Zooey Deschanel was in the process of developing an HBO show when she read the ''New Girl'' pilot script and responded to the material.<ref name=collider_nginterview /><ref name=ign_brought /> The character of Jess was not specifically written for Deschanel, but the producers found it a great match and needed little fine-tuning.<ref name=adorableness /> With the support from Fox, Meriwether wanted to make Jess a unique, interesting and funny female character<ref name=adorableness /><ref name=twp_kazoos /> that would have been the side character on other shows.<ref name=writersroom /> Deschanel became a producer on the show and helped build the character,<ref name=ew_attitude /> requesting to not play the classic wife character who would be ignored by the guys she tries to keep out of trouble.<ref name=avclub_s2part3 /> Meriwether's goal was to write about herself from an honest perspective,<ref name=twp_kazoos /> with Jess mirroring her at the start and later Deschanel until Jess turned into a "hybrid of me and Zooey, the writers, and the editor".<ref name=dailybeast_more /> Deschanel described Jess as a part of her, especially in regards to "the sort of enthusiasm and optimism" of her youth. She does not shy away from playing embarrassing scenes or being unattractive,<ref name=ign_brought /> and Kasdan said that "This show advocates for the attractive dork."<ref name=adorableness /> Although Meriwether had always imagined the show as an ensemble show, Fox would later focus its first marketing push on Zooey Deschanel<ref name=postmortems1 /> and gave the show the promotional tagline "Simply Adorkable."<ref name=ew_attitude />

[[File:Flickr - Genevieve719 - Zooey Deschanel, Jake Johnson, Max Greenfield, Lamorne Morris, Hannah Simone (cropped).jpg|thumb|The show's main cast: Zooey Deschanel (Jess), [[Jake Johnson]] (Nick), [[Max Greenfield]] (Schmidt), [[Lamorne Morris]] (Winston), and [[Hannah Simone]] (Cece) at Paley Fest 2012.]]

With Kasdan's advice to cast good actors and write for them instead of shoehorning them into the other roles, Meriwether was prepared to deviate from her pitched characters during casting.<ref name=postmortems1 /> Basing Nick Miller on a friend also surnamed Miller,<ref name=avclub_s2part2 /> she originally imagined Nick as the smartest one of the group who doesn't need to say that<ref name=sirius /> and thought of him as "the everyman one, who's stepping away and commenting on what all the crazy people are doing around him."<ref name=postmortems1 /> She sent the ''New Girl'' pilot script to movie actor [[Jake Johnson]], with whom she had enjoyed working on ''No Strings Attached''.<ref name=ac_101 /> As he had never auditioned for a TV pilot, she guided him through the audition process.<ref name=ew_podcast /> Casting was done mainly through chemistry tests, and Johnson auditioned with [[Max Greenfield]], who impressed the producers in his first audition as Schmidt.<ref name=ac_101 /> The actors auditioning for Schmidt were more varied in appearance than those auditioning for Nick,<ref name=ew_podcast /> and Johnson and Greenfield were initially worried that they looked too much alike.<ref name=yt_seacrest /> Johnson got the role of Nick after he agreed to lose 15 pounds at the network's request;<ref name=advocate_newguy /> Greenfield learned the same day that he was cast.<ref name=yt_seacrest />

Casting the role of the "Coach" character took longer.<ref name=ac_101 /> Meriwether originally envisioned Coach as "a fat Jewish guy, like a manchild" and later as "this dumb jock [with] crazy rage problems".<ref name=postmortems1 /> David Neher (who would play Schmidt's so-called "fremesis," Benjamin, in two episodes) was among the 400 actors auditioning for Coach before the producers settled on [[Damon Wayans Jr.]]<ref name=ac_101 /> Wayans was expecting his show, the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'', to be cancelled. When that show was renewed for a second season, Wayans' spot was replaced with Lamorne Morris,<ref name=tvguide_newman /> who had also read for Coach but had been unavailable for filming the pilot.<ref name=adorableness /> Meriwether estimated that about 80 percent of the pilot would have needed to be re-shot in order to remove Wayans from the episode, since he was in one of the leading roles of the show.<ref name=tvguide_newman /> As the producers also liked reflecting the frequent apartment changes in young people's lives,<ref name=adorableness /> Meriwether, 20th Century Fox and the studio decided to keep the characters and the plot of the pilot episode as they were.<ref name=tvguide_newman /> Morris joined the show in the second episode of the series when the producers had already broken seven episodes without knowing what the actor was going to be able to do.<ref name=postmortems1 /> Wayans returned to ''New Girl'' in season 3 for a season-long arc after ''Happy Endings'' had been cancelled, and was officially added as a regular for season 4.<ref name=thr_uppedregular />

===Writing===

The ''New Girl'' production offices are on the Fox lot in Los Angeles.<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /> ''New Girl'' had 11 writers during its first season<ref name=wga_em /> and 15 during the second season{{--}}including [[Elizabeth Meriwether]], [[Brett Baer]], and [[Dave Finkel]].<ref name=avclub_s2part3 /> Stories are developed in a collaborative effort<ref name=wga_em /> and are aimed at viewers of both sexes.<ref name=salon_adorkable /> The first season had no planned story arcs, but focused on setting up the characters, while the second season was to show different sides of the characters.<ref name=wga_em /><ref name=tvguide_offthegrid /> Overarching storylines usually culminate at a season's end;<ref name=hitfix_outline /> the actors are generally not told the ending.<ref name=ew_bachelorette /> Creator/showrunner Meriwether said the writers did not "have a lot of plans. I think we really just to try to go where the show wants to go."<ref name=postmortems1 /> The writers challenge themselves to create new stories and to change the show's dynamics to keep things fresh,<ref name=bww_creatorwriter /> while aiming to be "as emotionally real as possible" with "Every story having to feel like it was grounded in some emotional arc as opposed to going from the joke into the story."<ref name=wga_em /> As the show's jokes rely on the actors' performance instead of perfectly constructed punch lines, Meriwether looks for the actors' strengths before writing.<ref name=bww_creatorwriter /> The A story generally revolves around Jess and has an emotional core.<ref name=avclub_s2part4 /> Still, Meriwether sees the show as an ensemble about friendship with "everybody having their own stories and people being interested in all of the characters."<ref name=dailybeast_more />

Each ''New Girl'' episode starts out as a pitch page, goes through stages of an outline and a final draft before being filmed and edited,<ref name=antilena /> a process which may take weeks.<ref name=hitfix_outline /> Each stage is approved by Meriwether and her co-showrunners, by the production company Chernin, the Fox studio and the Fox network.<ref name=antilena /> One group of writers works on alternate punchlines ("alts"), while another group reworks a draft until they find the funniest and most emotionally resonant version. All characters are tried to be tied into the story, and determining their motivation is the major goal so that people will laugh. Before taking the script to the table read with the whole cast on Tuesday, the main writers of an episode continue working on the draft over the weekend and the executive producers polish it.<ref name=hitfix_outline /> During the first season, Meriwether usually made a final pass at the draft alone because of her film and theater background.<ref name=wga_em /> The actors' performance influences new story ideas;<ref name=wga_em /> the actors may also hand in story ideas.<ref name=avclub_s2part2 />

As a [[single-camera]] comedy, ''New Girl'' is neither performed in front of a studio audience nor has a [[laugh track]].<ref name=nytimes_emanswers /> Some scenes are cross-covered (i.e. are filmed with a shooting camera on each person at the same time), to allow for better improvisations.<ref name=salon_tease /> Handheld cameras are avoided for a more filmic look.<ref name=avclub_s2part4 />

The actors first receive the script in form of a table draft and film the episode the next Monday, by which time the story may have changed drastically.<ref name=sirius /> The script keeps evolving during shooting.<ref name=buddytv_paleyfest /> The actors first perform scenes as written, then act out the alts or improvise,<ref name=collider_nginterview /> to later allow the producers and editors to choose the gags that ultimately work best.<ref name=hitfix_outline /> Morris estimated that 20 percent of each episode are improv.<ref name=suntimes_lamorne /> Episodes are generally shot over five days,<ref name=avclub_s2part4 /> which may increase to several weeks if weather conditions delay filming outdoor scenes.<ref name=hitfix_outline /> The scenes are put together in the editing room until they achieve the emotional and comedic tone the producers are looking for.<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /> The first cut of generally 27 minutes has to be cut down to the air version's 21 minutes and 35 seconds, which may air as little as a few days later. Only upon completion do the producers know what version ends up in the episode.<ref name=hitfix_outline />

==={{anchor|True American|''True American''}} ''True American''===
''True American'' is a fictional, convoluted drinking game that the ''New Girl'' characters first played in the season 1 episode "[[Normal (New Girl)|Normal]]". In September 2012, producer Brett Baer felt the concept of the game "deserves its own episode at some point", but the writers were reluctant to repeat the established rules and rather wanted to make it fresh.<ref name=hitfix_trueamerican /> A version for the [[2012 U.S. Presidential Election]] was planned but never made.<ref name=avclub_pain /> The game's eventual second appearance in season 2's "Cooler" was played with the strip-poker version "Clinton Rules", but the exact rules remain unclear even to the actors.<ref name=thr_brooklyn /> ''True American'' with updated rules and the resulting hangover were featured in season 3's "Mars Landing". The writers started to do new ''True American'' episodes once each year.<ref name=thr_prince />

After "Normal" aired, internet sources began to summarize the rules for ''True American'', which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and [[Candy Land]] where [[Hot Lava (game)|the floor is lava]]; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents.<ref name=hitfix_trueamerican /><ref name=buzzfeed_trueamerican /> The idea of ''True American'' came from a ''New Girl'' writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting "[[John F. Kennedy|JFK]]! [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]]!" and walking on chairs. As the cast did not understand the game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to "have fun, dig in, jump in" and play it as if "they'd been playing this thing for years and years and years." The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming ''True American'' more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.<ref name=avclub_s2part3 /><ref name=hitfix_trueamerican />

[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] subsequently released a set of official rules for the game, which can be summarized "There are no real rules".<ref name=zap2it_trueamerican /> When the promotional ''New Girl True American Bus Tour'' went through 19 American cities in 2012,<ref name=usatoday_tour /> the writers stated lack of time rather than not knowing the rules for not writing down the rules.<ref name=hitfix_trueamerican /> Liz Meriwether said the game would not be easier to comprehend in later appearances, as the writers' goal is to actually make it harder to understand. She agreed with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' that "It's much funnier if the rules make no sense."<ref name=avclub_pain /> As more people attempted playing the game in real life,<ref name=hitfix_trueamerican /> Baer pointed out that most people were "getting too drunk too fast" and did not focus enough on strategy, so the writers were thinking of establishing more rules for guidance.<ref name=hitfix_trueamerican /> Meriwether advised to "just trust your hearts, get really wasted, and look inside yourselves. I think you'll find the rules were there all along."<ref name=nytimes_emanswers />

===Relationships===
Creator Elizabeth Meriwether sees Nick, Schmidt and Winston "on the weirder side of things".<ref name=thr_triangle /> The producers stated learning more about the characters by seeing the actors' work and that "We probably rely on them more than we should" to define the characters.<ref name=collider_nginterview /> For example, the producers found more variety in Nick's character in season 1 and enjoyed Johnson's improvisations, so they relayed Coach's attributed rage issues to Nick.<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /><ref name=postmortems1 /> Nick is a childhood friend of Winston, has been best friends with Schmidt since his college days and becomes close to Jess, so his character connects the most with the other loftmates and is often part of their stories.<ref name=salon_tease /> Jake Johnson (Nick) noted the contrast to the original plans for his character, as season 1 turned Nick into "an idiot, he's not keeping anyone together",<ref name=hwr_pleas /> and that he did not fully understand his character in season 1, partly because the character might not have figured himself out at the age of 30.<ref name=metro_tide /> Johnson felt that initially it seemed like Nick hated Schmidt for being a douchebag, but the show later teamed them up like [[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]], showing their genuine friendship and simultaneous idiocy as they get into trouble.<ref name=ew_detectives /> According to Johnson, he and Max Greenfield (Schmidt) "couldn't be more different [as actors] and it's very much like Nick and Schmidt, but we both really get a kick out of the other guy" on set.<ref name=dailybeast_success />

With Winston only being added late to the show, the writers developed the Nick–Winston dynamic in season 1 and sought to figure out Winston's relationship with the other loftmates in season 2.<ref name=postmortems1 /> The writers noticed late during the first season that Morris seemed better suited to play a smart character and act as the loft's voice of reason,<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /><ref name=postmortems1 /> although Meriwether found that when Winston "finally does blow up, he's crazier than all of them"<ref name=postmortems1 /> and that he works better "in these kind of crazy, comedic runners, small pieces of the episode"<ref name=salon_adorkable /> that contrast the relationship dramas of the other main characters.<ref name=hitfix_choice /> The Winston–Schmidt friendship was developed significantly in the second half of season 2 when the story focus moved to Nick and Jess.<ref name=avclub_s2part3 /> The Nick–Jess relationship affects the three guys' friendship as Nick starts being more considerate of Jess' feelings regarding shenanigans.<ref name=tvguide_readytodate /> Damon Wayans Jr. was planned to reprise his role as Coach in at least four episodes in the third season,<ref name=huffpost_wayans /> according to Meriwether "at a time when the roommates are at odds with each other" and "The guys are all fighting for his friendship."<ref name=tvguide_megabuzz /> The three guys will get intimidated by Coach's return, as he has "this alpha male aggression" and is "that macho, tough-talking guy that they all think is so cool".<ref name=thr_triangle />

With Meriwether's openness regarding straight and gay communities,<ref name=advocate_newguy /> ''New Girl'' also plays with the guys' sexual orientation for humor. One of Winston's recurring alternate persona is Nick's gay lover "Theodore K. Mullins", which started out as an improv of Lamorne Morris (Winston).<ref name=postmortems1 /> Johnson thought that Nick and Schmidt had "a pretty funny bromance" with "their own little weird will-they-won't-they".<ref name=salon_tease /> Greenfield improvised kissing Nick a lot in season 1 until the writers (“finally” according to Greenfield) started putting Schmidt–Nick kisses into the script,<ref name=yt_seacrest /> so that they shared more kisses than Nick and Jess did in the first two seasons.<ref name=advocate_newguy /> The season 2 episode "Models" came about when Meriwether thought the show "needed a love story between Nick and Schmidt or something. We wanted to tell it like a classic rom-com story about Nick and Schmidt and their love of each other".<ref name=avclub_s2part1 />

==Reception==

===Critical reviews===
On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], season one holds an approval rating of 84% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.83/10.
The site's critical consensus reads, "Zooey Deschanel's offbeat style gets a worthy showcase in ''New Girl'', and while it can get awfully cutesy at times, the show benefits from witty writing and a strong supporting cast."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/new_girl/s01|title=''New Girl'': Season 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the season a score of 66 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/new-girl|title=''New Girl'' Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref>

In June 2011, ''New Girl'' was one of eight honorees in the "most exciting new series" category at the [[1st Critics' Choice Television Awards]], voted by journalists who had seen the [[television pilot|pilots]].<ref name="cca" /> Robert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' considered ''New Girl'' "fall's most promising new series" and praised how Deschanel and Meriwether "have shaped Jess into something we haven't quite seen before – a woman who is sweet yet crass, innocent yet sexy, beautiful yet clumsy, and brash yet irresistibly adorable." However, he noted how "Some people will be resistant to Deschanel's doe-eyed charm; others have a congenital need to insult anyone who most everyone else is praising, particularly if doing so gets them attention."<ref name=usatoday_popular /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'s}} Tim Goodman saw the show as a "mostly romantic comedy", and although Jess' adorability "might seem like a thin premise, [...] Meriwether manages to make the situations funny and lets Deschanel channel her charm – a winning combination."<ref name=thr_pilotreview /> [[David Wiegand]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' would rather see the show tone down. He felt "the show's fundamental setup isn't all that inspired, but it could work with smarter writing and better direction, especially with regard to Deschanel", who, in his opinion, overplayed Jess' weird habits "to the point of overkill within the first 10 minutes of the show".<ref name=sfgate_pilotreview/>

[[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] considered ''New Girl'' "the best new comedy of the fall season, and the only new show I genuinely enjoyed from start to finish" because it was so well developed from the start. He praised Deschanel's "wonderful comic performance" and said that while the supporting actors "all bounce nicely off of Deschanel", the scenes without Deschanel around them fell flat for him.<ref name=hitfix_showcase /> Writing for the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', David Hinckley lauded how none of the characters "settle in as the stereotypes they could easily become", and presumed that all of them would evolve and get smarter as the show progresses.<ref name=nydailynews_goodhearted /> Lori Rack of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' praised the actors' comedic timing and playing off each other. Despite the guys sounding "like nightmares" on paper, "they have endearing, vulnerable cores that make them likable, and occasionally, lovable. [...] ''New Girl'' didn't give me as many laugh-out-loud moments as some comedies", but instead made her "feel warm and fuzzy".<ref name=suntimes_goofy /> Rob Owen of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' said the show's pilot was "more charming than hilarious" and "cuter than it is funny, but when it does conjure laughs, its style of humor is reminiscent of ABC's ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]''".<ref name=pg_formula />

Critics questioned the portrayal of Jess' girlishness early on.<ref name=antilena /> Phillip Maciak of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' initially expected ''New Girl'' as one of 2011's many new female-centric shows to "be an exemplar of this new age of empowerment, but found instead that "''New Girl'' presents us with a narratively scattered, male fantasy of a show about a cooing woman-child in a polka-dot skirt who literally can't say the word 'penis' without giggling."<ref name=slantmagazine_season1 /> Meriwether stated it was not the show's goal to create a symbol and, pointing to gender double standards, rejected opinions that Jess was emblematic of all women.<ref name=dailybeast_more /> She "was really just writing about myself, and so my main goal is just to give Zooey, really fun, interesting things to do every week, and then just be really honest with myself about the character and present an interesting, funny female character on television."<ref name=twp_kazoos /> Critics felt the first-season episode "Jess & Julia" was a meta reference to Jess' girliness and the initial "adorkable" ad campaign for ''New Girl'',<ref name=avclub_pain /><ref name=vulture_defense /> but Meriwether stated the episode was more a response to a controversial New York magazine cover story about Deschanel's personality and her views on women's issues.<ref name=avclub_pain />

Summarizing the first two seasons, Jon Caramanica of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "Jess fit into no known mode, sitcom or interpersonal. For much of the [first] season, she remained a cipher. Her interactions with the rest of the crew were unfailingly odd—there was no common language, and that was the root of the show's comedic alchemy, or lack thereof. By the end of that first season, Jess' sharp angles had been sandpapered down a bit, but the show's second season [...] represented a change in approach that has rescued ''New Girl'' from its whimsy and turned it into one of the most reliable and reliably affecting sitcoms on television. At root, these changes sprang from the recognition that Ms. Deschanel's charms lie not in her quirk but in her empathy and warmth."<ref name=nytimes_whimsy /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Cynthia Littleton summarized that "The show has drawn praise from critics for its deft mix of offbeat humor that captures the voice of contempo 20-somethings and laugh-out-loud moments, aided by Deschanel's flair for physical comedy."<ref name=variety_overall /> ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'s}} Maureen Ryan said ''New Girl''{{'s}} second season was "doing an ace job of mixing sharp comedic moments and goofball weirdness with excellent character-building."<ref name=huffington_bigmoment />

Many critics considered Max Greenfield the show's breakout star in season 1;<ref name=ew_attitude /><ref name=huffington_s2scoop /><ref name=dailybeast_more /><ref name=salon_manhood /> ''The A.V. Club'' even named Greenfield's Schmidt "the year's breakout TV character" as a "douchebag with a heart of gold".<ref name=avclub_pain /> ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' described Schmidt as "a sort of self-created alpha male and a collection of beta male qualities [... which] are performed with such conviction they congeal into a sort of deranged machismo, one slathered in sandalwood-scented lotion. As part of this transition, Schmidt has gone from being a douchebag in the classic model—a guy who, in the pilot, constantly wanted to show off his pecs and scam girls, and seemed capable of doing so—to a douche of a more unique variety."<ref name=salon_manhood /> ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'s}} Maureen Ryan said how "Schmidt could have easily been 'the dumb guy', or the show could have exploited his status as an eminently mockable douche. But thanks to Max Greenfield's endearing depiction of the would-be ladykiller, there's a lot more the writers have been able to do with the character."<ref name=huffington_s2scoop /> Caramanica lamented how Winston as the lone black character "is still an outlier, though far less so than in the first season. He's a sharp foil when other characters, especially Schmidt, get too racially comfortable."<ref name=nytimes_whimsy />

On Rotten Tomatoes, season two holds an approval rating of 88% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.56/10.
The site's critical consensus reads, "''New Girl''{{'}}s terrific ensemble cast remains its most valuable asset, and the show is buoyed by a deeper, more relatable central performance from lead Zooey Deschanel in its sophomore season."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/new_girl/s02|title=''New Girl'': Season 2 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> After the teasing of the Nick–Jess relationship in the first season, critics named Jake Johnson the breakout star of season 2 as the characters' romance unfolded.<ref name=dailybeast_success /><ref name=ew_15breakout /> Saying that "Not since Ross and Rachel's tango on ''[[Friends]]'' has watching a comedy romance been so satisfying", ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said the producers "did the impossible by engaging their leads in a love story, which only strengthened the artistry of the single-cam comedy".<ref name=thr_50power /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said season 2 "erupted in fantastic and bizarre fits and starts" because of the characters' unmatched personalities, and lauded the writers for not playing up the will-they-or-won't-they dynamic. By emphasing ''how'' the characters got together, the show "made for hilarious setups [that occasionally led] to high-level Abbott and Costello slapstick. They have a modern love. [...] Together, they are fully functional. They make each other human."<ref name=nytimes_whimsy /> ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'s}} Maureen Ryan was unconcerned about getting Jess and Nick together, as because of immaturity "they're bound to keep on making a lot of amusing and painful mistakes, sometimes with each other. Those choices can be both hilarious and sad, and ''New Girl'' has gotten a lot of mileage out of both those areas."<ref name=huffington_bigmoment /> The continued Nick–Jess relationship was criticized in season 3 for dropping the characters' personalities, lack of tension,<ref name=tvguide_openletter /> and for neglecting the show's female friendship between Jess and Cece.<ref name=ew_friendship /> ''TV Guide''{{'s}} Natalie Abrams felt that during the first half of season 3 that "bringing them together caused that [former] spark [between them] to diminish",<ref name=tvguide_breakup /> while ''Hitfix''{{'s}} Alan Sepinwall and ''The A.V. Club''{{'s}} David Sims found that the show's perceived decline in quality had less to do with the Nick–Jess relationship but with the handling of Schmidt's cheating arc and the re-introduction of Coach.<ref name=hitfix_prince /><ref name=avclub_bouncing />

On Rotten Tomatoes, season three holds an approval rating of 88% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.46/10.
The site's critical consensus reads, "Though it falls within a common sitcom template, ''New Girl'' brings laughter by spotlighting funny and genuine characters that are imperfect in relatable ways."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/new_girl/s03|title=''New Girl'': Season 3 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> Season four holds an approval rating of 100% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 6.67/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''New Girl''{{'}}s fourth season benefits from a renewed cast chemistry reminiscent of season two."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/new_girl/s03|title=''New Girl'': Season 4 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> The series' seventh and final season has an approval rating of 100% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78, and a critical consensus of, "After seven years of friendship, ''New Girl'' signs off with a thoughtful, funny final season that bids a proper adieu to its colorful cast of characters."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/new_girl/s07|title=''New Girl'': Season 7 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> 

''Variety'' has quoted Zooey Deschanel saying that "we were ready for it to be the end, in a bittersweet way...It was like finishing a marathon, like we did this really long run for seven years and we've played these characters a long time. It's not like there was any unfinished business".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/new-girl-season-7-zooey-deschanel-1202747963/|title=‘New Girl’ Star Zooey Deschanel on Filming Series’ Ending: ‘We Were Ready’|last=Otterson|first=Joe|last2=Otterson|first2=Joe|date=2018-04-10|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>
