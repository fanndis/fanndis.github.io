The case centered on a press statement issued by Clark criticising Brownlee, triggered by a constituent's complaint over the outcome of a hip replacement.

Clark entered office just three years after the adoption of the [[Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) [[Electoral system of New Zealand|voting system]], which had produced an unstable National-led government under Bolger and Shipley. Clark negotiated the formation of successive [[coalition government]]s. Political scientist [[Bryce Edwards]] identified Clark's ability to lead stable governments as her most significant achievement, arguing that her ability to work with a variety of coalition partners—including the [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], [[Jim Anderton's Progressive Party]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]], [[United Future]] and [[New Zealand First]]—consolidated public support for MMP.<ref name=Reflections>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Bryce|title=Reflections on Helen Clark's time as PM|url=http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2010/11/reflections-on-helen-clarks-time-as-pm.html|website=Liberation|accessdate=20 July 2016|date=21 November 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627063209/http://liberation.typepad.com/liberation/2010/11/reflections-on-helen-clarks-time-as-pm.html|archive-date=27 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=steady_as>{{cite web|last1=Espiner|first1=Colin|title=The prime of Helen Clark – steady as she goes|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/vote-08/candidates/about-the-leaders-28607/633471/The-prime-of-Helen-Clark-steady-as-she-goes|website=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|accessdate=20 July 2016|date=25 September 2008|archive-date=8 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908202601/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/vote-08/candidates/about-the-leaders-28607/633471/The-prime-of-Helen-Clark-steady-as-she-goes|url-status=live}}</ref>

Clark made every attempt to make sure that gender was not an issue in politics. However, Bryce Edwards states that others did. Clark was portrayed as bloodsucking, cold, and humourless.

The UN's role in the [[2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak|Haiti cholera outbreak]] has been widely discussed and criticised. There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti.
