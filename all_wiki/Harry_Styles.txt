===Treat People with Kindness===
"Treat People with Kindness", also abbreviated to "TPWK", is a slogan used by Styles to promote his message of love, acceptance and kindness to people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/tpwk-treat-people-with-kindness-album/|title=What does Harry Styles's 'TPWK' stand for as his second album approaches?|website=Capital|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329073216/https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/tpwk-treat-people-with-kindness-album/|url-status=live}}</ref> Styles started using the slogan on his debut concert tour in 2017, on a badge on his guitar and on tour merchandise, including Pride t-shirts sold to raise funds for GLSEN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/10/review-harry-styles-preaches-kindness-at-d-c-show|title=Review: Harry Styles preaches kindness at D.C. show|website=The Daily Tar Heel|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329114116/https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2017/10/review-harry-styles-preaches-kindness-at-d-c-show|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-style-0/news/harry-styles-new-tshirts-in-celebration-of-pride-are-all-we-wanna-wear-this-summer|title=Harry Styles' New T-Shirts In Celebration Of Pride Are All We Wanna Wear This Summer &#124; MTV UK|website=www.mtv.co.uk|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329093042/http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv-style-0/news/harry-styles-new-tshirts-in-celebration-of-pride-are-all-we-wanna-wear-this-summer|url-status=live}}</ref> In an interview in December 2019 he said, "It was a pin I had on my guitar strap and we made t-shirts for it, then I saw a lot of t-shirts around. I'd be driving or something and see someone in one and I started feeling like, 'Oh this is a bit of a thing'". This gave Styles the idea of writing a song to go with the slogan titled "Treat People with Kindness", which is the penultimate track on his second studio album, ''Fine Line''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/small-changes-make-a-big-difference-harry-styles-tells-the-story-of-treat-people-with-kindness/078397|title='Small changes make a big difference': Harry Styles tells the story of Treat People With Kindness|website=www.musicweek.com|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329105756/https://www.musicweek.com/talent/read/small-changes-make-a-big-difference-harry-styles-tells-the-story-of-treat-people-with-kindness/078397|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2019, teaser posters including the phrase "Do you know who you are?" and the acronym "TPWK" were spotted in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York and Australia, which fans were able to connect to Styles and his new album release due to the reference to his "Treat People with Kindness" motto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/do-you-know-who-you-are-poster-hs2-music-1d/|title=Harry Styles is covering the world in teaser posters for new music 'Do You Know Who You Are'|website=Capital|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329131541/https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/harry-styles/do-you-know-who-you-are-poster-hs2-music-1d/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-10-09-buzz-for-harry-styles-new-album-begins-see-the-mysterious-poster/|title=Buzz For Harry Styles' New Album Begins: See The Mysterious Poster &#124; iHeartRadio|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329130552/https://www.iheart.com/content/2019-10-09-buzz-for-harry-styles-new-album-begins-see-the-mysterious-poster/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/harry-styles-new-album-one-direction-fan-world-mental-health-day-twitter-a9151416.html|title=Harry Styles sends fan touching mental health message as he hints at new album|date=10 October 2019|website=The Independent|access-date=30 March 2020|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329143153/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/harry-styles-new-album-one-direction-fan-world-mental-health-day-twitter-a9151416.html|url-status=live}}</ref> At the same time to mark [[World Mental Health Day]], Styles launched a website bot called "Do You Know Who You Are?" that gives users positive randomised messages using words such as bright, determined, loving and wonderful, and ending with "TPWK.
