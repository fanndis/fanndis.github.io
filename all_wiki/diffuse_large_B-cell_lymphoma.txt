'''Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma''' (DLBCL) is a [[cancer]] of [[B cell]]s, a type of [[lymphocyte]] that is responsible for producing [[antibody|antibodies]]. It is the most common form of [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]] among adults,<ref name=Blood1997/> with an annual [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of 7–8 cases per 100,000 people per year in the US and UK.<ref name=Morton2006/><ref name=Smith2011/> This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age of diagnosis at ~70 years,<ref name=Smith2011/> although it can occur in young adults and, in rare cases, children.<ref name=Smith2010/> DLBCL can arise in virtually any part of the body and, depending on various factors, is often a very aggressive malignancy.<ref name=Kumar2009/> The first sign of this illness is typically the observation of a rapidly growing mass or tissue infiltration that is sometimes associated with systemic [[B symptoms]], e.g. [[fever]], [[Cachexia|weight loss]], and [[night sweats]].<ref name=UpToDateEpi2012/>

The causes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not well understood. Usually DLBCL arises from normal B cells, but it can also represent a [[malignant transformation]] of other types of lymphoma (particularly [[marginal zone lymphoma]]s<ref name="pmid28288708">{{cite journal | vauthors = Casulo C, Friedberg J | title = Transformation of marginal zone lymphoma (and association with other lymphomas) | journal = Best Practice & Research.

[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of DLBCL is made by removing a portion of the tumor through a [[biopsy]], and then examining this tissue using a microscope. Usually a [[Hematopathology|hematopathologist]] makes this diagnosis.{{sfn|Goldman|Schafer|2012|p=1222}} Numerous subtypes of DLBCL have been identified which differ in their clinical presentations, biopsy findings, aggressive characteristics, [[Prognosis|prognoses]], and recommended treatments.<ref name="pmid26980727">{{cite journal | vauthors = Swerdlow SH, Campo E, Pileri SA, Harris NL, Stein H, Siebert R, Advani R, Ghielmini M, Salles GA, Zelenetz AD, Jaffe ES | title = The 2016 revision of the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms | journal = Blood | volume = 127 | issue = 20 | pages = 2375–90 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26980727 | pmc = 4874220 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2016-01-643569 }}</ref> However, the usual treatment for most subtypes of DLBCL is [[chemotherapy]] combined with a [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|monoclonal antibody drug that targets the disease's cancerous B-cells]], usually [[rituximab]].{{sfn|Goldman|Schafer|2012|p=1225}} Through these treatments, more than half of all patients with DLBCL can be [[Cure#Remission|cured]];<ref name=Akyurek2011/> the overall cure rate for older adults is less than this but their [[five-year survival rate]] has been around 58%.<ref name=Feugier2005/>

== Subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ==
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma encompasses a biologically and clinically diverse set of disease subtypes,<ref name=Alizadeh2000/> many of which are difficult to separate from one another based on well-defined and widely accepted criteria. The [[World Health Organization]], 2008, classification system defined more than a dozen subtypes,{{sfn|Swerdlow|Campo|Jaffe|Pileri|2008|pp=233–7}} each of which was identified based on the location of the tumor, the presence of other cell types such as [[T cell]]s in the tumor, and whether the patient had certain other illnesses related to DLBCL. Based on further research, the World Health Organization, 2016, reclassified DLBCL into its most common subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS). DLBCL, NOS represents 80-85% of all DLBCL.<ref name="pmid29167021">{{cite journal | vauthors = Li S, Young KH, Medeiros LJ | title = Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | journal = Pathology | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–87 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29167021 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathol.2017.09.006 | url = http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma}}</ref> The remaining DLBCL cases consist of relatively rare subtypes that are distinguished by their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], (i.e. microscopic appearance),  [[Immunophenotyping|immunophenotype]], (i.e. expression of certain marker proteins), clinical findings, and/or association with certain [[pathogenic]] [[virus]]es.<ref name="pmid31735345"/> Some cases of DLBCL, NOS, while not included in the 2016 World Health Organization's classification, are clearly associated with, and caused by, chronic infection by the [[bacterium]], [[Helicobacter pylori#Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma|''Helicobacter pylori'']].<ref name="pmid31455250">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng Y, Xiao Y, Zhou R, Liao Y, Zhou J, Ma X | title = Prognostic significance of helicobacter pylori-infection in gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | journal = BMC Cancer | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 842 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 31455250 | pmc = 6712724 | doi = 10.1186/s12885-019-6067-5 }}</ref>

=== Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified ===
DLBCL cases that do not fit the distinctive clinical presentation, tissue morphology, neoplastic cell [[phenotype]], and/or pathogen-associated criteria of other DLBCL subtypes are termed Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified: DLBCL, NOS, while representing 80-85% of all DLBCL cases, is a [[diagnosis of exclusion]]. In general, DLBCL, NOS is an aggressive disease with an overall long-term survival rate in patients treated with standard chemotherapy regimens of ~65%. However, this disease has many variants that differ not only in the just cited parameters but also in their aggressiveness and responsiveness to treatment.<ref name="pmid30380402">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grimm KE, O'Malley DP | title = Aggressive B cell lymphomas in the 2017 revised WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues | journal = Annals of Diagnostic Pathology | volume = 38 | pages = 6–10 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30380402 | doi = 10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2018.09.014 }}</ref>

==== Presenting signs and symptoms ====
About 70% of DLBCL, NOS cases present primarily with lymph node disease. In these cases, the most typical presenting symptom at the time of diagnosis is a mass that is rapidly enlarging and located in a part of the body with multiple lymph nodes such as the groin, arm pits, or neck. In the remaining ~30% of other cases, the disease begins as an extranodal lymphoma, most commonly in the stomach,<ref name="pmid31735345"/> or, less commonly, in other sites such as the testicles, breasts, uterus, ovaries, kidneys, [[adrenal gland]]s, thyroid gland, or bone.<ref name="pmid29931605">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ollila TA, Olszewski AJ | title = Extranodal Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Molecular Features, Prognosis, and Risk of Central Nervous System Recurrence | journal = Current Treatment Options in Oncology | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 38 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29931605 | pmc = 6294323 | doi = 10.1007/s11864-018-0555-8 }}</ref> The presenting signs and symptoms in these cases reflect the presence of a rapidly expanding tumor or infiltrate that produces symptoms specific to the organ of involvement such as increased size, pain, and/or dysfunction.<ref name="pmid29931605"/> Individuals with nodal or extranodal disease also present with:  systemic [[B symptoms]] such as weight loss, night sweats, fevers, and/or fatigue in ~33% of cases; unexplained elevations in their blood levels of [[lactic acid dehydrogenase]] and [[beta-2 microglobulin]] in many cases; malignant cells infiltrating their [[bone marrow]] in 10-20% of cases; and/or localized [[Ann Arbor staging#Principal stages|Stage I or II disease]] in up to 50% of cases and disseminated [[Ann Arbor staging#Principal stages|Stage III or IV disease]] in the remaining cases.<ref name="pmid31735345"/> Bone marrow involvement may be due to DLBCL, NOS cells or low grade lymphoma cells; only DLBCL, NOS cell infiltrates indicate a worse prognosis.<ref name="pmid29167021"/> Uncommonly, DLBCL may arise as a transformation of [[marginal zone lymphoma]] (MZL) in individuals who have been diagnosed with this indolent cancer 4–5 years (median times) previously.<ref name="pmid28288717">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pileri S, Ponzoni M | title = Pathology of nodal marginal zone lymphomas | journal = Best Practice & Research.

===== Prognostic indicators based on clinical presentation =====
The [[International Prognostic Index#International Prognostic Index|International Prognostic Index]] and more recently, the Index's [[International Prognostic Index#Age-Adjusted IPII|age-adjusted variant]] use age >60 years, elevated serum [[lactate dehydrogenase]] levels, low [[Performance status#ECOG/WHO/Zubrod score|performance status]], and involvement in more than one extranodal site as contributors to a poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL, NOS.<ref name="pmid29167021"/> In addition, disease that initially involves the testes, breast, or uterus has a relatively high rate of spreading to the [[central nervous system]] while disease initially involving the kidneys, [[adrenal glands]], ovaries, or bone marrow has a high rate of spreading to other organs, including the central nervous system. All of these cases as well as cases initially involving the central nervous system have relatively poor to very poor prognoses. Cases initially involving the stomach, thyroid, or a single bone site have relatively good prognoses.<ref name="pmid29931605"/>

==== Pathophysiology ====
Most cases of DLBCL, NOS appear to result at least in part from the step-wise development of [[gene]] changes such as [[mutations]], [[Regulation of transcription in cancer|altered expressions]], [[Gene amplification|amplifications]] (i.e. increases in the number of copies of specific genes), and [[Chromosomal translocation|tranlocations]] from normal sites to other chromosomal sites. These changes often result in gains or loses in the production or function of [[Gene product|the product of these genes]] and thereby the activity of [[cell signaling]] pathways that regulate the [[Cellular differentiation|maturation]], [[Cell growth|proliferation]], survival, spread, [[Immune system#Tumor immunology|evasion of the immune system]], and other malignant behaviors of the cells in which they occur. While scores of genes have been reported to be altered in DLBCL, NOS many of these may not contribute to DLBCL, NOS. Changes in the following genes occur frequently in, and are suspected of contributing to, this disease's development and/or progression.<ref name="pmid30859597"/>
*''[[Bcl-2|BCL2]]'': This gene is a [[Oncogene#Protooncogene|protooncogene]], i.e. a normal gene that can become cancer-causing when mutated or overexpressed. Its product, Bcl-2 protein, regulates cellular [[apoptosis]] (i.e. survival) by inhibiting the apoptosis-causing proteins, [[Bcl-2-associated X protein]] and [[Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer]].<ref name="pmid31287161"/>
*''[[BCL6]]'': This genes' product, Bcl-6, is a [[repressor]] of transcription that regulates the expression of other genes which control cell maturation, proliferation, and survival.<ref name="pmid31287161"/>
*''[[MYC]]'': This protooncogene's product, Myc, encodes a [[transcription factor]] which regulates the expression of other genes whose products stimulate cell proliferation and expansion to extra-nodal tissues.<ref name="pmid29909914">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavez JC, Locke FL | title = CAR T cell therapy for B-cell lymphomas | journal = Best Practice & Research.

*''[[EZH2]]'': This gene's product, the EZH2 protein, is a [[Histone methyltransferase|histone-lysine N-methyltransferase]]. It thereby regulates the expression of other genes which control lymphocyte maturation.<ref name="pmid29167021"/>
*''[[MYD88]]'': This gene's product is a [[signal transducing adaptor protein]] essential for the [[Signal transduction|transduction]] of [[Interleukin-1 receptor|interleukin-1]] and [[toll-like receptor]] signaling pathways. It thereby regulates [[NF-κB]] and [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MAPK/ERK signaling pathways]] that control cell proliferation and survival.<ref name="pmid31287161"/>
*''[[CREBBP]]'': This gene's product is a transcriptional [[coactivation (Transcription)|coactivator]]; it activates numerous [[transcription factor]]s, some of which control cell proliferation.<ref name="pmid30859597"/> 
*''[[CD79A]]'' and ''[[CD79B]]'': these genes' products are critical components of the [[B-cell receptor]]. Mutations in either gene can cause uncontrolled cell activation and proliferation.<ref name="pmid30859597"/>
*''[[PAX5]]'': this gene's product, Pax-5, is a transcription factor that controls the development, maturation, and survival of B-cells; it also controls expression of the ''MYC'' gene in these cells.<ref name="pmid25428382">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shahjahani M, Norozi F, Ahmadzadeh A, Shahrabi S, Tavakoli F, Asnafi AA, Saki N | title = The role of Pax5 in leukemia: diagnosis and prognosis significance | journal = Medical Oncology (Northwood, London, England) | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 360 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25428382 | doi = 10.1007/s12032-014-0360-6 | s2cid = 7127158 }}</ref>

As a consequence of these gene changes and possibly other changes that have not yet been identified, the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS exhibit pathologically overactive NF-κB, [[PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway|PI3K/AKT/mTOR]], [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT]]0, [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MAPK/ERK]], [[B-cell receptor#Signaling pathways of the B-cell receptor|B-cell receptor]], [[Toll-like receptor#Function|toll-like receptor]], and [[NF-κB#Signaling|NF-κB]] signaling pathways and thereby uncontrolled pro-malignant behaviors.<ref name="pmid31287161"/>

==== Diagnosis ====
Microscopic examinations of involved tissues reveal large neoplastic cells that are typically classified as B-cells based on their expression of B-cell marker proteins (e.g. [[CD20]], [[CD19]], [[CD22]], [[CD79]], PAX5, [[POU2AF1|BOB1]], [[SLC22A2|OCT2]], an [[immunoglobulin]] [usually [[IgM]] but occasionally [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] or [[IgA]])],<ref name="pmid31735345"/> [[CD30]], and in ~20-25% of cases [[PD-L1]] or [[PD-L2]] (PD-L1 and PD-L2 are [[transmembrane protein]]s that normally function to suppress attack by the immune system).<ref name="pmid29167021"/> These cells arrange in a diffuse pattern, efface the tissues' architecture, and resemble [[Centroblast]] cells (80% of cases), [[Immunoblast]] cells (8-10% of cases), or [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells (9% of cases; anaplastic cells have bizarre nuclei and other features that may mimic the [[Reed-Sternberg cells]] of [[Hodgkin disease]] or the neoplastic cells of [[anaplastic large cell lymphoma]]). Rarely, these neoplastic cells are characterized as having signet ring or spindle shaped nuclei, prominent [[cytoplasm]]ic granules, multiple [[microvillus]] projections, or, when viewed by [[electron microscopy]], [[tight junctions|tight junctions with other cells]].<ref name="pmid31735345"/> These neoplastic tissue infiltrates are often accompanied by small non-malignant [[T-cell|T-cell lymphocytes]] and [[histiocytes]] that have a reactive morphology.<ref name="pmid29167021"/>

==== Variants of DLBCL, NOS ====
The World Health Organization, 2016, requires that the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS be further defined based on whether they are derived from [[germinal center]] B-cells (i.e. GBC) or activated B-cells (i.e. ABC) as identified by [[gene expression profiling]] (GEP) or are GBC or non-GBC as identified by [[immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] (IHC) analyses. As identified by GEP, which measures all cellular [[messenger RNA]]s, GBC and ABC represent about 50 and ~35% of DLBCL, NOS cases, respectively, with ~15% of cases being unclassifiable.<ref name="pmid29126866">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabanillas F, Shah B | title = Advances in Diagnosis and Management of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma | journal = Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 783–796 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29126866 | doi = 10.1016/j.clml.2017.10.007 | s2cid = 25304758 }}</ref> IHC analyses measure the cellular expression of specific proteins using a panel of fluorescent antibodies that bind to and therefore stain a set of key proteins.

The neoplastic cells in almost all cases of DLBCL, NOS express CD20. Commercially available anti-CD20 antibody agents such as [[rituximab]] or [[Obinutuzumab]] (which is sometimes used in place of rituximab) kill cells that express high levels of CD20 by binding to this cell-surface protein and thereby targeting them for attack by the hosts [[adaptive immune system]]. The addition of one of these [[immunotherapy]] agents to [[chemotherapy]] protocols has greatly improved the prognosis of most DLBCL, NOS variants.<ref name="pmid29167021"/> Neoplastic cell expression of CD30, found in 10-15% of DLBCL, NOS cases is a favorable prognostic indicator. As indicated in the following Treatments and prognoses section, expression of the CD20 and CD30 proteins as well as the CD19, CD20 CD22, CD30, CD79A, CD79B, and D-L1 proteins, expression of the ''MYC'', ''BCL2'', ''MYD88nd'', and ''CREBBP'' genes, and expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK-STAT, B-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, and NF-κB signaling pathways are being studied as potential therapeutic targets for the individualized treatment of GBC and ABC/non-GBC DLBCL, NOS cases.<ref name="pmid30859597"/><ref name="pmid29167021"/>

==== Treatments and prognoses ====
===== First-line therapy =====
First-line therapy for patients with the GBC variant of DLBCL, NOS is [[R-CHOP]]. R-CHOP consists of rituximab, three chemotherapy drugs ([[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydoxorubicin]], and [[oncovin]]) and a [[glucocorticoid]] (either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]).<ref name="pmid29126866"/> The regimen achieves cure, relapse following remission,<ref name="pmid29167021"/> and unresponsive rates of 60-70%, 30-40% and <10%, respectively, in GBC variant cases.<ref name="pmid29808921">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gisselbrecht C, Van Den Neste E | title = How I manage patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma | journal = British Journal of Haematology | volume = 182 | issue = 5 | pages = 633–643 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 29808921 | pmc = 6175435 | doi = 10.1111/bjh.15412 }}</ref> Relapses generally occur within the first 3 years of diagnosis with few cases doing so after 5 years.

One recommendation for treating these DH/THL cases is the [[EPOCH (chemotherapy)|DA-R-EPOCH]] regimen (dose-adjusted rituximab, [[etoposide]], prednisolone, oncovin, cyclophosphamide, and hydroxydaunorubicin). S-R-EPOCH achieves 2 year survival rates of 40-67% compared to a ~25% survival rate for R-CHOP in these cases.<ref name="pmid29126866"/> DA-R-EPOCH has also been recommended for patients with double expresser lymphoma<ref name="pmid29126866"/> although some experts recommend treating this variant more like a typical DLCBL, NOS.<ref name="pmid31287161"/> First-line therapy for patients with the ABC, undetermined, or non-GBC variants has been the DA-R-EPOCH regimen. Patients with these variants (including those with double expresser lymphoma) have had a ~40% cure rate when treated with it.<ref name="pmid29126866"/> A [[randomized clinical trial]] conducted in France reported that a R-ACVBP chemotherapy regimen (rituximab, [[adriamycin]], cyclophosphamide, [[vindesine]], [[bleomycin]], and [[cytarabine]] followed by sequential [[Therapy#By intent|consolidation therapy]] with systemic [[methotrexate]], [[ifosfamide]], and [[etoposide]], and then cytarabine) achieved significantly better response rates than R-CHOP in ABC/NGC variant cases lymphoma.<ref name="pmid31287161"/> In DLBCL, NOS variants which trend to spread or to the central nervous system,  methotrexate has been recommended to be added to regimens not containing it for use as [[Preventive healthcare|prophylaxis]] to reduce the incidence of this complication.<ref name="pmid29909914"/> The role of [[Autologous stem-cell transplantation]] as an addition to first-line therapy in the treatment of DLBCL, NOS, including cases with a poor prognosis, is unclear.<ref name="pmid30859597"/>

A [[Phases of clinical research#Summary|phase I clinical research trial]] found that the addition of [[lenalidomide]] to the R-CHOP regimen produce an ~80% complete response rate in GBC as well as non- GBC DLBCL, NOS variants.<ref name="pmid30859597"/> Two [[Phases of clinical research#Summary|phase III clinical research trials]] are underway to confirm these results and determine if the R-CHOP + lenalidomide regimen is superior to R-CHOP in the up-front treatment of GBC and/or non-GBC variants.<ref name="pmid30859597"/>

===== Treatment of recurrent and refractory DLBCL, NOS =====
Patients with DLBCL, NOS who relapse or progress following first-line therapy have been treated wit "salvage regimens" consisting of high-dose (also termed high-intensity) [[chemotherapy]] conditioning drugs followed by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation#Autologous|autologous stem cell transplantation]]. This regimen has attained 3 year progression-free survival rates of 21-37%.<ref name="pmid30859597"/> Relapse following this treatment carries a very poor prognosis with median overall survival times of ~10 months.<ref name="pmid29909914"/> Patients who have failed or because of health issues are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation have been treated with low-dose (i.e. low-intensity) chemotherapy conditioning regimens followed by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation#Allogeneic|allogeneic stem cell transplantation]]. This regimen has achieved 3 year progression-free and overall survival rates of 41% and 52%, respectively.<ref name="pmid29808921"/> Further studies are underway to determine the best treatment regimens for these cases.<ref name="pmid30859597"/><ref name="pmid29808921"/> Patients refractory to first-line therapy or who relapse within 12 months of receiving ''salvage'' therapy (including bone marrow transplant) for recurrent disease have had poor prognoses with median overall survival rates of 3.3 and 6.3 months, respectively.<ref name="pmid30859597"/>  Thee prognosis of these patients appears to be improved by using CAR-T therapy.

Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (i.e. CAR-T) [[Adoptive immunity|adoptive cellular immunotherapy]] has emerged as a recent advance in treating refractory and relapsed DLBCL, NOS. Chimeric antigen receptor T cells are [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to express: '''1)''' an artificial [[T-cell receptor]] consisting of antigen-recognition and attached hinge domains expressed on their [[Cell membrane|surface membranes]]; '''2)''' a surface membrane-spanning domain; '''3)''' an intracellular domain which, when the antigen-recognition domain binds its targeted antigen, activates signaling pathways that cause the T-cell to attack and  kill cells that bear the recognized antigen on their surface membranes; and '''4)''', in more recently devised second generation CAR-T strategies, an associated intracellular co-stimulating molecule (e.g. [[CD28]] or [[CD137|4‐1BB]]) which augments activation of the cell-killing signaling pathways. CAR-T therapy, as it pertains to DLBCL, NOS, kills a patient's neoplastic B-cells by isolating this patient's [[T-cell]]s; [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineering]] these cells to express an artificial [[T-cell receptor]] designed to bind an [[antigen]] expressed on the surface of their neoplastic B-cells; and infusing these cells back into the donor patient. The targeted antigen has usually been [[CD19]], a surface membrane protein expressed on virtually all B-cells including the neoplastic cells in DLBCL, NOS.<ref name="pmid29909914"/> However, design of CARs<ref name="pmid30830661">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee YH, Kim CH | title = Evolution of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy: current status and future perspectives | journal = Archives of Pharmacal Research | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 607–616 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 30830661 | doi = 10.1007/s12272-019-01136-x | s2cid = 73475110 }}</ref> as well as the antigens chosen to be their targets <ref name="pmid29909914"/> are constantly being changed in order to improve the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy.

CAR-T therapy for DLBCL, NOS has been used on patients who are refractory to and/or have progressed on first-line as well as salvage (including autologous stem cell transplantation) treatment regimens. Patients are treated first with a conditioning chemotherapy regimen, usually cyclophosphamide and [[fludarabine]], and then infused with their own T-cells that have been engineered to attack CD19-bearing or, rarely, [[CD20]]-bearing cells. A [[meta-analysis]] of 17 studies using this or very similar approaches to treat DLBCL, NOS found the treatments gave complete and partial responses rates of 61% and 43%, respectively.  While these studies did not have control groups and were too recent for meaningful estimates of remission durations, the remission rates were higher than expected using other treatment approaches. Significant and potentially lethal therapeutic complications of this therapy included development of the [[cytokine release syndrome]] (21% of cases), neurotoxicity, i.e. the CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (9% of cases),<ref name="pmid31923107">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zheng XH, Zhang XY, Dong QQ, Chen F, Yang SB, Li WB | title = Efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor-T cells in the treatment of B cell lymphoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 74–85 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31923107 | doi = 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000568 | pmc = 7028209 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage-activation syndrome (i.e. a form of [[Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis]]).<ref name="pmid31723824">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopfinger G, Jäger U, Worel N | title = CAR-T Cell Therapy in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma: Hype and Hope | journal = HemaSphere | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = e185 | date = April 2019 | pmid = 31723824 | pmc = 6746029 | doi = 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000185 }}</ref> Individual studies within and outside of this meta-analysis have reported remissions lasting >2 years but also lethal cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity responses to this therapy.<ref name="pmid29808921"/> As a consequence of these studies, the [[European Medicines Agency#Committee for Advanced Therapies|Committee for Advanced Therapies]] and the [[European Medicines Agency#Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use|Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use]] of the European Medicines Agency recommend granting marketing authorization for [[tisagenlecleucel]] (i.e. chimeric antigen receptor T cells directed against CD19) in adult patients with DLBCL, NOS who have relapsed after or are refractory to two or more lines of systemic therapy.<ref name="pmid31619548">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ali S, Kjeken R, Niederlaender C, Markey G, Saunders TS, Opsata M, Moltu K, Bremnes B, Grønevik E, Muusse M, Håkonsen GD, Skibeli V, Kalland ME, Wang I, Buajordet I, Urbaniak A, Johnston J, Rantell K, Kerwash E, Schuessler-Lenz M, Salmonson T, Bergh J, Gisselbrecht C, Tzogani K, Papadouli I, Pignatti F | title = The European Medicines Agency Review of Kymriah (Tisagenlecleucel) for the Treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = theoncologist.2019–0233| date = October 2019 | pmid = 31619548 | doi = 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0233 | doi-access = free }}</ref> The [[European Medicines Agency#Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products|Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products]] of the European Medicines Agency recommends tisagenlecleucel retain its [[orphan drug]] designation.<ref name="pmid31619548"/> The USA [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has also approved the use of this drug for relapsed or refractory DLBCL of the large B-cell lymphoma subtype in patients who have failed after two or more lines of systemic therapy.<ref name="pmid30413526">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bouchkouj N, Kasamon YL, de Claro RA, George B, Lin X, Lee S, Blumenthal GM, Bryan W, McKee AE, Pazdur R | title = FDA Approval Summary: Axicabtagene Ciloleucel for Relapsed or Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 1702–1708 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30413526 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-2743 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|Monoclonal antibodies]] directed against CD19, CD22, CD30, and PD-L1 have been developed for use as immunotherapeutic agents in other hematological malignancies and are being or plan to be tested for their usefulness in DLBCL, NOS.<ref name="pmid29167021"/> In August of 2020, the FDA approved the humanized Fc-modified cytolytic CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody [[tafasitamab]] in combination with lenalidomide as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory  DLBCL <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=761163|title= Monjuvi: FDA Approved Drugs |website=US FDA |access-date=August 20, 2020}}</ref>

===== Emerging therapies =====
Neoplastic cell expression of CD30 in DLBCL, NOS is a favorable prognostic indicator; in these cases, [[brentuximab vedotin]] may be a useful addition to [[chemotherapy]] treatment protocols. This agent is a CD30-targeting antibody that delivers a toxin, [[monomethyl auristatin E]], to CD30-expressing cells, has therapeutic efficacy against other CD30-expressing lymphomas, and may prove useful in treating the 10-15% of DLBCL, NOS cases expressing this protein. The neoplastic cells in the GBC variant of DLBCL, NOS often have mutations in the ''EZH2, BCL2'' and ''CREBBP'' genes and overactive PI3K/AKT/mTOR and JAK-STAT signaling pathways while neoplastic cells in the ABC variant often have mutations in the ''MYD88, [[CD79A]]'' and ''[[CD79B]]'' genes and overactive [[B-cell receptor#Signaling pathways of the B-cell receptor|B-cell receptor]], [[Toll-like receptor#Function|toll-like receptor]], and [[NF-κB#Signaling|NF-κB]] signaling pathways.<ref name="pmid29167021"/> These different gene mutations and dysregulated  signaling pathways are also being studied as potential therapeutic targets for the individualized treatment of GBC and ABC/non-GBC cases.<ref name="pmid30859597"/> [[Phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor#Early stage|CUDC-907]], an inhibitor of PI3K and [[histone deacetylase]]s, is being evaluated in two separate clinical trials<ref>{{cite web|title=Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CUDC-907 in Patients With RR DLBCL, Including Patients With MYC Alterations|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02674750?term=CUDC-907&cond=Diffuse+Large+B+Cell+Lymphoma&draw=2&rank=1|website=ClinicalTrials.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Fimepinostat (CUDC-907) in Patients With Lymphoma|website=ClinicalTrials.gov|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01742988?term=CUDC-907&cond=Diffuse+Large+B+Cell+Lymphoma&draw=2&rank=2}}</ref> for the treatment of refractory and/or relapsed DLBCL, NOS including cases with alterations in the ''MYC gene''.<ref name="pmid31735344">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ok CY, Medeiros LJ | title = High-grade B-cell lymphoma: a term re-purposed in the revised WHO classification | journal = Pathology | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 68–77 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31735344 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathol.2019.09.008 | doi-access = free }}</ref> [[BET inhibitor#Targeting both BD1 and BD2 (bromodomains)|GSK525762]], an inhibitor of [[Bromodomain#Bromo- and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) family|the BET family of proteins]], suppresses expression of the ''MYC'' gene and is undergoing a [[Phases of clinical research|phase I clinical trial]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Testing a New Anti-cancer Drug Combination, Entinostat and GSK525762C, for Advanced and Refractory Solid Tumors and Lymphomas|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03925428?term=GSK525762&draw=2&rank=7|website=ClinicalTrials.gov}}</ref> for the treatment of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with ''MYC, BL2,'' and/or ''BL6'' rearrangements (i.e. DH/THL).

=== Subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ===
DLBCL subtypes have been sorted into groups based on their distinctive morphology or [[Immunophenotyping|immunophenotype]], distinctive clinical issues, and distinctive virus-driven etiology. The prognoses and treatment of these subtypes varies with their severity. Most subtypes are aggressive diseases and consequently treated in a manner similar to DLBCL,NOS. Further details on these subtypes, including their treatments, can be found in their respective main article linkages.

This infiltration usually disrupts the normal architecture of the involved tissues. HHV8+ DLBCL develops in [[HIV]]-infected individuals in ~50% of cases, in individuals with [[Castleman disease#Human herpesvirus 8 associated multicentric Castleman disease|multicentric Castleman disease, plasma cell variant]] in uncommon cases, and in individuals with [[Kaposi sarcoma]] in rare cases. HHV8+ DLBCL commonly takes an aggressive course and has a poor prognosis.<ref name="pmid31735345"/>

{{main|Epstein–Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases#Epstein–Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer}}
Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) was first described as a lymphoproliferative disorder in which Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-cells proliferate and cause [[ulceration]]s in the [[mucous membranes]] and skin of [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressed]] individuals. Its lesions consist of Epstein-Barr virus-positive, variable-sized, atypical B-cells that by conventional histopathologic criteria indicate the lesions are a form of DLBCL. Since these lesions regress spontaneously without anti-cancer treatment, EBVMCU is now considered a pseudo-malignant disorder.<ref name="pmid31257347">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ikeda T, Gion Y, Yoshino T, Sato Y | title = A review of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers focusing on clinical and pathological aspects | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hematopathology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–71 | date = 2019 | pmid = 31257347 | pmc = 6661964 | doi = 10.3960/jslrt.18039 }}</ref> Elderly individuals that evidence the disease but have no other cause for immunosuppression may exhibit a relapsing and remitting course with their ulcers worsening but then regressing spontaneously.<ref name="pmid28477890">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodlad JR | title = Epstein–Barr Virus-associated Lymphoproliferative Disorders in the Skin | journal = Surgical Pathology Clinics | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 429–453 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28477890 | doi = 10.1016/j.path.2017.01.001 }}</ref> Persistent and/or severely symptomatic cases have had excellent responses to [[rituximab]].<ref name="pmid29518976">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dojcinov SD, Fend F, Quintanilla-Martinez L | title = EBV-Positive Lymphoproliferations of B- T- and NK-Cell Derivation in Non-Immunocompromised Hosts | journal = Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland) | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28| date = March 2018 | pmid = 29518976 | pmc = 5874754 | doi = 10.3390/pathogens7010028 }}</ref> Individuals developing these ulcers as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy generally have a remission after the dosage of the drugs used in their immunosuppressive treatments are reduced.
