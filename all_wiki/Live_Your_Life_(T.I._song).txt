"Live Your Life" was written by T.I. [[Dan Balan]], Justin Smith, and [[Makeba Riddick]] whilst being produced by [[Just Blaze]] and Riddick. T.I. explained Rihanna's incorporation progress into the song to Artist Direct, "It was a back and forth studio thing with Rihanna. I picked her. I was just able to 'hear' her voice on this record. I could hear her, so I reached out and she said, 'Yes,' thankfully."<ref name="song facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=13214|title=Live Your Life by T.I.|publisher=Song Facts|date=April 26, 2013}}</ref> The song itself features a significant sample from [[O-Zone]]'s popular song "[[Dragostea Din Tei]]".

The first unfinished version of "Live Your Life" leaked onto the Internet on August 26, 2008. The official mastered album version, which has Rihanna's own verse, and T.I.'s dedication to soldiers on the Iraqi battlefield (on the first part, he told "Ay... This a special what's haapnin' to all my, all my soldiers over there in Iraq. Errbody right here, what you need to do is be thankful for the life you got you know what I'm sayin'? Stop lookin' at what you ain't got, start and be thankful for what you do got. Let's give it to 'em baby girl").

==Critical reception==
Alex Fletcher of [[Digital Spy]] awarded "Live Your Life" two out of five stars saying, "While some will be charmed by T.I's well-meaning lyrics and Rihanna's hypnotic chorus hooks, others will find the mixture of samples and robotic effects grating. Our view? Well, hats off to Rihanna for finally taking time out from mining her ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' album, but it's a shame she had to waste her break on a naff novelty release like this."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a135508/ti-feat-rihanna-live-your-life.html|title=T.I feat Rihanna: 'Live Your Life'|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}</ref>

The American magazine ''[[The Village Voice]]'' voted "Live Your Life" at number 13 on their annual ''[[Pazz & Jop]]'' critics' poll; T.I.'s own "[[Whatever You Like (T.I. song)|Whatever You Like]]" was voted at number 14 on the same poll.

==Music video==
The music video for "Live Your Life" was filmed in October 2008 in [[Los Angeles]]<ref>{{cite web|title=T.I. & Rihanna to Shoot ‘Live Your Life’ Video|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/09/22/ti-rihanna-to-shoot-live-your-life-video/|work=[[Rap-Up]]|accessdate=November 17, 2008|date=September 22, 2008}}</ref> and was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]]. The video, using the radio edit of the song, features both T.I. and Rihanna. It plays backwards, starting with the end of T.I.'s day. In the opening scene, T.I. is shown walking along the [[Los Angeles River]] in a suit with bloody wounds culminating in the song beginning. It then goes into a series of underground shots of him with interspersed scenes of Rihanna in a dressing room. T.I. is then shown being thrown out of a car, in the Los Angeles river. The video then cuts again to the day with T.I. wearing the same suit seen earlier in the video, but undamaged. He then encounters a group of thugs whom he brawls with. The video then begins a different story arc, showing T.I. before he made his fortune, rapping in a recording studio and in front of a house playing dice and dominoes with friends. This portion of the video is interspersed with clips of the other story arc, such as showing T.I. with a briefcase full of money. He is then shown in the bathroom of a bar, before walking out into the bar passing Rihanna who has exited her dressing room. Rihanna performs on stage with a microphone while T.I. talks to a man saying "I want out."; the man replies by explaining that there is no getting out, not for him nor for the character that Rihanna plays. T.I slams the money briefcase down on the table and shows it to the man saying that "I'm done. I got myself here, I'll get myself out". Then he is seen walking into that same bar, in a flashback, with a CD in his hand. The man that T.I. spoke to earlier calls him over. This is a flashback showing T.I. trying to get a record deal. The last shot of the video takes place at around the same time as the first shot of the video. T.I. is walking down the [[Los Angeles River]], raising his hands triumphantly in the air with a bloodied and scarred face. The song's producer, [[Just Blaze]], is briefly seen playing pool in the bar during the second verse and final chorus.

==Live performances==
T.I. performed the track with Rihanna at the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]] on September 7, 2008, following a solo performance of "[[Whatever You Like]]" prior.<ref name="VMA">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2008/|title=2008 Video Music Awards Summary|date=April 26, 2013|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=September 7, 2008}}</ref> The track was included on the set list of Rihanna's [[Last Girl on Earth]] (2010–11) in a medley with Rihanna's own "[[Wait Your Turn]]", and the [[Jay-Z]], Rihanna and [[Kanye West]] single "[[Run This Town]]".
