The '''U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement''' ('''ICE''') is a [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]] under the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. ICE's stated mission is to protect the United States from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety.<ref>{{cite web |title=What We Do |url=https://www.ice.gov/overview |website=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Enforcement and Removal Operations |url=https://www.ice.gov/ero |website=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security |access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:ICE HQ in DC.jpg|thumb|left|ICE headquarters building in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was formed under the [[Homeland Security Act]] of 2002, following the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. With the establishment of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], the functions and jurisdictions of several border and revenue enforcement agencies were combined and consolidated into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Consequently, ICE is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security and the second largest contributor to the FBI's [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]].

The agencies that were either moved entirely or merged in part into ICE included the criminal investigative and intelligence resources of the [[United States Customs Service]], the criminal investigative, detention and deportation resources of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], and the [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]]. The Federal Protective Service was later transferred from ICE to the [[National Protection and Programs Directorate]] effective October 28, 2009. In 2003, [[Asa Hutchinson]] moved the [[Federal Air Marshals Service]] from the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) to ICE,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/06/19/air-marshals-seek-a-flight-out-of-tsa-to-new-agency/c88d3add-e63a-4ad7-894f-47d5fb1c5a24/|title=Air Marshals Seek a Flight Out of TSA to New Agency|first1=Sara Kehaulani|last1=Goo |first2=Sara Kehaulani|last2=Goo|date=June 19, 2003|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> but [[Michael Chertoff]] moved them back to the TSA in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Federal Air Marshal Service will be moved from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) bureau to the Transportation Security Administration|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dhs/chertoff_6points.htm}}</ref>

In April 2006, ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Section, initiated an investigation into criminal organizations that distributed child pornography.<ref>ICE FOIA Case Number 2015-ICFO-82330 (2016). Retrieved from https://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/controversies/USICE-FLICKER.pdf on 10/2/2019</ref> The project, dubbed Operation Flicker, found that there were a number of government employees, including "dozens of Pentagon staff and contractors with high-level security clearance," who had downloaded child pornography.<ref>MacAskill, E.(2010) Pentagon workers found to have downloaded child pornography. The Guardian. Retrieved from https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/24/pentagon-us-staff-downloaded-child-pornography on 10/2/2019</ref>

==Organization==
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is responsible for identifying and eliminating border, economic, transportation, and infrastructure security vulnerabilities. There is an estimate of about 20,000 ICE employees in approximately 400 offices within the United States and 53 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/about |title=Who We Are &#124; ICE |publisher=Ice.gov |date=March 25, 2016 |access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref>

The organization is composed of two law enforcement directorates (HSI and ERO) and several support divisions each headed by a director who reports to an Executive Associate Director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/about/leadership/index.htm |title=ICE Leadership |publisher=Ice.gov |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=September 27, 2010}}</ref> The divisions of ICE provide investigation, interdiction and security services to the public and other law enforcement partners in the federal and local sectors.

The Director of ICE is appointed at the sub-cabinet level by the [[President of the United States]], [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], and reports directly to the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]].<ref name="JohnMorton">{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/about/leadership/asstsec_bio/john_morton.htm |title=Leadership: Assistant Secretary John T.

====Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)====
[[File:ICE HSI Special Response Team (SRT) training using armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|HSI Special Response Team (SRT) members training using armored vehicle at [[Fort Benning]] in Georgia.]]
HSI consists of more than 10,300 employees who are assigned to over 210 cities throughout the U.S. and 80 international offices in 53 countries across the world. Over 7,100 special agents are included among the over 10,300 HSI employees.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

HSI special agents investigate violations of more than 400 U.S. laws that threaten the national security of the United States such as counter-proliferation; counter-terrorism; human smuggling and trafficking; weapons smuggling and export enforcement; narcotics smuggling and trafficking; document and benefit fraud; the manufacturing, sale, and use of counterfeit immigration and identity documents; human rights violations; transnational gang activity; financial crimes, including money laundering and bulk cash smuggling; cyber crime; exploitation of children and sex tourism; trade crimes such as commercial fraud and intellectual property theft; smuggling of counterfeit pharmaceuticals and other merchandise; mass-marketing fraud; art theft; international cultural property and antiquities crimes; and visa security.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-ice-difficulties-20190319-story.html|title=ICE's investigative arm fears it might have a branding problem|last=Mejia|first=Brittny|date=March 19, 2019|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 19, 2019}}</ref> HSI agents can be requested to provide security for VIPs, and also augment the [[U.S. Secret Service]] during overtaxed times such as special security events and elections.

HSI was formerly known as the ICE Office of Investigations (OI). HSI special agents investigate the largest range of crimes and have the statutory authority to enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act (Title 8), U.S. customs laws (Title 19), general federal crimes (Title 18), the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (Title 21), as well as Titles 5, 6, 12, 22, 26, 28, 31, 46, 49, and 50 of the U.S. Code.

=====Intelligence=====
The Office of Intelligence is a subcomponent of HSI that employs a variety of special agents and Intelligence Research Specialists to facilitate HSI's tactical and strategic intelligence demands. Collectively, these intelligence professionals collect, analyze, and disseminate [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for use by the operational elements of DHS. The Office of Intelligence  works closely with the intelligence components of other federal, state, and local agencies. Many HSI field offices assign intelligence analysts to specific groups, such as financial crimes, counter-proliferation, narcotics, or [[Identity document forgery|document fraud]]; or they can be assigned to a residential intelligence unit, known as a Field Intelligence Group (FIG). HSI agents assigned to FIGs generally focus on Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) collection.

=====International Operations=====

International Operations, formerly known as the Office of International Affairs (OIA), is a subcomponent of HSI with agents stationed in 60 locations around the world. HSI's foreign offices, known as Attaché Offices, work with foreign governments to identify and combat transnational criminal organizations before they threaten the United States. IO also facilitates domestic HSI investigations by providing intelligence from host countries, conducting collateral investigations, and facilitating international investigations conducted by field offices within the United States.

=====Special Response Teams=====
Seventeen HSI field offices maintain a Special Response Team (SRT) that operates as a federal [[SWAT]] element for the office's area of responsibility (AOR).<ref name="Fedtacteam">{{cite report|last1=James|first1=Nathan|title=Federal Tactical Teams|date=September 3, 2015|id=CRS Report for Congress, R44179|publisher=Congressional Research Service|url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=787682}}</ref> SRT was founded under the [[U.S. Customs Service]] as the Warrant Entry and Tactical Team (WETT) and were renamed to SRT in 1998.<ref name="Fedtacteam" /> The SRT handles HSI's high-risk arrest and search warrants, barricaded subjects, rural area operations, VIP protection, sniper coverage for high-risk operations, and security for National Security Events. HSI's active SRTs are located in Tampa, Miami, Arizona (Phoenix), New Orleans, Houston, New York, Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Juan, Detroit, San Francisco, El Paso, Chicago, San Diego and Washington, D.C. There is also a team of instructors and coordinators stationed full-time in Columbus, Georgia. These teams primarily deploy to handle high-risk operations, but also assist in events such as [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Haiti earthquake 2010]], and other natural disasters around the globe.

SRT is a collateral duty open to HSI special agents assigned to an office with a certified team. To qualify, candidates must pass a physical fitness test, qualify with multiple firearms by shooting 90% or better in full tactical gear, and pass an oral interview process. If a candidate passes these stages and is voted on the local team, they are then designated "Green Team" members and allowed to train with the certified team members. Green Team members are eventually sent to the SRT Initial Certification Course at the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs, Tactical Operations Unit (OFTP/TOU) [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, where they must pass additional physical fitness, firearms, scenario-based and written assessments.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Special response teams prep for high risk situations at Ft. Benning|url=https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/top-story-special-response-teams-prep-high-risk-situations-ft-benning|website=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|access-date=September 12, 2017|date=November 30, 2011}}</ref> Out of approximately 7,100 special agents, there are currently only approximately 300 certified SRT members nationwide.

HSI SRTs often conduct training exercises with various federal, state and local teams, and also assist other teams during national events or large-scale operations that require multiple high-risk scenarios to be conducted simultaneously. The working relationship between the SRTs and the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]'s [[U.S. Special Operations Command]] has led to SOCOM providing the SRTs with excess [[Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle]]s (MRAPs), firearms, and other gear designed for the U.S. [[Special Mission Unit|Tier One]] groups.

====Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)====
[[File:ICE Arrest.jpg|thumb|right|ICE ERO officers deporting a man to [[Mexico]]]]
ERO is responsible for enforcing the nation's immigration laws and ensuring the departure of removable immigrants from the United States. ERO uses its detention and deportation officers to identify, arrest, and remove immigrants who violate U.S. immigration law.  Deportation officers are responsible for the transportation and detention of immigrants in ICE custody to include the removal of immigrants to their country of origin. Deportation officers arrest immigrants for violations of U.S. immigration law, monitor cases during deportation proceedings, supervise released immigrants, and remove immigrants from the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/careers/facesofice/conradagagan.htm |title=ICE Office of Detention and Removal (ERO) ICE Detention and Deportation Officer Conrad Agagan |publisher=Ice.gov |access-date=September 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527151046/http://www.ice.gov/careers/facesofice/ConradAgagan.htm|archive-date=May 27, 2010}}{</ref>

Deportation officers operate strategically placed Fugitive Operations Teams whose function is to locate, apprehend, and remove immigrants who have absconded from immigration proceedings and remain in the United States with outstanding warrants for deportation.

ERO manages the [[Secure Communities]] program which identifies removable immigrants located in jails and prisons. Fingerprints submitted as part of the normal criminal arrest and booking process will automatically check both the Integrated Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division and the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) of the Department of Homeland Security's US-VISIT Program.

ERO was formerly known as the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO).

====Other divisions====
The Office of State, Local and Tribal Coordination (OSLTC) is ICE's primary outreach and communications component for state, local and tribal stakeholders. It is responsible for building and improving relationships, and coordinating activities with state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies and through public engagement. It also fosters and sustains relationships with federal, state and local government officials and coordinates ICE ACCESS programs (Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security).

The Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) provides legal advice, training and services to support the ICE mission and defends the interests of the United States in the administrative and federal courts.

The Office of Professional Responsibility is responsible for investigating allegations of misconduct involving employees of ICE.

ICE Air is the aviation division of ICE that charters aircraft or books commercial flights to send deportees back to their home countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/ice-air-operations|title=ICE Air Operations|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref name="cnn.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/10/11/ice-air-deportation-flight-ts-orig.cnn|title=A rare look inside a deportation flight – CNN Video}}</ref> There are 10 aircraft used to send deportees and has a working list of 185 countries.<ref name="cnn.com"/> Deportees have legs and arms secured while boarding, handcuffs are removed during flight and all shackles removed upon disembarking.

ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) is a division that is responsible for providing direct patient care to approximately 13,500 detainees housed in 21 detention facilities throughout the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/ice-health-service-corps|title=ICE Health Service Corps|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> Their stated mission is to provide the best care to those in ICE custody, practicing on the core values of Integrity, Commitment, Accountability, Service, and Excellence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/features/health-service-corps|title=ICE Health Service Corps|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The IHSC team is made up of around 1,000 members that consist of US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officers, healthcare professionals, and federal civil service workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/ero/ihsc|title=ICE Health Service Corps|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>

===Former units===
The [[Federal Air Marshal Service]] (FAMS) was aligned into ICE shortly after the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. On October 16, 2005, Homeland Security Secretary [[Michael Chertoff]] officially approved the transfer of the Federal Air Marshal Service from the Bureau of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the TSA as part of a broader departmental reorganization to align functions consistent with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) "Second Stage Review" findings for:

* consolidating and strengthening aviation law enforcement and security at the Federal level;
* creating a common approach to stakeholder outreach; and
* improving the coordination and efficiency of aviation security operations.

As part of this realignment, the Director of the Federal Air Marshal Service also became the Assistant Administrator for the TSA Office of Law Enforcement (OLE), which houses nearly all TSA law enforcement services.

The [[Federal Protective Service (United States)|Federal Protective Service]] (FPS) was moved from the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) to ICE upon the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The FPS was later moved out of ICE to the National Protection Programs Directorate.

Originally a part of the U.S. Customs Service's Office of Investigations, the [[Office of Air and Marine]] (then called the Air and Marine Interdiction Division) was transferred to ICE in 2003 during the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, becoming the Office of Air and Marine Operations. Due in part to a 500 million dollar budgetary dispute between CBP and ICE, in 2004 ICE Air and Marine Operations was transferred to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. CBP Air and Marine still works closely with ICE to support the agency's domestic and international law enforcement operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/hot-new/pressrel/2001/0316-00.htm |title=2000 Archived Press Releases |publisher=Customs and Border Protection |date=March 16, 2001 |access-date=June 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041223213853/http://www.cbp.gov/hot-new/pressrel/2001/0316-00.htm |archive-date=December 23, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2006/03/management-mess/21284/ |title=Management Mess – Features – Magazine |publisher=GovExec.com |date=March 1, 2006 |access-date=June 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/CustomsToday/2004/oct_nov/other/welcome_air.xml |title=CBP Today – October/November 2004 – Welcome Air and Marine Operations |publisher=Customs and Border Protection |date=October 31, 2004 |access-date=June 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023174551/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/CustomsToday/2004/oct_nov/other/welcome_air.xml |archive-date=October 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govexec.com/magazine/features/2006/03/wasted-year/21283/ |title=Wasted Year |publisher=GovExec.com |date=March 2006 |access-date=June 18, 2013}}</ref>

The Office of Detention Policy and Planning was responsible developing and maintaining ICE's National Detention Standards, which set out detailed rules for how immigration detainees were to be treated differently than criminal inmates.<ref name=NYT14april17>{{cite news|last1=Dickerson|first1=Caitlin|title=Trump Plan Would Curtail Protections for Detained Immigrants |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/us/detained-immigrants-may-face-harsher-conditions-under-trump.html|access-date=April 15, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 14, 2017|page=A1}}</ref>  In April 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] decided to close the office and to stop including the standards in new jail contracts.<ref name=NYT14april17/>

==Training==
[[File:111031.ICE.HSI.OperationPipelineExpress.herb 07.jpg|thumb|right|HSI Special Response Team (SRT) drug raid during Operation Pipeline in Arizona.]]
Newly hired ICE law enforcement personnel receive their training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] in Glynco, Georgia. To meet division specific academic and practical instruction, the ICE Academy varies in length from 4 to 6 months depending on the position. Furthermore, following graduation, all ICE law enforcement personnel undergo additional post academy training, as well as career-continuous training. Specific course curriculum is kept confidential, but both ERO and HSI new hires undergo training related to basic law enforcement tactics, immigration law, firearms training, emergency response driving, and Constitutional law. HSI special agents also receive training regarding U.S. customs law, warrant service, advanced tactics, undercover operations, criminal interrogation, weapons of mass destruction, and other subjects routinely encountered by HSI special agents in the field. ERO deportation officers undergo several weeks of intensive Spanish language training prior to graduating.

==Weapons and equipment==
Since the agency's formation, a variety of weapons have been carried by its Agents and Officers.

===Previously-issued firearms===
Initially when the agency was formed in 2003, the sidearms issued to its Agents and Officers were the weapons issued by the legacy agencies: the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  The USCS issued sidearm was the [[Glock 19]] 9mm pistol.  The I&NS issued sidearm was the Heckler & Koch [[USP Compact]] .40 caliber pistol.  Both pistols were loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]].<ref>Former I&NS Special Agent</ref>

In 2009 the agency selected the [[SIG Sauer P226#P229|SIG-Sauer P229]] DAK (double action Kellerman) .40 caliber pistol as its agency issued sidearm loaded with [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]].  This weapon stayed in service from 2009 to 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shootingtimes.com/editorial/handgun_reviews_sig070606/99285|title=Department Of Homeland Security Chooses SIG's DAK|first=G&A|last=Staff|date=January 3, 2011|website=Shooting Times}}</ref>

====Sidearms====
The agency's current duty sidearm, is the [[SIG Sauer P320]]C (C for Carry) pistol, chambered in [[9×19mm Parabellum]] [[hollow point ammunition|hollow-point rounds]], utilizing a [[striker-fired]] mechanism in lieu of a [[double action only]] [[hammer-fired|hammer]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sofrep.com/news/official-ice-tells-employees-sig-320-new-gun/"It is official: ICE tells employees the Sig 320 is their new gun". NEWSREP. 24 February 2017. Retrieved 11 June 2019.}}</ref>

The agency has a list of personally owned weapons that are authorized for duty and off duty carry.  These weapons must be inspected and approved by the agency's firearms unit.  The agent and/or officer must qualify with the weapon once a quarter.<ref name="HSI Special Agent">HSI Special Agent</ref>

===Other weapons===
Agents and Officers are trained on standard shoulder fired weapons that include the [[M4 carbine]], chambered for  [[5.56×45mm NATO]] ammunition and the 12-gauge [[Remington 870]] [[shotgun]].<ref name="HSI Special Agent"/>

As [[non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]] options, Special Agents and Officers are armed with the expandable metal [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] and [[pepper spray]].<ref name="HSI Special Agent"/>

==Transnational gangs==
[[File:ICE.Arrest lg.jpg|thumb|right|ICE [[officer]] detaining a suspect]]
In February 2005, ICE began [[Operation Community Shield (2005–present)|Operation Community Shield]], a national law enforcement initiative that targets violent transnational street gangs through the use of ICE's broad law enforcement powers, including the unique and powerful authority to remove criminal immigrants, including illegal immigrants and legal permanent residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/investigations/national_security/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505234647/http://www.ice.gov/investigations/national_security/|title=investigations national security - Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Search Results|archive-date=May 5, 2009|website=www.ice.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11769667/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/operation-targets-criminal-immigrant-gangs/|title=Operation targets criminal immigrant gangs|date=March 11, 2006|work=msnbc.com|access-date=July 23, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==Immigration law==
[[Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g)]] allows ICE to establish increased cooperation and communication with state, and local law enforcement agencies. Section 287(g) authorizes the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies, permitting designated officers to perform immigration law enforcement functions, pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), provided that the local law enforcement officers receive appropriate training and function under the supervision of sworn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Under 287(g), ICE provides state and local law enforcement with the training and subsequent authorization to identify, process, and when appropriate, detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Budzinski |first=Joe |url=http://www.novatownhall.com/blog/2006/09/287g_training_from_ice_sought.php |title=287g training from ICE sought by many U.S. jurisdictions – novatownhall blog |publisher=Novatownhall.com |date=September 30, 2006 |access-date=September 27, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308201252/http://www.novatownhall.com/blog/2006/09/287g_training_from_ice_sought.php |archive-date=March 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The 287(g) program is one of several ICE ACCESS (ICE "Agreements of Cooperation in Communities to Enhance Safety and Security") programs that increase collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration enforcement agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ice.gov/oslc/iceaccess.htm |title=Office of State and Local Coordination: ICE ACCESS |publisher=Ice.gov |access-date=September 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527124335/http://www.ice.gov/oslc/iceaccess.htm |archive-date=May 27, 2010 }}</ref>

==Detention centers==
{{main|Immigration detention in the United States}}
ICE operates detention centers throughout the United States that detain [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] who are apprehended and placed into removal proceedings. About 34,000 people are held in immigration detention on any given day,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/i/immigration_detention_us/incustody_deaths/index.html |title=In-Custody Deaths |work=New York Times |first=Nina |last=Bernstein |access-date=May 26, 2010}}</ref> in over 500 detention centers, jails, and prisons nationwide.<ref name=Kalhan2010>{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Immigration Detention |ssrn=1556867 |year=2010 |author=Anil Kalhan |journal=Columbia Law Review Sidebar |pages=42–58 |volume=110 }}</ref>

Due to the United States detention bed quota, mandated by Congress, that number will increase rather than decrease. The quota mandates at least 34,000 beds available for immigrants on any given day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.immigrantjustice.org/eliminate-detention-bed-quota|title=Detention Bed Quota|website=National Immigrant Justice Center|access-date=July 5, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/19/245968601/little-known-immigration-mandate-keeps-detention-beds-full|title=Little-Known Immigration Mandate Keeps Detention Beds Full|work=NPR.org|access-date=June 11, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Under the Trump administration, the number of people being detained on any given day has increased to 52,500.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/24-immigrants-have-died-ice-custody-during-trump-administration-n1015291|title=24 immigrants have died in ICE custody during the Trump administration|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>

===Corporate contracts===

Engineering and construction firm [[Kellogg, Brown and Root]] (KBR) released a press statement on January 24, 2006, that the company had been awarded a no-bid contingency contract from the Department of Homeland Security to support its ICE facilities in the event of an emergency. The maximum total value of the contract is $385 million and consists of a one-year base period with four one-year options. KBR held the previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005. The contract provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to expand existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contract may also provide migrant detention support to other government organizations in the event of an immigration emergency, the company said.<ref>{{cite news |title=KBR Awarded U.S. Department of Homeland Security Contingency Support Project for Emergency Support Services |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060124005819/en/KBR-Awarded-U.S.-Department-Homeland-Security-Contingency |access-date=18 February 2020 |work=www.businesswire.com |publisher=Business Wire |date=24 January 2006 |language=en}}</ref>

==Criticisms==

=== Protests ===
Numerous protests have emerged across the nation in response to the Trump administration's ICE policies. Many of the protesters are occupying areas around ICE facilities in hopes of disrupting operations. The [[Occupy ICE]] movement began on June 17, 2018, outside Portland, Oregon. It initially began as a vigil for the people suffering from ICE policies but spontaneously grew into a larger movement as more people showed up. The movement ultimately spread into other major cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Diego, and New York. As the movement grew, they faced counter protesters and arrests, but protesters remained undeterred and vowed to continue fighting the Trump administration's ICE policies. As Occupy ICE groups spread to different cities, there has also been a greater amount of coordination between them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/06/occupy-ice-movement-new-york-louisville-portland|title=The growing Occupy Ice movement: 'We're here for the long haul'|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|date=2018-07-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Other grassroots protests have sprung up across the nation as well. On August 1, 2019, a month-long peaceful protest event was started outside the San Francisco ICE office, where protesters beat drums and demanded that family separation at the border be stopped.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc7news.com/5434792/|title=Peaceful protest held following overnight arrests at ICE headquarters in San Francisco|date=2019-08-02|website=ABC7 San Francisco|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> In addition to blocking ICE facilities, protesters are also protesting technology companies such as Microsoft for providing technology to aid ICE. One such instance of this was the sit in at the Microsoft store on 5th Avenue in NYC led by Close the Camps NYC on September 14, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/14/us/anti-ice-protesters-arrested/index.html|title=76 anti-ICE protesters arrested during New York sit-in|author=Amir Vera|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>  In the 2020 protests and riots in Portland, Oregon and other cities, ICE was attacked numerous times by rioters, costing Portland an estimated {{US$|23}}{{nbsp}}million in damage. <ref>{{Cite news|title = Portland Protesters bust ICE building window, Police respond with Tear Gas|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/08/20/portland-protests-ice-tear-gas/|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|title =Costs of the Damage caused by Portland Rioters (as of Aug 15th)|url = https://www.foxnews.com/us/costs-protests-financial-toll-cash-strapped-us-cities}}</ref>

===Sexual abuse===
''[[The Intercept]]'' published a report by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]] [[Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General|Office of Inspector General]] revealing that 1,224 sexual abuse complaints while in immigration custody were filed between January 2010 and June 2017. Contrary to ICE's claims, only 2% of these complaints were investigated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/04/11/immigration-detention-sexual-abuse-ice-dhs/|title=Immigration detention and sexual abuse |access-date=June 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref name="urlAt Largest ICE Detention Center in the Country, Guards Called Attempted Suicides “Failures”">{{cite web |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/10/11/adelanto-ice-detention-center-abuse/ |title=At Largest ICE Detention Center in the Country, Guards Called Attempted Suicides "Failures" }}</ref>

===Record number of deportations===
Between 2009 and 2016, the [[Barack Obama administration]] oversaw the deporting of a record 2.4 million immigrants, earning him the nickname "Deporter-In-Chief" by [[Janet Murguía]], the president of [[National Council of La Raza]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/us/low-priority-immigrants-still-swept-up-in-net-of-deportation.html|title=Low-Priority Immigrants Still Swept Up in Net of Deportation|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 25, 2016|access-date=June 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/03/04/285907255/national-council-of-la-raza-dubs-obama-deporter-in-chief|title=National Council Of La Raza Dubs Obama 'Deporter-In-Chief'|work=NPR|date=March 4, 2014|access-date=June 15, 2018|language=en}}</ref> According to ICE data, about 40% of those deported by ICE in 2015 had no criminal conviction, while a majority of those convicted were guilty of minor charges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hard-truths-about-obamas-deportation-priorities_us_58b3c9e7e4b0658fc20f979e|title=The Hard Truths About Obama's Deportation Priorities|last=Young|first=Elliott|date=February 27, 2017|website=HuffPost|language=en-US|access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref> However, this statistic is misleading, as the way in how deportations were counted was changed under the Bush administration and continued under the Obama administration. Before, people caught crossing the southern border were simply bused back and were not counted as deportations. However, with the change, these people were fingerprinted and added to the deportation tally, giving the Obama administration a record number of deportations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-deported-more-people/|title=Were More People Deported Under the Obama Administration Than Any Other?|website=Snopes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>

Detained children have also been given up for adoption. In a series of court cases, foster families were successfully able to gain full custody of migrant children that they were housing without notifying their parents.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=No, the Government Did Not Make the Deadline to Reunify Children With Their Parents|doi = 10.1163/2210-7975_hrd-9970-20180211}}</ref> Most notably, the agency Bethany Christian Services, an agency that facilitates the care of foster children in Michigan has been under fire for trying to promote the adoption of these migrant children instead of trying to reunite them with their families.

This policy in particular has led to the [[Abolish ICE]] movement gaining traction in June 2018.

===Wrongful arrests and detentions===
From 2012 to early 2018, ICE wrongfully arrested and detained 1,488 U.S. citizens, including many who spent months or years in immigration detention.<ref name="LATimes2018">{{cite news|first1=Paige|last1=St. John|first2=Joel|last2=Rubin|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-citizens-ice-20180427-htmlstory.html|title=ICE held an American man in custody for 1,273 days.

Some of the wrongfully detained U.S. citizens had been arrested by ICE more than once.<ref name="LATimes2018"/> The inaccurate government data that ICE used had shown that both immigrants and U.S. citizens were both targets of being detained.

=== Sanctuary cities ===
[[Sanctuary city|Sanctuary cities]] are cities that limit their cooperation with ICE. When a person is arrested, his or her information is placed into a federal database that ICE can access. In a non-sanctuary city, ICE can ask the police to hold the illegal immigrant until they can pick him or her up. However, sanctuary cities believe this is unconstitutional and view being an illegal immigrant as not a crime but a civil violation. As such, the top officials of sanctuary cities prevent the police from holding an illegal immigrant for being undocumented by policy or ordinance. Notwithstanding, illegal immigrants in police custody have committed criminal violations unrelated to illegal immigration that landed them in jail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americasvoice.org/blog/what-is-a-sanctuary-city/|title=Immigration 101: What is a Sanctuary City?|last=Voice|first=Americas's|date=2017-04-25|website=America's Voice|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> Sanctuary cities are one of the many focal points for the Trump administration's attempts to reform the country's immigration policies.
