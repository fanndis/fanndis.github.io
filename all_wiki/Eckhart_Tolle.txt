==Early life and education==
Born '''Ulrich Leonard Tölle''' in [[Lünen]], a small town located north of [[Dortmund]] in the Ruhr Valley, [[Germany]] in 1948,<ref name=NYT-wisdom/><ref name=Indy/><ref name=Lunen>Ruhr Nachrichten (2008-05-27).

Retrieved 2010-06-03.</ref> Tolle describes his childhood as unhappy—particularly his early childhood in Germany.  His parents fought and eventually separated, and he felt alienated due to a hostile school environment.<ref name=int/> He also experienced considerable fear and anxiety growing up in post-war Germany, where he would play in bombed-out buildings. He later stated that pain "was in the energy field of the country".<ref name="VanSun">Douglas Todd (2002-10-05).

''The Independent''.</ref><ref name=int/>

At the age of 15, he read several books written by the German [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[Joseph Anton Schneiderfranken]], also known as Bô Yin Râ. Tolle has said he responded "very deeply" to those books.<ref name="int">{{Cite book|title=Dialogues With Emerging Spiritual Teachers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBUvTKSeJvEC| last=Parker|first=John W.|publisher=Sagewood Press|year=2000|isbn=9781440116315|location=Fort Collins, CO}}</ref>

At the age of 19, he moved to [[England]] and taught German and Spanish for three years at a [[London]] school for language studies.<ref name="TeleMag">Claire Scobie (2003-08-31).

==Inner transformation==
One night in 1977, at the age of 29, after having suffered from long periods of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], Tolle says he experienced an "inner transformation".<ref name="NY" /> That night he awakened from his sleep, suffering from feelings of depression that were "almost unbearable," but then experienced a life-changing [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].<ref name="int" />  Recounting the experience, he says,
{{quote|I couldn’t live with myself any longer. And in this a question arose without an answer: who is the ‘I’ that cannot live with the self? What is the self? I felt drawn into a void! I didn’t know at the time that what really happened was the mind-made self, with its heaviness, its problems, that lives between the unsatisfying past and the fearful future, collapsed. It dissolved. The next morning I woke up and everything was so peaceful. The peace was there because there was no self. Just a sense of presence or "[[being]]ness," just observing and watching.<ref name="TeleMag" />}}

Tolle recalls going out for a walk in London the next morning, and finding that "everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic."<ref name="int" /> The feeling continued, and he began to feel a strong underlying sense of peace in any situation.<ref name="Macleans" /> He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, "in a state of deep bliss," on park benches in [[Russell Square]], Central London, "watching the world go by." He stayed with friends, in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]], or otherwise [[homelessness|slept rough]] on [[Hampstead Heath]]. His family thought him "irresponsible, even insane."<ref name="TeleMag" />  He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the German philosopher and mystic, [[Meister Eckhart]].<ref name="Indy" /><ref name="USAtoday">Cathy Lynn Grossman (2010-15-04).

==Teachings==
{{See also|The Power of Now|A New Earth}}
Tolle writes in the introduction of his second book, ''Stillness Speaks'': <blockquote>A true spiritual teacher does not have anything to teach in the conventional sense of the word, does not have anything to give or add to you, such as new information, beliefs, or rules of conduct. The only function of such a teacher is to help you remove that which separates you from the truth ... The words are no more than signposts.<ref name=StillnessSpeaks>{{cite book |title=Stillness Speaks  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcfueLfqxR8C&q=Eckhart%20Tolle&pg=PR2 |last=Tolle |first=Eckhart |year=2003 |publisher=New World Library |isbn=978-1-57731-400-4}}</ref></blockquote>

He says that his book ''The Power of Now'' is "a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions".<ref name=PoN6>Tolle, ''[[The Power of Now]]'' (2005 edition), p. 6</ref> He writes that religions "have become so overlaid with extraneous matter that their spiritual substance has become almost completely obscured",<ref name=PoN6/> that they have become "to a large extent ... divisive rather than unifying forces" and become "themselves part of the insanity".<ref>Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 15</ref>

Tolle writes that "the most significant thing that can happen to a human being [is] the separation process of thinking and awareness" and that awareness is "the space in which thoughts exist".<ref>Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 261–262</ref>  Tolle says that "the primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it".<ref>Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 96</ref>

According to his official website, "at the core of Tolle's teachings lies the transformation of consciousness, a spiritual awakening that he sees as the next step in human evolution. An essential aspect of this awakening consists in transcending our ego-based state of consciousness. This is a prerequisite not only for personal happiness but also for the ending of violent conflict endemic on our planet".<ref name=bioOW/>

In his book ''A New Earth'', he describes a major aspect of the human dysfunction as "ego" or an "illusory sense of self"<ref>Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 27</ref> based on unconscious identification with one's memories and thoughts,<ref>Tolle, ''[[A New Earth]]'', p. 29</ref> and another major aspect he calls "pain-body"<ref name="NY"/> or "an accumulation of old emotional pain".<ref>Tolle, ''A New Earth'', p. 140</ref>

He often talks about the relevance of figures in intellectual or popular culture. In ''A New Earth'', he quotes [[René Descartes]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name=NYT-wisdom/><ref name=USAtoday/><ref name=NewEarth/>

Some critics characterize his books as unoriginal or derivative. A 2009 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article said he is "hardly the first writer to tap into the American longing for meaning and success".<ref name=NYT-wisdom/>  Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', said Tolle's writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that tell you how to be happier, more peaceful and more successful.<ref name=NYT-wisdom/>  James Robinson in ''[[The Observer]]'' called his writings "a mix of [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-science]], [[New Age]] philosophy, and teaching borrowed from established religions".<ref>James Robinson (2008-03-09).

Others praise his re-working and synthesis of traditions. New Age writer [[William Bloom]] wrote that "Tolle is offering a very contemporary synthesis of Eastern spiritual teaching, which is normally so clothed in arcane language that it is incomprehensible", thereby providing "a valuable perspective on Western culture".<ref name=Indy /> Publisher Judith Kendra says, "The ideas [that Tolle is] talking about have been in existence for thousands of years in both Eastern texts and with the great Western mystics, but he's able to make them understandable".<ref name=Indy />  Musician [[Annie Lennox]] said he "has some kind of special quality that I've never encountered before".<ref name=Indy />

====Reception by Christian theologians====
Christian scholars have differing opinions on the compatibility of Tolle's ideas with [[Christianity]].

James Beverley, professor of Christian Thought and Ethics at the evangelical [[Tyndale University College and Seminary|Tyndale Seminary in Toronto]], says that Tolle's worldview "is at odds with central Christian convictions" and that "Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus".<ref name="Macleans" /> [[John G. Stackhouse, Jr.|John Stackhouse]], a professor of theology and culture at evangelical [[Regent College]] in Vancouver, says that he "gives a certain segment of the population exactly what they want: a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser, that is, established religions".<ref name="Macleans" /> Stackhouse has described him as one of several spiritual teachers who "purport to have investigated the world’s religions (quite a claim) and found them wanting, who routinely subject those religions to withering criticism, and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.johnstackhouse.com/2009/10/22/eckhart-tolle-the-mask-of-stresslessness-hiding-a-deep-bitter-anger/ | title=Eckhart Tolle: Does the Mask of "Stresslessness" Hide a Deep, Bitter Anger? | access-date=2013-07-28}}</ref>

Conversely, Stafford Betty, teacher for Religious Studies at [[California State University, Bakersfield]] finds common ground between Tolle's worldview and that of Christian mystics. He notes that "one of the key elements in Tolle's teaching is that deep within the mind is absolute stillness in which one can experience 'the joy of Being'".<ref name="NatCath">Stafford Betty (2008-04-18), [http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2008b/041808/041808t.htm "Eckhart Tolle's message is positive, but is it Christian?]".  ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', 44.17, p. 22(2)</ref> Roman Catholic priest and theologian [[Richard Rohr]] credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians: "Tolle is, in fact, rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition ... [which is] both the ground and the process for breaking through to the theological contemplation of God, and acquired contemplation of Jesus, the Gospels, and all spiritual things."<ref>[[Richard Rohr|Rohr, Richard]]. [https://www.eckharttolle.com/article/Spirituality-And-The-Christian-Tradition "Eckhart Tolle and the Christian Tradition"]. ''EckhartTolle.com''. Retrieved November 17, 2016.</ref>

In 2008, ''[[The Independent]]'' noted that "Tolle's theories are certainly seen by many as profoundly non-Christian, even though Tolle often quotes from the Bible," but that "Tolle does have fans in academic, even Christian, circles".<ref name="Indy" /> It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at [[All Hallows College]] in Dublin, who wrote, "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make our way through the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being."<ref name="Indy" />
