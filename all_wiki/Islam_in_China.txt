The [[Silk Road]], which was a series of extensive inland trade routes that spread all over the Mediterranean to East Asia, was used since 1000 BC and continued to be used for millennia. During this large period of time, most of the traders were Muslim and moved towards the East. Not only did these traders bring their goods, they also carried with them their culture and beliefs to East Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guides.library.cornell.edu/IslamAsiaExhibit/SilkRoadIslam|title=LibGuides: Exhibition: Islam in Asia: Diversity in Past and Present: The Silk Road & Islam Spread|last=Houissa|first=Ali|website=guides.library.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110000330/http://guides.library.cornell.edu/IslamAsiaExhibit/SilkRoadIslam|archive-date=2019-11-10|url-status=live}}</ref> Islam was one of the many religions that gradually began to spread across the Silk Road during the "7th to the 10th centuries through war, trade and diplomatic exchanges."<ref>Dru C.

The early Tang dynasty had a cosmopolitan culture, with intensive contacts with Central Asia and significant communities of (originally non-Muslim) Central and Western Asian merchants resident in Chinese cities, which helped the introduction of Islam.<ref name=lipman25/> The first major [[Muslims|Muslim]] settlements in China consisted of [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Persians|Persian]] merchants,<ref>{{harvnb|Israeli|2002|p=291}}</ref> with comparatively well-established, even if somewhat segregated, mercantile Muslim communities existing in the port cities of [[Guangzhou]], [[Quanzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]] on China's southeastern seaboard, as well as in the interior centers such as [[Xi'an|Chang'an]], [[Kaifeng]] and [[Yangzhou]] during the Tang and especially [[Song dynasty|Song]] eras.<ref name=lipman26>{{harvnb|Lipman|1997|pp=26–27}}</ref> It is recorded in 758, Arab and Persian pirates who probably had their base in a port on the island of Hainan, sacked Guangzhou, causing some of the trade to divert to Northern Vietnam and the Chaozhou area, near the Fujian border.

Similarly, around [[879]], rebels killed around 120,000–200,000 mostly Arab and Persian foreigners in [[Guanzhou]] in the [[Guangzhou massacre]]. It is believed that the profile of Muslims as traders led to the government ignoring Muslims in the 845 [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], even though it virtually extinguished [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christianity]] in China.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drPQaUGOJQIC&q=abu+giafar+chinese&pg=PA138|title=Confucianism and its rivals|author=Herbert Allen Giles|accessdate=2011-12-14|edition=|series=|volume=|year=1926|publisher=Forgotten Books|location=|isbn=978-1-60680-248-9|page=139|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603045818/http://books.google.com/books?id=drPQaUGOJQIC&pg=PA138&dq=abu+giafar+chinese&hl=en&ei=LPTmToPPEsHj0QHPm4nWCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=harun%20raschid%20less%20obtrusive&f=false|archive-date=2013-06-03|url-status=live|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJqCAAAAIAAJ&q=According+to+Giles,+the+true+stock+of+the+present+Chinese+Mohammedans+was+a+small+army+of+four+thousand+Arabian+soldiers,+who,+being+sent+by+the+Khaleef+Abu+Giafar+in+755+to+aid+in+putting+down+a+rebellion,+were+subsequently+permitted&pg=PA150|title=China: its history, arts and literature, Volume 2|author=Frank Brinkley|accessdate=2011-12-14 |edition= |series= |volume=Volumes 9–12 of Trübner's oriental series |year=1902 |publisher=J.B.Millet company |location=BOSTON AND TOKYO |isbn=|pages=149, 150, 151, 152}}Original from the University of California</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ukVAAAAYAAJ&q=According+to+Giles,+the+true+stock+of+the+present+Chinese+Mohammedans+was+a+small+army+of+four+thousand+Arabian+soldiers,+who,+being+sent+by+the+Khaleef+Abu+Giafar+in+755+to+aid+in+putting+down+a+rebellion,+were+subsequently+permitted&pg=PA150|title=Japan &#x5B;and China&#x5D;: China; its history, arts and literature|author=Frank Brinkley|accessdate=2011-12-14 |edition= |series= |volume=Volume 10 of Japan [and China]: Its History, Arts and Literature |year=1904 |publisher=Jack |location=LONDON 34 HENRIETTA STREET, W.

The founder of the [[Ming dynasty]], [[Hongwu Emperor]], led Muslim generals like [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]] against the Mongols, whom they defeated in combat. As he made more achievements, Lan Yu became more arrogant, self-indulgent and unbridled. He started abusing his power and status and behaved violently and recklessly, sometimes even showing disrespect towards the emperor. Once, after he seized land from peasants in Dongchang (東昌), an official questioned him on his actions, but Lan Yu drove the official away in anger. In another incident, after Lan Yu returned from a campaign in the north, he arrived at Xifeng Pass (喜峰關), where the guards denied him entry as it was already late at night, but Lan led his men to force his way through. When he was away at war, Lan Yu sometimes also demoted officers at his own will and defied orders, to the extent of going to battle without permission. During his appointment as the Crown Prince's Tutor, Lan Yu was unhappy that his post was lower than the dukes of Song and Ying, so he exclaimed, "Am I not fit to be the Imperial Tutor (太師)?"[3] Some Muslim communities had a name in Chinese which meant "baracks" or "thanks," which many Hui Muslims claim comes from the gratitude which Chinese people have towards them for their role in defeating the Mongols.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkJwAAAAMAAJ&q=popular+belief+mongols|title=Muslim Chinese: ethnic nationalism in the People's Republic|author=Dru C.

The Muslims in the [[semu]] class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the [[Ispah Rebellion]], but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.

====Anti-Muslim persecution by the Yuan dynasty and Ispah rebellion====
{{main|Ispah rebellion}}
The Yuan dynasty started passing anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws and getting rid of Semu Muslim privileges towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, in 1340 forcing them to follow Confucian principles in marriage regulations, in 1329 all foreign holy men including Muslims had tax exemptions revoked, in 1328 the position of Muslim Qadi was abolished after its powers were limited in 1311. In the middle of the 14th century this caused Muslims to start rebelling against Mongol Yuan rule and joining rebel groups. In 1357-1367 the Yisibaxi Muslim Persian garrison started the [[Ispah rebellion]] against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and southern Fujian. Persian merchants Amin ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din) Saifuding led the revolt. Persian official Yawuna assassinated both Amin ud-Din and Saif ud-Din in 1362 and took control of the Muslim rebel forces. The Muslim rebels tried to strike north and took over some parts of Xinghua but were defeated at Fuzhou two times and failed to take it. Yuan provincial loyalist forces from Fuzhou defeated the Muslim rebels in 1367 after A Muslim rebel officer named Jin Ji defected from Yawuna.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=121 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&pg=PA121 |volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China}}</ref>

The Muslim merchants in Quanzhou who engaged in maritime trade enriched their families which encompassed their political and trade activities as families. Historians see the violent Chinese backlash that happened at the end of the Yuan dynasty against the wealth of the Muslim and Semu as something inevitable, however anti-Muslim and anti-Semu laws had already been passed by the Yuan dynasty. In 1340 all marriages had to follow Confucian rules, in 1329 all foreign holy men and clerics including Muslims no longer were exempt from tax, in 1328 the Qadi (Muslim headmen) were abolished after being limited in 1311. This resulted in anti-Mongol sentiment among Muslims so some anti-Mongol rebels in the mid 14th century were joined by Muslims. Quanzhou came under control of Amid ud-Din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-Din (Saifuding), two Persian military officials in 1357 as they revolted against the Mongols from 1357-1367 in southern Fujian and Quanzhou, leading the Persian garrison (Ispah) They fought for Fuzhou and Xinghua for 5 years. Both Saifuding and Amiliding were murdered by another Muslim called Nawuna in 1362 so he then took control of Quanzhou and the Ispah garrison for 5 more years until his defeat by the Yuan.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John W. |title=The Muslim Merchants of Premodern China: The History of a Maritime Asian Trade Diaspora, 750–1400 |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1108640091 |page=157 |series=New Approaches to Asian History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfBmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA157}}</ref>

====Yuan Massacres of Muslims====
The historian Chen Dasheng theorized that Sunni-Shia sectarian war contributed to the Ispah rebellion, claiming that the Pu family and their in-law Yawuna were Sunnis and there before the Yuan while Amiliding and Saifuding's Persian soldiers were Shia originally in central China and moved to Quanzhou and that Jin Ji was a Shia who defected to Chen Youding after Sunni Yawuna killed Amiliding and Saifuding. Three fates befell the Muslims and foreigners in Quanzhou, the ones in the Persian garrison were slaughtered, many Persians and Arab merchants fled abroad by ships, another small group that adopted Chinese culture were expelled into coastal Baiqi, Chendi, Lufu and Zhangpu and mountainous Yongchun and Dehua and one other part took refuge in Quanzhou's mosques. The genealogies of Muslim families which survived the transition are the main source of information for the rebellion times. The Rongshan Li family, one of the Muslim survivors of the violence in the Yuan-Ming transition period wrote about their ancestors Li Lu during the rebellion who was a businessman and shipped things, using his private stores to feed hungry people during the rebellion and using his connections to keep safe. The Ming takeover after the end of the Persian garrison meant that the diaspora of incoming Muslims ended. After the Persian garrison full and the rebellion was crushed, the common people started a slaughter of the Pu family and all Muslims: ''All of the Western peoples were annihilated, with a number of foreigners with large noses mistakenly killed while for three days the gates were closed and the executions were carried out. The corpses of the Pus were all stripped naked, their faces to the west. ... They were all judged according to the "five mutilating punishments" and then executed with their carcasses throwing into pig troughs. This was in revenge for their murder and rebellion in the Song.’’<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=122 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&pg=PA122 |volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China}}</ref> (“是役也，凡西域人尽歼之，胡发高鼻有误杀者，闭门行诛三日。”“凡蒲尸皆裸体，面西方……悉令具五刑而诛之，弃其哉于猪槽中。”)<ref>{{cite news |title=朱元璋为什么要将蒲寿庚家族中男的世世为奴，女的代代为娼？ |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/336088558_120049831 |agency=Sohu |date=2019-08-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=蒲寿庚背叛宋朝投降元朝，为何蒲家后人却遭到元廷残酷打压！ |url=https://www.360kuai.com/pc/9ff5e9a894a3ff2c9?cota=3&kuai_so=1&sign=360_7bc3b157 |accessdate=2020-02-07 |work=360kuai}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=南宋胡商蒲寿庚背叛南宋，他的子孙在明朝遭到怎样的对待？ |url=https://share.wukongwenda.cn/answer/6657878697367830798/ |work=wukongwenda}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=朱元璋最恨的一个姓，男的世世为奴，女的世世代代为娼！ |url=https://xw.qq.com/cmsid/20190820A05CQO00 |work=优质资讯推荐 |date=2019-08-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=朱元璋为什么要将蒲寿庚家族中男的世世为奴，女的代代为娼？ |url=https://new.qq.com/omn/20190824/20190824A0DKV100.html?pc |work=优质资讯推荐 |date=2019-08-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=此人屠殺三千宋朝皇族，死後被人挖墳鞭屍，朱元璋：家族永世為娼 原文網址：https://kknews.cc/history/xqx8g3q.html |url=https://kknews.cc/history/xqx8g3q.html |work=每日頭條 |agency=每日頭條 |date=2018-05-22  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=蒲寿庚背叛宋朝投降元朝，为何蒲家后人却遭到元廷残酷打压 |url=https://k.sina.cn/article_1141244644_440602e400100fs2v.html |work=新浪首页 |agency=新浪首页 |date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=此人屠杀三千宋朝皇族，死后被人挖坟鞭尸，朱元璋：家族永世为娼 |url=http://www.bajieyou.com/new/fc234fa20f0e4a9cba16fe2aca95b030 |work=最新新闻 英雄联盟 |agency=最新新闻 英雄联盟 |date=2019-11-26 }}</ref> 

80 merchant ships were commanded by Fo Lian, from Bahrain who was Pu Shougeng's son-in-law. The Qais born Supterintendent of Taxes for Persian and the Island, Jamal al-din Ibrahim Tibi had a son who was sent in 1297-1305 as an envoy to China. Wassaf, and Arab historian said that Jamal became wealthy due to trade with India and China. Patronage networks and monopolies controlled Yuan maritime trade unlike in the Song dynasty where foreigners and Chinese of the Song merchant elite reaped profits. Quanzhou's end as an international trading port was rapid as in 1357 rebellions borke out in central China so the Persian merchants Amin ud-din (Amiliding) and Saif ud-din (Saifuding) led soldiers to take over Quanzhou. A Pu family relative by marriage, Yawuna, another Muslim assassinated those two. The Muslim rebels of the Persian garrison in Quanzhou lasted a decade by exploiting maritime trade and plunder. Yawuna and his army were captured and defeated by provincial forces in 1366 and then the Ming took over Quanzhou 2 years later in 1368. Maritime trade was regulated and implemented extremely differently in the Ming dynasty. Guangzhou, Ningbo and Quanzhou all had maritime trade offices but they were limited to specific areas. The South Sea trade was no longer permitted in Quanzhou and only trade with Ryukyu was allowed in Quanzhou. The Muslim community in Quanzhou became a target of the people's anger. In the streets there was widescale slaughter of "big nosed" westerners and Muslims as recorded in a genealogical account of a Muslim family. The era of Quanzhou as an international trading port of Asia ended as did the role of Muslims as merchant diaspora in Quanzhou. Some Muslims fled by sea or land as they were persecuted by the locals and others tried to hide and lay low as depicted in the genealogies of Quanzhou Muslims despite the Ming emperors attempted to issue laws tolerating Islam in 1407 and 1368 and putting the notices in mosques.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaffee |first1=John |editor1-last=Hall |editor1-first=Kenneth R. |title=Secondary Cities and Urban Networking in the Indian Ocean Realm, C. 1400-1800 |date=2008 |publisher=Lexington Books |series=G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |isbn=978-0739128350 |page=115 |volume=Volume 1 of Comparative urban studies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gyPjBevBHxcC&pg=PA115 |chapter=4 At the Intersection of Empire and World Trade: The Chinese Port City of Quanzhou (Zaitun), Eleventh-Fifteenth Centuries}}</ref> Qais was the island of [[Kish Island|Kish]] and its king Jamal al-Din Ibrahim bin Muhammad al-Tibi briefly seized control of Hormuz while he traded with China and India and earned great wealth from it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Hyunhee |title=Mapping the Chinese and Islamic Worlds: Cross-Cultural Exchange in Pre-Modern Asia |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1107018686 |page=151 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-2iWcxD2e8C&pg=PA151}}</ref>

One of Sayyid [[Ajall Shams al-Din Omar]]'s descendants, the [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]] [[Ding (surname)|Ding]] fled to Chendai (Jinjiang]] on the coast of Quanzhou to avoid the violence of the Ispah rebellion. The Li family survived through philanthropy activities however they said that in the rebellion "great families scattered from their homes, which were burned by the soldiers, and few genealogies survived." and used the words "a bubbling cauldron" to describe Quanzhou. In 1368 Quanzhou came under Ming control and the atmosphere calmed down for the Muslims. The Ming [[Yongle emperor]] issued decrees of protection from individuals and officials in mosques such as Quanzhou mosques and his father before him [[Ming Taizu]] had support from Muslim generals in his wars to reunify the country so he showed tolerance to them. The Ming passed some laws saying that Muslims not use Chinese surnames. Some genealogies of Muslims like the Li family show debate over teaching Confucian culture and classics like [[The Book of Odes|Odes]] and [[Book of Documents|History]] or to practice Islam. Ming Taizu passed laws concerning maritime trade which were the major impact upon the life of Quanzhou Muslims. He restricted official maritime trade in Quanzhou to [[Ryukyu]] and [[Guangzhou]] was to monopolize south sea trade in the 1370s and 1403-1474 after initial getting rid of the Office of Maritime Trade altogether in 1370. Up to the late 16th century, private trade was banned.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liu 刘 |first1=Yingsheng 迎胜 |editor1-last=Schottenhammer |editor1-first=Angela |title=The East Asian Mediterranean: Maritime Crossroads of Culture, Commerce and Human Migration |date=2008 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3447058094 |page=123 |edition=illustrated |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSA_AaRdgioC&pg=PA123 |volume=Volume 6 of East Asian economic and socio-cultural studies: East Asian maritime history |issn=1860-1812 |chapter=Muslim Merchants in Mongol Yuan China}}</ref>

Persian Sunni Muslims Sayf al-din (Sai-fu-ding) and Awhad al-Din (A-mi-li-ding) started the Ispah rebellion in 1357 against the Yuan dynasty in Quanzhou and attempted to reach Fuzhou, capital of Fujian. Yuan general Chen Youding defeated the Muslim rebels and slaughtered Muslims of foreign descent in Quanzhou and areas next to Quanzhou. This led to many Muslim foreign fleeing to Java and other places in Southeast Asia to escape the massacres, spreading the Islamic religion. [[Gresik]] was ruled by a person from China's Guangdong province and it had a thousand Chinese families who moved there in the 14th century with the name Xin Cun (New Village) in Chinese. THis information was reported by [[Ma Huan]] who accompanied [[Zheng He]] to visit Java in the 15th century. Ma Huan also mentions Guangdong was the source of many Muslims from China who moved to Java.  Cu Cu/Jinbun was said to be Chinese. And like most Muslims form China, [[Wali Sanga]] [[Sunan Giri]] was Hanafi according to [[Stamford Raffles]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wain |first1=Alexander |editor1-last=Peacock |editor1-first=A. C.

In 1366 the Mongols slaughtered the Sunni Muslims of Quanzhou and ended the rebellion. The Yuan dynasty's violent end saw repeated slaughters of Muslims until the Ming dynasty in 1368. The role of trade in Quanzhou ended as Sunni Muslims fled to Southeast Asia from Quanzhou. The surviving Muslims who fled Quanzhou moved to Manila bay, Brunei, Sumatra, Java and Champa to trade. Zheng He's historian Ma Huan noticed the presence of these Muslim traders in Southeast Asia who had fled form China in his voyages in [[Barus]] in Sumatra, [[Trengganu]] on the Malayan peninsula, Brunei and Java. The Nine Wali Sanga who converted Java to Islam had Chinese names and originated from Chinese speaking Quanzhou Muslims who fled there in the 14th century around 1368. The [[Suharto]] regime banned talk about this after Mangaradja Parlindungan, a Sumatran Muslim engineer wrote about it in 1964.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Anthony |title=A History of Southeast Asia: Critical Crossroads |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |series=Blackwell History of the World |isbn=978-1118512951 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBX1BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102}}</ref>

During the following [[Ming dynasty]], Muslims continued to be influential around government circles. Six of Ming dynasty founder [[Hongwu Emperor]]'s most trusted generals are said to have been Muslim, including [[Lan Yu (general)|Lan Yu]] who, in 1388, led a strong imperial Ming army out of the [[Great Wall]] and won a decisive victory over the Mongols in Mongolia, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China.

The Ming policy towards the Islamic religion was tolerant, while their racial policy towards ethnic minorities was of integration through forced marriage. Muslims were allowed to practice Islam, but if they were members of other ethnic groups they were required by law to intermarry, so Hui had to marry Han since they were different ethnic groups, with the Han often converting to Islam. 

Integration was mandated through intermarriage by Ming law, ethnic minorities had to marry people of other ethnic groups. The Chinese during the Ming dynasty also tried to force foreigners like the Hui into marrying Chinese women.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims |first=Donald |last=Daniel Leslie |publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology |page=15 |year=1998 |accessdate=2011-12-15 |url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}</ref> Marriage between upper class Han Chinese and Hui Muslims was low, since upper class Han Chinese men would both refuse to marry Muslim women, and forbid their daughters from marrying Muslim men, since they did not want to convert due to their upper class status.

When the [[Qing dynasty]] invaded the Ming dynasty in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists led by Muslim leaders Milayin, Ding Guodong and Ma Shouying led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the [[Manchu conquest of China#The northwest|Milayin rebellion]] in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin and Ding Guodong killed.

The Muslim revolt in the northwest occurred due to violent and bloody infighting between Muslim groups, the [[Gedimu]], [[Khafiya]] and [[Jahriyya]]. The rebellion in Yunnan occurred because of repression by Qing officials,  resulting in five bloody [[Hui people|Hui]] rebellions, most notably the [[Panthay Rebellion]], which occurred in [[Yunnan]] province from 1855 to 1873 and the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]], which occurred mostly in [[Xinjiang]], [[Shensi]] and [[Gansu]], from 1862 to 1877.

Elisabeth Allès wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the [[Henan]] area, with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas.

However, many Muslims like [[Ma Zhan'ao]], [[Ma Anliang]], [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Qianling]] and [[Ma Ju-lung (Nationalist general)|Ma Julung]] defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang exterminate the Muslim rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the [[Khafiya]] sect, and they helped Qing massacre Jahariyya rebels. General Zuo moved the Han around Hezhou out of the area and relocated them as a reward for the Muslims there helping Qing kill other Muslim rebels.

In 1895, another [[Dungan Revolt (1895)|Dungan Revolt]] broke out, and loyalist Muslims like [[Dong Fuxiang]], [[Ma Anliang]], [[Ma Guoliang]], [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]] suppressed and massacred the rebel Muslims led by [[Ma Dahan]], [[Ma Yonglin]] and [[Ma Wanfu]]. A Muslim army called the [[Kansu Braves]] led by General [[Dong Fuxiang]] fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. They included well known generals like [[Ma Anliang]], [[Ma Fulu]] and [[Ma Fuxiang]].

In [[Yunnan]], the Qing armies exterminated only the Muslims who had rebelled and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising.<ref>{{harvnb|Dillon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&pg=PA77 77]}}</ref>

In addition to sending Han exiles convicted of crimes to Xinjiang to be slaves of Banner garrisons there, the Qing also practiced reverse exile, exiling Inner Asian (Mongol, Russian and Muslim criminals from Mongolia and Inner Asia) to [[China proper]] where they would serve as slaves in Han Banner garrisons in Guangzhou.

==Sectarian tensions==
===Hui-Uyghur tension===
Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs arise because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs in the past, and crushed the Uyghurs' revolts.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=311}} Xinjiang's Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebellion troops in 1933 known as the [[Kizil massacre]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNlwAAAAMAAJ&q=kizil+massacre|title=Great Britain and Chinese, Russian and Japanese interests in Sinkiang, 1918–1934|author=Lars-Erik Nyman|year=1977|publisher=Esselte studium|location=Stockholm|isbn=978-91-24-27287-6|page=111|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people,  “Kill the Han, kill the Hui.” is a common cry spread across social media among Uyghur extremists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/3099950/china-muslim-hui-xinjiang-uighur-islam/ |title=If China Is Anti-Islam, Why Are These Chinese Muslims Enjoying a Faith Revival |last=Beech |first=Hannah |publisher=TIME |date=August 12, 2014 |website=Time magazine |access-date=June 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617172027/http://time.com/3099950/china-muslim-hui-xinjiang-uighur-islam/ |archive-date=2017-06-17 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> Some Uyghurs in [[Kashgar]] remember that the Hui army at the [[Battle of Kashgar (1934)]] massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China.{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=113}} Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries.<ref name="Van Wie Davis">{{cite web|url=https://www.apcss.org/Publications/APCSS--%20Uyghur%20Muslim%20Separatism%20in%20Xinjiang.doc |title=Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China |last=Van Wie Davis |first=Elizabath |publisher=Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies |accessdate=2010-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617011421/http://apcss.org/Publications/APCSS--%20Uyghur%20Muslim%20Separatism%20in%20Xinjiang.doc |archivedate=2009-06-17 |df= }}</ref> Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques.<ref>{{cite book| first = William |last=Safran| title = Nationalism and ethnoregional identities in China| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=MT0VFdKklYoC |p=35}}| accessdate = 2011-01-11| year = 1998| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-7146-4921-4| page = 35 }}</ref>

The Uyghur militant organization [[East Turkestan Islamic Movement]]'s magazine ''Islamic Turkistan'' has accused the Chinese "Muslim Brotherhood" (the [[Yihewani]]) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the "infidel Chinese" language is the language of the Hui.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Zenn |first=Jacob |date=March 17, 2011 <!-- 05:10 PM --> |title=Jihad in China?

=== Hui sects ===
{{main|Muslim groups in China}}

There have been many occurrences of [[Muslim groups in China#Infighting between sects|violent sectarian fighting between different Hui sects]]. Sectarian fighting between Hui sects led to the Jahriyya rebellion in the 1780s and the 1895 revolt. After a hiatus after the People's Republic of China came to power, sectarian in fighting resumed in the 1990s in Ningxia between different sects. Several sects refuse to intermarry with each other. One Sufi sect circulated an anti-Salafi pamphlet in Arabic. Salafi movement, which is increasing in China due to fund from [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar]], [[Kuwait]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], both are major backers of Salafism, had facilitated a number of Chinese Salafi mosques. Some Hui Salafists have joined [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Tibetan Muslims===
In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]], but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.<ref name="Demick">{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-06-28 |date=23 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archivedate=June 22, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking [[Tibetan Muslims|Kache]] minority of Muslims).<ref name="Mayaram 2009 75">{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| accessdate = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 978-0-415-99194-0| page = 75 }}</ref>

===Genetics===
The East Asian O3-M122 Y chromosome Haplogroup is found in large quantities in other Muslims close to the Hui like Dongxiang, Bo'an and Salar. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi=10.1038/srep38656| pmid=27924949| pmc=5141421| title=Genetic evidence for an East Asian origin of Chinese Muslim populations Dongxiang and Hui| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=6| pages=38656| year=2016| last1=Yao| first1=Hong-Bing| last2=Wang| first2=Chuan-Chao| last3=Tao| first3=Xiaolan| last4=Shang| first4=Lei| last5=Wen| first5=Shao-Qing| last6=Zhu| first6=Bofeng| last7=Kang| first7=Longli| last8=Jin| first8=Li| last9=Li| first9=Hui| df=| bibcode=2016NatSR...638656Y}}</ref>

An early historical estimate of the Muslim population of the then [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] belongs to the Christian missionary [[Marshall Broomhall]]. In his book, published in 1910, he produced estimates for each province, based on the reports of missionaries working there, who had counted mosques, talked to [[mullah]]s, etc. Broomhall admits the inadequacy of the data for Xinjiang, estimating the Muslim population of [[Xinjiang]] (i.e., virtually the entire population of the province at the time) in the range from 1,000,000 (based on the total population number of 1,200,000 in the contemporary ''Statesman's Yearbook'') to 2,400,000 (2 million "[[Uyghurs|Turki]]", 200,000 "[[Kazakhs|Hasak]]" and 200,000 "[[Dungan people|Tungan]]", as per [[George W. Hunter (missionary)|George Hunter]]). He uses the estimates of 2,000,000 to 3,500,000 for [[Gansu]] (which then also included today's [[Ningxia]] and parts of [[Qinghai]]), 500,000 to 1,000,000 for [[Zhili Province|Zhili]] (i.e., [[Beijing]], [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]]), 300,000 to 1,000,000 for [[Yunnan]] and smaller numbers for other provinces, down to 1,000 in [[Fujian]]. For [[Mongolia]] (then, part of the Qing Empire) he takes an arbitrary range of 50,000 to 100,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|p=214}} Quote: "No definite information has been received concerning Mongolia".</ref> Summing up, he arrives to the grand total of 4,727,000 to 9,821,000 Muslims throughout the Qing Empire of its last years, i.e. just over 1–2% of the entire country's estimated population of 426,045,305.<ref>{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=196–215}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=216–217}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ferm|1976|p=145}}</ref> The 1920 edition of ''New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress'' gave the number "''between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000''" as the total number of Muslims in the Republic of China.<ref>{{cite book|title=New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hmUMAAAAYAAJ&q=anhui+1919+mongolia&pg=PA155|year=1920|pages=155–}}</ref>

In the two decades up to 2006,  a wide range of Islamic educational opportunities were developed to meet the needs of China's Muslim population. In addition to mosque schools, government Islamic colleges and independent Islamic colleges, more students went overseas to continue their studies at international Islamic universities in [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Malaysia]].<ref name="Armijo1986"/> Qīngzhēn (清真) is the Chinese term for certain Islamic institutions.

== Representative bodies ==

===Islamic Association of China===
[[File:Islamic_Association_of_China_20150613.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Islamic Association of China in Beijing]]
Established by the government, the [[Islamic Association of China]] claims to represent Chinese Muslims nationwide. At its inaugural meeting on May 11, 1953, in Beijing, representatives from 10 nationalities of the People's Republic of China were in attendance.  The association was to be run by 16 Islamic religious leaders charged with making "a correct and authoritative interpretation" of Islamic creed and canon.  Its brief is to compile and spread inspirational speeches and help imams "improve" themselves, and vet sermons made by clerics around the country.

Some examples of the religious concessions granted to Muslims are:
*Muslim communities are allowed separate cemeteries
*Muslim couples may have their marriage consecrated by an Imam
*Muslim workers are permitted holidays during major religious festivals
*Chinese Muslims are also allowed to make the Hajj to Mecca, and more than 45,000 Chinese Muslims have done so in recent years.<ref>{{harvnb|BBC|2002|loc=[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/china_4.shtml China Islamic Association]}}</ref>

== Culture and heritage ==
[[File:Niujie Mosques02.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Niujie Mosque]] in Beijing]]

Although contacts and previous conquests have occurred before, the Mongol conquest of the greater part of Eurasia in the 13th century permanently brought the extensive cultural traditions of China, central Asia and western Asia into a single empire, albeit one of separate khanates, for the first time in history. The intimate interaction that resulted is evident in the legacy of both traditions. In China, Islam influenced technology, sciences, philosophy and the arts. For example, the Chinese adopted much Islamic medical knowledge such as wound healing and urinalysis. However, the Chinese were not the only ones to benefit from the cultural exchanges of the Silk Road. Islam showed many influences from buddhist China in their new techniques in art, especially when humans began to be depicted in paintings which was thought to be forbidden in Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guides.library.cornell.edu/IslamAsiaExhibit/SilkRoadIslam|title=LibGuides: Exhibition: Islam in Asia: Diversity in Past and Present: The Silk Road & Islam Spread|last=Houissa|first=Ali|website=guides.library.cornell.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110000330/http://guides.library.cornell.edu/IslamAsiaExhibit/SilkRoadIslam|archive-date=2019-11-10|url-status=live}}</ref> In terms of material culture, one finds decorative motifs from central Asian Islamic architecture and calligraphy and the marked halal impact on northern Chinese cuisine.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Taking the Mongol Eurasian empire as a point of departure, the ethnogenesis of the Hui, or Sinophone Muslims, can also be charted through the emergence of distinctly Chinese Muslim traditions in architecture, food, epigraphy and Islamic written culture. This multifaceted cultural heritage continues to the present day.<ref>CHINA HERITAGE NEWSLETTER China Heritage Project, The Australian National University {{issn|1833-8461}} No. 5, March 2006</ref>

===Islamic architecture in China===
{{Main|List of mosques in China}}
[[File:Id Kah Mosque (39712811190).jpg|thumb|left|[[Id Kah Mosque]]]]

In Chinese, a mosque is called ''qīngzhēn sì'' (清真寺) or "pure truth temple." The [[Huaisheng Mosque]] and [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]] (first established during the Tang era) and the [[Jinan Great Southern Mosque|Great Southern Mosque]] in Jinan, whose current buildings date from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]], do not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, they follow traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. Mosques in western China incorporate more of the elements seen in mosques in other parts of the world. Western Chinese mosques were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like [[pagoda]]s.<ref name="Cowen1985">{{citation|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|accessdate=2006-04-08|last=Cowen|first=Jill S.|date=July–August 1985|pages=30–35|periodical=Saudi Aramco World|title=Muslims in China: The Mosque|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322154300/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|archive-date=2006-03-22|df=}}</ref>

An important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from [[palace]]s to [[mosque]]s. One notable exception is in the design of [[garden]]s, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself.

On the foothills of Mount Lingshan are the tombs of two of the four companions that Muhammad sent eastwards to preach Islam. Known as the "Holy Tombs," they house the companions Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun—their Chinese names, of course. The other two companions went to Guangzhou and Yangzhou.<ref name="islamonline.net"/>

Chinese buildings may be built with bricks, but [[wood]]en structures are the most common; these are more capable of withstanding [[earthquake]]s, but are vulnerable to [[fire]]. The roof of a typical Chinese building is curved; there are strict classifications of gable types, comparable with the classical orders of European columns.

As in all regions the Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of the middle east, with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] have built their mosques, there is a combination of east and west. The mosques have flared Chinese-style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and [[minaret]]s.<ref name="Cowen1985"/> The first mosque was the Great Mosque of Xian or the Xian Mosque, which was created in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] in the 7th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gjGxeyWC1S4C&q=mosque+xian+742&pg=PA274|title=Let's Go China 5th Edition|isbn=9780312320058|last1=Jiang|first1=Shelley|date=2004-12-13}}</ref>

===Halal food in China===
{{Main|Chinese Islamic cuisine}}
[[File:Huxi Mosque - Butcher Shop.jpg|thumb|A halal butcher shop at [[Huxi Mosque]] in [[Shanghai]]]]

Halal food has a long history in [[China]]. The arrival of Arabian and Persian merchants during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]] saw the introduction of the [[Muslims|Muslim]] diet. Chinese Muslim cuisine adheres strictly to the Islamic dietary rules with mutton and lamb being the predominant ingredient. The advantage of Muslim cuisine in China is that it has inherited the diverse cooking methods of Chinese cuisine for example, braising, roasting, steaming, stewing and many more. Due to China's multicultural background Muslim cuisine retains its own style and characteristics according to regions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muslim2china.com/halal-food-china/ |title=Halal Food in China |website=Muslim2china.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823101509/http://www.muslim2china.com/halal-food-china/ |archive-date=2016-08-23 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>

Due to the large [[Muslims|Muslim]] population in Western [[China]], many Chinese restaurants cater to Muslims or cater to the general public but are run by Muslims. In most major cities in China, there are small Islamic restaurants or food stalls typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., [[Uyghurs]]), which offer inexpensive noodle soup. [[Lamb and mutton]] dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. Commercially prepared food can be certified [[Halal]] by approved agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chinamuslim.per.sg/halal/halal.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921011124/http://www.chinamuslim.per.sg/halal/halal.htm |archivedate=2006-09-21 |df= }}</ref> In Chinese, [[halal]] is called ''qīngzhēncài'' (清真菜) or "pure truth food." Beef and lamb slaughtered according to Islamic rituals is also commonly available in public markets, especially in North China. Such meat is sold by Muslim butchers, who operate independent stalls next to non-Muslim butchers.

In October 2018, the government launched an official anti-halal policy, urging officials to suppress the "pan-halal tendency", seen as an encroachment by religion into secular life and a source of religious extremism.{{cn|date=October 2020}}

[[File:Šahādaḧ Calligraphy at Great Mosque of Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Sini-style Arabic calligraphy of the first [[Shahada]] (''La 'ilāha 'illā Allāh'') at the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]]]]
Sini is a [[China|Chinese]] [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligraphic form]] for the [[Arabic script]]. It can refer to any type of Chinese Islamic calligraphy, but is commonly used to refer to one with thick and tapered effects, much like [[Chinese calligraphy]]. It is used extensively in [[mosque]]s in Eastern China and to a lesser extent in [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]] and [[Shaanxi]]. A famous Sini calligrapher is [[Hajji]] [[Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang]].

Xiao'erjing (also Xiao'erjin or Xiaojing) is the practice of writing [[Sinitic languages]] such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (especially the Lanyin, [[Zhongyuan Mandarin|Zhongyuan]] and [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern]] dialects) or the [[Dungan language]] in the [[Arabic script]]. It is used on occasion by many [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] who adhere to the Islamic faith in [[China]] (mostly the [[Hui people|Hui]], but also the [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]] and the [[Salar people|Salar]]) and formerly by their [[Dungan people|Dungan]] descendants in Central Asia.

===Martial arts===
There is a long history of Muslim development and participation at the highest level of Chinese ''wushu''. The [[Hui people|Hui]] started and adapted many of the styles of ''wushu'' such as ''[[Ba Ji Quan|bajiquan]]'', ''piguazhang'' and ''[[Liu He Quan|liuhequan]]''. There were specific areas that were known to be centers of [[Muslims|Muslim]] ''wushu'', such as Cang County in [[Hebei|Hebei Province]].

===Literature===
The [[Han Kitab]] was a collection of Chinese Islamic texts written by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] which synthesized [[Islam]] and [[Confucianism]]. It was written in the early 18th century during the [[Qing dynasty]]. Han is Chinese for Chinese and kitab (ketabu in Chinese) is Arabic for book.<ref name=Dillon72>{{harvnb|Dillon|1999|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&pg=PA104 104]}}</ref> Liu Zhi wrote his Han Kitab in [[Nanjing]] in the early 18th century. The works of Wu Sunqie, Zhang Zhong and Wang Daiyu were also included in the Han Kitab.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&pg=PA191|title=Familiar strangers: a history of Muslims in Northwest China|author=Jonathan Neaman Lipman|year=2004|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|page=79|isbn=978-0-295-97644-0|accessdate=2010-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622160357/http://books.google.com/books?id=90CN0vtxdY0C&pg=PA191|archive-date=2013-06-22|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Han Kitab was widely read and approved of by later Chinese Muslims such as [[Ma Qixi]], [[Ma Fuxiang]] and [[Hu Songshan]]. They believed that Islam could be understood through Confucianism.

===Education===
A lot of Chinese students including male and females join [[International Islamic University, Islamabad]] to gain Islamic knowledge. For some Muslim groups in China, such as the [[Hui people|Hui]] and [[Salar people|Salar]] minorities, [[coeducation]] is frowned upon; for some groups such as [[Uyghurs]], it is not.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bsZxAhzxk0C&q=sala+hui&pg=PA211|title=China's universities, 1895–1995: a century of cultural conflict|author=Ruth Hayhoe|year=1996|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=|page=202|isbn=978-0-8153-1859-0|accessdate=2010-06-29}}</ref>

On 28 April 2020, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued “International Religious Freedom Annual Report 2020” . The Report  states that “Individuals have been sent to the camps for wearing long beards, refusing alcohol, or other behaviors authorities deem to be signs of “religious extremism.” Former detainees report that they suffered torture, rape, sterilization, and other abuses. In addition, nearly half a million Muslim children have been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools. During 2019, the camps increasingly transitioned from reeducation to forced labor as detainees were forced to work in cotton and textile factories. Outside the camps, the government continued to deploy officials to live with Muslim families and to report on any signs of “extremist” religious behavior. Meanwhile, authorities in Xinjiang and other parts of China have destroyed or damaged thousands of mosques and removed Arabic-language signs from Muslim businesses. ”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/USCIRF%202020%20Annual%20Report_Final_42920.pdf|title= International Religious Freedom Annual Report 2020|date=2020-04-28|website= U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom |language=en|access-date=2020-07-29 }}</ref>
