The '''New Zealand Security Intelligence Service''' ('''NZSIS''' or '''SIS'''; {{lang-mi|Te Pā Whakamarumaru}}) is [[New Zealand]]'s primary national [[intelligence agency]]. It is responsible for providing information and advising on matters including [[national security]] (including [[counterterrorism]] and [[counterintelligence]]) and [[foreign intelligence]].<ref>[http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/about-us/] New Zealand Security Intelligence Service overview</ref> It is headquartered in [[Wellington]] and overseen by a Director-General, the Minister of New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee; independent oversight is provided by the [[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (New Zealand)|Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security]].

SIS was established on 28 November 1956 with the primary function of combating perceived increases in Soviet intelligence operations in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=":1" /> Since then, its legislated powers have expanded to increase its monitoring capabilities and include entry into private property. Its role has also expanded to include countering domestic and international terrorism, chemical, biological, and cyber threats.

The organization has been criticised for its role in numerous high-profile incidents such as the 1974 arrest of [[Bill Sutch]] on charges of spying for the [[Soviet Union]],<ref name=":0" /> the 1981 assassination attempt by [[Christopher John Lewis|Christopher Lewis]] on Queen [[Elizabeth II]],<ref name=":2" /> and the 1996 invasion of GATT Watchdog organiser Aziz Choudry's home.<ref name=":3" /> It has also been criticised for its failures to anticipate or prevent incidents such as the 1985 bombing of the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'',<ref name=":4" /> the 2004 purchasing of New Zealand passports by Israeli "intelligence contract assets",<ref name="NZ_Herald_3596863" /> and the 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings|Christchurch Mosque Shootings]] by an Australian alt-right white supremacist terrorist.<ref name=":5" />

==History==
In the first half of the 20th century, domestic intelligence and counter-subversion were primarily in the hands of the [[New Zealand Police|New Zealand Police Force]] (1919–1941; 1945–1949) and the [[Special Branch#New Zealand|New Zealand Police Force Special Branch]] (1949–1956). During the [[Second World War]], the short-lived [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Bureau]] (SIB) took over.<ref>Graeme Hunt, ''Spies and Revolutionaries'', pp. 291–2.</ref> The SIB was modeled after the British [[MI5]] and was headed by Major Kenneth Folkes, a junior MI5 officer. However, the conman Syd Ross duped Major Folkes into believing that there was a Nazi plot in New Zealand. After this embarrassment, [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Peter Fraser]] dismissed Folkes in February 1943 and the SIB merged into the New Zealand Police. Following the end of the war in 1945, the police force resumed responsibility for domestic intelligence.<ref>Graeme Hunt, ''Spies and Revolutionaries'', pp.140–44.</ref>

On 28 November 1956, the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] established the New Zealand Security Service (NZSS). Its goal was to counter increased [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence operations in Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the [[Petrov Affair]] of 1954, which had damaged Soviet-Australian relations. The NZSS was again modeled on the British domestic intelligence agency [[MI5]] and its first Director of Security, [[Brigadier]] [[William Herbert Ellery Gilbert|William Gilbert]], was a former [[New Zealand Army]] officer. Its existence remained a state secret until 1960.<ref name=":1">Michael King, ''Penguin History of New Zealand'', pp. 429, 431.</ref><ref>Graeme Hunt, ''Spies and Revolutionaries'', pp.231–32.</ref>

The [https://www.nzic.govt.nz/ NZ Intelligence Community] (NZIC) developed further in the late 1950s due to growing concerns about political terrorism, improvements in weaponry, news media coverage, and frequent air travel. As terrorist threats grew, along with potential connections to wider groups, the adoption of counter-insurgency techniques increased in New Zealand. In response to this, the [[New Zealand Parliament]] enacted the 1961 Crimes Act to allow improved targeting of possible terrorist suspects and scenarios.<ref>Bethan Greener-Barcham, ''Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand'', p. 510.</ref> In 1969 the NZSS was formally renamed the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service.<ref>Graeme Hunt, ''Spies and Revolutionaries'', pp. 242, 292.</ref> That same year Parliament passed the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act to cover the agency's functions and responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1969/0024/latest/whole.html |title= New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969 No 24 (as at 13 July 2011), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation |work= legislation.govt.nz |year= 2011 |quote= The New Zealand Security Intelligence Service to which this Act applies is hereby declared to be the same Service as the Service known as the New Zealand Security Service which was established on 28 November 1956. |accessdate= 16 September 2011}}</ref>

Various amendments were later made to the Security Intelligence Act, including the controversial 1977 amendment under Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]], which expanded the SIS's powers of monitoring considerably.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Salient40261977-t1-body-d30.html|title=The SIS—What it does {{!}} NZETC|last=Robinson|first=Bruce|date=1977-10-03|website=Salient: Official newspaper of Victoria University of Wellington Students Association|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> The 1977 Amendment Act defined terrorism as: "planning, threatening, using or attempting to use violence to coerce, deter, or intimidate". The Immigration Amendment Act of 1978 further expanded the definition of terrorism.<ref>Bethan Greener-Barcham, ''Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand'', p. 512.</ref>

In 1987, [[Gerald Hensley]], Chair of the NZIC, stated that the State Services Commission became attracted to the concept of "comprehensive security", taking into account not only human-made threats such as terrorism but also natural hazards.{{Clarify|reason=Unclear what is meant by natural hazards or how this connects to nuclear policy|date=July 2019}} This was also a response to the severing of intelligence-sharing arrangements New Zealand had with the United States in 1985 over nuclear policy.<ref>Andrew Brunatti, ''The architecture of community'', p. 126.</ref> Following the attempted hijacking of an [[Air New Zealand Flight 24|Air New Zealand flight]] and the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombing of the ''Rainbow Warrior'' in 1985]], Parliament enacted the International Terrorism (Emergency Powers) Act 1987. The Act gave censorship powers to the government around matters of national security and terrorism. This was a significant departure from New Zealand's previous conformance to international norms and laws.<ref>Bethan Greener-Barcham, ''Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand'', p. 517.</ref>

At the end of the 20th Century and beginning of the 21st, the NZIC adapted to emerging chemical, biological, and eventually cyber threats. These three areas became a key point of integration between the intelligence community agencies. Cases of terrorism overseas promoted the NZ Intelligence Community to regularly exchange information and meet the growing demands of addressing non-state actors.<ref>Bethan Greener-Barcham, ''Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand'', p. 521.</ref><ref>Andrew Brunatti, ''The architecture of community''.</ref>

==Purpose==
The SIS is a civilian intelligence and security organisation. Its stated roles are:
*To investigate threats to security and to work with other agencies within Government, so that the intelligence it collects is appropriately used and threats which have been identified are disrupted
*To collect foreign intelligence
*To provide a range of protective security advice and services to Government.<ref name="NZSIS Web Index">NZSIS Official Website [http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/about/index.html About Us, Index]</ref>

As a civilian organisation, the SIS's remit does not include enforcement (although it has limited powers to intercept communications and search residences). Its role is intended to be advisory, providing the government with information on threats to [[national security]] or national interests. It also advises other government agencies about their own internal security measures, and is responsible for performing checks on government employees who require [[security clearance]]. The SIS is responsible for most of the government's [[counter-intelligence]] work.

In 2007, it was reported that the SIS wished to expand its role into fighting [[organised crime|organized crime]].<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200707141135/sis_head_wants_to_tackle_organised_crime 'SIS head wants to tackle organised crime'], Radio New Zealand news item.
</ref>

==Organisation==
The SIS is based in [[Wellington]], with branches in [[Auckland]] and [[Christchurch]]. It has close to 300 full-time staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/BIM-Redacted.pdf|title=Briefing to the Incoming Minister 2017|work=gcsb.govt.nz|accessdate=13 December 2017}}</ref>

The Director-General of the SIS reports to the Minister of  New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, who is {{as of|2018|lc=yes}} is Hon [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]], and the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/about-us/|title=New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (NZSIS): About Us|accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref> Independent oversight of its activities is provided by the [[Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (New Zealand)|Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igis.govt.nz/about/|title=About {{!}} Inspector General of Intelligence and Security|accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>

==Directors==
[[File:2015 05 18 Rebecca Kitteridge.jpg|thumb|Rebecca Kitteridge in 2015]]
The SIS is administered by a Director-General. {{As of|2014}} it has had seven directors generals:
*Brigadier [[William Herbert Ellery Gilbert|Sir William Gilbert]] KBE DSO (1956–1976)
*Judge Paul Molineaux CMG (1976–1983)
*Brigadier Lindsay Smith CMG CBE (1983–1991)
*Lieutenant General [[Don McIver]] CMG OBE (1991–1999)
*[[Richard Woods]] (1999–2006)
*[[Warren Tucker]] (2006–2014)
*[[Rebecca Kitteridge]] [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (2014–present)

==Public profile==
The SIS has been involved in a number of public incidents and controversies:

*In 1974, the SIS was the source of information that led to the arrest of [[Bill Sutch]], an economist and former civil servant, on charges of spying for the [[Soviet Union]]. Sutch was acquitted and the SIS was criticised for having accused him,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/intelligence-services/page-2|title=Intelligence services - The Cold War, 1945 to 1984|last=Clayworth|first=Peter|date=2012-06-20|website=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> although it has also been alleged that the SIS was correct in its accusation.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kitchin |first=Phil |title=Fresh twist in 40-year-old Cold War spy mystery |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2014-08-11 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10369208/Fresh-twist-in-40-year-old-Cold-War-spy-mystery |access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>
*In 1981, the SIS was criticised for drawing up a list of 20 "subversives" who participated in protests against the [[1981 Springbok Tour]], a visit by South Africa's [[apartheid]] [[rugby football|rugby]] team. Characterising individual protesters as "subversives" was deemed by many to be a violation of the right to protest government decisions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}
*Also in 1981, a SIS operative inadvertently left a briefcase, containing a copy of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', three cold meat pies, and notes of a dinner party hosted by a German diplomat, on a journalist's fence in [[Wellington]], where it was found by the son of another journalist, Fran O'Sullivan.<ref name=":0" />
*In 1985, the SIS failed to prevent the French operation in which [[Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure|DGSE]] operatives [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|bombed]] the [[Greenpeace]] vessel ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]'', killing a photographer.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/nuclear-free-new-zealand/rainbow-warrior|title=Sinking the Rainbow Warrior - Nuclear-free New Zealand {{!}} NZHistory, New Zealand history online|website=nzhistory.govt.nz|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref>
*In 1996, two SIS agents broke into the home of Aziz Choudry. Choudry was an organiser with GATT Watchdog, which was holding a public forum and rally against an [[APEC]] (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Trade Ministers meeting hosted in Christchurch. The Court of Appeal ruled that the SIS had exceeded their legislated powers of interception.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA9908/S00462/crown-pays-up-apologises-in-choudry-sis-case.htm|title=Crown Pays Up, Apologises In Choudry SIS Case|date=1999-08-26|website=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|access-date=2019-07-27|last3=Zeal|first3=5:15 pm Press Release: New|last4=Government}}</ref> Parliament later amended the SIS Act to give the SIS powers of entry into private property.
*In 2002, the SIS issued a security risk certificate for [[Ahmed Zaoui]], an [[Algeria]]n [[refugee|asylum-seeker]], and recommended his deportation. Zaoui was detained under a warrant of commitment. Inspector General [[Lawrence Greig|Laurie Greig]] resigned in March 2004 after controversy over comments perceived as biased against Zaoui. The risk certificate was subsequently lifted, allowing Zaoui to remain.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10463352">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10463352 |title=Statement by director of the SIS concerning Mr Ahmed Zaoui |date=13 September 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>
*In 2004, it was alleged that the SIS was spying on [[Māori people|Māori]] individuals and organisations, including those associated with the new [[Māori Party]], for political purposes under the codename "Operation Leaf".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0411/S00144.htm|title=Intel Sources Say SIS Investigating Maori Party|last=Manning|first=Selwyn|date=2004-11-11|website=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]]|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> A government inquiry led by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security later rejected these claims in April 2005.

*In July 2004, the SIS was [[2004 Israel–New Zealand passport scandal|criticised]] for not knowing that Israeli "intelligence contract assets" had been in New Zealand fraudulently purchasing New Zealand passports. This came to light when the New Zealand Police discovered the fraud. The case became world news and an embarrassment for both the SIS and [[Mossad]]. Two of the Israelis involved (Uriel Kelman and Eli Cara who had been based in Australia) were deported to Israel, while two non-Israelis believed to be involved (American Ze'ev Barkan and New Zealander David Reznic) left New Zealand before they were caught.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0902/S00209.htm 'A Word From Afar: The Curious Case of Mr. Tucker'], Scoop, Paul G.

* In December 2008, it was discovered that a Christchurch resident, Rob Gilchrist, had been spying on peace organisations and individuals including Greenpeace, Iraq war protesters, animal rights and climate change campaigners. He confessed to the allegations after his partner, Rochelle Rees, found emails sent between him and [[Special Investigation Group]] (SIG) officers, having found the emails while fixing Gilchrist's computer. Rochelle Rees was a Labour party activist as well as an animal rights campaigner. Gilchrist was said to have passed on information via an anonymous email address to SIG officers including Detective Peter Gilroy and Detective Senior Sergeant John Sjoberg. SIG is connected with SIS. Gilchrist had been paid up to $600 a week by police for spying on New Zealand citizens, reportedly for at least 10 years. Gilchrist also said he was offered money by Thomson Clark Investigations to spy on the [[Save Happy Valley Coalition]], an environmental group. The incident implied members of New Zealand political parties were spied on by SIS and SIG.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10548070">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10548070 |title=Chief of police called in over spies |author=Tan, Lincoln |date=15 December 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>
* In November 2009, the SIS was criticised for asking university staff to report their colleagues or students if they were behaving suspiciously. The SIS said it was part of an effort to prevent the spread of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name="3 News">{{cite web | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Uni-staff-asked-to-spy-on-students-/tabid/209/articleID/130029/cat/525/Default.aspx | title=Uni staff asked to spy on students | work=[[3 News]] | accessdate=17 November 2009 | archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130223021652/http://www.3news.co.nz/Uni-staff-asked-to-spy-on-students-/tabid/209/articleID/130029/cat/525/Default.aspx | archive-date=23 February 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref>
* In July 2011, the SIS was involved in an investigation of [[Israel]]i backpackers who were in New Zealand at the time of the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], in which one of the Israelis was killed. The Israelis were alleged to have been [[Mossad]] agents attempting to infiltrate the New Zealand government's computer databases and steal sensitive information. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence of a Mossad operation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Investigation cleared Israelis of spy claims: PM |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5311491/Investigation-cleared-Israelis-of-spy-claims-PM |accessdate=9 June 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=20 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721235949/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5311491/Investigation-cleared-Israelis-of-spy-claims-PM |archivedate=21 July 2011}}</ref>
* In March 2018, the SIS released a memo confirming that an assassination attempt was made on Queen [[Elizabeth II]] during her 1981 visit in Dunedin despite alleged efforts by the [[New Zealand Police]] to cover up the incident. The perpetrator was 17 year-old Dunedin teenager Christopher Lewis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/sis-files-confirm-dunedin-teen-tried-shoot-queen|title=SIS files confirm Dunedin teen tried to shoot Queen|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=2 March 2018|work=[[Otago Daily Times]]|agency=[[NZ Newswire]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/oceania/intelligence-documents-confirm-assassination-attempt-on-queen-elizabeth-in-new-zealand-20180301-p4z282.html|title=Intelligence documents confirm assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth in New Zealand|last1=McNeilly|first1=Hamish|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> Lewis electrocuted himself in prison in 1997 while awaiting trial for an unrelated murder.<ref name=":2">{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/101794948/nz-security-intelligence-confirms-assassination-attempt-on-queen-the-snowman-and-the-queen-the-aftermath|title=The Snowman and the Queen: Declassified intelligence service documents confirm assassination attempt on Queen|last1=McNeilly|first1=Hamish|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=2 March 2018|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]}}</ref>
* After the 15 March 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings|white supremacist terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch]], the failure of the SIS and other NZ state agencies to pay adequate attention to the 'far right', and to detect the terrorist was strongly criticised. Green Party MP [[Marama Davidson]] and [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tuhoe]] activist and artist [[Tame Iti]], among others, suggested that the SIS and other state security and intelligence agencies had the wrong people under surveillance, including Muslim communities, Maori, and environmental activists.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://teaomaori.news/wrong-people-have-been-under-surveillance-marama-davidson|title=The wrong people have been under surveillance - Marama Davidson|last=Ao|first=Te|date=2019-03-17|work=[[Māori Television]]|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teaomaori.news/tame-iti-sickened-act-terrorism-christchurch|title=Tame Iti sickened by act of terrorism in Christchurch|last=Black|first=Taroi|date=2019-03-17|work=[[Māori Television]]|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> The spokesperson for the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand, [[Anjum Rahman]], voiced frustration at the failure of the SIS to take Muslim community concerns about racist violence and the rise of the alt-right in New Zealand seriously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/384911/islamic-women-s-council-repeatedly-lobbied-to-stem-discrimination|title=Islamic Women's Council repeatedly lobbied to stem discrimination|last=Rahman|first=Anjun|date=2019-03-17|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] announced that there would be an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the mosque attacks and what the relevant agencies (SIS, Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), police, Customs and Immigration) knew about the individual and the accused's activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/385002/pm-on-gun-law-reforms-we-are-absolutely-united|title=PM on gun law reforms: 'We are absolutely united'|date=2019-03-18|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>
* In early June 2020, [[Radio New Zealand]] reported that the NZSIS had raided the [[Czechoslovakia]]n embassy in Wellington in 1986 as part of a joint operation with the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) to steal [[Warsaw Pact]] codebooks in order to break into the encrypted communications of Soviet-aligned countries during the Cold War. This operation would have breached the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]]. This revelation came to light as a result of an RNZ podcast series called ''The Service'', produced by Wellington writer and documentary maker John Daniell, whose mother and step-father had both worked for the NZSIS.

==Access to records==
Until a few years ago{{When|date=November 2009}} the SIS was reluctant to release information either under the Privacy Act or the Official Information Act. However it has {{as of | 2009 | alt = now}} adopted a much more open policy: individuals who apply for their files will be given extensive information, with only sensitive details (such as details of sources or information provided by overseas agencies) removed.  A letter to the Director is all that is required in order to obtain information.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In certain respects, {{Explain|reason=In what respects? Expand|date=March 2019}} the SIS still fails to meet its obligations under the Privacy Act but in these cases there is a right of appeal to the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Act does not cover deceased people but their files are available under the Official Information Act. The service is also required to release other information such as files on organizations but it is reluctant to do so, claiming that it has to perform extensive research in order to provide such information.
