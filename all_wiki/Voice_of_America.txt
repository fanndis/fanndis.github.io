'''Voice of America''' ('''VOA''') is a state-controlled international television and radio network funded by the U.S. federal tax budget. It is the largest U.S. international broadcaster. VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in 47 languages which it distributes to affiliate stations around the globe. It is primarily viewed by foreign audiences, so VOA programming has an influence on public opinion abroad regarding the United States and its people.

VOA was established in 1942,<ref name="VOA Mission">{{cite web|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5831.html|title=Mission and Values|website=InsideVOA.com|author=VOA Public Relations|publisher=Voice of America|access-date=August 10, 2017}}</ref> and the VOA charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415)<ref>[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg823.pdf 90 Stat. 823], [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-108/pdf/STATUTE-108-Pg4299.pdf 108 Stat. 4299]</ref> was signed into law in 1976 by [[President Gerald Ford]].

== History ==

===American private shortwave broadcasting before World War II===
Before World War II, all American shortwave stations were in private hands.<ref name="Berg, Jerome S. 1999, page 105">Berg, Jerome S. ''On the Short Waves, 1923–1945: Broadcast Listening in the Pioneer Days of Radio.'' 1999, McFarland. {{ISBN|0-7864-0506-6}}, 105</ref> Privately controlled shortwave networks included the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]]'s International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages,<ref>Library of Congress. "NBC Resources Held by the Recorded Sound Section." [https://www.loc.gov/rr/record/recnbc.html Library of Congress]</ref> the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]]'s Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 different countries,<ref>Chamberlain, A.B. "CBS International Broadcast Facilities". Proceedings of the IRE, Volume 30, Issue 3, March 1942 pp. 118–29.</ref> the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] in Cincinnati, Ohio, and [[General Electric]] which owned and operated [[WGEO (shortwave)|WGEO]] and WGEA, both based in [[Schenectady, New York]], and [[KGEI]] in [[San Francisco]], all of which had shortwave transmitters. Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.<ref name="Dizard_24">{{harvp|Dizard|2004|p=24}}</ref> In 1939, the Federal Communications Commission set the following policy:

<blockquote>A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.<ref>Rose, Cornelia Bruère. ''National Policy for Radio Broadcasting.'' 1971, Ayer Publishing. {{ISBN|0-405-03580-2}}. p. 244</ref></blockquote>

This policy was intended to enforce the State Department's [[Good Neighbor Policy]], but some broadcasters felt that it was an attempt to direct censorship.<ref>{{cite web |title=NABusiness |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771673-1,00.html |website=Time.com |publisher=Time Magazine |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda around 1940.<ref name="Dizard_24"/> Initially, the Office of Coordination of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.<ref name="Berg, Jerome S. 1999, page 105" /> The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was [[Edmund A. Chester]], and he supervised the development of CBS's extensive "La Cadena de las Americas" radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&pg=PA166&dq=Eva+Garza&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Edmund%20Chester&f=false ''Dissonant Divas In Chicana Music: The Limits of La Onda''] Deborah R.

Also included among the [[cultural diplomacy]] programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show ''[[Viva America]]'' (1942-1949) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including [[Alfredo Antonini]], [[Juan Arvizu]], [[Eva Garza]], [[Elsa Miranda]], [[Nestor Mesta Chayres|Nestor Mesta Chaires]], [[Miguel Sandoval (composer)|Miguel Sandoval]], [[John Serry Sr.]], and [[Terig Tucci]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A Pictorial History of Radio|last=Settel|first=Irving|publisher=[[Grosset & Dunlap]]|location=New York|orig-year=1960|year=1967|page=146|lccn=67-23789|oclc=1475068}}</ref><ref>Media Sound & Culture in Latin America.

===World War II===
Even before the [[Japan]]ese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government's [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]] (COI, in Washington) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis through its Foreign Information Service (FIS, in New York) headed by playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood]], the playwright who served as president [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]’s speech writer and information advisor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html |title=The Voice of America: Origins and Recollections |last=Roberts |first=Walter R. |access-date=October 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426030633/https://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2009/1012/fsl/roberts_voice.html |archive-date=26 April 2018}}</ref> Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via [[General Electric]]’s KGEI transmitting to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). The next step was to broadcast to [[Germany]], which was called ''Stimmen aus Amerika'' ("Voices from America") and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" and included the pledge: "Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war... The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth."<ref>Roberts, Walter R.

Donovan]] (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term "The Voice of America" to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City.

The [[Office of War Information]], when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA's operations. VOA reached an agreement with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] to share medium-wave transmitters in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and expanded into [[Tunis]] in North Africa and [[Palermo]] and [[Bari, Italy]] as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]].<ref>{{harvp|Dizard|2004|pp=24–25}}</ref>
[[Asia]]n transmissions started with one transmitter in [[California]] in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in [[Hawaii]] and, after recapture, the [[Philippines]].<ref name="Dizard_25">{{harvp|Dizard|2004|p=25}}</ref>

By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.<ref name="Dizard_25"/> Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and [[San Francisco]], with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sterling |first1=Christopher H. |first2=John Michael |last2=Kittross |year=2001 |title=Stay Tuned: a History of American Broadcasting |series=LEA's Communication Series |publisher=Lawernce Erlbaum Associates |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-8058-2624-1 |page=263}}</ref>

About half of VOA's services, including the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] service, were discontinued in 1945.<ref name="Rugh 2006, 13">{{harvp|Rugh|2006|p=13}}</ref> In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the Department of State.

===Cold War===
{{more citations needed|COLD WAR|date=October 2020|VOICE OF AMERICA=IN 1945-46 VOA was a under contract to CBS in New York to transmit to Latin America countries.

In 1946 the contract was awarded to NBC.}}<!--many paragraphs without citations, especially at end of section-->
In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of [[Soviet propaganda]] directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton's treatise, ''Cold War Propaganda''.<ref name="whitton">{{cite journal |author=John B. Whitton |year=1951 |title=Cold War propaganda |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=151–53 |jstor=2194791|doi=10.2307/2194791 }}</ref> The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic [[radio jamming|jamming]] of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.<ref name="whitton"/>

[[Charles W. Thayer]] headed VOA in 1948–49.

Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of its [[foreign policy]] to fight the propaganda of the [[Soviet Union]] and other countries.

The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.<ref name="Rugh 2006, 13"/>

In 1952, Voice of America installed a studio and relay facility aboard a converted [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] renamed ''[[USCGC Courier (WAGR-410)|Courier]]'' whose [[target audience]] was Soviet Union and other members of [[Warsaw Pact]]. The ''Courier'' was originally intended to become the first in a fleet of mobile, radio broadcasting ships (see [[offshore radio]]) that built upon [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] experience during WWII in using warships as floating broadcasting stations. However, the ''Courier'' eventually dropped anchor off the island of [[Rhodes, Greece]] with permission of the [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] to avoid being branded as a [[pirate radio]] broadcasting ship. This VOA offshore station stayed on the air until the 1960s when facilities were eventually provided on land. The ''Courier'' supplied training to engineers who later worked on several of the European commercial offshore broadcasting stations of the 1950s and 1960s.

Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the [[U.S. Information Agency]] when the latter was established in 1953<ref name="Rugh 2006, 13"/> to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Starting in the 1950s, VOA [[Voice of America Jazz Hour|broadcast American jazz]] on ''[[Voice of America Jazz Hour]]'' from 1955 until 2003. Hosted for most of that period by [[Willis Conover]], the program had 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at [[South Africa]] in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as ''The [[Newport Jazz Festival]]'' were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Louis Armstrong]], and [[Duke Ellington]], sponsored by the State Department.<ref>Appy, Christian G. Cold War Constructions: The Political Culture of United States Imperialism. 2000, [[University of Massachusetts Press]]; {{ISBN|1-55849-218-6}}, p. 126.</ref> From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in [[Westchester County, New York]], had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]]. Brown's program ended due to its popularity: his "chatty narratives" attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn't afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners' letters.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Folsom |first1=Merrill |title='Voice' to Drop Boy's Broadcasts; Can't Afford to Answer Fan Mail |work=The New York Times |issue=Vol CII, No 34823, pg 1 |date=28 May 1953}}</ref>

Throughout the [[Cold War]], many of the targeted countries' governments sponsored [[radio jamming|jamming]] of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts' actual impact. For example, in 1956, [[Polish People's Republic]] stopped jamming VOA transmissions {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, but [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. [[Chinese language]] VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976.<ref>Broadcasting Yearbook, 1976 and 1979 editions.</ref> However, after the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.<ref>Conference Report, ''Cold War Impact of VOA Broadcasts,'' Hoover Institution and the Cold War International History Project of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Oct. 13–16, 2004</ref> The People's Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iarums-r1.org/iarums/prcdragon.pdf |title=Fighting the Chinese Government "Firedragon" – Music Jammer AND "Sound of Hope" Broadcasting (SOH), Taiwan |access-date=January 15, 2008 |last=Bihlmayer |first=Ulrich |date=September 12, 2006 |publisher=IARU Region 1 Monitoring System}}</ref> [[Cuba]] has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to [[Iran]] from its Russian-built transmission site at [[Bejucal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc6.net/news/2334674/detail.html |title=U.S.: Cuba Jamming TV Signals To Iran – Local News Story – WTVJ |access-date=January 15, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224191817/http://www.nbc6.net/news/2334674/detail.html |archive-date=24 December 2008}}</ref> David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: "The [[North Korea]]n government doesn't jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era's most important news, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech and [[Neil Armstrong]]'s 1969 [[Apollo 11#Lunar surface operations|first walk on the Moon]]. During the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], VOA broadcast around-the-clock in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{Example needed |s|reason=says 1960s and 1970s, but only examples are from the 1960s|date=September 2020}}

In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, [[Radio Martí]] and [[TV Martí]]. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba.

In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to [[Afghanistan]] in [[Dari language|Dari]] and in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] in 1982. At the same time, VOA started to broadcast U.S. government editorials, clearly separated from the programming by audio cues.

In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live [[disc jockey]]s, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as "EuroFax") 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Bill|title=VOA Europe: A Victim of Bureaucracy?|journal=Billboard|date=March 8, 1997|volume=109|issue=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQ4EAAAAMBAJ&q=%22voa+europe%22&pg=PA61|access-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref> It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999 revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014 stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix).

In 1989, Voice of America expanded its [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese Chinese|Cantonese]] programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square.

Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting.

With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, and [[Rwanda-Rundi]] language services.

In 1993, the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] advised cutting funding for [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] as it was felt post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the [[International Broadcasting Act]]. The [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL.<ref name="Raghavan" />

In 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the International Broadcasting Act into law. This law established the [[International Broadcasting Bureau]] as a part of the U.S. Information Agency and created the Broadcasting Board of Governors with oversight authority. In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law and mandated that BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the [[United States Information Agency|U.S.I.A.]] and merged most of its functions with those of the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].

In 1994, Voice of America became the first<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html |title=The Voice of America: First on the Internet |last=Kern |first=Chris |access-date=January 15, 2008}}</ref> broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet.

In April 2020, the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] accused Voice of America of being a mouthpiece for authoritarian regimes that "speaks for America’s adversaries," and of "promoting propaganda" instead of "promoting freedom and democracy."<ref>{{cite web |title=Voice of America Spends Your Money to Speak for Authoritarian Regimes |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600daily/ |website=1600 Daily |publisher=The White House |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200410052118/https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600daily/ |archive-date=April 10, 2020 | access-date=April 10, 2020 |date=April 9, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Folkenflik |first1=David |title=White House Attacks Voice of America Over China Coronavirus Coverage |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/10/831988148/white-house-attacks-voice-of-america-over-china-coronavirus-coverage |access-date=April 15, 2020 |work=NPR |date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Lee |first1=Matthew |title=White House Slams Voice of America, VOA Fights Back |url=https://apnews.com/fa95382fb6df9386671785f219447499 |access-date=April 11, 2020 |work=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

=== Cuts in services ===
The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or [[Radio Sawa]], with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins. Today, the network has expanded to television with [[Alhurra]] and to various social media and websites.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.usagm.gov/networks/mbn/ |title = USAGM}}</ref>

On May 16, 2004; [[Worldnet Television and Film Service|Worldnet]], a satellite television service, was merged into the VOA network.

==Agencies==
Voice of America has been a part of several agencies. From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the [[Office of War Information]], and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the [[U.S. Information Agency]] in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]], or BBG, which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG.<ref>{{harvp|Rugh|2006|p=14}}</ref> The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], a branch of VOA.<ref name="Raghavan">Raghavan, Sudarsan V., Stephen S.

==Laws==

===Smith–Mundt Act===
From 1948 until its amendment in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens under § 501 of the [[Smith–Mundt Act]].<ref name=chuck_nbc_2013>{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/07/20/19502580-taxpayer-money-at-work-us-funded-foreign-broadcasts-finally-available-in-the-us|title=Taxpayer money at work: US-funded foreign broadcasts finally available in the US|first=Elizabeth|last=Chuck|publisher=NBC News|date=July 20, 2013}}</ref> The act was amended as a result of the passing of the ''Smith-Mundt Modernization Act'' provision of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|National Defense Authorization Act for 2013]].<ref name="smma">{{cite news|last=Hudson|first=John|title=U.S. Repeals Propaganda Ban, Spreads Government-Made News to Americans|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/07/12/us_backs_off_propaganda_ban_spreads_government_made_news_to_americans|access-date=July 16, 2013|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=July 14, 2013}}</ref> The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by their own government and to have no competition with private American companies.<ref>Broderick, James F., and Darren W.

===Internal policies===

====VOA charter====
Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director [[Henry Loomis]] commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization's mission, and was issued by Director [[George V. Allen]] as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director [[Edward R. Murrow]].<ref>{{harvp|Rugh|2006|pp=13–14}}</ref> The principles were signed into law on July 12, 1976, by President [[Gerald Ford]]. It reads:
<blockquote>The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.<ref name="VOA Charter" /></blockquote>

===="Firewall"====
The Voice of America Firewall was put in place with the 1976 VOA Charter and laws passed in 1994 and 2016 as a way of ensuring the integrity of VOA's journalism. This policy fights against propaganda and promotes unbiased and objective journalistic standards in the agency. The charter is one part of this firewall and the other laws assist in ensuring high standards of journalism.<ref>https://docs.voanews.eu/en-US-INSIDE/2019/07/02/a2cdade1-ffb3-41b5-a086-2a09861ae452.pdf</ref>

===="Two-source rule"====
According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent witness an event.<ref>Columbia University Press. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/publicity/heilinterview.html Interview with Alan Heil, author of ''Voice of America''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706051252/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/publicity/heilinterview.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}</ref>

==Newsroom==
Voice of America's central newsroom has hundreds of journalists and dozens of full-time domestic and overseas correspondents, who are employees of the U.S. government or paid contractors. They are augmented by hundreds of contract correspondents and [[stringer (journalism)|stringers]] throughout the world, who file in English or in one of VOA's other radio and television broadcast languages.

In late 2005, VOA shifted some of its central-news operation to Hong Kong where contracted writers worked from a "virtual" office with counterparts on the overnight shift in Washington, D.C., but this operation was shut down in early 2008.

==Shortwave frequencies==
By December 2014, the number of transmitters and frequencies used by VOA had been greatly reduced. VOA still uses shortwave transmissions to cover some areas of Africa and Asia. Shortwave broadcasts still take place in these languages: Afaan Oromoo, Amharic, Bambara, Cantonese, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Korean and Swahili.

==''VOA Radiogram''==
[http://voaradiogram.net/ ''VOA Radiogram''] was an experimental Voice of America program starting in March 2013 which transmitted digital text and images via [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] [[Radiogram (message)|radiograms]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voaradiogram.net/ |title=VOA Radiogram |publisher=VOA Radiogram |access-date=April 15, 2014}}</ref> There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30 minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] [[shortwave receiver]] with freely downloadable software of the [[Fldigi]] family. This software is available for [[Windows]], [[Apple Computers|Apple]] ([[OSX]]), [[Linux]], and [[FreeBSD]] systems.

Broadcasts can also be decoded using the free [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Tivar&hl=en TIVAR app from the Google Play store] using any [[Android (operating system)|Android]] device.

The mode used most often on ''VOA Radiogram'', for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted.

The final edition of ''VOA Radiogram'' was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://voaradiogram.net/post/160839098787/voa-radiogram-20-21-may-2017-special-doomed|title=VOA Radiogram, 20–21 May 2017: Special doomed edition|website=VOA Radiogram|access-date=June 26, 2017}}</ref> so a follow-on show called ''Shortwave Radiogram'' began transmission on June 25, 2017 from the [[WRMI]] transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.<ref>[http://swradiogram.net/post/162168963047/shortwave-radiogram-25-june-2017-first-show Shortwave Radiogram, 25 June 2017: First show.

==Transmission facilities==
One of VOA's radio transmitter facilities was originally based on a {{convert|625|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|Union Township]] (now West Chester Township) in [[Butler County, Ohio]], near [[Cincinnati]]. The site is now a recreational park with a lake, lodge, dog park, and Voice of America museum. The [[Voice of America Bethany Relay Station|Bethany Relay Station]] operated from 1944 to 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Voice_of_America|title=Voice of America - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}</ref> Other former sites include California ([[Dixon, California|Dixon]], [[Delano, California|Delano]]), Hawaii, [[Okinawa]], (Monrovia) Liberia, Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}

Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana, Morocco, Thailand, Kuwait, and Sao Tome.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/3794247.html|title=VOA Through the Years|work=VOA|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>

Currently, VOA and USAGM continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at [[International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station]] in the United States, close to [[Greenville, North Carolina]], "Site B." They do not use FCC-issued callsigns, since the FCC does not regulate communications by other federal government agencies. (The FCC regulates broadcasting by private companies and other businesses, state governments, [[nonprofit organization]]s [NPOs] and [[non-government organization]]s [NGOs], and private individuals.) The IBB also operates a transmission facility on [[São Tomé]] and (Tinang) [[Concepcion, Tarlac]], Philippines for VOA.<ref>https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/104117.pdf</ref>

==Comparing VOA-RFE-RL-RM to other broadcasters==
In 1996, the U.S.'s international radio output consisted of 992 hours per week by VOA, 667 by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and 162 by Radio Marti.

In late September 2001, VOA aired a report that contained brief excerpts of an interview with then [[Taliban]] leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar Mohammad]], along with segments from President Bush's post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from [[Georgetown University]],{{who|date=July 2019}} and comments by the foreign minister of Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]] and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA's [[editorial independence]] from its governors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the [[University of Oregon]]'s [[Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/events/payne-awards/|title=Ancil Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism|publisher=University of Oregon|access-date=May 23, 2016}}</ref>

===Abdul Malik Rigi interview===
On April 2, 2007, [[Abdul Malik Rigi]], the leader of [[Jundallah (Iran)|Jundullah]], a militant group with possible links to [[al-Qaeda]], appeared on Voice of America's [[Persian language]] service.

===Tibetan protester interview===
In February 2013, a documentary released by [[China Central Television]] interviewed a [[self-immolation protests by Tibetans in China|Tibetan self-immolator]] who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America's broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation.

===Trump presidency politicization efforts===
After the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]], several tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary [[Sean Spicer]] about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This first raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize the state-funded agency.<ref name=TrumpTV>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/26/voice-of-america-says-it-wont-become-trump-tv/ Voice of America says it won’t become Trump TV], ''[[Washington Post]]''</ref><ref name=stamp>[http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-voice-america-234078 Trump moves to put his own stamp on Voice of America], ''Politico''</ref><ref name=megaphone>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-ol-voice-of-america-cold-war-bennett-20170215-htmlstory.html Can Donald Trump turn Voice of America into his own private megaphone?], ''LA Times''</ref><ref name="salon/01/24/2017">[http://www.salon.com/2017/01/24/donald-trump-sends-two-aides-to-voice-of-america-studios-raising-fears-hes-going-to-politicize-the-outlet/ Donald Trump sends two aides to Voice of America studios, raising fears he’s going to politicize the outlet], ''Salon''</ref> This amplified already growing [[propaganda]] concerns over the provisions in the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017]], signed into law by [[Barack Obama]], which replaced the board of the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] with a CEO appointed by the president. Trump sent two of his political aides, Matthew Ciepielowski and Matthew Schuck, to the agency to aid its current CEO during the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition to the Trump administration]]. Criticism was raised over Trump's choice of aides; Schuck was a staff writer for [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] website ''The Daily Surge'' until April 2015, while Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative advocacy group [[Americans for Prosperity]].<ref name=TrumpTV/> VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become "Trump TV".<ref name=TrumpTV/> BBG head John F.

Another investigation,<ref name="medium.com"/> by Mark Feldstein, Chair of Broadcast Journalism at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and a journalist with decades of experiences as an award-winning television investigative reporter, concluded that "The failure to comply with leadership’s instructions during the Guo interview "was a colossal and unprecedented violation of journalistic professionalism and broadcast industry standards." The report also said that "There had been a grossly negligent approach" to pre-interview vetting and failure to "corroborate the authenticity of Guo’s evidence or interview other sources" in violation of industry standards. The interview team apparently "demonstrated greater loyalty to its source than to its employer — at the expense of basic journalistic standards of accuracy, verification, and fairness," the Feldstein report concluded.<ref name="medium.com"/>

==The VOA and the Cold War==

The VOA started its operations during the [[Cold War]] and that is when its influence first started as well. [[Foy D. Kohler|Foy Kohler]], the director of VOA during the Cold War, strongly believed that the VOA was serving its purpose, which he identified as aiding in the fight against communism.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kohler|first=Foy|date=1951|title=The Effectiveness of the Voice of America|journal=He Quarterly of Film Radio and Television|volume=6|issue=1|pages=20–29|doi=10.2307/1209931|jstor=1209931}}</ref> He argued that the numbers of listeners they were getting such as 194,000 regular listeners in Sweden, and 2.1 million regular listeners in France, was an indication of a positive impact. As further evidence, he noted that the VOA received 30,000 letters a month from listeners all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of requests for broadcasting schedules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kohler|first=Foy|date=1951|title=Voice Of America|journal=Naval War College Information Service for Officers|volume=3|issue=9|pages=1–20|jstor=44792598}}</ref> There was an analysis done of some of those letters sent in 1952 and 1953 while Kohler was still director. The study found that letter writing could be an indicator of successful, actionable persuasion. It was also found that broadcasts in different countries were having different effects. In one country, regular listeners adopted and practiced American values presented by the broadcast. Age was also a factor: younger and older audiences tended to like different types of programs no matter the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herzog|first=H.|date=1952|title=Listener Mail to the Voice of America|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=16|issue=4|pages=607–611|jstor=2746119|doi=10.1086/266423}}</ref> Kohler used all of this as evidence to claim that the VOA helped to grow and strengthen the free world. It also influenced the UN in their decision to condemn communist actions in Korea, and was a major factor in the decline of communism in the "free world, including key countries such as [[Italy]] and [[France]].<ref name=":0" /> In Italy, the VOA did not just bring an end to communism, but it caused the country to Americanize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tobia|first=S|date=2013|title=Did the RAI buy it?

Practically all defectors during Kohler's time claimed the VOA helped in their decision to defect. Another indication of impact, according to Kohler, was the Soviet response. Kohler argued that the soviets responded because the VOA was having an impact. Based on Soviet responses, it can be presumed that the most effective programs were ones that compared the lives of those behind and outside the iron curtain, questions on the practice of slave labor, as well as lies and errors in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]’s version of [[Marxism]].<ref name=":0" />

==DEEWA Radio’s impact==

DEEWA Radio, of the VOA, airs in [[Pakistan]]. Although some listeners are suspicious that the program is promoting an American agenda, others claim to be experiencing a positive effect. Some listeners feel that the programs are giving a voice to the voiceless, leading them to a sense of empowerment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jan|first=F|date=2015|title=International Broadcasting as Component of U.S. Public Diplomacy (A Case Study of Voice of America's DEEWA Radio)|journal=Dialogue|volume=10}}</ref>

They claim that the VOA has exacerbated the conflict between the Talabani and the Barzani.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A132000325/GIC?u=viva_gmu&sid=GIC&xid=47c|title=The Kurdish Disservice|date=2000|work=Kurdish Life|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> They further claim that the VOA is covering up wrongful imprisonments, wrongful arrests, and the building of extremist mosques. According to the same publication, Kurds are being turned into fanatics, and a new generation of terrorists is forming because of the VOA. They claim the VOA is doing this to help PUK.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Revisiting the Kurdish Disservice|work=Kurdish Life}}</ref>

==VOA and Latin America==

There is evidence to suggest that the people who listen to the Latin American service are being influenced, but not in the way the VOA wants. Instead of understanding and adopting the American way of life, listeners are parroting values and beliefs that do not mesh with their lives. However, others have adopted a negative view of America, because they think that the VOA is propaganda.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uttaro|date=1982|title=The Voices of America in International Radio Propaganda|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|volume=45|issue=1|pages=103–122|doi=10.2307/1191297|jstor=1191297|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3648&context=lcp}}</ref>

==VOA and China==

A study was done on Chinese students in America. It found that through the VOA, they disapproved of the actions of the Chinese government.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Lena Liqing |date=2002|title=Are They Still Listening?

Their political beliefs did not change in relation to [[China]], though, as they did not tend to believe the VOA's reports on China.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang |last2=Dominick |first1=Liquing |first2=Joseph R.|date=1998|title=Penetrating the Great Wall: the ideological impact of Voice of America newscasts on young Chinese intellectuals of the 1980s|journal=Journal of Radio Studies |volume=5|issue=1|pages=82–101|doi=10.1080/19376529809384531}}</ref>
