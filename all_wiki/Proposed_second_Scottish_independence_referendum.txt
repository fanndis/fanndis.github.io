The [[Scottish Government]] has proposed holding a second referendum on Scottish independence from the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). A first [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on independence]] was held in September 2014, with 55% voting "No" to independence. Ahead of that referendum, the Scottish Government stated in its white paper proposing independence that voting Yes was a "once in a generation opportunity to follow a different path, and choose a new and better direction for our nation".<ref name="White Paper">{{cite web|url=https://www2.gov.scot/resource/0043/00439021.pdf|title=SCOTLANDʼS FUTURE YOUR GUIDE TO AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND|date=1 November 2013|website=gov.scot|publisher=gov.scot|access-date=18 November 2019 |page=i}}</ref>

Ahead of the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], the pro-independence [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) said that a second independence referendum should be held if there was a material change of circumstances since the 2014 referendum, and specified one of those as the UK leaving the [[European Union]] ("[[Brexit]]").<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-04-20|title=At-a-glance: SNP's Holyrood manifesto|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2016-scotland-36093405|access-date=2020-08-24}}</ref> The SNP formed a minority government after the 2016 election,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-05-06|title=Nicola Sturgeon to lead minority government after SNP falls short|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-lead-minority-government-snp-falls-short-5873|access-date=2020-08-24|website=inews.co.uk|language=en}}</ref> and the "leave" side won a referendum on UK membership of the EU in June 2016 despite 62% of votes in Scotland being opposed to Brexit.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2016-06-24|title=Scotland backs Remain as UK votes Leave|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36599102|access-date=2020-08-24}}</ref>

The referendum on Scottish independence held on 18 September 2014 saw Scotland vote to remain part of the United Kingdom (UK), with 55% voting against the proposal for Scotland to become an independent country and 45% voting in favour. Uncertainty over Scotland's European Union (EU) membership was a topic in the run-up to the referendum vote.<ref name="Clegg 2014">{{cite web | last= Clegg | first=David | title= Independence referendum: Euro bigwig Jose Manuel Barroso delivers fresh blow to Yes campaign | website= Daily record | date=17 February 2014 | url= http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/independence-referendum-ec-president-jose-3154114 | access-date= 25 June 2016 | quote=EU membership is another central plank in Salmond's blueprint for independence outlined in the SNP's White Paper last year.}}</ref> The British government and some mainstream political parties argued that remaining in the UK was the only way for Scotland to remain part of the EU.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/24/nicola-sturgeon-keep-scotland-eu-independence |title=Nicola Sturgeon needs to keep Scotland in the EU.

Other issues, such as the economy, played a large part in the debate. Financial groups, such as the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and [[Lloyds Banking Group]], were reported to be considering moving their registered offices to London, as a result of a European law stating that banks should have their head offices in the same member state as its registered office, as well as implying that these offices should be in the location where they conduct most of their activity – which would be the remainder of the United Kingdom in the event of Scottish independence.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26455655|title=EU law may force RBS and Lloyds to become English |work= BBC News|date=5 March 2014 |access-date= 21 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0026:EN:HTML |title=Council Directive 95/26/EC |work= Eur-lex | publisher = Europa |date= 18 July 1995 |access-date= 21 March 2018}}</ref>

The Scottish Government's official publication on the independence referendum stated that "It is the view of the current Scottish Government that a referendum is a once-in-a-generation opportunity",<ref>Scottish Government (November 2013) [http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0043/00439021.pdf  "Scotland's Future"]. p. 556.</ref> a point reiterated a few days before the vote by the SNP's then-leader, [[Alex Salmond]], noting the eighteen-year gap between the devolution referenda held in [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|1979]] and in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]] as an example of the generational opportunity.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29196661|title=Salmond: 'Referendum is once in a generation opportunity'|date=14 September 2014|work=BBC}}</ref> Three months later, Salmond reversed the position, highlighting the UK's EU referendum as a factor.<ref>Kinder, Tabatha (20 December 2014) [http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/second-scottish-independence-referendum-horizon-says-alex-salmond-1480417 "'A second Scottish independence referendum is on the horizon', says Alex Salmond"].

Public Finance. CIPFA.</ref>

Though the proposal for Scotland to become an independent country was voted down in 2014, the referendum resulted in the Scottish Parliament gaining additional powers through the  [[Scotland Act 2016]], which increased the devolved powers in areas such as taxation and some aspects of welfare provision.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= McGarvey |first=Neil|year= 2015 |title= The 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum and Its Aftermath |journal= Social Alternatives |volume= 34 |pages= 34–40|via= EBSCOHost}}</ref>

[[File:2015UKelectionMapScotland.svg|right|300px|thumb|Results of the 2015 United Kingdom general election]]
The [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 UK general election]] was held on 7 May almost eight months after the independence referendum was held. In their manifesto, the SNP said the following in response to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]' manifesto pledge promising a referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 if elected:<ref>/http://votesnp.com/docs/manifesto.pdf}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

<blockquote>The European Union is far from perfect, however, we believe that it is overwhelmingly in Scotland’s interests for us to remain a member, engaging with the institutions as fully as we can, and to argue for reform from within. We will oppose UK withdrawal from the EU and will propose that, in any future referendum, there should be a double majority requirement. Each of the four constituent nations of the UK would have to vote for withdrawal before the UK as a whole could leave the European Union.</blockquote>

The SNP went on to win 56 of the 59 Scottish seats that were contested in an unprecedented landslide winning 50% of the national vote and left just three unionist MPs in Scotland; [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] saw their worst result in Scotland since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] fell to their lowest level since [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] and the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] received their lowest vote share in Scotland since [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865]].

Across the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[David Cameron]] won an unexpected overall majority, their first since 1992 and following their victory passed the [[European Union Referendum Act 2015]] which legislated for the holding of a national UK-wide referendum on EU membership which would be held following the conclusion of a [[United Kingdom renegotiation of European Union membership, 2015–16|renegotiation of the UK's membership to the EU]].

The elections to the Scottish Parliament took place on 5 May 2016, seven weeks before the holding of the EU Referendum. In their manifesto for the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 Scottish elections]], the SNP stipulated conditions under which they would seek a second independence referendum:<ref>[https://www.snp.org/manifesto SNP 2016 manifesto], p. 23</ref>

The SNP were re-elected in the 2016 election, winning 63 seats in the 129-seat chamber, although the result meant that they no longer held an overall majority.<ref name = "2016 result">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36205187 |title=Holyrood 2016: SNP claims 'historic' win but no majority |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2016 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>  The pro-independence [[Scottish Green Party]] won 6 seats,<ref name = "2016 result"/> meaning that pro-independence MSPs maintained a majority.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/03/scottish-greens-will-back-snp-over-indyref-2 |title=Scottish Greens will back SNP over Indyref 2 |first=Julia |last=Rampen |work=New Statesman |date=13 March 2017 |access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>

The [[Scottish Green Party|Green]] manifesto stipulated that a second referendum should be held if there was a public demand for one, rather than as a result of "calculations of party political advantage". The party specified that their preferred method of showing support for a referendum was via a public petition, although their manifesto didn't clarify how many signatories there would have to be to receive their support:<ref>[https://greens.scot/sites/default/files/Campaigns/Holyrood%202016/Holyrood%20Manifesto%202016%20%E2%80%93%20RNIB.pdf Scottish Green 2016 manifesto], p. 36</ref>

In the EU membership referendum held on 23 June 2016, 52% of voters across the whole UK voted to leave the European Union, with 48% voting to remain; majorities in England and Wales were in favour of leaving the EU, with majorities in Scotland (62%), Northern Ireland and Gibraltar to remain a member of the EU.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results|title=EU Referendum Results|work=BBC News}}</ref> All thirty-two council areas in Scotland voted by a majority for the UK to remain a member of the EU.

Before the referendum, leading figures with a range of opinions regarding [[Scottish independence]] suggested that in the event the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU but Scotland as a whole voted to remain, a second independence referendum might be precipitated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/24/nicola-sturgeon-denies-she-has-machiavellian-wish-for-brexit_n_9063372.html|title=Nicola Sturgeon Denies She Has 'Machiavellian' Wish For Brexit|last=Simons|first=Ned|date=24 January 2016|website=The Huffington Post UK|access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/26/scotland-will-quit-britain-if-uk-leaves-eu-warns-tony-blair_n_9077274.html|title=Scotland Will Quit Britain If UK Leaves EU, Warns Tony Blair|last=Simons|first=Ned|date=26 January 2016|website=The Huffington Post UK|access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref> Former Labour Scottish First Minister [[Henry McLeish]] asserted that he would support Scottish independence under such circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14194315.Henry_McLeish__I_will_back_Scottish_independence_if_UK_leave_EU_against_Scotland_s_wishes/?ref=rss|title=Henry McLeish: I will back Scottish independence if UK leave EU against Scotland's wishes|date=10 January 2016|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow|access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref>

A report for the [[European Parliament]] regarding the impact on the United Kingdom's exit from the EU on devolution suggested that "there now seems to be a consensus that, were Scotland to become independent by legal means, it could join the [European] Union", something which had been questioned before the 2014 referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/583118/IPOL_IDA(2017)583118_EN.pdf|title=The Impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union on Scotland, Wales and Gibraltar|work=Directorate General for Internal Policies|date=September 2017|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref>

[[Scottish Secretary]] [[David Mundell]] stated, on 26 June 2016, that "if the people of Scotland ultimately determine that they want to have another [independence] referendum there will be one", and added "Could there be another referendum?

In February 2017, the Scottish Parliament voted 90 to 34 to oppose the UK leaving the EU and to oppose [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|invoking Article 50]] in a non-binding vote.<ref name="dw17">[http://www.dw.com/en/scottish-parliament-rejects-brexit-in-non-binding-vote/a-37448650 Scottish parliament rejects Brexit in non-binding vote], ''DW'', 07 February 2017</ref>

{{Main|2017 United Kingdom general election in Scotland}}
The [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]] returned a [[hung parliament]] resulting in Theresa May's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] returning as a minority government through a [[Arrangement between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party|pact]] with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

The SNP remained as the third-largest party in the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with its representation reduced to 35 of the total 59 Scottish MPs. The SNP had 21 fewer seats than they won in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] and its popular vote in Scotland reduced from 50% in 2015 to 37% in 2017 with a lower voter turnout. The Conservatives, who oppose independence, saw their best election in Scotland since 1983, winning 29% of the vote and increasing their seat total to thirteen, compared to one in the previous parliament.

During the election campaign, Sturgeon was asked about the prospect of further referenda if the proposed referendum did not result in a vote in favour of independence.<ref name="PandJ">{{cite news|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/westminster/general-election/1261080/nicola-sturgeon-jeered-refusing-rule-third-independence-referendum-within-years/|title=Nicola Sturgeon jeered after refusing to rule out third independence referendum within a few years|date=6 June 2017|access-date=6 June 2017|newspaper=The Press and Journal}}</ref> In response she said that that, "I don't think it's right for any politician to dictate to a country what its future should be.

Sturgeon stated: "Undoubtedly the issue of an independence referendum was a factor in this election result, but I think there were other factors in this election result as well".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40216748|title=General election 2017: Sturgeon says Indyref2 'a factor' in SNP losses|date=9 June 2017|work=BBC}}</ref> Opposition to a second referendum is one of the issues that former SNP MP [[Angus Robertson]] and [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish Conservative]] leader [[Ruth Davidson]] have attributed to reduced support for the SNP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/08/europe/snp-uk-general-election/index.html|title=Scottish referendum in doubt after steep losses for SNP in UK vote|work=CNN|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>

The SNP lost seats that voted for independence.

Following the 2017 UK general election, Sturgeon announced that the Scottish Government would postpone legislation on the proposed second referendum on Scottish independence until at least autumn 2018 when it was believed that the outcome of Brexit negotiations would become clearer.<ref name=NicolaDelays>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-40415457 |title= Nicola Sturgeon puts Scottish independence referendum bill on hold|work=[[BBC]]|date= 27 June 2017 |access-date= 27 June 2017}}</ref>

===2018===
On 25 May 2018, the Scottish National Party published its "Growth Commission" report, which detailed the economics of an independent Scotland when maintaining close alignment to British fiscal policy. The report noted that it would take £450 million to set up an independent state, with an initial budget deficit of around 6% of GDP. The report, additionally, suggested that an independent Scotland would negotiate a share of the UK national debt, while continuing to use the [[Pound Sterling]] as currency for at least a decade. Scotland would only consider an independent currency, once certain economic goals had been met. Despite not having a separate currency on independence, the report suggested that Scotland would set up a central bank to act as a lender of last resort. According to the Growth Commission, Scotland would seek an open migration policy to allow for its population to grow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44237956|title=What's in the SNP's growth commission report?|work=BBC News|date=25 May 2018|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson responded to the report by saying: "For me, the most important issue is making sure our children get a good education. The first minister used to claim that that was her priority too—how times have changed. It's hard to see how dragging Scotland back down the rabbit hole of a debate on independence is going to improve our schools." Richard Leonard, Scottish Labour's leader, stated that the report, "will exasperate millions of people around the country who just want the first minister focused on public services".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44224884|title=Scotland 'can match top small countries'|work=BBC News|date=24 May 2018|access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref>

===2019===
In March 2019, the SNP conference adopted an amendment version of the Growth Commission as party policy on the economics of independence.  This amended version established that it is now SNP policy for an independent Scotland to create a new currency at the earliest feasible point of independence to enable fiscal sovereignty, with Pound Sterling being a transitional currency for Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48069470|title=SNP members change leadership's currency plan|date=2019-04-27|access-date=2019-06-16|language=en-GB}}</ref> First Minister Sturgeon also announced the establishment of a 'Social Justice Commission' to develop the social argument for independence to complement the SNP's new economic policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bbf70b34-69c7-11e9-80c7-60ee53e6681d|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

The Scottish Government was working on a three-pronged approach to constitutional change:

*A referendum on independence is a matter of intent of the government to allow Scotland a say on independence.
*Cross-party talks are to be held to enable any areas of agreement on changes to devolution to be explored.
*The Scottish Government established the [[Citizens' Assembly of Scotland]] to discuss the most prominent issues faced by contemporary Scottish society and governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gapi.io/6OUb|title=Citizens' Assembly of Scotland|website=Scottish Government News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

The civic campaign group [[Voices for Scotland]] launched in April 2019 to secure a pro-independence majority in Scotland through societal engagement. This group was established by the [[Scottish Independence Convention]] which is made up of cross-party and grassroots organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/indyref2-campaign-group-launches-with-elaine-c-smith-on-board-1-4914657|title=Indyref2: Campaign group launches with Elaine C Smith on board|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>

On the same day as the passing of the [[Referendums (Scotland) Act 2020]], Nicola Sturgeon officially published the Scottish Government's request to Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] for the transfer of legal authority to hold an independence referendum. This request set out the constitutional history of Scotland's place in the United Kingdom and that the Scottish Government would deem either a Section 30 order or an amendment to the Scotland Act as a satisfactory means of transferring the power over independence referendums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-right-choose-putting-scotlands-future-scotlands-hands/|title=Scotland's right to choose: putting Scotland's future in Scotland's hands - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> Sturgeon's intention was for the referendum to be held in 2020.<ref name="for 2020">{{cite news |first= Libby |last=Brooks |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-to-demand-powers-for-2020-referendum |title= Nicola Sturgeon to demand powers for 2020 referendum |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 15 October 2019 |access-date= 31 December 2019}}</ref>

The [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 UK general election]] resulted in a majority parliament for the Conservatives led by Boris Johnson. The SNP held the position of the third-largest party in the House of Commons, gaining 13 seats from the previous election to a total of 48.

===Referendums (Scotland) Act 2020===
{{Main|Referendums (Scotland) Act 2020}}
In May 2019, the Scottish Government introduced the Referendums (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament.

The current Scottish Government intends to seek a Section 30 order or an amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 to ensure that the result of a future referendum can be indisputably binding.

The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 19 December 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-50288237|title=MSPs back principles of indyref2 framework bill|website=BBC News|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> and received royal assent on 29 January 2020.

This includes Scottish Parliamentary elections, local authority elections and referenda under the Scottish Parliament's remit. This Act extends voting rights to anyone legally resident in Scotland over the age of 16, regardless of nationality or citizenship, and extends voting rights to some prisoners if they have less than 12 months to serve in prison. This is counter to the voting franchise in the 2014 referendum which was limited to British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens resident in Scotland over the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |last1=The National Archives |title=Scottish Elections (Franchise and Representation) Act 2020 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2020/6/contents |website=legislation.gov.uk |access-date=23 August 2020}}</ref>

In April 2017, a report for the [[European Parliament Committee on Constitutional Affairs]] was published to look at the implications on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union on Scotland, Wales and Gibraltar and their future relations with the EU.

However, it affirmed that Scotland's independence would have to be accepted by the United Kingdom for Scotland to obtain EU membership: "There now seems to be a consensus that, were Scotland to become independent by legal means, it could join the [European] Union".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/583118/IPOL_IDA%282017%29583118_EN.pdf|title=The Impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union on Scotland, Wales and Gibraltar|first=Michael|last=Keating|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|date=April 2017|access-date=6 December 2018|page=19}}</ref>

[[File:CommonTravelArea.svg|thumb|right|The [[Common Travel Area]]]]
With the United Kingdom leaving the European Union and previously having an opt-out of the [[Schengen Area]], an independent Scotland, if acceded into the European Union, would be required to negotiate an opt-out of the Schengen Area to continue to form part of the [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA) alongside Ireland and the United Kingdom. Without such an opt-out, passport controls may be required between Scotland and the CTA members. If Scotland were to join the EU, this could also cause a customs border to form due to the United Kingdom leaving the EU.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gallagher |first1=T |title=Britain After Brexit: Resistance from Scotland |journal=Journal of Democracy |pages=31–41 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/645535/summary |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

====Agriculture and fisheries====
Under the United Kingdom’s EU membership, Scottish farmers had been entitled to [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) payments, with fisheries receiving support from the [[Common Fisheries Policy]] (CFP). With Brexit, such support was due to be ended with a new payment system introduced. The Scottish Government would be required to negotiate a new settlement on agricultural subsidy and fishing subsidies and regulations with the European Union upon seeking membership.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McAngus |display-authors=etal |title=Brexit, Fisheries and Scottish Devolution: An Intergovernmental Disruption |journal=The Political Quarterly |date=2019 |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=802–807 |doi=10.1111/1467-923X.12772 }}</ref>

====EFTA====
In November 2016, Sturgeon confirmed to members of the Scottish Parliament that the Scottish Government was considering joining the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) and the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), based on the model of [[Norway]] and some other countries, to "protect [Scotland's] place in the single market" of Europe even if the United Kingdom as a whole does leave in a "hard [[Brexit]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37993028|title=Nicola Sturgeon confirms 'Norway model' option|date=2016-11-16|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The SNP's 2017 General Election manifesto stated that "the Scottish Government [led by the SNP, had] published proposals that would keep Scotland in the Single Market, even as we left the EU."<ref>''Scottish National Party Manifesto 2017''. p. 8.</ref> Christophe Hillion, a Professor of European Law at the [[University of Oslo]] who was invited to deliver an expert opinion to the Scottish Parliament, said that while there is scepticism about UK accession to EFTA in Norway, Scotland is viewed much more positively and that the EFTA member states would likely welcome an independent Scotland as a member.<ref name="thenat">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/16097931.eea-likely-to-welcome-an-independent-scotland/|title=EEA 'likely to welcome' an independent Scotland|date=2018-03-20|work=The National}}</ref>

===Economy===

====Currency====
In the 2014 referendum, the Scottish Government had advocated remaining in a currency union with the United Kingdom. This was refuted by the United Kingdom Government and opposition parties as a policy that no party would support in government.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Scotland analysis: assessment of a sterling currency union|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scotland-analysis-assessment-of-a-sterling-currency-union|access-date=2020-08-21|website=GOV.UK|language=en}}</ref> The SNP's Sustainable Growth Commission developed a new party policy that, if in government, the SNP would aim to create a new Scottish currency after a future referendum. However, the currency would not be adopted until several key economic tests were satisfied, and until then an SNP government would have a policy of Sterlingisation of the Scottish economy and state.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Institute|first=Fraser of Allander|title=Some early thoughts on the Sustainable Growth Commission report|url=https://fraserofallander.org/scottish-economy/some-early-thoughts-on-the-sustainable-growth-commission-report/|access-date=2020-08-21|website=Fraser of Allander Institute|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2019-04-27|title=SNP members change leadership's currency plan|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48069470|access-date=2020-08-21}}</ref> This position was criticised by think tank [[Common Weal]] who propose that Scotland should adopt a new currency as close to day 1 of independence as a means to have full fiscal and monetary sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-04-09|title=Six tests would 'act against' creating a Scottish currency, think-tank argues in critique of SNP Growth Commission|url=https://sourcenews.scot/six-tests-would-act-against-creating-a-scottish-currency-think-tank-argues-in-critique-of-snp-growth-commission/|access-date=2020-08-21|website=Source|language=en-GB}}</ref>

====COVID-19 Recession====
:''See also [[COVID-19 recession]]''
Although the Scottish Government have paused independence referendum planning, the impact of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland|COVID-19 pandemic]] on the economy will be present for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Coronavirus: Largest UK recession on record - official figures|url=https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-largest-uk-recession-on-record-official-figures-12047521|access-date=2020-08-21|website=Sky News|language=en}}</ref> Scotland's GDP remains at 17.6% lower than in February 2020 despite small levels of growth since the easing of lockdown restrictions.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-08-19|title=Scotland officially in recession after GDP fall|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53837124|access-date=2020-08-21}}</ref> Therefore, this severe recession will have consequences on both the Scottish and UK Government's ability to supply confidence to people in Scotland on both continued participation within the United Kingdom and as an independent country.

====Trade====
In 2013, Scotland exported around three and a half times more to the rest of the UK than to the rest of the EU,<ref name="SiU">{{cite web|title=Scotland, 'Brexit' and the UK|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/scotlandinunion/pages/377/attachments/original/1453372484/Brexit_PDF.pdf?1453372484|publisher=Scotland in Union|access-date=5 July 2016|date=January 2016}}</ref> while in 2015, that had increased to around four times more to the rest of the UK than to the rest of the EU.<ref>{{cite report |author=The Scottish Government|date=25 January 2017|title=Export Statistics Scotland 2015|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00513335.pdf|pages=1–2|access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> The pro-union organisation [[Scotland in Union]] has suggested that an independent Scotland within the EU would face trade barriers with a post-Brexit UK and face additional costs for re-entry to the EU.<ref name="SiU"/>

==Political response==
:''See also, for comparison [[2014 Scottish independence referendum#Responses]]''
Responses by politicians to the possibility of a referendum have been both pro-referendum and anti-referendum. This generally tends to show independence supporters favouring a referendum, with those against independence being against one.

=== In support of a referendum ===

Scottish Greens co-convener [[Patrick Harvie]], on 13 March 2017 welcomed the confirmation from the First Minister that she is seeking a Section 30 Order from the UK Government to give the Scottish Parliament temporary power to hold an independence referendum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://greens.scot/news/greens-welcome-referendum-call|title=Greens Welcome Referendum Call|date=2017-03-13|work=Scottish Greens|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en}}</ref> This was re-affirmed in the Scottish Parliament on 29 January 2020 when the Greens voted with the government for a referendum to be held.

[[Scottish Socialist Party]] spokesman [[Colin Fox (political activist)|Colin Fox]] said the SSP would "work as hard as anyone to deliver a Yes vote for independence", but warned that making Scotland's EU membership a central and “overarching” issue of the debate would be “a risky strategy” and said it ran the risk of side-lining economic and social challenges facing Scots.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15153561.Pro_independence_parties_throw_their_weight_behind_ScotRef_decision/|title=Pro-independence parties throw their weight behind ScotRef decision|date=14 March 2017|access-date=14 March 2017|publisher=The National}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/13/nicola-sturgeon-could-derail-brexit-scottish-referendum-demand/|title=Theresa May rules out Nicola Sturgeon's plans for a new Scottish independence referendum before Brexit, as Lords pass landmark Brexit bill following MPs' vote|date=13 March 2017|access-date=14 March 2017|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>

The [[Scottish Independence Convention]] backs calls for a referendum. As a result, the Convention established [[Voices for Scotland]] as a civic campaign for independence based on conversations and discussions of what Scotland could look like.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/09/18/announcing-a-new-national-campaign/ |title=Announcing a New National Campaign |first=Robin |last=McAlpine |work=Bella Caledonia |publisher=Bella Caledonia |date=18 September 2018 |access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/13296/new-campaign-organisation-aims-take-independence-movement-next-level |title=New campaign organisation aims to take independence movement 'to the next level' |first=Sean |last=Bell|work=CommonSpace |publisher=CommonSpace |date=18 September 2018 |access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>

Alison Evison, President of the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] (COSLA) and [[Scottish Labour]] councillor for Aberdeenshire has stated her support for a referendum on independence, stating "We can strengthen it [democracy] by enabling the voice of Scotland to be heard through its formal processes and that must mean a referendum on independence"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/labour-councillor-and-cosla-president-calls-for-second-independence-referendum/|title=Labour councillor and Cosla president calls for second independence referendum|last=Post|first=The Sunday|website=Sunday Post|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>

Former First Minister [[Alex Salmond]] has shown support for a further independence referendum, claiming it is inevitable but only after what he predicts will be the ‘humiliation’ of Brexit becomes apparent for a clear choice to be made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/alex-salmond-scottish-independence-indyref-brexit-humiliation-snp-a7887236.html|title=Alex Salmond calls for second independence referendum after Brexit 'humiliation'|date=2017-08-10|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>

=== Opposed to a referendum ===

==== British party leaders ====
In November 2019 during the lead up to the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|UK general election]], leader of the Conservatives and Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] stated that a Conservative government would not permit a second independence referendum, vowing to "protect our magnificent union".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/newsscotland/boris-johnson-wont-give-scots-a-second-independence-referendum/ar-BBXlKhO|title=Boris Johnson won't give Scots a second independence referendum|last=Bussey|first=Katrine|date=Nov 26, 2019|work=MSN|access-date=Dec 14, 2019}}</ref>

Former Labour Party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] said in March 2017 that a referendum would be "absolutely fine" and that "I don't think it's the job of Westminster or the Labour Party to prevent people holding referenda." However, a spokesman for Corbyn later said: "Labour continues to oppose a further referendum in the Scottish Parliament and would campaign against independence if one were held."<ref name="BBC News Corbyn 2017">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-39244890|title=Scottish independence: Jeremy Corbyn says indyref2 'absolutely fine'|date=11 March 2017|website=BBC News|access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref>

Former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] leader [[Tim Farron]] in March 2017, said: “Scottish Liberal Democrats stood for election last year on a platform to oppose a new independence referendum.

A spokesperson speaking on behalf of Cameron's successor as Conservative Party Leader and Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]], said in October 2016: "The prime minister and the government does not believe that there is a mandate for [a second referendum]. There was one only two years ago. There was an extremely high turnout and there was a resounding result in favour of Scotland remaining in the UK."<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37708545|title=New Scottish independence bill published|date=20 October 2016|work=BBC}}</ref>

==== Scottish party leaders ====
Interim [[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish Conservative]] leader [[Jackson Carlaw]] has stated his opposition to a referendum. He has said; "We will not support another independence referendum for a generation." and that the Scottish Government should focus on its domestic agenda. He has stated that 40 years is what he sees as the time needed between referenda.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2019-50588843|title=General election 2019: Jackson Carlaw answers your questions on the election|website=BBC News|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>

[[Scottish Labour]] leader [[Richard Leonard (Scottish politician)|Richard Leonard]] is against an independence referendum.

==Opinion polling==
{{see also|Opinion polling on Scottish independence|Scottish independence#Public opinion}}
[[File:Scottish independence polling with local regression fit.png|thumb|440x440px]]
Since the referendum in September 2014, opinion polls have asked how people would vote in a hypothetical second referendum. These polls have been carried out since six weeks after the referendum.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/new-poll-scotland-would-back-indy-if-fresh-vote-was-held-now.1414830607 |title=New poll: Scotland would back indy if fresh vote was held now |work=The Herald |date=1 November 2014|access-date=13 March 2015}}</ref> Twenty-five opinion polls were conducted in the year after the referendum, with seventeen of them having "No" as the predominant answer, seven having "Yes", and one having an equal proportion of respondents for each opinion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-34277133 |title=What are the latest polls saying about Scottish independence? |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |first=John |last=Curtice |date=18 September 2015 |access-date=19 September 2015}}</ref> During the period of 18 September 2015 to 18 September 2016 a further twenty-four opinion polls were conducted, of which twenty had "No" as the predominant answer while four had "Yes" as the predominant answer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-vote-in-the-in-the-scottish-independence-referendum-if-held-now-a#table|title=How would you vote in a Scottish independence referendum if held now?
