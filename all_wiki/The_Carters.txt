'''The Carters''' (stylized in [[all caps]]) are an American musical duo composed of married artists [[Beyoncé]] and [[Jay-Z]]. They released their first album as the Carters, ''[[Everything Is Love]]'', on June 16, 2018. Before formally naming their collaboration, the duo performed together on two world tours, [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run Tour]] (2014) and [[On the Run II Tour|OTR II]] (2018), and released a number of collaborations. In 2019 the album was certified gold in US.

The couple first collaborated in 2002 on "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]" from Jay-Z's ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/886181/beyonce-can-t-believe-it-s-been-15-years-since-bonnie-clyde-and-neither-can-we|title=Beyoncé Can't Believe It's Been 15 Years Since ''Bonnie & Clyde''—And Neither Can We |website=E! Online}}</ref> They had their first number one single the next year with "[[Crazy in Love]]" from Beyoncé's debut solo album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/beyonce-crazy-in-love-best-song-why-2316762|title=Here's why Beyoncé's 'Crazy In Love' is the best song of the millennium|website=NME}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Beyoncé e Jay-Z.jpg|thumb|The Carters performing in 2009]]
===Early collaborations===
After co-writing [[Amil]]'s song "I Got That" in 2000, the couple later went on to make their first recording collaboration with "'03 Bonnie & Clyde", which peaked at number 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The duo co-wrote five tracks of Beyoncé's debut album, ''Dangerously in Love'', including its lead single "Crazy in Love", which topped the charts in the US. This was followed by two collaborations on her follow-up, ''B-Day'', which spawned their single "Déjà Vu", which peaked at number 4 in the US and number one in the UK. 

Following several of Beyoncé's appearances on Jay-Z's records ''Kingdom Come'' and ''Watch the Throne'', the duo released the number two US hit, "Drunk in Love". Beyoncé then appeared on two songs on Jay-Z's ''Magna Carta Holy Grail'' (2014). That same year, the couple then launched their first collaborative tour with On the Run Tour (2014), named after one of the collaborations from the record. The two later released two collaborations with [[DJ Khaled]] and worked on ''[[The Lion King: The Gift]]'', which Beyoncé had curated.

===Formation and ''Everything is Love''===
In 2014 and 2018, The Carters embarked on two world tours with On the Run Tour and On the Run Tour II. On June 16, 2018, during a concert in London as part of their [[On the Run II Tour]], the Carters premiered the music video for "[[Apeshit]]". Following the conclusion of the video, the words "ALBUM OUT NOW" appeared on the screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8461322/beyonce-jay-z-apeshit-video-the-carters|title=Beyonce & JAY-Z's 'Apeshit' Video: Watch the Carters Take Over the Louvre, Call Out Super Bowl and Grammys|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/16/beyonce-and-jay-z-release-collaborative-album-everything-is-love|title=Beyoncé and Jay-Z release surprise album Everything is Love|website=The Guardian}}</ref> ''[[Everything Is Love]]'' was released exclusively on [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] for streaming and digital download, before being made available across all other platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8461319/beyonce-jay-z-the-carters-everything-is-love-album|title=Beyonce & JAY-Z's 'Everything Is Love' Joint Album Released Under the Name the Carters|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>ReCode, [https://www.recode.net/2018/6/18/17474632/beyonce-jay-z-spotify-the-carters-everything-is-love-tidal "You can listen to the new Beyonce and Jay-Z album on Spotify and Apple Music now"], ''ReCode'', June 18, 2018, Retrieved Feb 7 2019</ref> The record received positive reviews and debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200. The album was later ranked as one of the best albums of the year by critics and won a [[Grammy Award]] for Urban Contemporary Album.

In 2020, Jay-Z co-wrote "Savage (Remix)" by Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé's solo single, "Black Parade". The former had reached the top of the charts in the United States, with all proceeds benefit Bread of Life Houston's COVID-19 relief efforts, which includes providing over 14 tons of food and supplies to 500 families and 100 senior citizens in Houston weekly.
