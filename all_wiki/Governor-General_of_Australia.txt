In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] and [[responsible government]], maintaining a political neutrality, and has almost always acted only on the advice of the prime minister or other ministers or, in certain cases, parliament. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at either of the two official residences{{mdash}}[[Government House, Canberra|Government House]] in the capital, [[Canberra]], and [[Admiralty House, Kirribilli|Admiralty House]] in [[Sydney]]{{mdash}}and travelling throughout Australia to open conferences, attend services and commemorations, and generally provide encouragement to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Australia, and of the Queen of Australia.

From Federation in 1901 until 1965, 11 out of the 15 governors-general were British aristocrats; they included four [[baron]]s, three [[viscount]]s, three [[earl]]s, and one [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|royal duke]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Governor-General Quentin Bryce backs gay marriage, Australia becoming a republic in Boyer Lecture|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-22/governor-general-quentin-bryce-backs-gay-marriage-republicanism/5112020|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122110646/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-22/governor-general-quentin-bryce-backs-gay-marriage-republicanism/5112020|archive-date=22 November 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, all but one of the governors-general have been Australian-born; the exception, [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]], arrived in Australia as a teenager.

==Method of appointment==
[[File:David Hurley swearing-in.jpg|thumb|[[David Hurley]] is sworn in as the 27th governor-general]]

The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Australia, pursuant to ''Letters Patent issued by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth as Queen of Australia''. Conventionally, the Australian Ministers to the Crown (the [[Minister (government)|ministers]] of the [[Australian Government]]) give recommendation to the Queen on who should be appointed.<ref name="HoR Practice" />

Having agreed to the appointment, the monarch then permits it to be publicly announced in advance, usually several months before the end of the current governor-general's term. During these months, the person is referred to as the ''governor-general-designate''.  After receiving their commission, the governor-general takes an [[Oath of Allegiance (Australia)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the monarch and an [[Oath of office|Oath of Office]], undertaking to serve Australia's monarch "according to law, in the office of governor-general of the Commonwealth of Australia".<ref name="GGSrole"/> These rituals are witnessed by the [[Chief Justice of Australia|chief justice of the High Court]] or another senior judge. Traditionally, the swearing-in of a new governor-general takes place in the Senate chamber.<ref name="HoR Practice" />

===History===
In 1919, Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] sent a memorandum to the Colonial Office in which he requested "a real and effective voice in the selection of the King's representative". He further proposed that the [[Dominion]]s be able to nominate their own candidates and that "the field of selection should not exclude citizens of the Dominion itself".{{sfn|Cunneen|1983|p=151}} The memorandum met with strong opposition within the Colonial Office and was dismissed by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], the Colonial Secretary; no response was given. The following year, as [[Ronald Munro Ferguson]]'s term was about to expire, Hughes cabled the Colonial Office and asked that the appointment be made in accordance with the memorandum. To mollify Hughes, Milner offered him a choice between three candidates. After consulting his cabinet he chose [[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster]].{{sfn|Cunneen|1983|p=152}} In 1925, under Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]], the same practice was followed for the appointment of Forster's successor [[John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven|Lord Stonehaven]], with the Australian government publicly stating that his name "had been submitted, with others, to the Commonwealth ministry, who had selected him".{{sfn|Cunneen|1983|p=164}}

The Prime Minister now advises the monarch to appoint their nominee. This has been the procedure since November 1930, when [[James Scullin]]'s proposed appointment of Sir [[Isaac Isaacs]] was fiercely opposed by the British government. This was not because of any lack of regard for Isaacs personally, but because the British government considered that the choice of Governors-General was, since the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], a matter for the monarch's decision alone. (However, it became very clear in a conversation between Scullin and King [[George V]]'s Private Secretary, [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], on 11 November 1930, that this was merely the official reason for the objection, with the real reason being that an Australian, no matter how highly regarded personally, was not considered appropriate to be a governor-general.) Scullin was equally insistent that the monarch must act on the relevant prime minister's direct advice (the practice until 1926 was that [[Dominion]] prime ministers advised the monarch indirectly, through the British government, which effectively had a veto over any proposal it did not agree with). Scullin cited the precedents of the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|prime minister of South Africa]], [[J. B. M. Hertzog]], who had recently insisted on his choice of [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|the Earl of Clarendon]] as [[Governor-General of South Africa|governor-general of that country]], and the selection of an Irishman as [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|governor-general of the Irish Free State]]. Both of these appointments had been agreed to despite British government objections.

Despite these precedents, George V remained reluctant to accept Scullin's recommendation of Isaacs and asked him to consider [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood]]. However, Scullin stood firm, saying he would be prepared to fight a general election on the issue of whether an Australian should be prevented from becoming governor-general because he was Australian. On 29 November, the King agreed to Isaacs's appointment, but made it clear that he did so only because he felt he had no option.<ref>{{cite book|last=Souter|first=Gavin|title=Acts of Parliament|location=Carlton, Vic|publisher=Melbourne U.P.|year=1988|pages=266–269|isbn=0522843670}}</ref> (Lord Stamfordham had complained that Scullin had "put a gun to the King's head".) This right not only to advise the monarch directly, but also to expect that advice to be accepted, was soon taken up by all the other Dominion prime ministers. This, among other things, led to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and to the formal separation of the Crowns of the Dominions. Now, the Queen of Australia is generally bound by [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] to accept the advice of the Australian prime minister and [[Premiers of the Australian states|state premiers]] about Australian and state constitutional matters, respectively.

==Styles and titles of Governors-General==
Governors-General have during their tenure the style ''His/Her [[Excellency]] [[the Honourable]]'' and their [[Spouse of the Governor-General of Australia|spouses]] have the style ''His/Her Excellency''. Since May 2013, the style used by a former governor-general is ''the Honourable''; it was at the same time retrospectively granted for life to all previous holders of the office.<ref name=thehon>[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013G00681 The title 'the Honourable' for Governors-General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110135637/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013G00681 |date=10 November 2013 }}, ''Australian Government Special Gazette'' S No. 54 of 2013.</ref>

From the creation of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1975, the governor-general was, ''[[Ex officio member|ex officio]]'', [[Principal of the Order of Australia|Chancellor and Principal Companion]] of the Order, and therefore became entitled to the post-nominal AC. In 1976, the [[letters patent]] for the Order were amended to introduce the rank of Knight and Dame to the Order, and from that time the governor-general became, ex officio, the Chancellor and Principal Knight of the Order. In 1986 the letters patent were amended again, and Governors-General appointed from that time were again, ex officio, entitled to the post-nominal AC (although if they already held a knighthood in the Order that superior rank was retained).

Until 1989, all Governors-General were members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] and thus held the additional style ''[[the Right Honourable]]'' for life. The same individuals were also usually either [[Australian peers and baronets|peer]]s, knights, or both (the only Australian peer to be appointed as governor-general was [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|the Lord Casey]]; and Sir [[William McKell]] was knighted only in 1951, some years into his term, but he was entitled to the style "The Honourable" during his tenure as Premier of New South Wales, an office he held until almost immediately before his appointment). In 1989, [[Bill Hayden]], a republican, declined appointment to the British Privy Council and any [[Australian honours system#Imperial honours|imperial honours]]. From that time until 2014, Governors-General did not receive automatic titles or honours, other than the post-nominal AC by virtue of being Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Australia. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] was the first governor-general to have had no prior title or [[Pre-nominal letters|pre-nominal]] style. She was in office when, on 19 March 2014, the Queen, acting on the advice of Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], amended the letters patent of the Order of Australia to provide, inter alia, that the governor-general would be, ex officio, Principal Knight or Principal Dame of the Order. Until 2015, the honour continued after the retirement from office of the governor-general. Formerly, the governor-general automatically became a knight or dame (if he or she was not already one previously) upon being sworn in.<ref>[http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians Prime Minister's media release "A New Honour for Pre-eminent Australians", 25 March 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325130621/http://www.pm.gov.au/media/2014-03-25/new-honour-pre-eminent-australians |date=25 March 2014 }}  Retrieved 2 May 2014</ref>

==Backgrounds of Governors-General==
All the Governors-General until 1965 were [[United Kingdom|British]]-born, except for Australian-born [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]] (1931–1936) and [[William McKell|Sir William McKell]] (1947–1953). There have been only Australian occupants since then, although [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]] (1982–1989) had been born in Britain. Prince [[Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], was a senior member of the Royal family. [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] (2008–2014) was the first woman to be appointed to the office. Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Zelman Cowen were [[Jews|Jew]]ish; [[Bill Hayden]] was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]]<ref>He became a [[Catholic Church in Australia|Catholic]] in 2018: {{cite news|url=http://catholicleader.com.au/uncategorized/former-atheist-and-political-leader-bill-hayden-baptised-at-age-85-at-st-marys-church-ipswich|title=Former atheist and political leader Bill Hayden baptised at age 85 at St Mary's Church, Ipswich|publisher=[[The Catholic Leader (Brisbane)|The Catholic Leader]]|date=18 September 2018|access-date=22 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222102335/https://catholicleader.com.au/uncategorized/former-atheist-and-political-leader-bill-hayden-baptised-at-age-85-at-st-marys-church-ipswich|archive-date=22 December 2019|url-status=live}}  See also {{cite news |first=Kristian |last=Silva |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-19/bill-hayden-turns-to-god-at-85-baptism-brisbane/10280724 |title=Bill Hayden, former Labor leader, turns to God despite atheist past |work=ABC News |date=19 September 2018 |access-date=22 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001031655/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-19/bill-hayden-turns-to-god-at-85-baptism-brisbane/10280724 |archive-date=1 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> during his term and he made an affirmation rather than swear an oath at the beginning of his commission; the remaining Governors-General have been at least nominally Christian.

Various Governors-General had previously served as governors of an Australian state or colony: [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]] (Victoria 1889–1895); [[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] (South Australia 1899–1902); [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Gowrie]] (South Australia 1928–34; and New South Wales 1935–1936); Major General [[Michael Jeffery]] (Western Australia 1993–2000); [[Quentin Bryce|Dame Quentin Bryce]] (Queensland 2003–2008); General [[David Hurley]] (New South Wales 2014 - 2019). [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson]] had been offered the governorship of South Australia in 1895 and of Victoria in 1910, but refused both appointments. [[Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote|Lord Northcote]] was [[Governor of Bombay]]. Lord Casey was [[Governor of Bengal]] in between his periods of service to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].

Former leading politicians and members of the judiciary have figured prominently. [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]] was [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] (1902–1905). [[John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven|Lord Stonehaven]] (as John Baird) was Minister for Transport in the Cabinets of [[Bonar Law]] and [[Stanley Baldwin]]; and after his return to Britain he became Chairman of the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. Sir Isaac Isaacs was successively Commonwealth Attorney-General, a High Court judge, and Chief Justice. Sir William McKell was Premier of New South Wales. [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Lord Dunrossil]] (as William Morrison) was [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the UK House of Commons]]. [[William Sidney, 1st Viscount De L'Isle|Lord De L'Isle]] was [[Secretary of State for Air]] in [[Winston Churchill]]'s cabinet from 1951 to 1955. More recent Governors-General in this category include Lord Casey, [[Paul Hasluck|Sir Paul Hasluck]], [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]], [[Bill Hayden]] and [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]].

Of the eleven Australians appointed governor-general since 1965, [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]], Sir Paul Hasluck and [[Bill Hayden]] were former federal [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]]; Sir John Kerr was the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]; Sir Ninian Stephen and Sir William Deane were appointed from the bench of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; [[Zelman Cowen|Sir Zelman Cowen]] was a [[Vice-Chancellor|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Queensland]] and constitutional lawyer; [[Peter Hollingworth]] was the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Brisbane]]; and Major-General Michael Jeffery was a retired [[Officer (armed forces)|military officer]] and former [[Governor of Western Australia]]. Quentin Bryce's appointment was announced during her term as [[Governor of Queensland]]; she had previously been the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner. General David Hurley was a retired [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of Defence Force]] and former Governor of New South Wales.

Significant post-retirement activities of earlier Governors-General have included: Lord Tennyson was appointed [[List of Governors of the Isle of Wight|Deputy Governor]] of the [[Isle of Wight]]; Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson (by now Lord Novar) became [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]; and Lord Gowrie became Chairman of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] ([[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster|Lord Forster]] had also held this post, before his appointment as governor-general).

==Tenure==
The [[Constitution of Australia|constitution]] does not set a term of office, so a governor-general may continue to hold office for any agreed length of time. In recent decades the typical term of office has been five years. Some early governors-general were appointed to terms of just one year ([[Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]]) or two years ([[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster|Lord Forster]]; later extended). At the end of this initial term, a commission may be extended for a short time, usually to avoid conflict with an election or during political difficulties.<ref name="GGSrole"/>

The salary of the governor-general was initially set by the constitution, which fixed an annual amount of [[Australian pound|A£]]10,000 until the parliament decided otherwise. The constitution also provides that the salary of the governor-general cannot be "altered" during his or her term of office.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 3.</ref> Under the ''Governor-General Act 1974'', each new commission has resulted in a pay increase. Today, the law ensures the salary is higher than that for the [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] of the High Court, over a five-year period. The annual salary during Michael Jeffery's term was $365,000. Quentin Bryce's salary was $394,000.<ref name=QBS>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23881081-662,00.html Herald Sun, 18 June 2008, governor-general Quentin Bryce to get pay rise]</ref> The current salary is $425,000 and there is a generous pension.<ref>''Governor-General Act 1974'' (Cth), sections 3 and 4;  the pension is 60% of the salary of the [[Chief Justice of Australia|Chief Justice]] at the end of the governor-general's term.</ref> Until 2001, Governors-General did not pay income tax on their salary; this was changed after the Queen agreed to pay tax.<ref name=QBS/>

Three Governors-General have resigned their commission. The first governor-general, [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Hopetoun]], asked to be recalled to Britain in 1903 over a dispute about funding for the post. [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] resigned in 1977, with his official reason being his decision to accept the position of Australian Ambassador to [[UNESCO]] in Paris, a post which ultimately he did not take up, but the resignation also being motivated by the 1975 constitutional controversy. In 2003, Archbishop [[Peter Hollingworth]] voluntarily stood aside while controversial allegations against him were managed, and the [[letters patent]] of the office were amended to take account of this circumstance. He later "stepped down over the church's handling" of "allegations" of sexual abuse of boys, for which he apologised before the [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/peter-hollingworth-apologises-for-poor-handling-of-sex-abuse-complaint|title=Peter Hollingworth apologises for poor handling of sex abuse complaint|first=Australian Associated|last=Press|date=2 February 2016|website=the Guardian|accessdate=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824135055/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/03/peter-hollingworth-apologises-for-poor-handling-of-sex-abuse-complaint|archive-date=24 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1961, [[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Lord Dunrossil]] became the first and, to date, only governor-general to die while holding office.

A governor-general may be recalled or dismissed by the monarch before their term is complete. By convention, this may only be upon advice from the prime minister, who retains responsibility for selecting an immediate replacement or letting the vacancy provisions take effect. No Australian governor-general has ever been dismissed, and it is unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice.{{cn|date=September 2020}} The [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]] raised the possibility of the prime minister and the governor-general attempting to dismiss each other at the same time. According to [[William McMahon]], [[Harold Holt]] considered having [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]] dismissed from the governor-generalship, and went as far as to have the necessary documents drawn up. Casey had twice called McMahon into Yarralumla to give him a "dressing down" over his poor relationship with Deputy Prime Minister [[John McEwen]], which he believed was affecting the government. Holt believed that this was an improper use of his authority, but no further action was taken.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/102077013|title=McMahon 'in Casey row'|date=4 April 1988|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|access-date=5 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406040637/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/102077013|archive-date=6 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

A vacancy occurs on the resignation, death, or incapacity of the governor-general. A temporary vacancy occurs when the governor-general is overseas on official business representing Australia. A temporary vacancy also occurred in 2003 when Peter Hollingworth stood aside.

Section 4 of the constitution allows the Queen to appoint an [[Administrator (Australia)|administrator]] to carry out the role of governor-general when there is a vacancy.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] section 4.</ref> By convention, the longest-serving state governor holds a [[dormant commission]], allowing an assumption of office to commence whenever a vacancy occurs. In 1975, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] advised the Queen that [[Colin Hannah|Sir Colin Hannah]], then [[Governor of Queensland]], should have his dormant commission revoked for having made public political statements.{{clarify|date=March 2018}}

The Constitution of Australia, section 2, provides:<blockquote>A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], section 2.</ref></blockquote>Such further powers are currently set out in [[letters patent]] of 2008 from Queen Elizabeth II;  these contain no substantive powers, but provide for the case of a governor-general's absence or incapacity.<ref>[http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/S179-2008-LettersPatent.pdf Letters Patent, 21 August 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228205038/http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/S179-2008-LettersPatent.pdf |date=28 February 2015 }}.  They also provide for appointment of a deputy, although this has never been done.</ref> The constitution also provides that the governor-general is the monarch's "representative" in exercising the executive power of the Commonwealth (section 61) and as commander-in-chief of the armed forces (section 68).<ref>[[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], sections 61 and 68.</ref>

Australian Solicitor-General [[Maurice Byers]] stated in 1974: "The constitutional prescription is that executive power is exercisable by the governor-general although vested in the Queen. What is exercisable is original executive power: that is, the very thing vested in the Queen by section 61. And it is exercisable by the Queen's representative, not her delegate or agent."<ref name=norepublic/>

This remains the case even when the sovereign is in the country: Solicitor-General [[Kenneth Bailey (Australian lawyer)|Kenneth Bailey]], prior to the first tour of Australia by its reigning monarch in 1954, explained the position by saying: <blockquote>the Constitution expressly vests in the Governor-General the power or duty to perform a number of the Crown's functions in the Legislature and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth... The executive power of the Commonwealth, by section 61 of the Constitution, is declared to be vested in the Queen. It is also, in the same section, declared to be "exercisable" by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative. In the face of this provision, I feel it is difficult to contend that the Queen, even though present in Australia, may exercise in person functions of executive government which are specifically assigned by the constitution to the Governor-General."<ref name="norepublic">{{cite web|url=http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1217&Itemid=25|title=Australians for Constitutional Monarchy|website=Australians for Constitutional Monarchy|accessdate=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408024639/http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1217&Itemid=25|archive-date=8 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>
As early as 1901, the authoritative commentary by [[John Quick (politician)|Quick]] and [[Robert Garran|Garran]] had noted that the Governor-General of Australia was distinguished from other Empire Governors-General by the fact that "[t]he principal and most important of his powers and functions, legislative as well as executive, are expressly conferred on him by the terms of the Constitution itself ... not by Royal authority, but by statutory authority".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Quick|first1=John|last2=Garran|first2=Robert Randolph|title=The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth|url=https://archive.org/details/annotatedconstit00quicuoft|location=Sydney|publisher=Angus & Robertson|year=1901|access-date=25 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325103029/https://archive.org/details/annotatedconstit00quicuoft|archive-date=25 March 2014|url-status=live}} [https://archive.org/details/annotatedconstit00quicuoft p 390] .</ref> This view was also held by Senior Judge of the [[Supreme Court of Tasmania]] [[Andrew Inglis Clark]], who, with W. Harrison Moore (a contributor to the first draft of the constitution put before the 1897 Adelaide Convention and professor of law at the [[University of Melbourne]]), postulated that the [[letters patent]] and the [[royal instructions]] issued by Queen Victoria were unnecessary "or even of doubtful legality".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=145&Itemid=48|title=Australians for Constitutional Monarchy|website=Australians for Constitutional Monarchy|accessdate=24 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624190055/http://www.norepublic.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=145&Itemid=48|archive-date=24 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The monarch chose not to intervene during the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], in which Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]] dismissed the Labor government of [[Gough Whitlam]], on the basis that such a decision is a matter "clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General". Through her Private Secretary, she wrote that she "has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution".<ref name=HorP5E>{{Cite web | url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter1 | title = House of Representatives Practice (5th Edition) | publisher = Parliament of Australia | accessdate = 15 December 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215011458/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/practice/chapter1 | archive-date = 15 December 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref>
In an address to the Sydney Institute, January 2007, in connection with that event, Sir [[David Smith (public servant)|David Smith]], a retired [[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]] who had been Kerr's Official Secretary in 1975, described the constitution as conferring the powers and functions of Australia's head of state on the Governor-General in "his own right". He stated that the Governor-General was more than a representative of the sovereign, explaining: "under section 2 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the Queen's representative and exercises certain royal prerogative powers and functions; under section 61 of the Constitution the Governor-General is the holder of a quite separate and independent office created, not by the Crown, but by the Constitution, and empowered to exercise, in his own right as Governor-General... all the powers and functions of Australia's head of state."<ref name=norepublic />

===Role in the Australian Parliament===

The constitution describes the parliament of the commonwealth as consisting of the Queen, the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Section 5 states that "the Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the Parliament [...] [[legislative session|prorogue]] the Parliament [and] dissolve the House of Representatives." These provisions make it clear that the Queen's role in the parliament is in name only and the actual responsibility belongs to the Governor-General. Such decisions are usually taken on the advice of the prime minister, although that is not stated in the constitution.

The Governor-General has a ceremonial role in swearing in and accepting the resignations of Members of Parliament. They appoint a deputy, to whom members make an [[Oath of Allegiance (Australia)|oath of allegiance]] before they take their seats. On the day parliament opens, the Governor-General makes a speech, entirely written by the government, explaining the government's proposed legislative program.

The most important power is found in section 58: "When a proposed law passed by both Houses of Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare ... that he assents in the Queen's name." The [[royal assent]] brings such laws into effect, as legislation, from the date of signing.

Sections 58 to 60 allow the Governor-General to withhold assent, suggest changes, refer to the Queen or proclaim that the Queen has annulled the legislation. A number of Governors-General have reserved Royal Assent for particular legislation for the Queen. Such assent has usually been given during a scheduled visit to Australia by the Queen. On other occasions Royal Assent has been given elsewhere. Examples of this have been the [[Flags Act 1953|Flags Act (1953)]], the Royal Styles and Titles Acts (1953 and 1973), and the [[Australia Act 1986|Australia Act (1986)]].

===Role in executive government===
At the start of Chapter 2 on executive government, the constitution says "The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative". The Governor-General presides over a [[Executive Council of Australia|Federal Executive Council]]. By convention, the prime minister is appointed to this council and advises as to which parliamentarians shall become [[Minister (government)|ministers]] and [[Parliamentary Secretary|parliamentary secretaries]].

In the constitution, the words "Governor-General-in-council" mean the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Council. Powers exercised in council, which are not reserve powers, include:
* establishing government departments
* appointing federal judges, and
* appointing ambassadors and high commissioners

All such actions are taken on the advice of ministers.

===Military role===
Under [[Section 68 of the Constitution of Australia|section 68 of the constitution]], "the [[Commander-in-chief|command in chief]] of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor‑General". In practice, the associated powers over the [[Australian Defence Force]] are only exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], on behalf of cabinet.<ref name=GGSrole/> The actual powers of the Governor-General as commander-in-chief are not defined in the constitution, but rather in the ''Defence Act 1903'' and other legislation. They include appointing the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] and authorising the deployment of troops.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bn/pol/parliamentaryinvolvement.pdf|publisher=Parliamentary Library of Australia|author=Deirdre McKeown and Roy Jordan|date=22 March 2010|title=Parliamentary involvement in declaring war and deploying forces overseas|page=1–2|access-date=22 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929003716/https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/bn/pol/parliamentaryinvolvement.pdf|archive-date=29 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  There is some ambiguity with regard to the role of the Governor-General in declarations of war.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 3.</ref> In 1941 and 1942, the [[Curtin Government]] advised the Governor-General to declare war on several [[Axis powers]], but then had [[King George VI]] make identical proclamations on Australia's behalf.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 4.</ref> No formal declarations of war have been made since World War II, although in 1973 the [[Whitlam Government]] advised the Governor-General to proclaim the end of [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement in Vietnam]], despite the lack of an initiating proclamation.<ref>McKeown and Jordan (2010), p. 32.</ref>

The powers of command-in-chief are vested in the Governor-General rather than the "Governor-General in Council", meaning there is an element of personal discretion in their exercise.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Ninian Stephen]]|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/about-governor-general/governor-general-commander-chief|title=The Governor-General as Commander-in-Chief|date=21 June 1983|access-date=22 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422113620/http://www.gg.gov.au/about-governor-general/governor-general-commander-chief|archive-date=22 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> For instance, in 1970 Governor-General [[Paul Hasluck]] refused Prime Minister [[John Gorton]]'s request to authorise a [[Pacific Islands Regiment]] peacekeeping mission in the [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]], on the grounds that cabinet had not been consulted. Gorton agreed to put the matter to his ministers, and a cabinet meeting agreed that troops should only be called out if requested by the territory's [[List of Administrators and High Commissioners of Papua New Guinea|administrator]]; this did not occur. Defence Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], who opposed the call out, was responsible for informing Hasluck of the prime minister's lack of consultation.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Malcolm Fraser]] and [[Margaret Simons]]|title=Malcolm Fraser: The Political Memoirs|page=206|publisher=The Miegunyah Press|year=2011}}</ref> The incident contributed to Fraser's resignation from cabinet in 1971 and Gorton's subsequent [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, 1971|loss of the prime ministership]].<ref>Fraser & Simons (2011), p. 222.</ref>

The reserve powers are, according to the Constitution of Australia:
* The power to dissolve (or refuse to dissolve) the House of Representatives (section 5)
* The power to dissolve Parliament on the occasion of a deadlock (section 57)
* The power to withhold assent to bills (section 58)
* The power to appoint (or dismiss) ministers (section 64)

Those powers are generally and routinely exercised on ministerial advice, but the Governor-General retains the ability to act independently in certain circumstances, as governed by convention. It is generally held that the Governor-General may use powers without ministerial advice in the following situations:
* if an election results in a parliament in which no party has a majority, the Governor-General may select the Prime Minister
* if a Prime Minister loses the support of the House of Representatives, the Governor-General may appoint a new Prime Minister
* if a Prime Minister advises a dissolution of the House of Representatives, the Governor-General may refuse that request, or request further reasons why it should be granted; it is worth noting that convention does not give the Governor-General the ability to dissolve either the House of Representatives or the Senate without advice

The use of the reserve powers may arise in the following circumstances:
* if a Prime Minister advises a dissolution of Parliament on the occasion of a deadlock between the Houses, the Governor-General may refuse that request
* if the Governor-General is not satisfied with a legislative bill as presented, they may refuse royal assent
* if a Prime Minister resigns after losing a vote of confidence, the Governor-General may select a new replacement contrary to the advice of the outgoing Prime Minister
* if a Prime Minister is unable to obtain supply and refuses to resign or advise a dissolution, the Governor-General may dismiss him or her and appoint a new Prime Minister

The above is not an exhaustive list, and new situations may arise. The most notable use of the reserve powers occurred in November 1975, in the course of the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]]. On this occasion the Governor-General, [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], dismissed the government of [[Gough Whitlam]] when the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] withheld Supply to the government, even though Whitlam retained the confidence of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Kerr determined that he had both the right and the duty to dismiss the government and commission a new government that would recommend a dissolution of the Parliament.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Events surrounding the dismissal remain extremely controversial.
===Biosecurity emergencies===
{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}
On 18 March 2020,<ref name=decl/> a [[state of emergency|human biosecurity emergency]] was declared in Australia owing to the risks to human health posed by the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Australia]], after the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]] met the previous day. The ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]'' specifies that the Governor-General may declare such an emergency exists if the [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Health Minister]] ([[Greg Hunt]] at the time) is satisfied that "a listed human disease is posing a severe and immediate threat, or is causing harm, to human health on a nationally significant scale". This gives the Minister sweeping powers, including imposing restrictions or preventing the movement of people and goods between specified places, and [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]s.<ref name=emergdec>{{cite web | last=McPhee | first=Sarah | title=Human biosecurity emergency declared in Australia | website=NewsComAu | date=17 March 2020 | url=https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/coronavirus-australia-human-biosecurity-emergency-declared/news-story/cd7fbff78297c076c8bb774595459c59 | access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> The ''Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration 2020'' was declared by Governor-General [[David Hurley]] under Section 475 of the Act.<ref name=decl>{{cite document|url=https://nswbar.asn.au/uploads/pdf-documents/biosecurity_emergency.pdf|title=Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) Declaration2020| access-date=29 March 2020|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia}}</ref>

==Ceremonial role==
[[File:WilliamMorrisonDunrossil.jpg|thumb|[[William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil|Viscount Dunrossil]], 14th Governor-General of Australia (1960–61), in his court uniform, with his vice-regal consort, Viscountess Dunrossil.]]
In addition to the formal constitutional role, the Governor-General has a representative and ceremonial role, though the extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time, the individual in office at the time, the wishes of the incumbent government, and the individual's reputation in the wider community. Governors-General generally become patrons of various charitable institutions, present honours and awards, host functions for various groups of people including ambassadors to and from other countries, and travel widely throughout Australia. [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]] (Governor-General 1996–2001) described one of his functions as being "Chief Mourner" at prominent funerals. In ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia'', Garran noted that, since the Australian executive is national in nature (being dependent on the nationally elected House of Representatives, rather than the Senate), "the Governor-General, as the official head of the Executive, does not in the smallest degree represent any federal element; if he represents anything he is the image and embodiment of national unity and the outward and visible representation of the Imperial relationship of the Commonwealth".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/fed0014.pdf |title=p700 |access-date=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204153912/http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/fed0014.pdf |archive-date=4 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[Image:Flag of the Governor-General of Australia.svg|thumb|left|[[Flag of the Governor-General of Australia]] since 1936]]

That role can become controversial, however, if the Governor-General becomes unpopular with sections of the community. The public role adopted by [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]] was curtailed considerably after the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1975]]; Sir William Deane's public statements on political issues produced some hostility towards him; and some charities disassociated themselves from [[Peter Hollingworth]] after the issue of his management of sex abuse cases during his time as Anglican [[Anglican Diocese of Brisbane|Archbishop of Brisbane]] became a matter of controversy.

At one time, Governors-General wore the traditional [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom#Foreign Service variants|court uniform]], consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the Royal Arms and with bullion edged epaulettes on the shoulders, dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam, silver sword belt with ceremonial sword, bicorne cocked hat with plume of ostrich feathers, black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc., that is worn on ceremonial occasions.<ref>[[iarchive:dresswornathisma00trenuoft|Dress worn at His Majesty's court : issued with the authority of the Lord Chamberlain]] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609090532/https://archive.org/details/dresswornathisma00trenuoft|date=9 June 2016}} (1912), pp. 49, 50</ref> There is also a tropical version made of white tropical wool cut in a typical military fashion worn with a plumed helmet. However, that custom fell into disuse during the tenure of Sir [[Paul Hasluck]].  The Governor-General now wears an ordinary lounge suit if a man or day dress if a woman.

==Diplomatic role==
The governor-general makes [[state visit]]s overseas on behalf of Australia, during which an [[administrator of the government]] is appointed. The right of governors-general to make state visits was confirmed at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], as it was deemed not feasible for the sovereign to pay state visits on behalf of countries other than the United Kingdom.<ref name=smith96>{{cite journal|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=D704CA6CD1B549AF8654FDCFBA383150&_z=z|title=An Australian Head of State: An Historical and Contemporary Perspective|first=David|last=Smith|author-link=David Smith (public servant)|year=1996|journal=Papers on Parliament|publisher=Australian Parliamentary Library|volume=27|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124434/https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/~/~/link.aspx?_id=D704CA6CD1B549AF8654FDCFBA383150&_z=z|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> However, an Australian governor-general did not exercise that right until 1971, when [[Paul Hasluck]] visited New Zealand.<ref name=smith96/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-2466|title=State visit by Governor-General of New Zealand - statement by the prime minister, Mr William McMahon|publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|date=8 September 1971|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124216/https://pmtranscripts.pmc.gov.au/release/transcript-2466|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Hasluck's successor [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]] made state visits to eight countries, but Kerr's successor [[Zelman Cowen]] made only a single state visit – to Papua New Guinea – as he wished to concentrate on travelling within Australia.<ref name=smith96/> All subsequent governors-general have travelled widely while in office and made multiple state visits. Occasionally governors-general have made extended tours visiting multiple countries, notably in 2009 when [[Quentin Bryce]] visited nine African countries in 19 days.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/criticism-over-ggs-africa-tour-20090308-8sgk.html|title=Criticism over G-G's Africa tour|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 March 2009|access-date=7 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124310/https://www.smh.com.au/national/criticism-over-ggs-africa-tour-20090308-8sgk.html|archive-date=9 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==The office of Governor-General as an agency==
The office of Governor-General as an agency of the Commonwealth is regulated by the Governor-General Act 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00392Vth|title=Search|website=www.legislation.gov.au|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> The act provides the Governor-General with a salary (fixed in 2014 at $425,000<ref>Governor-General Amendment (Salary) Act 2014 (Cth)</ref>) and, after leaving office, a lifetime allowance fixed at two-thirds of the salary of the Chief Justice of the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].  There is also provision for a surviving spouse or partner.  The Governor-General appoints an Official Secretary, who in turn appoints other staff.

==History==
The office of "Governor-General" was previously used in Australia in the mid-19th century. [[Charles Augustus FitzRoy|Sir Charles FitzRoy]] (Governor of New South Wales from 1846–1855) and [[William Denison|Sir William Denison]] (Governor of New South Wales from 1855–1861) also carried the additional title of Governor-General because their jurisdiction extended to other colonies in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~natinfo/colony3-3.htm |title=Rulers: Regal and Vice-Regal |work=Colony and Empire |first=Thomas |last=Ross |accessdate=2004-06-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619163640/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~natinfo/colony3-3.htm |archive-date=19 June 2004 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
[[Image:Hopetoun.jpg|thumb|left|The [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Earl of Hopetoun<!--remembered in Australia under this title-->]], the first Governor-General, 1901–1903]]
The office of Governor-General for the Commonwealth of Australia was conceived during the debates and conventions leading up to [[Federation of Australia|federation]]. The first Governor-General, the [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Earl of Hopetoun]], was a previous [[Governor of Victoria]]. He was appointed in July 1900, returning to Australia shortly before the inauguration of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901. After the initial confusion of the [[Hopetoun Blunder]], he appointed the first [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Edmund Barton]], to a caretaker government, with the [[1901 Australian federal election|inaugural 1901 federal election]] not occurring until March.

Early Governors-General were British and were appointed by the Queen or King on the recommendation of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]. The Australian Government was merely asked, as a matter of courtesy, whether they approved of the choice or not. Governors-General were expected{{by whom|date=February 2014}} to exercise a supervisory role over the Australian Government in the manner of a colonial governor. In a very real sense, they represented the British Government. They had the right to "reserve" legislation passed by the [[Parliament of Australia]]: in effect, to ask the [[Colonial Office]] in London for an opinion before giving the [[Royal Assent|royal assent]].<ref>Constitution section 58.</ref> They exercised this power several times.  The Queen (that is, the UK monarch acting upon advice of the British Government) could also disallow any Australian legislation up to a year after the Governor-General had given it the assent;  although this power has never been used.<ref>Constitution section 59.</ref> These powers remain in the Constitution, but today are regarded as dead letters.

The early Governors-General frequently sought advice on the exercise of their powers from two judges of the [[High Court of Australia]], [[Samuel Griffith|Sir Samuel Griffith]] and [[Edmund Barton|Sir Edmund Barton]].<ref>[[Donald Markwell]], "Griffith, Barton and the Early Governor-Generals: Aspects of Australia's Constitutional Development" (1999) 10 ''Public Law Review'' 280.</ref> That practice has continued from time to time.

During the 1920s, the importance of the position declined. As a result of decisions made at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], the Governor-General ceased to represent the British Government diplomatically, and the British right of supervision over Australian affairs was abolished. As the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], later implemented as the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], put it:<blockquote>It is desirable formally to place on record a definition of the position held by the Governor-General as His Majesty's representative in the Dominions. That position, though now generally well recognised, undoubtedly represents a development from an earlier stage when the Governor-General was appointed solely on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers in London and acted also as their representative. In our opinion it is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor-General of a Dominion is the representative of [[the Crown]], holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government.</blockquote> However, it remained unclear just whose prerogative it now became to decide who new Governors-General would be. In 1930, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and the Australian Prime Minister [[James Scullin]] discussed the appointment of a new Governor-General to replace Lord Stonehaven, whose term was coming to an end. The King maintained that it was now his sole prerogative to choose a Governor-General, and he wanted [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood]] for the Australian post. Scullin recommended the Australian jurist [[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]], and he insisted that George V act on the advice of his Australian prime minister in this matter. Scullin was partially influenced by the precedent set by the [[Government of the Irish Free State]], which always insisted upon having an Irishman as the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]].

The King approved Scullin's choice, albeit with some displeasure. The usual wording of official announcements of this nature read "The King has been pleased to appoint ...", but on this occasion the announcement said merely "The King has appointed ...", and his [[Private Secretary to the Sovereign|Private Secretary]] ([[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]]) asked the Australian Solicitor-General, [[Robert Garran|Sir Robert Garran]], to make sure that Scullin was aware of the exact wording.<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', p. 269</ref> The opposition [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] denounced the appointment as "practically republican", but Scullin had set a precedent. The convention gradually became established throughout the Commonwealth that the Governor-General is a citizen of the country concerned, and is appointed on the advice of the government of that country.
[[Image:ac.isaacs.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac Isaacs|Sir Isaac Isaacs]], the first Australian-born Governor-General, 1931–1936]]
In 1931, the transformation was concluded with the appointment of the first Australian Governor-General, Isaacs, and the first British Representative in Australia, [[Ernest Crutchley]]. 1935 saw the appointment of the first [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Australia|British High Commissioner to Australia]], [[Geoffrey Whiskard]] (in office 1936–1941).

After Scullin's defeat in [[1931 Australian federal election|1931]], non-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments continued to recommend British people for appointment as Governor-General, but such appointments remained solely a matter between the Australian government and the monarch. In 1947, Labor appointed a second Australian Governor-General, [[William McKell]], who was in office as the Labor [[Premier of New South Wales]]. The then Leader of the Opposition, [[Robert Menzies]], called McKell's appointment "shocking and humiliating".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=Leonie|title=Signposts|journal=Sydney Morning Herald|date=11 March 2004|volume=37}}</ref>

In 1965 the Menzies conservative government appointed an Australian, [[Richard Casey, Baron Casey|Lord Casey]], and thereafter only Australians have held the position. Suggestions during the early 1980s that the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] might become the Governor-General came to nothing due to the prospective constitutional difficulty that might ensue if Prince Charles became King.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 2007 media outlets reported that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] might become Governor-General of Australia. Both the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], and [[Clarence House]] repudiated the suggestion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|date=30 June 2007|title=Australians reject role for Prince William|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556101/Australians-reject-role-for-Prince-William.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=17 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920091349/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556101/Australians-reject-role-for-Prince-William.html|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pierce|first=Andrew|date=23 November 2009|title=Prince William and Prince Harry: A firm foundation for the brothers in arms|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6634096/Prince-William-and-Prince-Harry-A-firm-foundation-for-the-brothers-in-arms.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=17 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920114112/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/6634096/Prince-William-and-Prince-Harry-A-firm-foundation-for-the-brothers-in-arms.html|archive-date=20 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Patronage==
The Governor-General is generally invited to become Patron of various charitable and service organisations. Historically the Governor-General has also served as [[Scouts Australia|Chief Scout of Australia]]. The Chief Scout is nominated by the Scouting Association's National Executive Committee and is invited by the President of the Scout Association to accept the appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouts.com.au/main.asp?iStoryID=734 |title=Chief Scout |publisher=Scouts Australia |accessdate=15 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082612/http://scouts.com.au/main.asp?iStoryID=734 |archive-date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> [[Bill Hayden]] declined the office on the grounds of his [[atheism]], which was incompatible with the Scout Promise.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Brief Comments |journal=On Target from Australia |volume=25 |issue=13 |publisher=Australian League of Rights |date=14 April 1989 |url=http://www.alor.org/Volume25/Vol25No13.htm |accessdate=15 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204004515/http://www.alor.org/Volume25/Vol25No13.htm |archive-date=4 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He did however serve as the Association's Patron during his term of office.

==Spouse==
{{Main|Spouse of the Governor-General of Australia}}

Spouses of Governors-General have no official duties but carry out the role of a Vice-Regal consort. They are entitled to the courtesy style ''Her Excellency'' or ''His Excellency'' during the office-holder's term of office. Most spouses of Governors-General have been content to be quietly supportive. Some, however, have been notable in their own right, such as [[Alexandra Hasluck|Dame Alexandra Hasluck]], [[Maie Casey, Baroness Casey|Lady Casey]] and [[Michael Bryce]].
