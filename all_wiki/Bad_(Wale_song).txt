==Music video==
Wale spoke about the concept of the video in an interview saying, "It was an amazing experience because it felt like a real movie, The concept of the video is about a girl. She’s trying to find herself by means of intimacy. She hasn’t really discovered what she wants out of love or lust. It’s almost a true story about some of the girls I’ve been with or courted." It features a cameo from Rick Ross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2013/03/20/video-wale-f-tiara-thomas-bad/ |title=Video: Wale f/ Tiara Thomas – ‘Bad’ |publisher=Rap-Up.com  |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref> The music video was directed by [[Alexandre Moors]] and premiered on March 20, 2013, on [[106 & Park]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/watch-wales-new-videos-for-bad-featuring-tiara-thomas-and-the-show-featuring-rick-ross-and-aaron-wess |title=Watch Wale's New Videos for "Bad" featuring Tiara Thomas, and "The Show" featuring Rick Ross and Aaron Wess |magazine=Complex |date=2013-03-13 |accessdate=2013-03-21}}</ref>

"Bad" was officially remixed with the inclusion of guest vocals of Barbadian recording artist [[Rihanna]]. The song was digitally released via the [[iTunes Store]] on June 3, 2013. It also appeared on Wale's third studio album, ''The Gifted''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wete|first=Brad|title=Wale Previews 'The Gifted' Album In NYC: First Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/1562843/wale-previews-the-gifted-album-in-nyc-first-listen|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=23 May 2013}}</ref> On May 10, 2013, R&B singer [[Rihanna]] posted a photo of herself and Wale working in a studio via [[Instagram]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://instagram.com/p/ZJCPsUhMwW/# |title=Photo by badgalriri • Instagram |publisher=Instagram.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref> It was later confirmed that the pair had recorded a remix of the single.

===Composition===
[[File:Rihanna Diamonds World Tour 2013 (Cropped).png|thumb|left|150px|upright|[[Rihanna]] lent her vocals for the remix of "Bad".]]
As noted by [[MTV]], the remix starts with moody synth keys before the familiar "bed springs" squeak, which appeared in the original track, lead to the infidelity-laced hook. Wale and Rihanna also trade rap bars: "Bad girls ain't no good and the good girls ain't no fun," he spits before she answers: "And the bad girls want a real nigga." Rihanna tweaks Tiara Thomas' original section into her own, adding a "touch of her seductive island accent". "Is it bad that, I never made love. I never did it, but I sure know how to fuck," she sings tragically.<ref name="MTV">{{cite news|title=Wale And Rihanna Make Good On 'Bad' Remix|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1708391/wale-rihanna-bad-remix.jhtml|accessdate=3 June 2013|publisher=MTV|date=5 June 2013}}</ref> Wale and Rihanna play off one another on the track and voice their inner turmoil involving the opposite sex. Rihanna sings (also later raps) in response to Wale's laments about a difficult relationship and praises of hot sex on the "bed, floor, couch, more."<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Wale Releases Rihanna-Assisted 'Bad' Remix: Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/1565641/wale-releases-rihanna-assisted-bad-remix-listen|accessdate=3 June 2013|magazine=Billboard|date=5 June 2013}}</ref> It uses a whole new instrumental track that refers to Rihanna's song "[[Loveeeeeee Song]]". Rihanna raps with Wale with similar lyrics to the original song.

===Critical reception===
Rob Markman of [[MTV]] gave the remix a positive review saying, "These days, most rap remixes usually consists of a loose collection of MCs collaborating over pre-existing instrumentals, but for the remix to his hit single 'Bad', Wale had the good sense to do something different. Instead of rounding up a predictable cast of rap characters, Folarin retooled the beat and then added Rihanna to the remix."<ref name="MTV"/>
