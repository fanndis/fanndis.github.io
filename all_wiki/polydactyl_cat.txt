{{short description|Cats with genetic anomaly that causes extra toes}}
[[File:Polydactylcat.jpg|thumb|One of the polydactyl cats at the [[Ernest Hemingway House]] in [[Key West, Florida]].  This particular cat has seven (two extra) toes on each paw.]]

A '''polydactyl cat''' is a [[cat]] with a [[congenital disorder|congenital physical anomaly]] called [[polydactyly]] (or polydactylism, also known as hyperdactyly), which causes the cat to be born with more than the usual number of toes on one or more of its [[paw]]s. Cats with this genetically inherited trait are most commonly found along the East Coast of [[North America]] (in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]) and in [[South West England]] and [[Wales]].

==Occurrence==
Polydactyly is a [[congenital]] abnormality that can be inherited in an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[dominance relationship|dominant]] manner. Some cases of polydactyly are caused by mutations in the ZRS, a genetic enhancer that regulates expression of the [[Sonic hedgehog|Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) gene]] in the limb.<ref name=pmid18156157>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lettice LA, Hill AE, Devenney PS, Hill RE |title=Point mutations in a distant sonic hedgehog cis-regulator generate a variable regulatory output responsible for preaxial polydactyly |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=978–85 |year=2008 |pmid=18156157 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddm370 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The SHH protein is an important signalling molecule involved in patterning of many body elements, including limbs and digits.

Normal cats have a total of 18 toes, with five toes on each fore paw, and four toes on each hind paw; polydactyl cats may have as many as nine digits on their front or hind paws. Both Jake, a Canadian polydactyl cat, and Paws, an American polydactyl cat, were recognised by [[Guinness World Records]] as having the highest number of toes on a cat, 28.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-toes-on-a-cat| title = Most toes on a cat| accessdate = 2015-06-29}}</ref> Various combinations of anywhere from four to seven toes per paw are common.<ref name="Lange">{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Axel |last2=Nemeschkal |first2=Hans L. |last3=Müller |first3=Gerd B. |title=Biased Polyphenism in Polydactylous Cats Carrying a Single Point Mutation: The Hemingway Model for Digit Novelty |journal=Evolutionary Biology |volume=41 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=262–75 |doi=10.1007/s11692-013-9267-y }}</ref> Polydactyly is most commonly found on the front paws only; it is rare for a cat to have polydactyl hind paws only, and polydactyly of all four paws is even less common.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Naming==
Nicknames for polydactyl cats include ''Hemingway cats'',<ref name="AmazingHemingwayCats" /><ref name="HemingwayCatsReprieve" /> ''mitten cats'',<ref name="AmazingHemingwayCats" /> ''conch cats'', ''boxing cats'', ''mitten-foot cats'', ''snowshoe cats'', ''thumb cats'', ''six-fingered cats'', and ''Cardi-cats''. Two specific breeds recognized by some cat fancier clubs are the American Polydactyl and [[Maine Coon]] Polydactyl.

==Breeding==
American Polydactyl cats are bred as a specific cat breed, with specific physical and behavioral characteristics in addition to extra digits.<ref name="centralpets">{{cite web|url=http://www.centralpets.com/animals/mammals/cats/cat5776.html |title=American Polydactyl |accessdate=2007-01-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117224124/http://www.centralpets.com/animals/mammals/cats/cat5776.html |archivedate=January 17, 2007 }}</ref>

The American Polydactyl is not to be confused with the pedigree [[Maine Coon]] polydactyl. The polydactyl form of the Maine Coon is being reinstated by some breeders.<ref name="poly_mc">{{cite web| url = http://maine-cooncat.com/poly_mc.html| title = The History of the Polydactyl Maine Coon| last = Kus| first = Beth E.| accessdate = 2008-02-12}}{{self-published inline|date=May 2016}}</ref>

==Genetics==
In the case of preaxial polydactyly of the Maine Coon cat (Hemingway mutant) a mutation of the cis-regulatory element ZRS (ZPA regulator sequence) is associated. ZRS is a noncoding element, 800 kilobasepairs (kb) remote to the target gene Shh.  An [[ectopia (medicine)|ectopic]] expression of Shh is seen on the anterior side of the limb. Normally Shh is expressed in an organiser region, called the [[zone of polarizing activity]] (ZPA) on the posterior limb side. From there it diffuses anteriorly, laterally to the growth direction of the limb. In the mutant mirroring smaller ectopic expression in a new organiser region is seen on the posterior side of the limb. This ectopic expression causes cell proliferation delivering the raw material for one or more new digits.<ref name="Lettice-2003">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lettice LA, Heaney SJ, Purdie LA, Li L, de Beer P, Oostra BA, Goode D, Elgar G, Hill RE, de Graaff E |title=A long-range Shh enhancer regulates expression in the developing limb and fin and is associated with preaxial polydactyly |journal=Human Molecular Genetics |volume=12 |issue=14 |pages=1725–35 |year=2003 |pmid=12837695 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddg180 |url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/34481/1/Shh+artikel.pdf }}</ref><ref name="Lettice 2012">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lettice LA, Williamson I, Wiltshire JH, Peluso S, Devenney PS, Hill AE, Essafi A, Hagman J, Mort R, Grimes G, DeAngelis CL, Hill RE |title=Opposing functions of the ETS factor family define Shh spatial expression in limb buds and underlie polydactyly |journal=Developmental Cell |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=459–67 |year=2012 |pmid=22340503 |pmc=3314984 |doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.12.010 }}</ref> An identical sequence at this position serves the same function in human and mice and cause similar symptoms when mutated. Different mutations have different specific effects: for example, while the Hemingway (''Hw'') mutant tends to mostly induce extra fingers in the fore limbs, many other mutations affect the posterior limbs too.<ref name=pmid18156157/>

Polydactyly is a spontaneous complex phenotypic variation, developed in one generation. In the concrete preaxial form of the Hemingway (''Hw'') mutant the variation is induced by a single point mutation in a noncoding cis-regulatory element for Shh. In an extensive phenotypic variation like this, one or more complete digits at each single limb are developed including nerves, blood vessels, muscles and ligaments. The physiology of the digits can be perfect. This complex phenotypic result cannot be explained by the mutation alone. The mutation can only induce the variation. In the consequence of the mutation thousands of events, each different from the wildtype, occur on different organisation layers, i.e. expression changes of other genes, cell-cell signal exchange, cell differentiation, cell and tissue growth. The summarized small random changes on all layers build the raw material and the process steps for the generation of the plastic variation.<ref name="Lange" /> The mentioned form of polydactyly of the Hemingway mutant shows a biased variation. In a recent empirical study first the number of extra toes of 375 mutant [[Maine Coon]] cats were variable ([[polyphenism]]) and second, the number of extra toes followed a discontinuous statistical distribution. They were not equally distributed as one might expect of an identical single point mutation. The example demonstrates that the variation is not explained completely by the mutation alone.<ref name="Lange" />
