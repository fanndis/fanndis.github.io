==Early life==

==Early career in journalism==
After a brief period working on a newspaper in Costa Rica,<ref name="Edwardes"/> Katz joined the short-lived ''[[Sunday Correspondent]]'' as a graduate trainee in 1989 along with [[Jonathan Freedland]],<ref>Roy Greenslade [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPR0pB9UCS4C&pg=PA487&lpg=PA487#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits From Propaganda''], London: Macmillan (Pan), 2004, p.487.</ref> a future colleague.

Katz was responsible for the then new guardian.co.uk website in 1998.<ref name="SMC09"/> As features editor in January 2003, he ran an image commissioned from artist [[Gillian Wearing]] for the ''G2'' front cover which consisted of the words: "[[Fuck]] [[Cilla Black]]".<ref name="Katz2003">Ian Katz [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/jan/08/art.artsfeatures "Were we right to do this?"], ''The Guardian'', 8 January 2003.</ref><ref name="Fletcher">Kim Fletcher [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1418427/Gone-to-press.html "Gone to press"], telegraph.co.uk, 10 January 2003.</ref> Intended to promote an article about the decline in the quality of British television, readers complained about the decline in the quality of newspaper journalism.<ref name="Fletcher"/> Black's agent, her son Robert Willis, described it as a "cheap publicity stunt", and Wearing apologised for the offence caused.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2638259.stm "Artist sorry for Cilla insult"], BBC News, 8 January 2003.</ref>

In 2004, while editor of the ''G2'' supplement, and having bought a list of voters, Katz oversaw the campaign for ''Guardian'' readers to pair with undecided voters in the marginal [[Clark County, Ohio]] to help swing the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 US presidential election]] against [[George W. Bush]] and in favour of [[John Kerry]].<ref>Ian Katz [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/21/uselections2004.usa4 "The Last Post"], ''The Guardian'', 21 October 2004.</ref> The campaign did not have a successful outcome; it was dropped after a negative response and Bush won Clark County.<ref name="Bowers">Andy Bowers [http://www.slate.com/id/2109217/ "Dear Limey Assholes&nbsp;...'/A crazy British plot to swing Ohio to Kerry—and how it backfired"], ''Slate'', 4 November 2004.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3981823.stm "Did ''Guardian'' turn Ohio to Bush?"], BBC News, 4 November 2004.</ref><ref>Andy McSmith [http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/05/16/ian-katz-and-the-great-clark-county-stunt/ "Ian Katz and the great Clark County stunt"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517130921/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2013/05/16/ian-katz-and-the-great-clark-county-stunt/ |date=17 May 2013 }}, ''The Independejnt'' (blog), 16 May 2013.</ref> In 2008, he became deputy editor,<ref>Dominic Ponsford [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ian-katz-leaves-guardian-edit-newsnight-and-jamie-angus-new-today-editor "Ian Katz leaves Guardian to edit Newsnight and Jamie Angus is new Today editor"], ''Press Gazette'', 16 May 2013.</ref> at the same time as Paul Johnson<ref>Responsible, according to Ponsford, for News, Business and Sport, he should not be confused with [[Paul Johnson (writer)|the former editor]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]''.</ref> and [[Katharine Viner]].<ref>Laura Oliver [http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/guardian-news-amp-media-names-paul-johnson-as-deputy-editor-/s2/a532056/ "Guardian News & Media names Paul Johnson as deputy editor"], Journalism.co.uk, 6 August 2008.</ref>

==''Guardian'' deputy editor==
As deputy editor, latterly overseeing News and Business coverage from Spring 2010,<ref>Jason Deans [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/mar/26/guardian-reorganises-editorial-executives "Guardian reorganises editorial executives"], ''The Guardian'', 26 March 2010.</ref> Katz supervised ''The Guardian''{{'}}s investigation by [[Nick Davies]], and others, into the [[News International phone hacking scandal]].<ref>Mallary Jean Tenore [http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/138975/guardian-deputy-editor-it-got-pretty-lonely-covering-news-international-scandal/ "Guardian deputy editor: ‘It got pretty lonely’ covering News International scandal"], Poynter, 13 July 2011.</ref> Following the release in 2011 of the [[Palestine Papers]] by broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] and ''The Guardian'', Katz defended 'the newspaper against attacks from [[Ron Prosor]], at the time the Israeli ambassador to the UK, who had seen it as demonstrating the newspaper's "affinity for [[Hamas]]".<ref name="KatzHP11">Ian Katz [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ian-katz/ron-prosors-dishonest-att_b_820951.html "Israeli Ambassador's Dishonest Attacks on the ''Guardian'' Miss the Point"], ''The Huffington Post'', 9 February 2011. It is clear from the links that the American form of rendering a date is being used here.</ref> This assertion Katz wrote was "based on a highly tendentious reading of a single op-ed column [by [[Seumas Milne]]] and a single line of one of two editorials which the paper ran on the Palestine Papers".<ref name="KatzHP11" />

Katz was also one of the newspaper's contacts with [[Julian Assange]] of [[WikiLeaks]], whose material ''The Guardian'' initially published before the relationship between the two organisations turned sour.<ref>Ian Katz [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/05/wikileaks-collaboration-distrust-legal-threats "Pioneering WikiLeaks collaboration ended in distrust and legal threats"], ''The Guardian'', 5 February 2011.</ref> According to an article in ''[[The Australian]]'', [[David Aaronovitch]] of ''[[The Times]]'' at a panel discussion at the [[Frontline Club]] accused Katz of "dirty dealing", while Katz defended himself against an accusation of a "betrayal" of Assange levelled by Aaronovitch in the decision by ''The Guardian'' to publish documents relating to the Swedish sexual allegations involving Assange.<ref>Peter Wilson [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/wikileaks-locked-in-war-of-words/story-e6frg6z6-1225991320260 "WikiLeaks locked in war of words"], ''The Australian'', 20 January 2011.</ref>

Katz was on the final short list of two in 2015 to succeed Alan Rusbridger as editor-in-chief of ''The Guardian'', but Katz's rival, Katharine Viner, was appointed instead.<ref>Adam Sherwin [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katharine-viner-appointed-editorinchief-of-the-guardian-10123851.html "Katharine Viner appointed editor-in-chief of the Guardian"], ''The Independent'', 20 March 2015.</ref><ref>Peter Preston [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/22/katharine-viner-new-editor-guardian "Enter Katharine Viner at the Guardian: new editor, old hand"], ''The Observer'', 22 March 2015.</ref> In the film ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]'' (2013), Katz was portrayed by actor [[Dan Stevens]].<ref name="ES160513">[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/newsnight-post-is-cool-for-ian-katz-8618825.html "Newsnight post is cool for Ian Katz"], ''Evening Standard'', 16 May 2013.</ref>

==''Newsnight'' editor==
Katz joined the BBC in July 2013,<ref name="Plunkett"/> and became editor of ''Newsnight'' at the beginning of September.<ref name="Hewlett"/> Katz was the permanent successor to [[Peter Rippon]], as editor of the programme following serious errors in editorial practice in recent years.

Shortly after becoming editor, Katz sent an unintended [[Twitter|tweet]] late on 9 September. Katz typed, in what he thought was a private direct message, that the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Rachel Reeves]] was "boring snoring" while being interviewed by [[Jeremy Paxman]] on the programme. Katz deleted his tweet and apologised<ref>James Legge [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/newsnight-guest-rachel-reeves-was-boring-snoring-says-shows-editor-ian-katz-on-twitter-8806346.html "Newsnight guest Rachel Reeves was 'boring snoring', says show's editor Ian Katz on Twitter"], ''The Independent'', 10 September 2013.</ref> to both Reeves and the Labour Party.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24032530 "Newsnight's Ian Katz apologises to Labour over tweet"], BBC News, 10 September 2013.</ref>

A year later, Katz returned to the issue of the political interview in an article for the ''[[Financial Times]]''. His mistake, he thought, had been to refer to Reeves when all political interviews had the "boring snoring" quality he had attributed to her appearance on ''Newsnight''.<ref name="Kate050914">Ian Katz [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bd0b95c4-3477-11e4-b81c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3CRZeczGD "The death of the political interview"], ''Financial Times'', 5 September 2014.</ref> He argued for a better understanding between the two sides in the "transaction", so that an interview is "a source of light as well as heat" becoming an opportunity to "explore and illuminate the dilemmas politicians face, to recognise that government is not a choice between good and bad policies but most often a search for the least worst option."<ref name="Kate050914"/>

On 31 October 2017, it was announced that Katz is leaving the BBC, and his role as ''Newsnight'' editor for [[Channel 4]] where became director of programmes in January 2018.<ref name="BBC311017"/><ref name="Brown201801"/>

==Personal life==
Katz is married to [[Justine Roberts]], the chief executive of the [[Mumsnet]] website.<ref name="ES160513"/>
