{{Portal|Christianity}}
The '''supreme governor of the Church of England''' is the titular head of the [[Church of England]], a position which is vested in the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]].<ref name="monarchtoday">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080307003413/http://www.royalinsight.gov.uk/output/Page4708.asp The Monarchy Today > Queen and State > Queen and Church > Queen and Church of England<!-- Bot generated title -->] Cached at the [[Internet Archive]].</ref> Although the monarch's authority over the Church of England is largely ceremonial and is mostly observed in a symbolic capacity, the position is still very relevant to the church. As the supreme governor, the monarch formally appoints high-ranking members of the church on the advice of the [[prime minister of the United Kingdom]], who is in turn advised by church leaders.<ref name="monarchtoday"/>

== History ==
By 1536, King [[Henry VIII of England]] had broken with the [[Holy See]], seized assets of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and declared the [[Church of England]] as the [[Christian state|established church]] with himself as its [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|supreme head]]. The [[Acts of Supremacy#First Act of Supremacy 1534|Act of Supremacy 1534]] confirmed the king's status as having supremacy over the church and required the [[Peerage|peer]]s to swear an oath recognising Henry's supremacy.<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia: Henry Viii">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07222a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Henry Viii<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Henry's daughter [[Mary I]] attempted to restore the English Church's allegiance to the [[pope]] and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09766a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Mary Tudor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Elizabeth I]] ascended to the throne in 1558 and the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] passed the [[Act of Supremacy 1558]] which restored the original act.<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/engref/er79.html Elizabeth's Supremacy Act (1559)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To placate critics, the [[Oath of Supremacy]] which peers were required to swear, gave the monarch's title as supreme governor rather than supreme head of the church. This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or usurping [[Christ]], whom the [[Bible]] explicitly identifies as [[head of the Church]].<ref>Ephesians 5:23</ref>

"[[Defender of the Faith]]" (''Fidei Defensor'') has been part of the English (and since the Union of Scotland and England, British) monarch's title since Henry VIII was granted it by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1521 in recognition of Henry's role in opposing the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia: Henry Viii"/> The pope withdrew the title, but it was later reconferred by Parliament in the reign of [[Edward VI]].

===Thirty-Nine Articles===
The position of the monarch role is acknowledged in the preface to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1562. It states that:

{{quote|Being by God's Ordinance, according to Our just Title, Defender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church, within these Our Dominions, We hold it most agreeable to this Our Kingly Office, and Our own religious zeal, to conserve and maintain the Church committed to Our Charge, in Unity of true Religion, and in the Bond of Peace&nbsp;... We have therefore, upon mature Deliberation, and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following&nbsp;... That We are Supreme Governor of the Church of England&nbsp;... }}

Article 37 makes this claim to [[royal supremacy]] more explicit:

{{quote|The Queen's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other her Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.&nbsp;... [We] give not to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments&nbsp;... but only that prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoers. The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.<ref>[http://acl.asn.au/the-thirty-nine-articles/ The Thirty Nine Articles]</ref>}}

== Church of Scotland ==
The British monarch vows to uphold the constitution of the [[Church of Scotland]] (a [[Presbyterian]] [[national church]]), but does not hold a leadership position in it. Nevertheless, the monarch appoints the [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] as his or her personal representative, with a ceremonial role. The Queen on occasion has filled the role personally, as when she opened the General Assembly in 1977 and 2002 (her [[Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Silver]] and [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]] years).<ref>BBC News "Royal Thanks at Church Assembly" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2007449.stm</ref>
