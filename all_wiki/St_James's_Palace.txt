'''St James's Palace''' is the most senior royal palace in the [[United Kingdom]]. It gives the name, [[Court of St James's]], to the monarch's [[royal court]] and is located in the [[City of Westminster]] in London. Although no longer the principal residence of the monarch, it is the ceremonial meeting place of the [[Accession Council]], the office of the [[Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps]], and the London residence of several minor members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]].

Built by order of [[Henry VIII]] in the 1530s on the site of a leper hospital dedicated to [[Saint James the Less]], the palace was secondary in importance to the [[Palace of Whitehall]] for most [[Tudor Dynasty|Tudor]] and [[Stuart Dynasty|Stuart]] monarchs.  The palace increased in importance during the reigns of the early [[House of Hanover|Georgian]] monarchy, but was displaced by [[Buckingham Palace]] in the late-18th and early-19th centuries.  After decades of being used increasingly for only formal occasions, the move was formalised by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1837.  Today the palace houses a number of official offices, societies and collections, and all ambassadors and high commissioners to the United Kingdom are still accredited to the [[Court of St James's]].  The palace's [[Chapel Royal#St James's Palace|Chapel Royal]] is still used for functions of the [[British royal family]].

Mainly built between 1531 and 1536 in red-brick, the palace's architecture is primarily [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] in style. A fire in 1809 destroyed parts of the structure, including the monarch's private apartments, which were never replaced. Some 17th-century interiors survive, but most were remodelled in the 19th century.

==History==
===Tudors===
The palace was commissioned by Henry VIII on the site of a former [[leprosy|leper]] hospital dedicated to Saint James the Less.{{#tag:ref|The uncertainty as to which Saint James was intended is expressed in the 1874 work ''Old and New London'', where the author refers to the dedication as to "St. James the Less, Bishop of Jerusalem".

The most recognisable feature is the north gatehouse; constructed with four storeys, the gatehouse has two crenellated flanking octagonal towers at its corners and a central clock dominating the uppermost floor and gable; the clock is a later addition and dates from 1731.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45186 British History online Chapter IX: St James's Palace] Access date 15 October 2014</ref> It is decorated with the initials ''H.A.'' for Henry and his second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]].

In 1638, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] gave the palace to [[Marie de Medici]], the mother of his wife [[Henrietta Maria]]. Marie remained in the palace for three years, but the residence of a Catholic former queen of France proved unpopular with parliament and she was soon asked to leave for [[Cologne]]. Charles spent his final night at St James's before his [[execution of Charles I|execution]].<ref name="Walford"/> [[Oliver Cromwell]] then took it over, and turned it into barracks during the [[English Commonwealth]] period. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], [[James II of England|James II]], [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], were all born at the palace.<ref name="Walford"/>

The palace was restored by Charles II following the demise of the Commonwealth, laying out [[St James's Park]] at the same time. It became the principal residence of the monarch in London in 1698, during the reign of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] after [[Whitehall Palace]] was destroyed by fire, and became the administrative centre of the monarchy, a role it retains.

The first two monarchs of the [[House of Hanover]] used St James's Palace as their principal London residence. [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] both housed their mistresses, the [[Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal|Duchess of Kendal]] and the [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Countess of Suffolk]] respectively, at the palace.<ref name="Walford"/> In 1757, George II donated the Palace library to the [[British Museum]];<ref>{{cite book| last=Warner| first=George| title=Queen Mary's Psalter Miniatures and Drawings by an English Artist of the 14th Century Reproduced from Royal Ms. 2 B.

[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] found St. James's unsuitable. The Tudor palace was regarded as uncomfortable and also as not affording its residents enough privacy, or the space to withdraw from the court into family life. In 1762, shortly after his wedding, George purchased Buckingham House{{spaced ndash}}the predecessor to [[Buckingham Palace]]{{spaced ndash}}for his queen, [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]

The Second Round Table Conference (September – December 1931), pertaining to Indian independence, was held at the palace. On 12 June 1941, Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and of the exiled governments of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Yugoslavia, as well as [[Charles de Gaulle|General de Gaulle]] of France, met and signed the Declaration of St James's Palace which was the first of six treaties signed that established the [[United Nations]] and composed the [[Charter of the United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web| title=1941: The Declaration of St. James' Palace| url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1941-declaration-st-james-palace/index.html| website=United Nations| accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>

St James's Palace is still a working palace, and the Royal Court is still formally based there, despite the monarch residing elsewhere. It is also the London residence of [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], [[Princess Beatrice]], and [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]]. The palace is used to host official receptions, such as those of visiting heads of state, and charities of which members of the royal family are patrons. The Palace forms part of a sprawling complex of buildings housing Court offices and officials' apartments. The immediate palace complex includes [[York House, St. James's Palace|York House]], the former home of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and his sons, Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]]. [[Lancaster House]], located next-door, is used by [[UK government|HM Government]] for official receptions, and the nearby [[Clarence House]], the former home of the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]], is now the residence of the Prince of Wales.<ref name="Brit Monarchy">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/Today.aspx|publisher=The British Monarchy|date=n.d.|title=St James's Palace: Today|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> The palace also served as the official residence for [[Princess Eugenie]] until April 2018.<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://people.com/royals/princess-eugenie-jack-brooksbank-move-kensington-palace/| title=Princess Eugenie and Her Fiancé Jack Brooksbank Just Moved Next Door to Harry and Meghan!| journal=[[People (magazine)|People]]| first=Simon| last=Perry| date=1 May 2018| accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>

The nearby [[Queen's Chapel]], built by [[Inigo Jones]], adjoins St James's Palace. While the Queen's Chapel is open to the public at selected times, the [[Chapel Royal#The Chapel Royal St James.27s Palace|Chapel Royal]] in the palace is not accessible to the public. They both remain active places of worship.<ref name="Brit Monarchy"/>

The offices of the [[Royal Collection#Management|Royal Collection Department]], the [[Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps]], the [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]], the [[Chapel Royal]], the [[Gentlemen at Arms]], the [[Yeomen of the Guard]] and the [[Queen's Bargemaster|Queen's Watermen]] are all housed at St James's Palace. Since the beginning of the 2000s, the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]] has been housed at St James's Palace, after spending the entire 20th century at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name="Brit Monarchy"/>

On 1 June 2007 the palace, [[Clarence House]] and other buildings within its curtilage (other than public pavement on Marlborough Road) were designated as a protected site for the purposes of Section 128 of the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], making it a specific criminal offence for a person to [[Trespass in English law|trespass]] into the site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/trespass-on-protected-sites-sections-128-131-of-the-serious-organised-crime-and-police-act-2005|title=Home Office Circular 018 / 2007 (Trespass on protected sites - sections 128–131 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005)|date=22 May 2007|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Home Office|language=en|access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref>
