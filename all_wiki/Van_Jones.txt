== Early life ==
Anthony Kapel Jones and his twin sister Angela were born in [[Jackson, Tennessee]], on September 20, 1968,<ref name="newyorker-kolbert"/> to high school teacher Loretta Jean (née Kirkendoll) and middle school principal Willie Anthony Jones.<ref name="newyorker-kolbert"/> His sister said that as a child, he was "the stereotypical geek—he just kind of lived up in his head a lot".<ref name="newyorker-kolbert">{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Kolbert |author-link=Elizabeth Kolbert |title=Greening the Ghetto |date=January 12, 2009 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/12/090112fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |work=The New Yorker |access-date=August 25, 2009}}</ref> Jones has said as a child he was "bookish and bizarre".<ref name="newyorker-kolbert" /> His grandfather was a leader in the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church]],<ref>{{cite news|first=Ethan |last=Vesely-Flad |title=Addiction to Punishment: Challenging America's Incarceration Industry |work=The Witness |date=January 2002 |url=http://www.thewitness.org/article.php?id=695 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130060920/http://thewitness.org/article.php?id=695 |archive-date=November 30, 2010 }}</ref> and Jones sometimes accompanied him to religious conferences. He would sit all day listening to the adults "in these hot, sweaty black churches".<ref name="newyorker-kolbert" /> Jones was born after the assassinations of President [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], but as he learned about the men's work, he became devoted to them as heroic figures. He pinned photographs of the Kennedy brothers to a [[bulletin board]] in his room in the specially delineated "Kennedy Section". As a child, he matched his ''[[Star Wars]]'' action figures with Kennedy-era political figures; [[Luke Skywalker]] was John, [[Han Solo]] was Robert, and [[Lando Calrissian]] was Martin Luther King Jr.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism">{{cite news |first=Eliza |last=Strickland |title=The New Face of Environmentalism |date=November 2, 2005 |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/gyrobase/the-new-face-of-environmentalism/Content?oid=1079539&showFullText=true |work=[[East Bay Express]] |access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref>

Jones graduated from [[Jackson Central-Merry High School]], a public high school in his hometown, in 1986. He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] in communication and [[political science]] from the [[University of Tennessee at Martin]] (UT Martin). During this period, Jones also worked as an intern at ''[[The Jackson Sun]]'' (Tennessee), the ''[[Shreveport Times]]'' ([[Louisiana]]), and the [[Associated Press]] ([[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] bureau). He adopted the nickname "Van" when he was 17 and working at ''The Jackson Sun.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://player.megaphone.fm/FL8446703782|title=How Van Jones Keeps His Cool in the Cable News Circus|last=W. Kamau Bell & Hari Kondabolu|date=August 3, 2016 |website=Politically Reactive|publisher=First Look Media |access-date=August 3, 2016}}</ref> At UT Martin, Jones helped to launch and lead a number of independent, campus-based publications. They included the ''Fourteenth Circle'' ([[University of Tennessee]]), the ''Periscope'' ([[Vanderbilt University]]), the ''New Alliance Project'' (statewide in Tennessee), and the ''Third Eye'' (Nashville's African-American community).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.noetic.org/person/van-jones|title=Van Jones&nbsp;– About|publisher=Institute of Noetic Sciences}}</ref> Jones later credited UT Martin for preparing him for a larger life.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rita |last=Mitchell |title=Van Jones and the Promise of a Green Future |date=May 25, 2009 |url=http://alumnus.tennessee.edu/2009/05/van-jones-and-the-promise-of-a-green-future/ |work=Tennessee Alumnus |access-date=September 5, 2009}}</ref>

Deciding against journalism, Jones moved to Connecticut to attend [[Yale Law School]]. In 1992, in the aftermath of the [[Rodney King#1991 police assault in Los Angeles|Rodney King beating]] and [[Rodney King#Trial of the officers|trial]], he was among several law students selected by the [[Lawyers Committee for Human Rights]], based in [[San Francisco]], to serve as [[legal observer]]s to the protests triggered by the verdict. King had been beaten by police officers in an incident caught on camera. Three of the officers were acquitted and the jury deadlocked on the verdict of the fourth man. Jones and others were arrested during the protests, but the [[district attorney]] later dropped the charges against Jones.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/> The arrested protesters, including Jones, won a small [[Settlement (litigation)|legal settlement]]. Jones later said that "the incident deepened my disaffection with the system and accelerated my political radicalization".<ref name="vanjonesrodneyking">{{cite news |first=Van |last=Jones |title=15 Years Ago: Rodney King Uprising Left LA in Flames&nbsp;– And Me in Jail! |date=May 13, 2007 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/van-jones/15-years-ago-rodney-king-_b_48361.html |access-date=September 11, 2009}}</ref> Jones was deeply affected by the trial and verdict. In an October 2005 interview, Jones said he had been "a rowdy nationalist on April 28th"<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/> before the King verdict was announced, but that by August 1992 he had become a communist.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/>

Jones's activism was also spurred by seeing the deep [[Racism in the United States|racial inequality]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], particularly in prosecution of drug use: "I was seeing kids at Yale do drugs and talk about it openly, and have nothing happen to them or, if anything, get sent to rehab ... And then I was seeing kids three blocks away, in the housing projects, doing the same drugs, in smaller amounts, go to prison."<ref name="newyorker-kolbert"/> After graduating from law school with his [[juris doctor]] in 1993, Jones moved to [[San Francisco]], and according to his own words, "trying to be a revolutionary".<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/> He became affiliated with many {{Citation needed|reason=not clear that he is affiliated with more than one such organizations. The current reference only reports on the STORM.|date=December 2019}} left activists, and co-founded a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement (STORM). It protested against police brutality, held study groups on the theories of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and aspired to a multi-racial socialist utopia.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/>

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
==== Ella Baker Center for Human Rights ====
Jones was affiliated with the [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights]], which had brought him to the city as a legal observer in 1992. In 1995, Jones initiated their project of Bay Area PoliceWatch, the region's only bar-certified hotline and lawyer-referral service for victims of [[police abuse]]. The hotline started receiving fifteen calls a day.<ref name="newyorker-kolbert"/>

Jones described the development of the project:

<blockquote>"We designed a computer database, the first of its kind in the country, that allows us to track problem officers, problem precincts, problem practices, so at the click of a mouse we can now identify trouble spots and troublemakers", said Jones. "This has given us a tremendous advantage in trying to understand the scope and scale of the problem. Now, obviously, just because somebody calls and says, 'Officer so-and-so did something to me,' doesn't mean it actually happened, but if you get two, four, six phone calls about the same officer, then you begin to see a pattern. It gives you a chance to try and take affirmative steps.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Van Jones|title=Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders Who are Changing Our World|first=Kerry|last=Kennedy |editor-first=Nan |editor-last=Richardson|publisher=Umbrage Editions|location=New York|pages=69–70|isbn=1-884167-33-0|edition=2nd|year=2004}}</ref></blockquote>

By 1996, Jones founded a new umbrella [[NGO]], the [[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]]. He operated out of "a closet-like office" within the space of Eva Paterson, Executive Director of the Lawyers' Committee, and used his personal computer.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/>

In 1996–1997, Jones and PoliceWatch led a campaign to gain the firing of officer Marc Andaya from the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. Andaya was accused of excessive force in the in-custody death in 1995 of Aaron Williams, an unarmed black man who fought on the street with several officers. There was community outrage about his death and pressure on the department to bring justice against Andaya, who witnesses saw kick Williams in the head. In the year after the incident, the press reported that Andaya had a record of incidents of misconduct in the 1980s. The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported in addition that Andaya was named in 10 complaints between 1983 and 1993, eight of them allegedly for misuse of physical force, when he was a policeman with the Oakland Police Department.<ref name="sfgate">[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/PAGE-ONE-Troubled-Past-Of-S-F-Cop-Accused-In-2964146.php Susan Sward, Bill Wallace, "Troubled Past Of S.F.

Panel Fires Officer In Aaron Williams Case"], ''San Francisco Chronicle/SF Gate,'' June 28, 1997; accessed February 20, 2017</ref>

In 1999 and 2000, Jones led a campaign to defeat [[Proposition 21]], which would increase "penalties for a variety of violent crimes and required more juvenile offenders to be tried as adults."<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/> He worked to mobilize a student protest movement against the proposition; this effort made national headlines,<ref>{{cite news |title=California Youth Take Initiative |work=The Nation |first=Robin |last=Templeton |date=February 23, 2000 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/california-youth-take-initiative |access-date=October 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Color Blind |first=Andrew |last=Hsiao |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-07-18/news/color-blind |date=July 18, 2000 |access-date=September 2, 2009}}</ref> but it ultimately imploded. He began to work for more solidarity and building broader alliances across politics and class to achieve goals.<ref name="newfaceofenvironmentalism"/>

The proposition was passed by voters, part of a nationwide wave of states' increasing punishments for crimes. This has led to increasingly high rates of incarceration in the United States, especially of minorities. In 2001, Jones and the Ella Baker Center launched the "Books Not Bars" campaign. From 2001 to 2003, he led an effort to block the construction of a proposed "Super-Jail for Youth" in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]'s [[Alameda County]]. Books Not Bars later launched a statewide campaign to transform California's juvenile justice system.<ref name=ella>[[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]], [http://www.ellabakercenter.org/page.php?pageid=19&contentid=152 Ella Baker Center: A Brief History]. Retrieved August 17, 2009.</ref><!-- Goals? Results? -->

During the [[California recall election, 2003|2003 California gubernatorial recall election]], Jones served as [[Arianna Huffington]]'s statewide grassroots director.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/09/30/MN14003.DTL |title=Huffington considering leaving governor's race |first=Zachary |last=Coile |date=September 30, 2003 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |page=A1}}</ref>

==== Color of Change ====
Following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Jones and [[James Rucker]] co-founded a Web-based grassroots organization to address Black issues, called [[Color of Change]]. Color of Change's mission, as described on its website, is as follows: "ColorOfChange.org exists to strengthen Black America's political voice. Our goal is to empower our members—Black Americans and our allies—to make government more responsive to the concerns of Black Americans and to bring about positive political and social change for everyone."<ref name="aboutcoc">{{cite web |publisher = [[Color of Change]]|url = https://colorofchange.org/about/|title = What Is ColorOfChange.org? |access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref> Jones amicably parted ways with Color of Change within two years after founding the group.

==== Shift to environmentalism ====
By 2005, Jones had begun promoting [[eco-capitalism]] and [[environmental justice]].<ref name="vanjonesnewenvironmentalists">{{cite news |first=Van |last=Jones |title=The New Environmentalists |date=July–August 2007 |url=http://www.colorlines.com/article.php?ID=230 |work=Time |access-date=August 31, 2009}}</ref> In 2005 the Ella Baker Center expanded its vision beyond the immediate concerns of policing, declaring that "If we really wanted to help our communities escape the cycle of incarceration, we had to start focusing on job, wealth and health creation."<ref name=ella/> In 2005, Jones and the Ella Baker Center produced the "Social Equity Track" for the United Nations' [[World Environment Day]] celebration, held that year in San Francisco.<ref name=ellavan>{{cite web |publisher=[[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]] |url=http://ellabakercenter.org/page.php?pageid=16&contentid=100 |title=Van Jones, esq |access-date=August 28, 2009}}</ref> It was the official beginning of what would eventually become Ella Baker Center's Green-Collar Jobs Campaign.

The Green-Collar Jobs Campaign was Jones's first effort to combine his goals of improving racial and economic equality with mitigating environmental damage. He worked to establish the nation's first "Green Jobs Corps" in Oakland. On October 20, 2008, the City of Oakland formally launched the Oakland Green Jobs Corps, a public-private partnership to "provide local Oakland residents with job training, support, and work experience so that they can independently pursue careers in the new energy economy."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Ella Baker Center for Human Rights]] |url=http://www.ellabakercenter.org/index.php?p=gcjc_green_jobs_corps |title=Oakland Green Jobs Corps |access-date=August 28, 2009}}</ref>

==== Green for All ====
In September 2007, Jones attended the [[Clinton Foundation#Clinton Global Initiative (CGI)|Clinton Global Initiative]] and announced his plans to launch [[Green for All]], a new national NGO dedicated to creating green pathways out of poverty in America. The plan grew out of his earlier work with the Ella Baker Center. Green for All was intended to make a national program out of the Green-Collar Jobs mission&nbsp;– creating green pathways out of poverty.

Green for All formally opened its doors on January 1, 2008. In its first year, Green for All organized "The Dream Reborn", the first national green conference in which the majority of attendees were people of color. With [[1Sky]] and the [[We Campaign]], it co-hosted a national day of action for the new economy called "Green Jobs Now". It launched the Green-Collar Cities Program to help cities build local green economies and started the Green for All Capital Access Program to assist green entrepreneurs. As part of the Clean Energy Corps Working Group, it launched a campaign for a Clean Energy Corps initiative which would create 600,000 'green-collar' jobs while retrofitting and upgrading more than 15 million American buildings.<ref name=GFAAR08>{{cite web|publisher=[[Green for All]] |url=http://www.greenforall.org/resources/green-for-all-2008-annual-report |title=A New Movement for a New Century: 2008 Annual Report |access-date=August 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305142903/http://greenforall.org/resources/green-for-all-2008-annual-report |archive-date=March 5, 2009 }}</ref>

In reflecting on Green for All's first year, Jones wrote, "One year later, Green for All is real&nbsp;– and we have helped put green collar jobs on the map ... We have a long way to go. But today we have a strong organization to help get us there."<ref name=GFAAR08/>

Jones advocates a combination of conservation, regulation and investment as a way of encouraging [[environmental justice]] and opposing [[environmental racism]]. In an interview for the "EON Deep Democracy Interview Series", Jones spoke of a "third wave of environmentalism":

<blockquote>The first wave is sort of the Teddy Roosevelt, conservation era which had its day and then, in 1963, [[Rachel Carson]] writes a book, ''[[Silent Spring]]'', and she's talking about toxics and the environment, and that really kind of opens up a whole new wave. So it's no longer just conservation but it's conservation, plus regulation, trying to regulate the bad, and that wave kind of continued to be developed and got kind of a 2.5 upgrade because of the environmental justice community who said, "Wait a minute, you're regulating but you're not regulating equally, the white polluters and white environmentalists are essentially steering poison into the people-of-color communities, because they don't have a racial justice frame."... Now there's something new that's beginning to gather momentum, and it's conservation plus regulation of the bad, plus investment in the good ... beginning to put money into the solutions as well as trying to regulate the problem.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Zb0EVKOkY |title=Green Jobs Not Jails&nbsp;– The Third Wave of Environmentalism |publisher=EON&nbsp;– Ecological Options Network |date=January 19, 2008 |access-date=October 30, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

==== ''The Green Collar Economy'' ====

Jones published his first book, ''[[The Green Collar Economy]],'' in 2008. He describes his "viable plan for solving the two biggest issues facing the country today—the economy and the environment."<ref name="hc">{{cite web|publisher=HarperCollins|title=About the Book: ''The Green Collar Economy''|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780061650765/the-green-collar-economy}}</ref> The book received favorable reviews from [[Al Gore]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Daschle]], [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], and [[Arianna Huffington]].<ref>[http://www.vanjones.net/books Books&nbsp;– Van Jones], vanjones.net</ref>

In the book, Jones contended that invention and investment was needed to transition from a pollution-based "grey economy" and into a healthy new "green economy".<ref>{{cite book |first=Van |last=Jones |title=The Green Collar Economy |url=https://archive.org/details/greencollarecon000jone |url-access=registration |year=2008 |publisher=HarperOne |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-165075-8}}</ref> Jones wrote:

{{quote|We are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely.

So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs—and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world—and everyone else.}}

Jones had a limited publicity budget and no national media platform. But a viral, web-based marketing strategy earned the book a #12 debut on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list. Jones and Green For All used "a combination of emails and phone calls to friends, bloggers, and a network of activists" to reach millions of people.<ref name="huff08">{{cite news |work=The Huffington Post |date=October 20, 2008 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/20/how-environmental-activis_n_136054.html |title=How Environmental Activist Van Jones' Book 'The Green Collar Economy' Reached the NYT Best Sellers List |first=Nicholas |last=Sabloff |access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref> Due to the marketing campaign's grassroots nature, Jones said that achieving bestseller status was a victory for the entire green-collar jobs movement. In August 2008 Jones was featured on the grassroots radio program ''Sea Change Radio.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cchange.net/2008/08/20/green-collar-jobs-build-the-clean-energy-economy/|title=Green Collar Jobs Build the Clean Energy Economy|access-date=January 26, 2016|website=Sea Change Radio|date=August 20, 2008}}</ref> ''The Green Collar Economy'' is the first environmental book written by an African-American to make the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.<ref name="GFAAR08" />

=== Obama White House ===
==== Special Advisor for Green Jobs ====
In March 2009, Jones was appointed as Special Advisor for Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the [[White House Council on Environmental Quality]].<ref name=WhiteHouse/> Jones, while an ardent supporter of President [[Barack Obama]], had not planned on working for his administration. Jones later said, "when they asked the question, I burst out laughing because at the time it seemed completely ludicrous that it would even be an option. I think what changed my mind was interacting with the administration during the transition process and during the whole process of getting the recovery package pulled together."<ref>{{cite news |first=Doug |last=Pibel |title=Van Jones: Why I'm Going to Washington |date=March 10, 2009 |url=http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/food-for-everyone/3368 |work=Yes Magazine |access-date=September 1, 2009}}</ref>

He described his role as "the green-jobs handyman. I'm there to serve. I'm there to help as a leader in the field of green jobs, which is a new field.
