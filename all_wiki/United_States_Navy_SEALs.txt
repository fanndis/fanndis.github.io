The '''United States Navy Sea, Air, and Land''' ('''SEAL''') '''Teams''', commonly known as '''Navy SEALs''', are the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy's]] primary [[special operations force]] and a component of the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|Naval Special Warfare Command]]. Among the SEALs' main functions are conducting small-unit special operation missions in maritime, jungle, urban, arctic, mountainous, and desert environments. SEALs are typically ordered to capture or to eliminate high level targets, or to gather intelligence behind enemy lines.<ref name="Navy Seal History">{{cite web |url=http://navyseals.com/nsw/navy-seal-history/ |title=Navy SEAL History |website=Navy Seals.com |accessdate=16 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031225738/http://navyseals.com/nsw/navy-seal-history/ |archive-date=31 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==

===Origins===
Although not formally founded until 1962, the modern-day U.S. Navy SEALs trace their roots to [[World War II]].<ref name="Navy Seal History"/> The United States Military recognized the need for the [[covert]] [[Amphibious reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] of [[Amphibious assault|landing beaches]] and [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defense]]s. As a result, the joint Army, Marine Corps and Navy [[Scouts and Raiders|Amphibious Scout and Raider]] School was established in 1942 at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]].<ref name="Navy Seals History sealswcc.com"/> The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], from the [[Observer Group]], a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit.

=== Scouts and Raiders ===
Recognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek|Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Little Creek]], Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders' mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach.<ref name="Navy Seal History"/> The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy chief petty officers and sailors came from the boat pool at ATB, Solomons, Maryland and Army Raider personnel came from the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]] and [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]s. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. [[Operation Torch]] was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa.<ref>https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-storyseal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii</ref>

The first group included [[Phil H. Bucklew]], the "Father of Naval Special Warfare," after whom the Naval Special Air Force Warfare Center|Naval Special Warfare Center building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in [[Sicily]], [[Salerno]], [[Anzio]], [[Normandy]], and [[southern France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii/ |title=SEAL History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare-WWII |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>

The second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named [[Special Service Unit No. 1]], was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and [[combined operations]] force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at [[Finschhafen]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Later operations were at [[Gasmata]], [[Battle of Arawe|Arawe]], [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]], and the east and south coasts of [[New Britain]], all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Naval personnel was reassigned. The unit, renamed 7th Amphibious Scouts, received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles, and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.<ref name="Navy Seal History"/>

The third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization|Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO)]]. To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for "Amphibious Raider" at the Scout and Raider school at [[Fort Pierce, Florida]]. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a "guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes, and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans." While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at [[Camp Knox]] in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper [[Yangtze River]] in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as [[coolies]], conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kitchioh]] Wan, near [[Hong Kong]].<ref name="Navy Seal History"/>

=== Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs) ===
[[File:Naval Combat Demolition Unit 45.jpg|thumb|NCDU 45, CEC Ensign Karnowski, Chief Carpenters Mate Conrad C. Millis, MM2 Equipment Operator Lester Meyers and three sailors. The unit received a Presidential Unit Citation with Ens. Karnowski earning the [[Navy Cross]] & French [[Croix de Guerre]] with Palm, while MM2 Meyers received a [[Silver Star]].<ref name="KarnowskiNCDU-45">{{cite web |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2014/06/06/opening-omaha-beach-ensign-karnowski-and-ncdu-45/ |first=Frank A. |last=Blazich |title=Opening Omaha Beach: Ensign Karnowski and NCDU-45 |date=6 June 2014 |website=Seabees Online |publisher=Navy Facilities Engineering Command,Attn: SEABEE Online (Code PA), 1322 Patterson Ave., S.E., Bldg. 33, Suite 1000, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20374-5065 |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref>]]

In September 1942, 17 Navy salvage personnel arrived at ATB [[Little Creek, Virginia]] for a week-long course in demolitions, explosive cable cutting and commando raiding techniques. On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during [[Operation Torch]] in North Africa. This enabled {{USS|Dallas|DD-199}} to traverse the water and insert [[U.S. Rangers]] who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.

In early May 1943, a two-phase "Naval Demolition Project" was directed by the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] "to meet a present and urgent requirement". The first phase began at ATB Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the [[Seabee]]'s NTC [[Camp Peary]] dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily.<ref name="navysealmuseum.org">{{cite web |url=https://www.navysealmuseum.org/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-origins-of-naval-special-warfare-wwii |title=Seal History: Origins of Naval Special Warfare – WWII |website=Navy Seal Museum Archives |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> At that time Lieutenant Commander [[Draper L. Kauffman]], "The Father of Naval Combat Demolition," was selected to set up a school for Naval Demolitions and direct the entire Project.   The first six classes graduated from "Area E" at NTC Camp Peary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specwarnet.net/americas/NCDU.htm|title=Naval Combat Demolition Units|publisher=specwarnet|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> LCDR Kauffman's needs quickly out-grew "Area E" and on 6 June 1943 he established NCDU training at Fort Pierce. Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) and enlisted Seabees. Training commenced with a grueling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates.

By April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]], the amphibious landing at [[Normandy]]. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at [[Omaha Beach]] managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at [[Utah Beach]] met less intense enemy fire. They cleared {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} of beach in two hours, another {{convert|900|yd|m|abbr=off}} by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944, four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings [[Operation Dragoon]] in southern France.  It was the last amphibious operation in the [[European Theater of Operations]].  With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the [[Underwater Demolition Team|Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs)]] for the Pacific.

Thirty NCDUs<ref name="UDT Cold"/> had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy.  NCDUs 1–10 were staged on [[Florida Island]] in the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)]] during January 1944.<ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25">World War II US Navy Special Warfare Units, Eugene Lipak, Osprey Publishing, POB 3985, NY,NY, 10185. 2014, '''p. 25'''</ref> NCDU 1 went briefly to the [[Aleutians]] in 1943.<ref name= "NCDU">{{cite web|url=https://www.navy.mil/Ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=106553|title=A Glance at the Origins of Naval Special Warfare|publisher=United States Navy|date=1 August 2018}}</ref> NCDUs 4 and 5 were the first to see combat by helping the [[4th Marine Regiment|4th Marines]] at [[Green Island, Papua New Guinea|Green Island]] and [[Emirau Island]].<ref name= "NCDU"/> A few were temporarily attached to UDTs.<ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25"/> Later NCDUs 1–10 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able.<ref name="US Navy Special Warfare Units 2014, p. 25"/> Six NCDUs: 2,3, 19, 20, 21 and 24 served with the Seventh Amphibious Force and were the only remaining NCDUs at the end of the war. The [[Naval Special Warfare Command]] building is named for LTJG Frank Kaine CEC commander of NCDU 2.

=== OSS Maritime Unit ===
Much like their brethren in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] (aka Green Berets), the Navy SEALs claim a lineage to the [[Office of Strategic Services|Office of Strategic Services (OSS)]]. The OSS was a paramilitary organization and also a progenitor of the CIA.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Special Operations |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/oss/art05.htm |website=OSS Library}}</ref> Army Special Forces, founded in 1952 by former members of the OSS, established the first military special operations [[combat diver]] units nearly a decade before the SEALs were created in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |last1=US National Archives |title=The Big Picture #372 US ARMY |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.2569641 |website=National Archives |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Some of the earliest World War II predecessors of the Green Berets and SEALs were the Operational Swimmers of the OSS.

The OSS executed special operations, dropping operatives behind enemy lines to engage in organized guerrilla warfare as well as to gather information on such things as enemy resources and troop movements.<ref name=vann /> British Combined Operations veteran LCDR Wooley, of the Royal Navy, was placed in charge of the OSS Maritime Unit (MU) in June 1943. Their training started in November 1943 at Camp Pendleton, California, moved to Santa Catalina Island, California in January 1944, and finally moved to the warmer waters of The Bahamas in March 1944. Within the U.S. military, they pioneered flexible [[swimfin]]s and [[diving mask]]s, [[Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit|closed-circuit diving equipment]] (under the direction of Dr. [[Christian J. Lambertsen]]),<ref name=vann>{{cite journal |last=Vann |first=R. D. |title=Lambertsen and O2: beginnings of operational physiology |journal=[[Undersea Hyperb Med]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=21–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15233157 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3987}}</ref><ref name=butler>{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=F.

The mission of the OSS MU was "to infiltrate agents and supply resistance groups by sea, conduct maritime sabotage, and to develop specialized maritime surface and subsurface equipment and devices." The MU operated in several theaters. In the Mediterranean, a fleet of hired Greek wooden fishing vessels—called caiques—covertly supported OSS agents in Albania, Greece, and Yugoslavia. After Italy surrendered, the MU and the San Marco battalion, an elite Italian special operations naval unit, operated against the Germans. In the Far East, the MU operated in conjunction with an Operational Group to attack Japanese forces on the Arakan coast of Burma. They jointly conducted reconnaissance missions on the Japanese-held coast, sometimes penetrating several miles up enemy-controlled rivers.<ref name="Maritime Unit">{{cite web |last1=United States Army Special Operations Command |title=Maritime Unit |url=https://www.soc.mil/OSS/maritime-unit.html |website=soc.mil |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>

The MU developed or used several innovative devices that would later allow for the creation of a special operations combat-diver capability, first in Army Special Forces (Green Berets) and later in US Navy SEAL units. Perhaps the most important invention in the realm of special operations diving was the [[LAR5|Lambertsen Rebreathing Unit]] (LARU) invented by [[Christian Lambertsen|Dr. Christian J. Lambertsen]]. The Lambertsen unit permitted a swimmer to remain underwater for several hours and to approach targets undetected because the LARU did not emit telltale air bubbles. The LARU was later refined, adapted, and the technology used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, and NASA. The Army Special Forces Underwater Operations School at Key West, Florida, the home of Special Forces maritime operations, draws its roots from the Maritime Unit.<ref name="Maritime Unit"/>

Lambertsen began his involvement with OSS as a medical student offering the use of his technology to the secretive organization in 1942. In 1944 he was commissioned as an Army Officer and later joined the OSS as an Operational Swimmer. Lambertsen himself led the OSS Maritime Unit on covert underwater missions to attach explosives to Japanese ships.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chace |first1=Dave |title=Dr. Christian Lambertsen: 70 years of influence on the military dive community |url=https://www.army.mil/article/75716/dr_christian_lambertsen_70_years_of_influence_on_the_military_dive_community |website=US Army |accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> Dr. Christian Lambersten is remembered today as the 'Father of Military Underwater Operations'. He, along with all the members of the OSS Maritime Unit, was made honorary Green Berets and recognized by organizations like the UDT Navy Seal Association for their heroic and critical work.<ref>{{cite web |last1=OSS Maritime Unit |url=http://www.maritimeunit.org/}}</ref>

In May 1944, Colonel "Wild Bill" [[William Joseph Donovan|Donovan]], the head of the OSS, divided the Maritime Unit into four groups and approached [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] and [[Chester William Nimitz, Sr.|Admiral Nimitz]] about using OSS men in the Pacific<ref name= "UDT10">{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/oss-in-action-the-pacific-and-the-far-east.htm|title=Series: OSS Training in the National Parks and Service Abroad in World War II|publisher=nps.gov|date=8 August 2017}}</ref> Gen. MacArthur had no interest at all.<ref name= "UDT10"/> Adm Nimitz looked at Donovan's list of units and also said no thank you except he could use the swimmers from the Maritime Unit to expand the UDTs.<ref name= "UDT10"/> He was primarily interested in them for being swimmers, not their military training.  The interest in the tactical applications of the [[OSS Operational Swimmers]]' training only developed later but most of Group A's gear was put into storage as it was not applicable to UDT work.<ref name= "OSS"/> The OSS was very restricted in operations in the Pacific.

They were reported captured in Japanese communications and identified as "BAKUHATAI" — explosive ordnance men.<ref>BAKUHATAI, The Reconnaissance Mission of the USS Burrfish and the Fate of Three American POWs, BY NATHANIEL PATCH, Prologue Magazine, Winter 2015, p.26-33, National Archives and Records Administration, 700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20408-0001 [https://www.archives.gov/files/publications/prologue/2015/winter/bakuhatai.pdf]</ref> They were never seen again and are listed as [[Missing in action|MIA]]s.

Prior to [[Operation Galvanic]] and [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], V Amphibious Corps had identified [[coral]] as an issue for future [[amphibious operations]].  Rear Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]], commander [[V Amphibious Corps]] had ordered a review to get a grip on the problem.  VAC found that the only people having any applicable experience with the material were men in the Naval Construction Battalions.  The Admiral tasked Lt. T. C. Crist (CEC) with developing a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team to do it.<ref name="UDT Cold">The Water Is Never Cold, James Douglas O'Dell, 2000, Brassey's, 22841 Quicksilver Drive, Dulles, Va. 20166, {{ISBN|1-57488-275-9}}</ref> Lt. Crist started by getting others he had blasted coral with in CB 5.  By the end of November 1943 he had close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted gathered at [[Waipio]] Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu.<ref name="UDT Cold"/>

On 23 November 1943, the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] suffered heavy losses at [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]].  The second wave of [[landing craft]] ran aground on [[coral reefs]] in unexpected shallows due to the [[tide]]s. As a result, Admiral [[Richmond K. Turner|Kelly Turner]] requested the formation of nine [[underwater demolition teams]] for advance landing [[reconnaissance]] and demolition of beach obstructions. Six would be assigned to VAC in the Central Pacific while the other three would go to [[III Amphibious Corps]] in the South Pacific. UDTs 1 and 2 consisted of men Lt. Crist had gathered at Waipio.<ref name="UDT Cold"/> When Teams 1 and 2 were initially formed they were "provisional" with 180 men total.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viewoftherockies.com/UDT1and2.html |title=WWII UDT One & WWII UDT Two |website=View of the Rockies |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref> The first underwater demolition team commanders were Cmdr. E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and Lt. Crist (CEC) UDT 2. (Lt. Crist was replaced because Admiral Conolly wanted Line Officers with combat experience). The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats – similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein [[Fort Pierce]] protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC. Ens. Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Atchison wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat. They stripped down and spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out they were taken directly to Admiral Turner's [[flagship]] to report, still in their trunks.  Admiral Turner concluded that daylight reconnaissance by individual swimmers was the way to get accurate information on coral and underwater obstacles for upcoming landings.

At wars end 34 teams had been formed with teams 1–21 having actually been deployed.  The Seabees provided over half of the men in the teams that saw service.  The U.S. Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post-war and when they did they gave credit to Lt.

The next largest group of UDT volunteers came from the joint Army-Navy [[Scouts and Raiders]] school that was also in Fort Pierce and the [[Explosive ordnance disposal (United States Navy)|Navy's Bomb disposal School]] in the Seabee dominated teams.

Three days after requesting the creation of UDTs Admiral Turner also requested the creation of a "Naval Combat Demolition Training & Experimental Base" at [[Kihei, Hawaii]]. The actions of UDT 1 were immediately incorporated in the training which made it distinctly different from that at Fort Pierce. The first head of training was Seabee Lt. T.C. Crist [[Roi-Namur]]. He was in that position briefly from when UDTs 1 & 2 were decommissioned until he was made Commander of UDT 3.

The UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, [[swimfins]], [[diving mask]]s and [[Ka-bar]]s.

The last UDT operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]].

===Korean War===
[[File:US Navy SEALs SEAL jumps over side boat.jpg|thumb|UDT members using the casting technique from a speeding boat]]
The [[Korean War]] began on 25 June 1950, when the [[North Korea]]n army invaded [[South Korea]]. Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the "Forgotten War" the UDTs fought intensively, beginning to employ demolition expertise gained from WWII and use it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets, and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the [[Republic of Korea]] [[Republic of Korea Navy Special Warfare Flotilla|Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)]], which continues today.<ref name="Navy Seal History"/>

The UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War, through their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war, the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions include transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.<ref name="Navy Seal History"/>

As part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT Lieutenant Ted Fielding, "We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do." (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-history-underwater-demolition-teams-in-the-korean-war/ |title=SEAL History: Underwater Demolition Teams in the Korean War |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S. minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an "aqualung" when he dove on {{USS|Pledge|AM-277|6}}. For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.<ref name="Navy Seal History"/>

=== Birth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War ===
{{Main|Vietnam War}}
President [[John F. Kennedy]], aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for [[unconventional warfare]] and [[special operations]] as a measure against [[guerrilla warfare]]. In a speech, to [[United States Congress|Congress]], on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]]. While his announcement of the government's [[Apollo program|plan to put a man on the moon]] drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100&nbsp;million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been underway since the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |title=Genesis of the U.S. Navy's SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) Teams |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222183844/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/genesis-of-the-u-s-navys-sea-air-land-seal-teams/ |archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref>

The Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Arleigh Burke]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], recommended the establishment of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] and [[Counter-guerrilla warfare|counter-guerrilla]] units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s, who had already gained extensive experience in [[commando]] warfare in [[Korean War|Korea]]; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.<ref name="Navy Seal History" />

[[File:Members of SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two (SDVT-2).jpg|thumb|Members of [[SDVT-2|SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two]] in a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] of the submerged {{USS|Philadelphia|SSN-690|6}}]]
The first two teams were formed in January 1962<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/viewVideo.asp?id=17950 |title=Video gallery: Forged by Adversity |date=2 January 2013 |publisher=United States Navy}}</ref> and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], in San Diego, California and Team Two at [[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments.<ref name="Navy Seals History sealswcc.com"/> Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as [[hand-to-hand combat]], [[HALO jump|high-altitude parachuting]], [[demolitions]], and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the [[Cuyamaca Peak|Cuyamaca Mountains]]. After SBI training class, they would enter a [[platoon]] and conduct platoon training.

According to founding SEAL team member [[Roy Boehm]], the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in a prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion Boehm and another SEAL smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.<ref>{{cite book |title=First SEAL |first1=Ray |last1=Boehm |first2=Charles |last2=Sasser |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0-67153-625-1 }}</ref>

The [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific Command]] recognized [[Vietnam]] as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started [[hydrographic survey]]s and along with other branches of the US Military, the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to [[South Vietnam]] as advisors for the purpose of training [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] [[commando]]s in the same methods they were trained themselves.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] began using SEALs in [[covert operation]]s in early 1963. The SEALs were involved in the CIA sponsored [[Phoenix Program]] where it targeted key North Vietnamese Army personnel and [[Vietcong]] sympathizers for capture and assassination.

The SEALs were initially deployed in and around [[Da Nang]], training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions, and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the [[Rung Sat Special Zone]] where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the [[Mekong Delta]] to fulfill [[Brown-water navy|riverine]] operations, fighting on the inland waterways.

[[File:NavySeal1967Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|SEALs on patrol in the [[Mekong Delta]]]]
Combat with the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]] was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The Viet Cong referred to them as "the men with green faces," due to the [[camouflage]] [[Body painting#Use in military|face paint]] the SEALs wore during combat missions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Point Man |first1=James |last1=Watson |first2=Kevin |last2=Dockery |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Avon Books |isbn=0-380-71986-X}}</ref>

In February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in Vietnam to conduct direct action missions. Operating from [[Nhà Bè Base]], near the Rừng Sác Special Zone, this detachment signaled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis. SEALs also served as advisors for Provincial Reconnaissance Units and the Lein Doc Nguio Nhia, the Vietnamese SEALs.<ref name="Navy Seals History sealswcc.com"/>
[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1967-1969.jpg|thumb|1st [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1967 to June 1969.]]

SEALs continued to make forays into North Vietnam and Laos, and covertly into [[Cambodia]], controlled by the [[Studies and Observations Group]]. The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with South Vietnamese Commandos ([[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]). In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units, which were called South Vietnamese [[Provincial Reconnaissance Unit]]s (PRUs).

[[File:Presidential Unit Citation SEAL TEAM TWO 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] awarded to SEAL Team TWO for extraordinary heroism in Vietnam from July 1969 to June 1971.]]

By 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] initiated a Plan of [[Role of United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969–1975|Vietnamization]], which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left Vietnam on 7 December 1971, the last SEAL advisor, left Vietnam in March 1973. South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces in April 1975. The SEALs were among the highest decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one [[Medal of Honor]], two [[Navy Cross]]es, 42 [[Silver star]]s, 402 [[Bronze Star]]s, two [[Legions of Merit]], 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals<ref name="SEAL Combat Manual">{{Cite book |title=US Navy SEAL Combat Manual |year=1974 |page=xvi |url=https://www.federaljack.com/ebooks/US-Navy-SEAL-Combat-Manual.pdf}}.</ref> Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses.

===Grenada===
{{Main|United States invasion of Grenada}}
Both SEAL Team Four and SEAL Team Six, the predecessor to [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group#Operation Urgent Fury|DEVGRU]], participated in the US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's [[Paul Scoon|Governor-General]] and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C130 Hercules with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] [[satellite phone]]. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in [[AC-130]] gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.

The team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by [[BTR-60]] armored personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.

===Iran–Iraq War===
{{Main|Operation Prime Chance}}
During the closing stages of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] the United States Navy began conducting operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed [[Operation Prime Chance]]. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD techs were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (United States)|Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment]]. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted [[VBSS]] (Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the takedown of the ''[[Iran Ajr]]<!--Not a spelling error, this is the name of a ship-->''. Evidence gathered on the ''Iran Ajr'' by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58}}. This chain of events led to [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.

During Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.

===Panama===
{{Main|United States invasion of Panama}}
[[File:US Navy 100107-N-0000X-003 Members of Seal Team 4 pose for a group photo before Operation Just Cause.jpg|thumb|Members of SEAL Team 4 immediately before the start of Operation Just Cause]]
The United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to the invasion of Panama, codenamed [[Operation Just Cause]]. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate [[Naval Special Warfare Development Group]] (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of [[Panamanian Defense Forces]] (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as [[Operation Nifty Package]]), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.

The strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs, Lt Edward S. Coughlin, EN-3 Timothy K. Eppley, ET-1 Randy L. Beausoleil, and PH-2 Chris Dye, swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V [[rebreathers]] and attached [[C-4 (explosive)|C4 explosives]] to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the ''Presidente Porras''.

Task Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]]. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead and thirteen wounded. Killed were Lt. John Connors, Chief Petty Officer [[Donald L. McFaul|Donald McFaul]], Torpedoman's Mate 2nd Class Issac Rodriguez, and Boatswain's Mate 1st Class Chris Tilghman.

===Persian Gulf War===
{{main|Gulf War}}
In August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. They infiltrated the capital city of [[Kuwait]] within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their [[Desert Patrol Vehicle]]s when it was recaptured.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=14}}

===Somalia Intervention===
On 6 December 1992, as part of [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]], U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of [[Mogadishu]] airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country. They suffered only one casualty, who was injured by an IED.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psywarrior.com/SomaliaHerb.html |title=United States PSYOP in Somalia |first=Herbert A. |last=Friedman |website=Psywarrior |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.leeds.ac.uk/papers/pmt/exhibits/2740/PSYOP_in_Somalia.pdf |title=PSYOP in Somalia: The Voice of Hope |last1=Borchini |first1=Charles P.

In August 1993 a four-man DEVGRU SEAL sniper team was deployed to Mogadishu to work alongside [[Delta Force]] as part of [[Task Force Ranger]] in the search for Somali warlord [[Mohammed Farrah Aidid]]. They took part in several operations in support of the CIA and Army culminating in the 3 October '[[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]' where they were part of the ground convoy raiding the Olympic Hotel. All four SEALs would be later awarded the Silver Star in recognition of their bravery whilst Navy SEAL [[Howard E. Wasdin]] would be awarded a Purple Heart after continuing to fight despite being wounded three times during the battle.<ref>{{cite book |title=Seal Team Six: The incredible story of an elite sniper – and the special operations unit that killed Osama Bin Laden |first1=Howard E. |last1=Wasdin |first2=Stephen |last2=Templin |year=2011 |location=London, UK |publisher=[[Sphere Books]] |isbn=978-1-84744-549-0 }}</ref>

===War in Afghanistan===
{{Main|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}

====Invasion====
{{details|topic=the opening phase of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan|United States invasion of Afghanistan}}

In the immediate aftermath of the [[11 September attacks]], Navy SEALs quickly dispatched to [[Camp Doha]], and those already aboard US Naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters began conducting [[VBSS]] operations against ships suspected of having ties to or even carrying [[al Qaeda]] operatives. SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of [[Masirah Island|Masirah]] for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct [[special reconnaissance]] (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the [[75th Ranger Regiment|Army Rangers]] also staging on Masirah, the SEALs inserted into Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become [[Camp Rhino]], as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom#Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)|Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan]] (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Albert Calland]].

[[File:US Navy SEALs at Zhawar Kili cave entrance.jpg|thumb|Task Force K-Bar SEALs at one of the entrances to the [[Zhawar Kili]] cave complex]]
As part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General [[Tommy Franks]] at [[CENTCOM]] SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a [[Black operation|black]] SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of [[JSOC]]. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was of capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force teams (Task Force Red) and ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). [[Task Force K-Bar]] was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, [[3rd Special Forces Group (United States)|3rd SFG]]; the task force was led by SEAL Captain [[Robert Harward]].

The task force's principal task was to conduct SR and [[Site Exploitation|SSE]] missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly [[Kommando Spezialkräfte|KSK]], [[Joint Task Force 2|JTF2]] and [[New Zealand Special Air Service]] were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism) – intelligence integration and fusion activity manned by personnel from all Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan (OEF-A) participating units- SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of a Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from [[DEVGRU]] and supported by [[Intelligence Support Activity|ISA]]'s technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance – sending small 2 or 3-man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=25–31}}

SEALs were present at the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British [[Special Boat Service|SBS]]. Chief Petty Officer [[Stephen Bass]] was awarded the [[Navy Cross]] for his actions during the battle.

Before the US Marines landed at [[Camp Rhino]] in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from [[SEAL Team 8]] conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1W attack helicopters]], but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=44}} The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two [[United States Air Force Combat Control Team]]s made a nighttime [[HALO jump]] to assist the SEALs in guiding in [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] who seized control of the area and established a [[Forward operating base]].

In January 2002, following the [[Battle of Tora Bora]], another series of caves was discovered in [[Zhawar Kili]], just south of [[Tora Bora]]; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and [[JTF2]] reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=49–50 & 77}} Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]], [[Air Force Special Operations Command|United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams]], and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of [[Kandahar]] and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters, and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

In February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] passed on intelligence from a [[Predator drone]] operating in the [[Paktia]] province that [[Taliban]] Mullah [[Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa]] was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy. SEALs and Danish [[Jægerkorpset]] commandos boarded Air Force [[Pave Low]] helicopters and seized Khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=78}} The SEALs continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the Marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground.

In March 2002, SEALs from DEVGRU, SEAL Team 2, 3 and 8 participated extensively in [[Operation Anaconda]]. During what would become known as the [[Battle of Takur Ghar]], whilst inserting from an MH-47E Chinook, PO1 [[Neil C. Roberts|Neil Roberts]] from DEVGRU,{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=54–69}} was thrown from his helicopter when it took fire from entrenched al Qaeda fighters. Roberts was subsequently killed after engaging and fighting dozens of enemies for almost an hour. Several SEALs were wounded in a rescue attempt and their Air Force Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant [[John A. Chapman|John Chapman]], was killed. Attempts to rescue the stranded SEAL also led to the deaths of several US Army Rangers and an [[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force Pararescueman]] acting as a Quick Reaction Force.

Later in 2002, CJSOFT became a single integrated command under the broader [[Combined Joint Task Force 180|CJTF-180]] that commanded all US forces assigned to OEF-A, it was built around an Army Special Forces Group (often manned by National Guard units) and SEAL teams. A small JSOC element (formerly Task Force Sword/11) not under direct CTJF command – embedded within CJSOFT, it was manned by a joint SEAL and Ranger element that rotated command, it was not under direct ISAF command, although it operated in support of NATO operations.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=83}}

In June 2005, Lieutenant [[Michael P. Murphy]] was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after his four-man reconnaissance counterinsurgency team was almost wiped out during [[Operation Red Wings]]. After the four-man team lost [[Danny Dietz]], he put himself in open view to call in the QRF. He soon after died from injuries sustained. Matthew Axelson also died on this operation. The QRF never reached the scene; it was struck by an RPG killing eight Navy SEALs and eight [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Army Night Stalkers]]. [[Marcus Luttrell]] was the only survivor from this operation.

In early 2010, Brigadier General [[Austin S. Miller|Scott Miller]] took command of CJSOTF-Afghanistan and assigned virtually all SOF in the theatre to a new counterinsurgency role that would become known as the ALP/VSO Program (Afghan Local Police/Village Stability Operations), the SOF in Afghanistan were organised into battalion level SOTF (Special Operations Task Forces) each with a geographic area of responsibility-the SEALs were given southeast Afghanistan. To increase security of their assigned VSO village, a SEAL Platoon in [[Chora District]], [[Urozgan Province|Uruzgan Province]] built a wall constructed of {{convert|500|m|yd}} of [[Hesco bastion|HESCO barriers]] to divert insurgent movements away, this proved successful and eventually the Afghan villagers took ownership of it. SEALs and other SOTF still conducted Direct Action missions, but now partnered with Afghan forces.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=161–162}}

On 6 August 2011, seventeen U.S. Navy SEALs were killed when their [[CH-47 Chinook]] helicopter [[2011 Chinook shootdown in Afghanistan|was shot down]] by an [[Rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] fired by [[Taliban]] militants.

===Iraq War===
{{Main|Iraq War}}

====Invasion====
[[File:AlBasrahMESD823.png|upright=1.2|thumb|US military security personnel on the [[Al Basrah Oil Terminal]] after its capture]]
For the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], a squadron from [[DEVGRU]] operated as part of Task Force 20. Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish [[GROM]], [[Royal Marines]] from [[40 Commando|40]] and [[42 Commando]] under the command of [[3 Commando Brigade]] and attached [[United States Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command|US Psy Ops and civil affairs]] teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of [[Umm Qasr]], Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the [[Al-Faw Peninsula]]; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and [[20th Special Operations Squadron]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=96}}

Several days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from [[Mark V Special Operations Craft]] in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographic reconnaissance]] of the [[KAAOT|Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals]]. After swimming under the terminals and securing their [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle|Mark 8 mod 1s]], the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}} On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|Navy EOD]] a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=123}}

The shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were [[Battle of Al Faw (2003)|seized by]] 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs dropped from [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52s]] on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines, and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 Spectres]] fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10As]] engaged a nearby [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] installation and a responding Iraqi mechanised unit. The SEALs secured the facility itself whilst the Royal Marines cleared Iraqi bunkers, killing several Iraqi soldiers.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=123–126}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=149, 153 & 158–162}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}

Other Naval Task Group operations included elements of three SEAL platoons in GMV trucks and DPVs seizing the al Zubayr MMS, whilst [[I Marine Expeditionary Force|I MEF]] attacked the Rumaylah Oil Fields north of al-Faw. SEALs and [[Special warfare combatant-craft crewmen|Special Boat teams]] helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, that was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.{{sfnp|Cawthorne|2008}}{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=126–127}}

Coalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53J Pave Lows]]; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counter-attack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM [[soldier]] who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for five days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=127}}{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|p=161}}<ref>{{cite book |title=No Easy Day: The Autobiography of a Navy Seal: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden |first=Mark |last=Owen |year=2012 |location=New York |publisher=Dutton Books |page=[https://archive.org/details/noeasyday00mark/page/49 49] |isbn=978-0-52595-372-2 }}</ref>

During the [[Battle of Basra (2003)|Battle of Basra]], SEALs along with the [[Brigade Patrol Troop|Brigade Reconnaissance Force]] and [[539 Assault Squadron RM]] attempted a waterborne approach to [[Basra]] via the Shatt al-Arab waterway but were intercepted by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] patrol craft and did not want to engage them so they withdrew. On 6 April 2003, after relocating further up the waterway they successfully infiltrated via the waterway, using SEAL UAVs they called in "show-of-force" and an airstrike by a USMC harrier on Iraqi troops, the SEALs then headed to "[[Ali Hassan al-Majid|Chemical Ali]]'s" house with SSE teams to find traces of chemical weapons.{{sfnp|Rossiter|2009|pp=325–328}} SEALs carried out missions around [[Nasiriyah]], carrying out reconnaissance on surrounding villages and engaging enemy strong points bypassed by the US Marine advance. Charlie Platoon, SEAL Team 3, later operated ahead of the Marine advance carrying out similar missions.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}} SEAL and GROM units continued to cooperate throughout the rest of the invasion phase, with raids and anti-sniper missions in [[Baghdad]].{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=126}}

====Post-invasion Iraq====
[[File:SEAL Michael A. Monsoor.jpg|left|thumb|Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]], 2nd Navy SEAL killed in Iraq. This photo was taken during an extraction after a firefight, and the smoke was used to conceal their movements from the enemy.]]

Following the invasion, SEAL platoons rotated through [[Iraq]], conducting overwatch for US and Iraqi patrols and directly mentoring local Iraqi forces; they also conducted surveillance and sniping missions into known trouble spots. In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking [[Haifa Street]], they were inserted by [[M2 Bradley|Bradley IFVs]] from a unit of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties and the SEALs were extracted.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=178–179}}

In the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], insurgents in [[Fallujah]] knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, [[berm]]s, strategically placed [[car bomb]]s and [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infra-red chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th SFG]], [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Marine Force Recon]] and [[MCSOCOM Detachment One|Det One]] and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to 7 November [[D-Day (military term)|D-DAY]] when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=175–178}}

From 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|AQI]] terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to [[Ramadi]]. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at [[Al Asad Airbase]] and sent elements to Ramadi and [[Habbaniyah]], the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although [[Foreign internal defense|FID]] was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a [[junior officer]], three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to [[Dick Couch]], the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=179–180}} The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimised for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://corpidelite.net/afm/2017/05/a-navy-seal-loadout-in-ramadi/ |title=A Navy SEAL loadout in Ramadi |website=Corpi d'élite.net |language=en-US |access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>

As the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local [[Sheikh]]s and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a [[Sharia]]-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the [[Battle of Ramadi (2006)|Second Battle of Ramadi]] SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the [[1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division]] which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer [[Michael A. Monsoor]] died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the [[Anbar Awakening]]) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=180–182}}

In Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=182}}

In September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured [[Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi]] (nicknamed the "Butcher of Fallujah"), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the [[2004 Fallujah ambush]]. Al-Isawai made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing [[court-martial|courts-martial]] against three SEALs (all of whom were acquitted).<ref name=RobinsonBook>{{cite book |title=Honor and Betrayal: The Untold Story of the Navy Seals Who Captured the "Butcher of Fallujah"—and the Shameful Ordeal They Later Endured |isbn=978-0-30682-309-1 |year=2013 |last=Robinson |first=Patrick |author-link=Patrick Robinson (author) |publisher=[[Perseus Book Group]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUQPAAAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL not guilty of charges in Iraq |publisher=CNN|date=22 April 2010 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/04/22/navy.seal.verdict/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Navy SEAL Found Not Guilty of Assaulting a Suspected Terrorist |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/06/navy-seal-guilty-assaulting-suspected-terrorist.html|first=Steve |last=Centanni}}</ref> Iraqi authorities later tried and executed al-Isawi by [[hanging]] at some point before November 2013.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Persecuting Our Heroes |first=Ray V. |last=Hartwell |magazine=[[The American Spectator]] |date=26 November 2013|url=https://spectator.org/56777_persecuting-our-heroes/}}</ref>

SEALS remained employed throughout the Iraqi Campaign as Task Units or Task Elements until its close in 2011.

===Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines===
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom – Philippines}}

OEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct long-term partnered operations with both Philippine Army special operations and intelligence units, as well as police units to counter the threat posed by the [[Abu Sayyaf|ASG]] and [[Jemaah Islamiyah|JI]] terrorist groups. Much of this work has been assigned to 1st SFG; SEALs and [[Air Force Special Operations Command|USAF Special Operations]] who have also had a long-term presence in the Philippines. There are few confirmed operational details about the SEALs and Green Berets conducting partnered operations, although elements are partnered with Philippine Army and SOF; there have been mentions of Green Berets and SEALs being wounded. On 21 June 2002, SEALs in [[Rigid-hulled inflatable boat|RIB]]s supported the [[Naval Special Operations Group|Philippine Naval Special Operations Group]] in the operation that killed [[Abu Sabaya]], a senior leader in the ASG. A US Predator UAV marked the HVT with an infrared laser as he tried to escape in a smugglers boat, the MH-47Es from the 160th SOAR used search lights mounted on their helicopters to pinpoint the target's boat while operators from the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group opened fire on the boat killing the terrorist leader and capturing four other terrorists with him.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=184–185}}

Before [[Djibouti]] became the epicentre for counter terrorism operations in Africa, unilateral operations were launched from temporary forward locations in friendly nations such as Kenya, or from US Navy Ships. The earliest known operation in Somalia was known as Operation Cobalt Blue: In 2003, SEALs using [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle]]s swam ashore along the Somali coastline and emplaced covert surveillance cameras. Known as cardinals, the cameras were designed to watch likely target locations for wanted terrorists as al-Qaeda and its affiliates began to regroup in the country, however the cameras only took one image a day and captured very little.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|pp=282–284}}

CJSOTF-HOA (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Horn of Africa) developed a rescue plan called Operation Mystic Talon, in case and CIA SAD or ISA operators were captured in the region, the plan required a SEAL platoon Air Force Special Operations assets that, if necessary, would fight their way into Somalia, recover the hostage and fight their way out, should a mission need to be launched before a dedicated JSOC task force could be deployed to the region.{{sfnp|Neville|2015|p=285}}

===Women===
{{broader|Women in the United States Navy}}
No woman has ever become a Navy SEAL.

Until December 2015, female sailors were barred from becoming Navy SEALs by naval regulation; however, this prohibition no longer exists. As early as August 2015, it was reported that the "Navy is planning to open its elite SEAL teams to women who can pass the grueling training regimen."<ref name="Navy Times">{{cite news |url=http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2015/08/18/women-seals-greenert-losey-buds/31943243/ |title=Navy SEALs set to open to women, top admiral says |last1=Larter |first1=David |last2=Myers |first2=Meghann |date=19 August 2015 |newspaper=Navy Times}}</ref> In that same month, Admiral Jon Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, said that "he and the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral [[Brian Losey]], believe that if women can pass the legendary six-month [[United States Navy SEAL selection and training#BUD/S|Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S)]] training, they should be allowed to serve."<ref name="Navy Times" /> On 3 December 2015, it was announced that there are now "no exceptions" to all military roles in the U.S., and women can become U.S. Navy SEALs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crockett |first=Emily |url=https://www.vox.com/2015/12/3/9844404/women-military-combat-no-exceptions |title="No exceptions": Women can now serve in all military combat roles |website=Vox |date=3 December 2015}}</ref>

===SEAL Teams===
The original SEAL Teams in the [[Vietnam War]] were separated between West Coast (Team One) and East Coast (Team Two) SEALs. Likewise current SEAL Teams are organized into two groups: Naval Special Warfare Group One (West Coast) and Naval Special Warfare Group Two (East Coast), both of which come under the command of [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|Naval Special Warfare Command]] at [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado|NAB Coronado]], California. As of 2006, there are eight confirmed Navy SEAL Teams. The current SEAL Team deployments include Teams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. The most recent active-duty teams are SEAL Team 7 and SEAL Team 10, which were formed in March and April 2002, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://duniakemilauemas.blogspot.com/2011/10/us-navy-seals.html |title=US Navy SEALs |website=Duniakemilauemas.blogspot.com |date=4 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=33851 |first=Tommy |last=Crosby |title=SEAL Team 7 Holds Change of Command |website=U.S. Navy |date=12 December 2007}}</ref> However, two [[United States Navy Reserve|reservist]] support teams were reorganized into SEAL teams in 2008.<ref name="Menzie"/><ref>https://www.facebook.com/NavalSpecialWarfare/posts/havent-heard-of-seal-team-18-they-are-one-of-our-two-incredible-reserve-teams-wh/179732352072953/{{Primary source inline|date=September 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Combat Rubber Raiding Craft manned by SEAL-Team 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|SEAL Team 5 conducts an exercise in a [[Combat Rubber Raiding Craft]] in 2000.]]

The Teams deploy as Naval Special Warfare Squadrons or Special Operations Task Forces and can deploy anywhere in the world. Squadrons will normally be deployed and fall under a Joint Task Force (JTF) or a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) as a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF).

Each SEAL Team (or "squadron") is commanded by a Navy [[Commander (United States)|commander]] (O-5), and has eight operational SEAL platoons and a headquarters element. Operationally, the "Team" is divided into two to four 40-man "task units" (or "troops"). Each task unit consists of a headquarters element consisting of a task unit commander, typically a [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]] (O-4), a task unit senior enlisted (E-8), a targeting/operations officer (O-2/3) and a targeting/operations leading/chief petty officer (E-6/7). Under the HQ element are two to four SEAL platoons of 16 men (two officers and 14 enlisted SEALs, and sometimes assigned non-NSW support personnel); a company-sized combat service support (CSS) and/or combat support (CS) consisting of [[Staff (military)|staff]] N-codes (the Army and Marine Corps use S-codes); N1 Administrative support, N2 Intelligence, N3 Operations, N4 Logistics, N5 Plans and Targeting, N6 Communications, N7 Training, and N8 Air/Medical.

Each 16-man platoon can be task organized for operational purposes into two eight-man squads, four four-man fire teams, or eight two-man sniper/reconnaissance teams. The size of each SEAL "Team", or "squadron", with two to four task units (containing a total of eight platoons) and support staff is approximately 300 personnel. The typical SEAL platoon has an OIC (officer in charge), usually a lieutenant (O-3), a platoon chief (E-7/E-8), and two squads commanded by a LTJG (O-2) and a squad leader (E-6). The remaining members of the squad are operators (E-4 to E-6) with their specialty skills in ordinance, communications, diving, and medical. The core leadership in the troop and platoon are the commander/OIC and the senior enlisted NCO (Senior Chief/chief).

Platoon core skills consist of: Sniper, Breacher, Communicator, Maritime/Engineering, Close Air Support, Corpsman, Point-man/Navigator, Primary Driver/Navigator (Rural/Urban/Protective Security), Heavy Weapons Operator, Sensitive Site Exploitation, Air Operations Master, Lead Climber, Lead Diver/Navigator, Interrogator, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical Surveillance, and Advanced Special Operations.

[[Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek]], a [[naval base]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], is home to SEAL Teams 2, 4, DEVGRU, 8, 10, and 18. [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]], a naval base in [[Coronado, California]], is home to SEAL Teams 1, 3, 5, 7, and 17. There are also two [[SEAL Delivery Vehicle]] (SDV) units, SDVT-1 and SDVT-2, located in [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] and [[Little Creek, Virginia]], respectively.<ref name=Faram>{{cite news |last1=Faram |first1=Mark D. |title=SEALs revive stealthy submarine delivery team in Virginia |url=https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/02/26/seals-revive-stealthy-submarine-delivery-team-in-virginia/|work=Navy Times |date=25 February 2019}}</ref> SDV Teams are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability.

The primary mission of the Navy Parachute Team (NPT) is to support Naval Special Warfare recruiting by gaining access and exposure to appropriate candidates through aerial parachuting demonstrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leapfrogs.navy.mil/pdf/npt_handbook.pdf |title=Navy Parachute Team handbook |website=U.S. Navy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722202628/http://www.leapfrogs.navy.mil/pdf/npt_handbook.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> The U.S. Navy Parachute Team is a fifteen-man team composed of U.S. Navy SEALs. Each member comes to the team for a three-year tour from one of the two Naval Special Warfare Groups located on the east and west coasts. On completion of the tour, members return to operational units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leapfrogs.navy.mil/default.asp |title=Leap Frogs |website=Official U.S. Navy Parachute Team Web Site |accessdate=1 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005010855/http://www.leapfrogs.navy.mil/default.asp |archive-date=5 October 2011}}</ref> The parachute team began in 1969 when Navy SEALs and Frogmen volunteered to perform at weekend air shows. The Team initially consisted of five jumpers: [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|LCDR]] Olson, [[Mass communication specialist|PHC]] Gagliardi, [[Storekeeper|SK2]] "Herky" Hertenstein, [[Parachute rigger#U.S. Navy and Marine Corps|PR1]] Al Schmiz and [[Mass communication specialist|PH2]] "Chip" Maury. Schmiz and Maury were members of the original "Chuting Stars."<ref name="leap-frogs">{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-histor-the-leap-frogs-origins-of-the-navy-seal-parachuting-exhibition-team/ |title=SEAL History: The Leap Frogs-Origins of the Navy SEAL Parachuting Exhibition Team |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200551/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-navy-seals/seal-history-the-naval-special-warfare-story/seal-histor-the-leap-frogs-origins-of-the-navy-seal-parachuting-exhibition-team/ |archive-date=29 October 2013}}</ref> When LCDR Olson was transferred to California, PHC Gene "Gag" Gagliardi (D 546) of UDT Eleven introduced him to the local jumping elite with the San Diego Skydivers, one of the nation's first sports parachuting clubs. He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a "not to interfere" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the "Leap Frogs" name.<ref name="leap-frogs"/>

The team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based "Chuting Stars" were disbanded in the 1980s with the "Leap Frogs" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.

A typical Leap Frogs performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.

==Influence on foreign units==

From its predecessors, the [[Underwater Demolition Teams]], to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units. In 1955, the Underwater Demolition Teams provided funding and training for the [[Republic of Korea Naval Special Warfare Flotilla]], who are also known as UDT/SEALs. This was followed in 1956 by providing funding, training and formation of the [[Naval Special Operations Command|Philippine Navy Underwater Operations Team (UOT)]], patterned on the training and implementation of the US Navy SEALs and the UDTs. In 1966, United States Navy SEALs established Pakistan's [[Special Service Group (Navy)]] based on a mutual security understanding and the training provided under the [[International Military Education and Training|IMET program]] until the 1970s.<ref name="Naval Inter-Services Public Relations (Navy ISPR)">{{cite web|url=http://www.paknavy.gov.pk/ssg_marines.htm|title=Special Service Group (Navy)|last=Government of Pakistan|first=Navy Press Release|work=The Directorate-General for the Naval Inter-Services Public Relations (Navy ISPR)|publisher=Naval Inter-Services Public Relations (Navy ISPR)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419131629/http://www.paknavy.gov.pk/ssg_marines.htm|archive-date=19 April 2012|accessdate=19 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> US Navy SEALs provided initial training to the Indian Marine Special Force, which later became known as the [[MARCOS]].<ref name=sp.com>{{cite web|title=MARINE COMMANDO FORCE|url=http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/India/MCF.htm|publisher=Specialoperations.com|accessdate=15 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705041432/http://www.specialoperations.com/Foreign/India/MCF.htm|archive-date=5 July 2012}}</ref>

Due to their reputation as being one of America's premier special operations forces, SEALs (particularly operators from [[United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group|DEVGRU]]) will often do exchanges with allied SOFs.{{sfnp|Kyle|2013}}{{sfnp|Couch|2008|p=54}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Falconer |first=Duncan |title=First into Action: A Dramatic Personal Account of Life in the SBS |date=1 July 2001 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |location=London |isbn=978-0-75153-165-7}}</ref>

==National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum and memorial==
{{main|National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum}}
The [[National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum]], in [[Fort Pierce, Florida]], was founded in 1985<ref>{{cite web |url=https://navysealmuseum.com/about-the-navy-sealmuseum/the-origin-of-the-udt-seal-museum/ |title=The Origin of the UDT-SEAL Museum |website=National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum |accessdate=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310081622/https://navysealmuseum.com/about-the-navy-sealmuseum/the-origin-of-the-udt-seal-museum/ |archive-date=10 March 2014}}</ref> and was recognized as a National Museum by an act of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyseals.com/ft-pierce-museum-now-official-national-museum-navy-seals-and-their-predecessors |title=Ft.

The SEAL Museum stands on the training site of the first Navy frogmen. There through World War II, thousands of service members were trained as members of [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] and [[Underwater Demolition Teams]]. The Museum houses rare historic artifacts from the founding of the UDT to present day, including weapons, vehicles, equipment, and most recently added, the {{ship|MV|Maersk Alabama||2}} lifeboat aboard which [[Piracy in Somalia|Somali pirates]] held Captain Richard Phillips hostage.
