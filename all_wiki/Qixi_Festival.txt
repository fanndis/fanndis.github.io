The '''Qixi Festival''', also known as the '''Qiqiao Festival''', is a [[Chinese festival]] celebrating the annual meeting of [[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl|the cowherd and weaver girl]] in [[Chinese mythology|mythology]].<ref name="zhao15-13">{{Harvnb|Zhao|2015|loc=13}}.</ref><ref name=brown06-72>{{Harvnb|Brown|Brown|2006|loc=72}}.</ref><ref name=poon11-100/><ref name=melbau10-912-3/> The festival is celebrated on the 7th day of the 7th lunisolar month on the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref name="zhao15-13"/><ref name=brown06-72/><ref name=poon11-100>{{Harvnb|Poon|2011|loc=100}}.</ref><ref name=melbau10-912-3>{{Harvnb|Melton|Baumann|2010|loc=912–913}}.</ref>

The festival originated from the romantic legend of two lovers, Zhinü and Niulang,<ref name=brown06-72/><ref name=melbau10-912-3/> who were the weaver girl and the cowherd, respectively. The tale of ''[[The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl]]'' has been celebrated in the Qixi Festival since the [[Han dynasty]].<ref name=schomp09-70>{{Harvnb|Schomp|2009|loc=70}}.</ref> The earliest-known reference to this famous myth dates back to over 2600 years ago, which was told in a poem from the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]''.<ref name=schomp09-89>{{Harvnb|Schomp|2009|loc=89}}.</ref> The Qixi festival inspired the [[Tanabata]] festival in [[Japan]], [[Chilseok]] festival in [[Korea]], and [[:vi:Thất Tịch|Thất Tịch]] festival in [[Vietnam]].

The festival has variously been called the ''Double Seventh Festival'',<ref name=melbau10-912-3/> the ''Chinese Valentine's Day'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Welch|2008|loc=228}}.</ref> the ''Night of Sevens'',<ref name=brown06-72/><ref>Chester Beatty Library, [http://www.cbl.ie/china/Item.aspx?itemId=6 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022035250/http://www.cbl.ie/china/Item.aspx?itemId=6 |date=2014-10-22 }}.</ref> or the ''[[Magpie]] Festival''.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

== Mythology ==
{{See also|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}

The general tale is a love story between Zhinü (the weaver girl, symbolizing [[Vega]]) and Niulang (the cowherd, symbolizing [[Altair]]).<ref name=brown06-72/> Their love was not allowed, thus they were banished to opposite sides of the Silver River (symbolizing the Milky Way).<ref name=brown06-72/><ref>{{Harvnb|Lai|1999|loc=191}}.</ref> Once a year, on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, a flock of magpies would form a bridge to reunite the lovers for one day.<ref name=brown06-72/> There are many variations of the story.<ref name=brown06-72/>

== Traditions ==
During the Han dynasty, the practices were conducted in accordance to formal ceremonial state rituals.<ref name="zhao15-13"/> Over time, the festival activities also included customs that the common people partook.<ref name="zhao15-13"/>

Girls take part in worshiping the celestials ({{lang|zh|拜仙}}) during rituals.<ref name=poon11-100/> They go to the local temple to pray to Zhinü for wisdom.<ref name=melbau10-912-3/> Paper items are usually burned as offerings.<ref name=steph91-83/> Girls may recite traditional prayers for dexterity in needlework,<ref name=melbau10-912-3/><ref>{{Harvnb|Kiang|1999|loc=132}}.</ref> which symbolize the traditional talents of a good spouse.<ref name=melbau10-912-3/> Divination could take place to determine possible dexterity in needlework.<ref name=steph91-83>{{Harvnb|Stepanchuk|Wong|1991|loc=83}}</ref> They make wishes for marrying someone who would be a good and loving husband.<ref name=brown06-72/> During the festival, girls make a display of their domestic skills.<ref name=brown06-72/> Traditionally, there would be contests amongst those who attempted to be the best in threading needles under low-light conditions like the glow of an ember or a half moon.<ref name=steph91-83/> Today, girls sometimes gather toiletries in honor of the seven maidens.<ref name=steph91-83/>

The festival also held an importance for newlywed couples.<ref name=poon11-100/> Traditionally, they would worship the celestial couple for the last time and bid farewell to them ({{lang|zh|辭仙}}).<ref name=poon11-100/> The celebration stood symbol for a happy marriage and showed that the married woman was treasured by her new family.<ref name=poon11-100/>

On this day, the Chinese gaze to the sky to look for [[Vega]] and [[Altair]] shining in the Milky Way, while a [[Summer Triangle|third star forms a symbolic bridge]] between the two stars.<ref name=schomp09-70/> It was said that if it rains on this day that it was caused by a river sweeping away the magpie bridge or that the rain is the tears of the separated couple.<ref name=steph91-82>{{Harvnb|Stepanchuk|Wong|1991|loc=82}}</ref> Based on the legend of a flock of magpies forming a bridge to reunite the couple, a pair of magpies came to symbolize conjugal happiness and faithfulness.<ref>{{Harvnb|Welch|2008|loc=77}}.</ref>

In some places people gather together and build a four meter long bridge(花桥) with big incensticks and decorate with colorful flowers. They burn the bridge at night and wish to bring happiness in life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020|reason=personal contact from Guangzhou has never heard of this tradition}}

== Literature ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2020}}
Due to the romance, elegancy as well as the beautiful symbolic meaning of the festival, there has been a lot of literature pieces, such as poems, popular songs and operas, since the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou Dynasty]] from 11th century BC, which described the atmosphere of the festival or narrated the stories happened on that day, leaving us valuable literary treasure to understand better how the ancient Chinese spent their time on the festival and what exactly was their opinion towards it.

=== 迢迢牽牛星–佚名（東漢）  Far, Far Away, the Cowherd – Anonymous（[[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]]） ===
<blockquote><poem>
迢迢牽牛星，                          Far, far away, the Cowherd,
皎皎河漢女。                          Fair, fair, the Weaving Maid,
纖纖擢素手，                          Nimbly move her slender white finger,
札札弄機杼。                          Click-clack goes her weaving-loom.
終日不成章，                          All day she weaves, yet her web is still not done.
泣涕零如雨。                          And her tears fall like rain.
河漢清且淺，                          Clear and shallow the Milky Way,
相去復幾許？                          They are not far apart!
盈盈–水間，                          But the stream brims always between.
脈脈不得語。                          And, gazing at each other, they cannot speak.

===秋夕–[[Du Mu|杜牧]]（唐朝）  An Autumn Night – [[Du Mu]] ([[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]])===
<blockquote><poem>
銀燭秋光冷畫屏，          A candle flame flickers against a dull painted screen on a cool autumn night,
輕羅小扇撲流螢。          She holds a small silk fan to flap away dashing fireflies.
天階夜色涼如水，          Above her hang celestial bodies as frigid as deep water,
坐看牽牛織女星。          She sat there watching Altair of Aquila and Vega of Lyra pining for each other in the sky.

=== 鵲橋仙–[[Qin Guan|秦觀]]（宋朝）  Immortals at the Magpie Bridge – [[Qin Guan]] ([[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]]) ===
<blockquote><poem>
纖雲弄巧，                      Clouds float like works of art,
飛星傳恨，                      Stars shoot with grief at heart.
銀漢迢迢暗渡。                Across the Milky Way the Cowherd meets the Maid.
金風玉露一相逢，             When Autumn’s Golden Wind embraces Dew of Jade,
便勝却人間無數。             All the love scenes on earth, however many, fade.
柔情似水，                      Their tender love flows like a stream;
佳期如夢，                      Their happy date seems but a dream.
忍顧鶴橋歸路。                How can they bear a separate homeward way?
兩情若是久長時，             If love between both sides can last for aye,
又豈在朝朝暮暮。             Why need they stay together night and day?

（翻譯：[[Xu Yuanchong|許淵沖]]）             (Translated by [[Xu Yuanchong]])
