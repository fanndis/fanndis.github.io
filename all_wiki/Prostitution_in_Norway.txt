'''Prostitution in Norway''' is illegal and a criminal act when sexual acts are purchased, but not when sold.<ref name=snl/> The [[Norway|Norwegian]] law prohibiting the buying of sexual acts came into effect on 1 January 2009, following the passing of new legislation by the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]] in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7806760.stm |title=New Norway law bans buying of sex.

== History ==

=== Early era ===
In early times, [[proscription]] of prostitution fell under more general laws on [[fornication]] and [[adultery]], particularly after the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]]. Around this time, sexual acts started to be moved from [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (largely with [[Fine (penalty)|fines]]) to [[criminal law]]. For instance, in one part of [[Mediaeval]] law, the [[Frostathing Law]], it is stated, "If a woman lies with a man whom she is not allowed to possess, she owes a fine of three marks, just as he does with whom she lies". Regulation of sexuality in the [[High Middle Ages]] was largely a function of the Church, for whom only [[heterosexual]] sexual relations within [[marriage]] were acceptable. Despite this, prostitution was not considered amongst the most serious sexual crimes, but was frequently associated with other nuisances such as gambling, drinking, and causing a disturbance.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg| 250 px|thumb|right|[[Albertine i politilægens venteværelse|Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room]], by [[Christian Krohg]], 1886-1887<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harriet.nasjonalmuseet.no/ukenskunstverk/index.php?showimage=19|title=Ukens kunstverk -|website=harriet.nasjonalmuseet.no}}</ref>]]
Prostitution was criminalised in Norway with the introduction of the new [[Norwegian Code|Criminal Code]] (''Norske Lov'') in 1842, but was made legal again when the Penal Code (''Straffeloven'') was revised in 1902,<ref name=sflorey/> when the prohibition of both the sale and purchase of sex was lifted. However, even during that time, it was actually tolerated and regulated in practice, in the larger cities such as [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]], and [[Trondheim]]. While prostitution was defined as an immoral [[vice]], it was street prostitution that was especially frowned upon, being visible. It was also considered important to distinguish between "decent" and "indecent" women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/prostitution-old-oslo|title=Prostitution in old Oslo|date=26 July 2012}}</ref><ref>Schiøtz, A.

Pax, Oslo 1980 Pax.</ref> The regulation of prostitution in Europe (''Regulationism'') was closely tied to the concept that prostitution was a source of venereal disease, requiring medical supervision.<ref>Roger Davidson and Leslie Hall (eds), Sex, sin and suffering: venereal disease and European society since 1870, London and New York, Routledge, 2001, pp. 1-14.</ref><ref>Mary Spongberg, Feminizing venereal disease: the body of the prostitute in nineteenth-century medical discourse, Basingstoke, Macmillan, 1997</ref><ref>Aina Schiøtz, ‘Prostitusjon og prostituerte i 1880-åras Kristiania’, in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schiøtz (eds.), Det kriminelle kjønn: om barnefødsel i dølgsmål, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 35-39</ref><ref>Kari Melby, "Prostitusjon og kontroll", in Anne-Marit Gotaas, Brita Gulli, Kari Melby and Aina Schiøtz (eds.), Det kriminelle kjønn: om barnefødsel i dølgsmål, abort og prostitusjon, Oslo, Pax, 1980, pp. 83-85</ref> 
This form of regulation first appeared in Bergen, then the largest Norwegian municipality, in 1816, in (what is now known as) Oslo in 1840, and Trondheim in 1844. Regulation was at least on the surface contrary to the Penal Code which had made [[fornication]] and hence prostitution a criminal offence in 1842. In practice the latter law was considered only to apply to males.

The media, the church, and social commentators started to express concerns about prostitution which was labelled as ''The Great Social Evil''. Various institutions stated a desire to rescue 'fallen women', and help them exit their trade and 're-enter society', training them for positions such as domestic servants.<ref name=Beitnes/>

In the mid-nineteenth century, there was a growth of organised society, in which religious and philanthropic organisations developed, many of which had a predominance of women members. Amongst these were "societies for the defense of moral standards", concerned ''inter alia'' with prostitution and the government's failure to deal with it. (UNESCO 1989, p.&nbsp;13)

Brothels were eventually prohibited in Norway in 1887 as part of a pan-European moral reform campaign of ''Abolitionism'' that replaced Regulationism and was supposed to end prostitution.<ref name=Beitnes/> The change in the Penal Code in 1902 did not, however, mean that prostitution was more tolerated by society. The exchange of sex in one's own home was now legal, but [[loitering]] and [[procurement]] was not, and women seen selling sex in public were directed to "rehabilitation" programs.<ref name=mls12/>

=== Modern era ===
A Pan-[[Scandinavia]]n conference on prostitution was held in [[Lillehammer]] in 1993. Sex workers participated, and the emphasis was on [[harm reduction]]. [[Liv Jessen]] from Pro-Sentret compared this to the punitive approach of the radical "Women's Front" (''Kvinnefronten''), a feminist activist group.<ref>[http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/no.php International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126184352/http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/ccies/no.php |date=26 January 2013 }}</ref> The debate on what to do was to continue for another 30 years.<ref name=mls12/> ''Kvinnenfronten'' had been founded in 1972, and was to work for a change in the law over all of that time.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40647443|title=A glimpse into 30 years of struggle against prostitution by the women's liberation movement in Norway|first=Agnete|last=Strøm|date=10 April 2018|journal=Reproductive Health Matters|volume=17|issue=34|pages=29–37|doi=10.1016/S0968-8080(09)34467-5|pmid=19962635}}</ref>

== Legal framework==
The criminal Code deals with organised crime (Section 60a), third parties (''tredjeparts''), and procurers, such as [[pimps]]<ref name=HG257/> ([[:no:Hallik|''hallik'']], ''halliker'' (pl.))<ref name=snl/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snl.no/hallik|title=hallik|first1=May-Len|last1=Skilbrei|first2=John Christian|last2=Elden|date=10 July 2017|via=Store norske leksikon}}</ref> or [[madams]] (S 202), purchase of sexual "services" (S 202a), purchase under 18 (S 203), and human trafficking ([[:no:Menneskehandel|''menneskehandel'']])<ref name=snl/> (S 224).

===Norwegian General Civil Penal Code (''Straffeloven'')===

'''Section 60a'''<br /> 
"If a criminal act has been committed as part of the activity of an organised criminal group, the maximum penalty laid down in the penal provision shall be increased to double its prescribed limit, but not by more than five years' imprisonment.

An organised criminal group is here defined as an organised group of three or more persons whose main purpose is to commit an act that is punishable by imprisonment for a term of not less than three years, or whose activity largely consists of committing such acts. An increase of the maximum penalty pursuant to the present provision shall be applicable in relation to statutory provisions that give legal effect to the penalty limit, unless it is otherwise provided."
 
'''Section 202''' <br /> 
"Anyone who
a) promotes the engagement of other persons in prostitution, or
b) lets premises on the understanding that such premises shall be used for prostitution or is grossly negligent in this respect

shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

Any person who in a public announcement unambiguously offers, arranges or asks for prostitution shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.

In this provision, prostitution means that a person engages in sexual activity or commits a sexual act with another person in return for payment."

'''Section 202a''' <br /> 
"Any person who
a) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act, for himself/herself or for another person, in return for payment or agreement to provide payment,
b) procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act in return for another person paying or agreeing to pay, or
c) in the manner described in a) or b) above induces someone to carry out acts that are equivalent to sexual intercourse with himself/herself

shall be liable to a fine or up to 6 months' imprisonment or both.

If the sexual intercourse or act has been particularly humiliating in its nature, but it is not punishable under any other law, the punishment is imprisonment for a term of up to 1 year."

'''Section 203'''<br /> 
"Any person who, in return for payment, procures sexual intercourse or any other sexual act from a person under the age of 18, shall be liable to a fine or up to 2 years’ imprisonment. Being mistaken about someone's age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown."

'''Section 224'''<br /> 
"Any person who by force, threats, abuse of another person's vulnerability or other improper conduct exploits another person for the purpose of
a) prostitution or other sexual purposes,
b) forced labour or forced services, including begging,
c) military service in a foreign country, or
d) removal of any of the said person's organs,
or who induces another person to allow himself or herself to be used for such purposes, shall be guilty of human trafficking, and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

Any person who
a) makes arrangements for such exploitation or inducement as is mentioned in the first paragraph by procuring, transporting or receiving the person concerned,
b) in any other way aids and abets such exploitation or inducement, or
c) provides payment or any other advantage in order to obtain consent to such exploitation from any person who is in a position of authority over the aggrieved party, or who receives such payment or other advantage shall be liable to the same penalty.

Any person who commits an act referred to in the first or second paragraph against a person who is under the age of 18 shall be liable to a penalty independently of any use of force or threats, abuse of a person’s vulnerability, or other improper conduct. Being mistaken about someone’s age does not affect criminal liability, unless diligent good faith has been shown.

Gross human trafficking is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. In deciding whether the offence is gross, particular importance shall be attached to whether the person exposed to the act was under the age of 18, whether gross violence or coercion was used or whether the act led to considerable gain."

=== Other acts ===
'''The Planning and Building Act'''<br />
Specifies requirements for premises where commercial activities take place, used to close massage parlours occupying premises that do not meet the requirements for commercial activities.

'''Tax and VAT'''<br />
All income is taxable, including income from prostitution, but implementation varies. Some people have been made to pay tax on their estimated earnings from prostitution, while some have registered as self-employed, to benefit from the rights that taxpayers have. Most services are liable to VAT.<ref name=sflorey/><ref name=taxing/><ref name=tax/>

'''Welfare''' <br />
Prostitution is not considered legal work in Norway. Those entitled to social welfare benefits may claim economical support from [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|NAV]] when not employed and indigent.

'''Immigration Act''' <br />
It is for foreigners to work as prostitutes in Norway, because prostitution is not considered legal work. ''Section 27'' states that foreigners can be deported for breaches of the peace.

'''Police Act'''<br />
''Section 7'' (Public order and peace) allows the police to stop breaches of the peace or intervene when there is reason to fear such a breach.

'''Child Welfare Act'''<br />
Protects and gives rights to children under the age of 18. If a child is in the company of sex workers, this may lead to intervention under the act. All government employees have a duty to report to the child welfare authorities if they see a child who may be suffering from neglect.

'''Communicable Diseases Control Act'''<br />
Entitles residents to preventive care, diagnosis and treatment for such diseases. It does not allow collective restrictions to be imposed on sex workers.

== Prostitution in Norway today ==
In 2013, it was estimated there were 3,000 sex workers (''prostituert'', ''prostituerte'' (pl.))<ref name=pk/> working in Norway<ref name=taxing/> ([[Demographics of Norway|population]] 5 million).<ref>[http://www.ssb.no/a/english/kortnavn/folkendrkv_en/2012k4/hittil00-en.html Population per 1 January 2013 and population changes in 2012. Counties] SSB, retrieved 14 September 2013</ref> Earnings from sex trade are estimated at 390 million [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] (£39m., $US63m., €48m.).<ref name=taxing/>

Norwegian prostitutes make a clear distinction between the term "prostitute" and "sex worker", seeing "prostitution" as a derogatory word (''nedlatende ord''). They also describe themselves as ''gledespike'' (literally, ''fille de joie''), or ''hjelpepleier'' (health worker).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ba.no/nyheter/article6924505.ece|title=Lever dobbeltliv som mor og sexarbeider|date=16 October 2013}}</ref> As in most countries, prostitution takes on a number of different forms, including [[street prostitution]] (''Gateprostitusjon'') and indoor prostitution in [[brothels]] (''[[:no:bordell|bordell]]'', ''bordeller'' (pl.)).<ref name=snl/> Technically, both street work and brothel operations (''bordellvirksomhet'')<ref name=snl/> are legal, even though purchase of those "services" is not, but as with other countries, technological change has resulted in a shift to offering "services" from [[street solicitation]] to [[mobile phones]] and the [[internet]].<ref name=snl/> While brothels are technically legal in that there is no explicit law banning then (''de jure''), the sex purchase ban prevents them operating overtly (''de facto''). As a form of protest, it was suggested that some sex workers might operate free brothels that circumvent the ban, to make this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article12190064.ab|title=Gratis bordeller öppnas i Norge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/2839300.html|title=Vil åpne gratis "bordell"|first=Magnus|last=Blaker|date=22 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theantifeminist.com/norwegian-sex-activisit-on-eivind-berge/|title=Norwegian Sex Activist on Eivind Berge : 'The Law on Paying for Sex Leads to Angry Young Men' The Antifeminist, 16 July 2012}}</ref> Later, it was stated that this was an exercise designed primarily to stimulate debate on the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/3436342.html|title=- Sexkjøpsloven fører til sinte, unge menn|first=Nina|last=Bjordal|date=16 July 2012}}</ref>

The current law banning purchase creates an administrative anomaly, since any money earned is illegal, yet is taxable.<ref name=sflorey/><ref name=taxing/><ref name=tax/> Recent legislative proposals have included a ban on advertising. Some sex workers have complained about the lack of government consultation with them.<ref name=taxing/> In July 2014, the Nadheim City Mission has reported that street prostitution levels in Norway have returned to those prior to the introduction of the law in 2009.<ref name=DV21714/>

== Sex purchase ban ==

=== First consideration ===
The possibility of criminalising the purchase of sex was discussed in an official report in 1997;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/nouer/1997/nou-1997-23.html?id=141115 |title=NOU 1997: 23. Seksuallovbrudd. Justisdepartmentet 1997 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= 16 July 1997|accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref>
however, neither the [[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Justice Department]] (''Justis- og politidepartementet'') nor the [[Storting]] (Parliament) were in favour of taking this step. The Department did, however, promise to re-look at the situation in two years.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/otprp/19992000/otprp-nr-28-1999-2000-.html?id=160376|title=Ot.prp. nr. 28 (1999-2000)|first=Justis- og|last=politidepartementet|date=28 January 2000|website=Regjeringen.no}}</ref>
Norway then criminalised the purchase of sex from people under the age of 18 in 2000 (Law 76, 11 August; Penal Code art. §203). 
<ref>Straffeloven § 203.</ref>
<ref name=just04/>

=== Working group report 2004 ===
Although [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]] had banned the purchase of sex in 1999, opinions remained divided in Norway. In 2003, as part of its ''Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Women and Children''
,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/rapporter_planer/rapporter/2004/statusrapport---regjeringens-handlingspl.html?id=457572 |title=Regjeringen handlingsplan mot handel med kvinner og barn 2003-2005. Justis- og politidepartementet, Oslo, 12 Feb 2003 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date= 3 September 2004|accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref>
the Justice Ministry investigated the situation in both the [[Prostitution in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] (which had recently legalised [[brothels]]) and Sweden to better inform the debate, and concluded that neither approach would be appropriate at that point.

The working group for this report was chaired by Professor [[Ulf Stridbeck]], of [[Oslo University]]'s [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|law school]].

With regard's to Sweden's law, the group found that reliable data was unavailable, the law was difficult to enforce, and had had little impact (p.&nbsp;23).
<ref name=just04/>
The difference between the two countries they saw was the different way they defined prostitution, and hence approached it (p.&nbsp;45). They were particularly concerned about the unintended effects of the Swedish approach (p.&nbsp;52).

=== Changing policy due to immigration ===
The debate which finally led to the introduction of the sex purchase ban concerned the effects of the arrival of women from [[Africa]], typically [[Nigerian]], on the streets of Norway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/12/15/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjop/sexkjoploven/prostitusjon/19418698/|title=Prostitusjon på nettet har trolig økt etter sexkjøploven|language=no|date=15 December 2011|work=[[Dagbladet]]}}</ref>

It was argued that human trafficking was fuelled by a demand for sex and that therefore a ban was necessary, and whether [[solicitation]] was offensive.

=== Current law (''Sexkjøpsloven'') ===
In November 2008, the Storting passed legislation which criminalised purchasing sex (''sexkjøploven''). This became Section 202a of the Norwegian [[Penal Code]].
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/whats-new/News/2008/criminanlizing-the-purchase-of-sexual-ac.html?id=537854 |title=Criminalizing the purchase of sexual activity. Ministry of Justice, 1 December 2008 |publisher=Regjeringen.no |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref>

<blockquote>'''Section 202a'''

''Any person who''

    ''(a) engages in or aids and abets another person to engage in sexual activity or commit a sexual act on making or agreeing payment'',<br />
    ''(b) engages in sexual activity or a sexual act on such payment being agreed or made by another person, or'' <br />
    ''(c) in the manner described in (a) or (b) causes someone to carry out with herself or himself acts corresponding to sexual activity'',

''shall be liable to fines or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.''

''If the sexual activity or sexual act is carried out in a particularly offensive manner and no penalty may be imposed pursuant to other provisions, the penalty shall be imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year''</blockquote>

The ban extends to Norwegians outside of Norway ([[Extra-territorial|extra territorial]] law).

=== Effect of sex purchase ban ===
Despite an initial drop in the visibility of street prostitution,

In 2013, prior to the elections, the Justice Ministry announced plans to evaluate the law, with applications to contract closing at the end of August, being awarded to Vista Analyse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vista-analyse.no/|title=Forsiden|website=www.vista-analyse.no}}</ref> However, researchers have criticised this because neither the budget nor the scope seem likely to provide useful answers.<ref>[http://fafo.no/prostitution/131001-Lackofwill.pdf Anette Brunovskis and May-Len Skilbrei.

==== Findings ====

It stated that the law had met its mandate, and that the street market had been reduced, and probably also the indoor market, but that this was more difficult to estimate:

<blockquote>'''Main findings'''.<br />
''The ban on purchasing sexual services has reduced demand for sex and thus contribute to reduce the extent of prostitution in Norway. The enforcement of the law, in combination with the laws against trafficking and pimping, makes Norway a less attractive country for prostitution based trafficking than what would have been the case if the law had not been adopted. Furthermore, the economic conditions for prostitution in Norway are reduced following the implementation of the law. These effects are in line with the intentions of the law and are thus not considered as unintended side effects. This report does not find any evidence of more violence against prostitutes after the ban on buying sex entered into force''.</blockquote>

==== Response ====
Critics argued that while one could show trends in prostitution, it was simplistic to argue that they were a direct result of regulatory change, given the complex social phenomenon and the many forces acting on it. [[Vidar Brein-Karlsen]] (FrP), the Justice Secretary, has promised a thorough parliamentary inquiry (''stortingsmelding'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjoepsloven/ny-rapport-prostitusjonen-i-norge-redusert-etter-sexkjoepsloven/a/23271620/|title=Ny rapport: Prostitusjonen i Norge redusert etter sexkjøpsloven}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjoepsloven/hege-grostad-tror-det-er-store-moerketall/a/23271841/|title=Hege Grostad: Tror det er store mørketall}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-sexkjopsevaluering-_for-spinkel_-1.11869647|title=– Sexkjøpsevaluering "for spinkel"|last=NRK|date=10 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/norge/_-nei_-loven-er-ingen-suksess-1.11875910-|title=– Nei, loven er ingen suksess|last=NRK|date=12 August 2014}}</ref> The conclusions conflict with other studies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/ostlandssendingen/ingen-har-oversikt-over-sexsalg-1.11678026|title=Ingen har oversikt over sexsalg|last=NRK|date=11 June 2014}}</ref> and the definition of "success" has been a subject of debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/08/11/nyheter/innenriks/sexkjop/prostitusjon/menneskehandel/34719779/|title=Snever tilnærming til prostitusjonsmarkedet i ny rapport, mener PION-sjef|date=11 August 2014}}</ref> The report also states that the it has become much more difficult to be a sex worker in Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/incoming/article7664307.ece#.U-tt-2O8PuV|title=Er det positivt at sexarbeideres inntekt går ned?

== Politics of prostitution ==
The 2008 sex purchase ban was passed by the centre-left [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|red-green coalition]] government. At the time of the passage of the purchase law, it was opposed by the centre-right opposition parties in the Storting, including the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservatives]] (''Høyre'', H), the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] (''Fremskrittspartiet'', FrP), and the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] (''Venstre'', V). The bill passed 44 to 28, with the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] (''Arbeiderpartiet'', A/Ap), [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left]] (''Sosialistisk Venstreparti'', SV), [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre]] (''Senterpartiet'', Sp), and [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] (''Kristelig Folkeparti'', KrF) voting in favour, and the Conservatives, Progress Party, and Liberals voting against.

The opposition parties continued to express their objections, according to Conservative MP [[Bent Høie]] and [[Anniken Hauglie]], a fellow Conservative and Commissioner for Social Services in Oslo.<ref>[http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/politisk/opposisjonen-vil-fjerne-sexkjoeploven-3958365.html#.UrxLsrSLVEk Opposisjonen vil fjerne sexkjøploven.

Following revelations that selling sex was as prevalent as ever, and that reporters posing as [[Client (prostitution)|clients]] were easily able to negotiate transactions, Conservative MP [[André Oktay Dahl]], deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice (''[[Justiskomiteen]]''), called for a repeal of the law,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/vil-fjerne-sexkjoeploven-3474578.html#.UrxQ4rSLVEk|title=Vil fjerne sexkjøploven.

=== 2013 elections ===
The change of government in the September [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|2013 election]] which created a Conservative (48 seats) led coalition with the Progress Party (29 seats) created an opportunity for the laws to be revisited, and the Liberals (9 seats) pressed for reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://annemodus.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/our-nations-disgrace-soon-a-bygone-embarrassment/|title=Norway's disgrace – soon a bygone embarrassment?|date=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/4160-norway-venstre-to-press-the-government-on-the-sex-purchase-law|title=Venstre to Press the Government on the Sex Purchase Law - The Nordic Page|date=9 December 2013}}</ref> Høie has now become the [[Minister of Health and Care Services]].

Amongst those continuing to support the law are the Christian Democrats (10 seats), who wish to see the law strengthened. They and the Liberals hold the balance of power in supporting the minority Conservative coalition government. Opposition parties supporting the law include the Labour Party, which holds the greatest number of seats (55), and the Socialist Left (7 seats). Critics of the law include [[Sveinung Rotevatn]] (V) and Conservative leader [[Trond Helleland]], as well as the Green (''De Grønne'', MDG) (1 seat).<ref name=NPN/> [[Marthe Hammer]] (SV), leader of her party's women's movement, sees the law as having symbolic value, sending a message that buying sex is unacceptable.<ref name=taxing/> However, even the KrF agree the effects of the law should be evaluated. Support is particularly strong amongst the youth wings of the parties.<ref name=NiE/> The twelve member Justice Committee is currently chaired by [[Hadia Tajik]] (A), a strong supporter of the law, with [[Anders Bjørnsen Werp]] (H) and [[Kjell Ingolf Ropstad]] (KrF) as deputies. [[Jan Arild Ellingsen]] represents Progress on the committee, and is an outspoken critic, as is Ropstad. Werp and [[Minister of Justice and Public Security|Justice Minister]] Anders Anundsen (FrP) saying only that they will review the evaluation. News from the Nadheim City Mission in July 2014 that the levels of prostitution in Norway had returned to those before the introduction of the law, reignited the debate, with Rotevatn stating that there was a sufficient majority in parliament to rescind the law, and that unless the evaluation produced startlingly positive results, this should now proceed.<ref name=DV22714/>

In November 2013, the Mayor of Oslo, [[Stian Berger Røsland]], stated that selling sex was now so prevalent in Oslo that the government should ban the sale as well as purchase of sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20131118/oslo-mayor-calls-for-ban-on-sex-workers|title=Oslo mayor calls for ban on sex workers|date=18 November 2013}}</ref> By January 2014, all parties had created platforms around prostitution policy.<ref name=NiE/>

The law is supported by women's organisations such as the radical feminist ''Kvinnefronten''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tnp.no/norway/panorama/3713-women-organizations-react-to-prostitution-article|title=Women Organizations React to Prostitution Article - The Nordic Page|date=7 May 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kvinnefronten.no/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=255:fare-sexkjopslova-er-truga-av-hogrekreftene Kvinnefronten: Fare- sexkjøpslova er truga av høgrekreftene! 9 September 2013]</ref> Despite political opposition, the law has public support, 65% in January 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20140102/strong-support-for-prostitution-laws-survey|title=Strong support for prostitution laws - survey|date=2 January 2014}}</ref> but at least one newspaper editorial has called for repeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.no/meninger/leder/Moralismens-overtak-3162484.html#.U-p9_GO8PuW|title=Moralismens overtak}}</ref>

In 1886, [[Christian Krohg]] wrote a novel titled ''[[Albertine (Krohg novel)|Albertine]]'' (see illustration above) about a seamstress of that name living in what was then Christiana (Oslo) forced into prostitution by poverty and abuse. Although the book was confiscated, and Krogh was fined, the ensuing debate expedited the abolition of prostitution in Norway. Krohg also executed several paintings on the Albertine theme.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Christian Krohg |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Knut |last=Berg |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Christian_Krohg/utdypning_%E2%80%93_2 |language=no |accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=nmk2>{{cite book |title=Norges Malerkunst |volume=1 |first=Knut|last=Berg |year=1991 |publisher=Gyldendal |location=Oslo |language=no |pages=430–431|isbn=978-82-05-20587-1 }}</ref> Despite this, prostitution was a frequent theme in nineteenth century literature.<ref name=Beitnes/>

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Norway}}
Norway is a destination and, to a lesser extent, transit and source country for women and girls subjected to sex trafficking. Trafficking victims identified in Norway primarily originate from Eastern Europe and Africa, particularly Bulgaria, Lithuania, Nigeria, and Romania, as well as victims from Pakistan and the Philippines.<ref name="state18">{{cite web |title=Norway 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282723.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730234403/https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282723.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2018 |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>
