== Show synopsis ==
{{See also|List of Six Feet Under episodes}}
The show stars Peter Krause as [[Nate Fisher]], whose funeral director father ([[Richard Jenkins]]) dies and bequeaths ownership of Fisher & Sons Funeral Home to his brother [[David Fisher (Six Feet Under)|David]] (Michael C. Hall) and him. The Fisher clan also includes widow [[Ruth Fisher]] (Frances Conroy) and daughter [[Claire Fisher]] (Lauren Ambrose). Other regulars include mortician and family friend [[Federico Diaz]] (Freddy Rodriguez), Nate's on-again/off-again girlfriend [[Brenda Chenowith]] (Rachel Griffiths), and David's long-term boyfriend [[Keith Charles (Six Feet Under)|Keith Charles]] (Matthew St. Patrick).

On one level, the show is a conventional family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, it is distinguished by its focus on the topic of death, which it explores on personal, religious, and philosophical levels. Each episode begins with a death, the cause of which ranges from heart attack to murder to [[sudden infant death syndrome]]. That death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters to reflect on their current fortunes and misfortunes in a way that is illuminated by the death and its aftermath. The show also uses dark humor and surrealism throughout its seasons.

A recurring plot device consists of a character having an imaginary conversation with the deceased; for example, Nate, David, and Federico sometimes "converse" with the deceased at the beginning of the episode, while the corpse is being embalmed, or during funeral planning or the funeral itself. Sometimes, the characters converse with other deceased characters, most notably Nathaniel Fisher, Sr. The show's creator Alan Ball avers that this represents the living characters' internal dialogues expressed in the form of external conversations.<ref>{{cite video |title=Six Feet Under — DVD audio commentaries |people=Ball, Alan (writer) |publisher=HBO Home Video |medium=DVD}}</ref>

== Production ==

=== Concept ===
Although overall plots and characters were created by Alan Ball, reports conflict on how the series was conceived. In one instance, Ball stated that he came up with the premise of the show after the deaths of his sister and father. However, in an interview,<ref name="In Memoriam">{{cite video |title=Six Feet Under: The Complete Series – "In Memoriam" featurette |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video |people=Ball, Alan}}</ref> he intimates that HBO entertainment president Carolyn Strauss proposed the idea to him. In a copyright-infringement lawsuit,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/462/f3d/1072/funky-films-inc-v-time-warner-entertainment-company-lp-lp|title=462 F3d 1072 Funky Films Inc v. Time Warner Entertainment Company Lp Lp|work=Open Jurist|access-date=March 28, 2010|archive-date=November 21, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121035016/http://openjurist.org/462/f3d/1072/funky-films-inc-v-time-warner-entertainment-company-lp-lp|url-status=live}}</ref> screenwriter Gwen O'Donnell asserted that she was the original source of the idea that later passed through Strauss to Ball; the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], proceeding on the assumption that this assertion was true, rejected her claim. Ball stated in an interview:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/six-feet-under-creator-alan-ball-talks-about-the-end-of-the-hbo-series |title=Six Feet Under creator Alan Ball talks about the end of the HBO series |work=[[MovieWeb]] |date=May 25, 2005 |access-date=August 29, 2012 |archive-date=January 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123160522/http://www.movieweb.com/news/six-feet-under-creator-alan-ball-talks-about-the-end-of-the-hbo-series |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{cquote|When I went to HBO and they had read my first draft and Carolyn Strauss said, 'You know, this is really, really good. I love these characters, I love these situations, but it feels a little safe. Could you just make it just a little more fucked up?' which is not a note that you get in Hollywood very often. And I thought, 'Wow!' And that gave me free range to go a little deeper, go a little darker, go a little more complicated.}}

=== Major themes ===
The show focuses on human mortality, the symbiotic nature of life and death feeding off of each other, and the lives of those who deal with it on a daily basis. When discussing the concept of the show, creator Ball elaborates on the foremost questions the show's pilot targeted:<ref name="In Memoriam" />

{{cquote|Who are these people who are funeral directors that we hire to face death for us? What does that do to their own lives – to grow up in a home where there are dead bodies in the basement, to be a child and walk in on your father with a body lying on a table opened up and him working on it? What does that do to you?}}

''Six Feet Under'' introduces the Fisher family as the basis on which to explore these questions. Throughout its five-season, 63-episode run, major characters experience crises which are in direct relation to their environment and the grief they have experienced. Alan Ball again relates these experiences, as well as the choice of the series' title, to the persistent subtext of the program:<ref>{{cite video |title=Six Feet Under: The Complete Fifth Season – "Everyone's Waiting" audio commentary |people=Ball, Alan (writer/director) |medium=DVD |publisher=HBO Home Video}}</ref>

{{cquote|''Six Feet Under'' refers not only to being buried as a dead body is buried, but [also] to primal emotions and feelings running under the surface. When one is surrounded by death – to counterbalance that, there needs to be a certain intensity of experience, of needing to escape. It's Nate with his womanizing – it's Claire and her sexual experimentation – it's Brenda's sexual compulsiveness – it's David having sex with a male hooker in public – it's Ruth having several affairs – it's the life force trying to push up through all of that suffering and grief and depression.}}

=== Setting ===
Exteriors for the Fisher home were shot at 2302 West 25th Street and the intersection of Arlington Avenue, in the [[West Adams, Los Angeles|West Adams]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lataco.com/taco/six-feet-under-house-fisher-diaz-funeral-home-west-adams|title=Six Feet Under House / Fisher-Diaz Funeral Home ~ West Adams|publisher=L.A.

It is fearless in its approach to storytelling and, far more often than not, succeeds in the risks it takes" and "there is much to admire about this series, including top-notch performances, artful direction and creative storytelling that employs various techniques, including dream sequences and parody commercials. Best of all, though, is Ball’s introspection and the insight he provides about society, the funeral industry, and family relationships."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/six-feet-under-first-episode-816636|title='Six Feet Under' First Episode: THR's 2001 Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Barry|last=Garron|date=August 21, 2015|access-date=October 18, 2017|archive-date=November 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109183930/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/six-feet-under-first-episode-816636|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bill Carter of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "''Six Feet Under'' certainly got enthusiastic reviews, almost universally glowing notices about the rich characterizations and quirky humor shaped by the show's celebrated creator, Alan Ball, the Academy Award-winning writer of the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]''."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/02/business/on-television-six-feet-under-a-morbid-new-comedy-tugs-at-hbo-s-evolving-identity.html|title=On Television; 'Six Feet Under,' a morbid new comedy, tugs at HBO's evolving identity|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=July 2, 2001|access-date=October 18, 2017|archive-date=October 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018192346/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/02/business/on-television-six-feet-under-a-morbid-new-comedy-tugs-at-hbo-s-evolving-identity.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In an early response from HBO executive [[Chris Albrecht]], he announced in regards to the viewers, that they are "totally thrilled with the series."<ref name="nytimes" />

The series finale is considered one of the greatest endings in television history. In a 2015 interview with Alan Ball, Peter Krause, Michael C. Hall, and Lauren Ambrose for ''The Hollywood Reporter'', to mark 10 years since the show's ending, they described it as the "finale that would not die". Megan Vick of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said, "The idea of flashing forward to depict how each member of the Fishers and their loved ones would pass on seemed revolutionary in 2005, but Ball – who created the series and would write and direct its final episode – uses another word for it – inevitable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/six-feet-under-10-years-816495|title='Six Feet Under' 10 Years Later: Creator, Stars on Finale 'Bomb,' Lasting Legacy |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Megan |last=Vick |date=August 21, 2015|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>
