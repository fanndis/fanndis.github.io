It is the first time that the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief,<ref name=HaberkornGerstein/> but it is limited to ''closely held'' corporations.{{efn|"Closely held" corporations are defined by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] as those which a) have more than 50% of the value of their outstanding stock owned (directly or indirectly) by 5 or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of the tax year; and b) are not personal service corporations. By this definition, approximately 90% of U.S. corporations are "closely held", and approximately 52% of the U.S. workforce is employed by "closely held" corporations.

== Background ==
=== Federal law ===
==== Religious Freedom Restoration Act ====
The United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' (1990) that a person may not defy ''neutral laws of general applicability''{{efn|The meaning of ''neutral law of general applicability'' was [[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah|elaborated by the court in 1993]].}} even as an expression of religious belief. "To permit this," wrote Justice Scalia, citing the 1878 ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' decision, "would make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://web.utk.edu/~scheb/decisions/Reynolds.htm|title = Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878)|date = 1878|accessdate = September 2, 2015}}</ref> " He wrote that generally applicable laws do not have to meet the standard of [[strict scrutiny]], because such a requirement would create "a private right to ignore generally applicable laws". Strict scrutiny would require a law to be the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.

In 1993, the US Congress responded by passing the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] (RFRA), requiring strict scrutiny when a neutral law of general applicability "substantially burden[s] a person's{{efn|The [[Dictionary Act]] defines the word 'person' in any act of Congress to include corporations.}} exercise of religion".<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Supreme Court Hears Cases on Contraception Rule|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/26/us/politics/q-and-a-on-challenges-to-health-laws-birth-control-requirement.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 25, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2014}}</ref> The RFRA was amended in 2000 by the [[Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act]] (RLUIPA) to redefine ''exercise of religion'' as any exercise of religion, "whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief", which is to be "construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution". The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the RFRA as applied to federal statutes in ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita]]'' in 2006.

==== Affordable Care Act ====
Of those Americans who have health insurance, most are covered by [[Private Option|employer-sponsored]] health insurance. In 2010, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA), which relies on the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to specify what kinds of preventive care for women should be covered in certain employer-based health plans. HHS exempted religious employers (churches and their integrated auxiliaries, associations of churches, and any religious order), non-profit organizations that object to any required contraception,<ref>{{cite web|title=High court worsens pain of Obamacare birth-control compromise|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-health-contraceptives01-20140701,0,3865443.story|accessdate=July 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703122917/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-wp-blm-news-bc-health-contraceptives01-20140701,0,3865443.story|archive-date=July 3, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> employers providing grandfathered plans (that have not had specific changes before March 23, 2010), and employers with fewer than 50 employees.

=== Lower court history ===
In September 2012, Hobby Lobby filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma]] against enforcement of the contraception rule based on the RFRA and the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the First Amendment.  On November 19, 2012, U.S. District Judge [[Joe L.

=== Acceptance and briefs ===
On November 26, the Supreme Court accepted and consolidated the case with ''Conestoga Wood Specialties v. Sebelius.'' Two dozen amicus briefs support the government, and five dozen support the companies. [[American Freedom Law Center]]'s brief argues that birth control harms women because men will only want them "for the satisfaction of [their] own desires."<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcotte|first=Amanda|title=Your Health Care, Your Choices (Amen, to That!)|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/24/your-health-care-your-choices-amen-to-that.html|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Another brief argues that the contraception rule leads to "the maximization of sexual activity".<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=Religion run amok?

== Opinion of the Court ==

=== Majority opinion ===
[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Justice [[Samuel Alito]] was the author of the Court's majority opinion.]]
On June 30, 2014, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Samuel Alito]] delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas) joined him to strike down the HHS mandate, as applied to [[closely held corporation]]s with religious objections, and to prevent the plaintiffs from being compelled to provide contraception under their healthcare plans. The ruling was reached on statutory grounds, citing the RFRA, because the mandate was not the "least restrictive" method of implementing the government's interest. The ruling did not address Hobby Lobby's claims under the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the First Amendment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/06/30/politics/scotus-obamacare-contraception/index.html|title=Supreme Court rules against Obama in contraception case - CNNPolitics|author=By Bill Mears and Tom Cohen|website=CNN}}</ref>

It noted that the HHS treats ''nonprofit'' corporations as ''persons'' within the meaning of RFRA. The court stated, "no conceivable definition of the term includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|title=''Burwell v.

The court held that the HHS contraception mandate substantially burdens the exercise of religion, rejecting an argument that the $2,000-per-employee penalty for dropping insurance coverage is less than the average cost of health insurance. Responding to HHS's argument that the provision of coverage does not itself result in destruction of embryos, the Court asserted that the argument dodges the substantial burden question that the Court is supposed to address. The Court added, citing Jesuit moral manuals, that the argument is also the religious question of the morality of enabling the immoral acts of others, to which HHS had provided "a binding national answer". The Court argued that federal courts should not answer religious questions because they would in effect be deciding whether certain beliefs are flawed.<ref>134 S.

The court found it unnecessary to adjudicate on whether the HHS contraceptive mandate furthers a compelling government interest and held that HHS has not shown that the mandate is "the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling interest".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|title=''Burwell v.

Hobby Lobby Stores'', p. 50}}</ref>

The court concluded by addressing "the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction". The court said that their decision "provides no such shield", and that "prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|title=''Burwell v.

The court responded by saying, "Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that 'the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests'&nbsp;... The wisdom of Congress's judgment on this matter is not our concern.

=== Concurring opinion ===
[[File:Anthony Kennedy official SCOTUS portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], joined in the majority opinion but also wrote a concurring opinion addressing the dissent.]]
Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote a concurring opinion, responding to the "respectful and powerful dissent", by emphasizing the limited nature of the ruling and saying that the government  "makes the case that the mandate serves the Government's compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees", but that the RFRA's least-restrictive way requirement is not met because "there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage," the one that HHS has devised for non-profit corporations with religious objections. "RFRA requires the Government to use this less restrictive means. As the Court explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise." (Kennedy, J., concurring, pp.&nbsp;3, 4)

=== Dissenting opinions ===
[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|left|185px| Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote a stern dissent disagreeing with the Court's reasoning.]]
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] delivered the primary dissent, which was joined by Justice Sotomayor in full and by Justices Breyer and Kagan as to all but Part III–C–1<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|title=''Burwell v.

Hobby Lobby Stores'', pp 72–73}}</ref> Ginsburg began, "In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.&nbsp;... Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a 'less restrictive alternative.'

She challenged the majority's unprecedented view of for-profit religion saying "Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized a for-profit corporation's qualification for a religious exemption from a generally applicable law, whether under the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA.

She noted that "a less restrictive alternative" has not been written into law by Congress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf|title=''Burwell v.

Justices Breyer and Kagan wrote a one-paragraph dissenting opinion, saying that "the plaintiffs' challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement fails on the merits" and that they "need not and do not decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/06/30/scotusblog-reports-closely-held-corporations-cannot-be-required-to-provide-contraception-coverage/ |title=Hobby Lobby wins before the Supreme Court |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 30, 2014 }}</ref>

===Wheaton College order===
On July 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted a temporary exemption to the approach it suggested as a less restrictive alternative in ''Hobby Lobby,'' where the plaintiffs would send a form ([[EBSA Form 700]])<ref name=form700>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc|title=EBSA Form 700: Certification for Safe Harbor Exemption from Contraceptive Coverage Mandate|access-date=2014-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722040927/http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/preventiveserviceseligibleorganizationcertificationform.doc|archive-date=2014-07-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> to its insurance issuer, which would pay for the contraception. In an unsigned emergency injunction for [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] in Illinois, the court said that instead of notifying its insurance issuer, Wheaton can notify the government. Once notified, the government should notify the issuer. Wheaton believed that by transferring the obligation to cover contraceptives to its insurance issuer, it was triggering that obligation. The emergency injunction does not constitute a ruling on the merits of Wheaton's religious objection. The court said "Nothing in this interim order affects the ability of the applicant's employees and students to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13a1284_ap6c.pdf Order in Pending Case, Wheaton College v.

In dueling commentaries between regular [[SCOTUSblog]] contributor [[Marty Lederman]] and co-founder [[Tom Goldstein]], Lederman argued that only Form 700 can require an insurance provider to pay for contraception coverage. Goldstein argued that an existing regulation allows the government to specify an alternative to Form 700. He pointed out that "the Court didn't accept Wheaton's most aggressive argument" that it cannot be required to do anything. He said that Justice Kennedy's concurrence is controlling and makes clear that the RFRA is not violated by requiring Wheaton to notify the government.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Tom|title=Commentary: Why I don't think the Court's Wheaton College decision rests on any misunderstanding of the law|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/07/commentary-why-i-dont-think-the-courts-wheaton-college-decision-rests-on-any-misunderstanding-of-the-law/|accessdate=Jul 15, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=Jul 4, 2014 <!-- 11:53 AM --> }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lederman|first1=Marty|title=Commentary: Is the Court's attempt at a compromise order in Wheaton College based upon a misunderstanding of the law?|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/07/commentary-is-the-courts-attempt-at-a-compromise-order-in-wheaton-college-based-upon-a-misunderstanding-of-the-law/|accessdate=Jul 15, 2014|work=SCOTUSblog|date=Jul 4, 2014 <!-- 11:52 AM --> }}</ref>

A revised version of EBSA Form 700, effective August 2014, says "[a]s an alternative to using this form, an eligible organization may provide notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the eligible organization has a religious objection to providing coverage for all or a subset of contraceptive services&nbsp;...".<ref name=form700/>

===Religious exemption from laws that apply to the general public===
Although the court stated clearly that the decision is limited to the contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.&nbsp;4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. [[Walter Dellinger]], former acting solicitor general said, "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care.<ref name=Reach>{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Ruling Could Have Reach Beyond Issue of Contraception|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/us/contraception-ruling-could-have-reach-far-beyond-womens-rights.html?_r=0|accessdate=March 27, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 24, 2014}}</ref> In line with the dissenting opinion, ''[[The American Prospect]]'' asked, "[W]ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that [[minimum wage]] laws violate their religious beliefs?"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lemieux|first1=Scott|title=5 Men on Supreme Court Impose Substantial Burden on Women in Illogical Decision|url=http://prospect.org/article/5-men-supreme-court-impose-substantial-burden-women-illogical-decision|accessdate=Jul 3, 2014|work=The American Prospect|date=Jun 30, 2014}}</ref> [[Jonathan Rauch]], a senior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction.<ref name=Cohen/> The [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] (NGLT) and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]] withdrew their support for the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the ''Hobby Lobby'' ruling. NGLT executive director [[Rea Carey]] said, "We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years."<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Ed|title=Gay rights group withdrawing support of ENDA after Hobby Lobby decision|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/07/08/gay-rights-group-withdrawing-support-of-enda-after-hobby-lobby-decision/|accessdate=Jul 8, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=Jul 8, 2014}}</ref>

Such concerns are focused on the court's application of the federal RFRA law and were driven by national controversy over a [[State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts|state RFRA]] amendment bill in Arizona. Douglas Laycock, law professor at the University of Virginia, said, "The whole secular left has decided" that RFRA laws "are very dangerous because they care so much more about the contraception cases and gay rights." He said RFRA laws are mischaracterized because they do not dictate outcomes favoring religious objectors, they only require courts to use the highest standard of scrutiny on any law challenged.<ref name=Reach/> Mark Kernes, Senior Editor and Chief Legal Analyst for [[AVN magazine]] stated in an [[op-ed]] piece, "If the Hobby Lobby decision supports the 'right' of companies not to make available birth control that will prevent women from 'catching' a pregnancy, what's to keep those same religious companies from arguing that providing access to [[pre-exposure prophylaxis|PrEP]] drugs like [[Truvada]], which help prevent gays (and, admittedly, everyone) from catching [[HIV]] shouldn't similarly be excluded from their health plans?"<ref name=2014AVNTruvada>{{cite web|last1=Kernes|first1=Mark|title=Will the Hobby Lobby Decision Impact the Availability of Truvada?|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Will-the-Hobby-Lobby-Decision-Impact-the-Availability-of-Truvada-565669.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>

===Imposition of religious beliefs onto others===
Ian Millhiser from [[Vox (website)|Vox.com]] argued that as a general rule in religious liberty cases prior to the Hobby Lobby decision religion can't be used to diminish the rights of others. He pointed to the 1982 U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[United States v. Lee (1982)]]'' (1982) in which the Court declared “when followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.”<ref name="20191226Vox.comMillhiser" /> According to Millhiser the Hobby Lobby decision marks the first time "rights of religious believers could trump the rights of others."<ref name="20191226Vox.comMillhiser">{{cite news |last1=Millhiser |first1=Ian |title=9 Supreme Court cases that shaped the 2010s |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/12/26/21024188/nine-supreme-court-citizens-united-obamacare-muslim-ban-religion |access-date=December 1, 2020 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox.com]] |date=December 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124073316/https://www.vox.com/2019/12/26/21024188/nine-supreme-court-citizens-united-obamacare-muslim-ban-religion |archive-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref> Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the [[National Women's Law Center]], argued in the same direction Millhiser by saying that the Supreme Court has never ruled that companies have religious beliefs and that "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom "gives us all the right to hold our beliefs, but it doesn't give you the right to impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others."<ref name=LATimes/> The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the decision "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees."<ref>{{cite news|author1=The Editorial Board|title=Limiting Rights: Imposing Religion on Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/opinion/the-supreme-court-imposing-religion-on-workers.html|accessdate=Jul 2, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=Jun 30, 2014}}</ref> A [[Fox News]] columnist wrote, "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon."<ref>{{cite news|last1=A.

[[Welton Gaddy]] said, "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used to protect the rights of minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom."<ref name=Boorstein/>

Scholars on the other side (including some on the left){{citation needed|date=July 2017}} disagree, arguing that companies owned and run by liberals will likewise benefit from the freedom to operate according to their conscience or values—which has not been viewed as "imposing" views, because people routinely choose whom to associate with based on philosophical compatibility.<ref>

===Corporate liability===
''[[The New York Times]]'' editor Dorothy J. Samuels invoked the cautionary adage "be careful what you wish for", speculating that "if owners indicate that they are not entirely separate from their corporation—by denying corporation employees' birth control coverage based on their personal religious beliefs—the case could be made in future state-court litigation that they have waived their right to be shielded from responsibility for corporate financial liabilities."<ref name=Samuels>{{cite news|last1=J.
