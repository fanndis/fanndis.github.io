'''Annexation of the [[West Bank]]''', or parts thereof, has been proposed by some Israeli politicians since the area was captured and [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupied]] by Israel during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]].

[[East Jerusalem]] was the first part of the West Bank to be annexed; it was ''de facto'' annexed following its occupation by Israel in 1967, and ''de jure annexed'' following the 1980 [[Jerusalem Law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.ochaopt.org/location/east-jerusalem|title=East Jerusalem|website =OCHA|date= 6 September 2019 |accessdate = 11 September 2019}}</ref>

[[Israeli law in the West Bank settlements|Israeli law has been applied to Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank]], leading to a system of "enclave law" and claims of "creeping annexation".

[[Annexation of the Jordan Valley]], first proposed in the 1967 [[Allon Plan]], was announced by Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] in September 2019 as his plan, subject to the outcome of the [[September 2019 Israeli legislative election]].

Annexation of the West Bank would be condemned as illegal by the [[United Nations]] and would break international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25960&LangID=E|title=Israeli annexation of parts of the Palestinian West Bank would break international law – UN experts call on the international community to ensure accountability|website=OHCHR|date=June 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/opinion/sunday/west-bank-israel-annex.html|title=Annexing the West Bank Is a Brazen Violation of International Law|website=The New York Times|date=May 30, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/06/1066452|title=Rights experts call for global opposition to Israel’s annexation plans|website=UN News|date=June 16, 2020|author=Reem Abaza}}</ref>

Israel's prime minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and his center-right [[Likud]] party do not have a coherent stance on the status of the West Bank. In 2009, Netanyahu endorsed the two-state solution, but before the [[April 2019 Israeli legislative election]], he stated his intention of unilaterally annexing Israeli settlements in the West Bank. However, since this was a throwaway remark made without addressing the international opposition to such an action, it is unclear whether Netanyahu intends to follow through.<ref name=raphael>{{cite news |last1=Ahren |first1=Raphael |title=From annexation to right of return: What the parties say about the Palestinians |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/from-annexation-to-right-of-return-what-the-parties-say-about-the-palestinians/ |accessdate=9 June 2019 |work=Times of Israel}}</ref><ref name=lawfare>{{cite web |title=Israel's New Plan to Annex the West Bank: What Happens Next? |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/israels-new-plan-annex-west-bank-what-happens-next |website=[[Lawfare (blog)|lawfareblog.com]] |accessdate=9 June 2019 |language=en |date=6 May 2019}}</ref> On 16 September 2019, in an interview with Israeli Army Radio, Netanyahu said "I intend to extend sovereignty on all the settlements and the (settlement) blocs," including "sites that have security importance or are important to Israel’s heritage," including the settlements in Hebron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-09-16/israel-leader-vows-annex-all-settlements|title=Netanyahu vows to annex "all the settlements" in West Bank |date=2019-09-16|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-09-16}}</ref>

On 10 September 2019 (shortly before the [[September 2019 Israeli legislative election]]) Netanyahu announced his government's plan to annex the [[Jordan Valley]], if it won the election. He also reaffirmed his previous pledge to annex all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank, but said such a move would not be made before publication of the [[Trump peace plan]] and consultations with President Donald Trump. According to B'Tselem, 65,000 Palestinians and about 11,000 Israeli settlers live in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.btselem.org/jordan_valley|title=The Jordan Valley|date=2017-11-17|website=B'Tselem|access-date=2019-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/netanyahu-announces-post-election-plan-annex-jordan-valley-190910155523634.html |title=Netanyahu announces post-election plan to annex Jordan Valley |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=11 September 2019 |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref> According to [[Peace Now]], the proposal includes 30 settlements with 12,778 settlers, 18 illegal outposts, 15 Area A and B communities, including 44,175 Palestinians planned to remain under the nominal autonomous rule of the Palestinian Authority, surrounded by annexed territory with access roads, described by Peace Now as "..alarmingly similar to the [[Bantustan]] formula in former [[Apartheid]] South Africa" and 48 shepherding communities in Area C including 8,775 Palestinians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-election-jordan-valley-west-bank-palestine-a9106261.html|title=Netanyahu isn’t bluffing about his plans to annex the Jordan Valley – but will he succeed? |first=Bel |last=Trew |date=2019-09-15|website=[[The Independent]] |access-date=2019-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peacenow.org.il/en/data-on-netanyahus-jordan-valley-annexation-map|title=Data on Netanyahu’s Jordan Valley Annexation Map |date=2019-09-11|website=[[Peace Now]] |access-date=2019-09-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The area to be annexed is about 22% of the West Bank, 90% of which is in [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] and 20% of the land is Palestinian-owned; the map that Netanyahu displayed of the area to be annexed had several errors, incorrectly noting the location of several settlements and omitting Palestinian villages.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Daraghmeh |first1=Mohammed |last2=Heller |first2=Aron |title=A look at the Jordan Valley Israeli PM has vowed to annex |url=https://www.apnews.com/2cf0c03c22fe43d28d16bdd92b7203ff |accessdate=14 September 2019 |work=[[AP News]] |date=11 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=seriously>{{cite news |last1=Magid |first1=Jacob |title=PM’s Jordan Valley map was error-strewn, but is his vow worth taking seriously? |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/pms-jordan-valley-map-was-error-strewn-but-is-his-vow-worth-taking-seriously/ |accessdate=14 September 2019 |work=Times of Israel |date=12 September 2019}}</ref> Netanyahu's map is only a slightly revised version of the [[Allon Plan]] map, with the key difference being that the Palestinians are no longer offered access to the international border with Jordan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2019/09/11/netanyahu-hints-trump-peace-plan-will-allow-israel-annex-key-west-bank-territory/|title=Netanyahu Hints Trump Peace Plan Will Allow Israel to Annex Key West Bank Territory|date=2019-09-11 |website=[[The Intercept]] |access-date=2019-09-16 |df=dmy-all |first=Robert |last=Mackey}}</ref> Netanyahu said that he had received a green light from the United States' [[Donald Trump administration]].

The West Bank is divided into Area A, Area B, and [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]. Area C contains 60% of the West Bank's area and all Israeli settlements. According to OCHA there are about 300,000 Palestinians in Area C<ref>{{cite web|url=https://public.tableau.com/profile/ocha.opt#!/vizhome/VPP2013MMay21N-Basic24/DashBasic |title=UNOCHA occupied Palestinian territory - Profile

[[File:Trump Peace Plan Map.jpg|thumb|[[Trump peace plan|Trump's peace plan]] is the first U.S. peace proposal ever to contain a map with borders for a future [[State of Palestine]].]]
Axios cite a "senior U.S. official" as saying that any Israeli annexations must come "in the context of an offer to the Palestinians to achieve statehood based upon specific terms, conditions, territorial dimensions and generous economic support." and that "We are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty over areas of the West Bank in the context of the Government of Israel agreeing to negotiate with the Palestinians along the lines set forth in President Trump’s vision." U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told Netanyahu's aides at a meeting of the U.S.-Israeli mapping committee that is examining potential areas that could be annexed, that "the U.S. wants to implement a peace plan, not an annexation plan".<ref>{{cite news |title=West Bank annexations must come in context of Palestinian state, White House tells Israel|url=https://www.axios.com/israel-west-bank-annexation-netanyahu-trump-plan-0e84d62c-9362-42fa-91da-3a6b89947750.html|publisher=Axios|date=April 30, 2020|access-date=April 30, 2020}}</ref>

On 28 May, 2020, Netanyahu said he was committed to annexing parts of the West Bank in July once a joint Israeli-US team completes mapping the exact territory based on the conceptual map released by US President Donald Trump's administration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Netanyahu: Palestinians in Israeli-annexed Jordan Valley won’t get citizenship|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/rejecting-settler-fears-pm-says-annexation-plan-wont-mention-palestinian-state/|publisher= Times of israel|date=May 28, 2020 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> However, the July 2020 annexation plan was later pushed back.<ref name=usdelay />

==Opinion polling==
A 2019 ''[[Haaretz]]'' poll investigated support for annexation among Israelis. According to the survey, 30% did not know, 28% of Israelis opposed any annexation and 15% supported annexing Area C alone. 27% wanted to annex the entire West Bank including 16% who opposed granting political rights to Palestinians and 11% who favored granting political rights.<ref name=poll>{{cite news |last1=Kraft |first1=Dina |title=Haaretz Poll: 42% of Israelis Back West Bank Annexation, Including Two-state Supporters |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-palestinian-conflict-solutions/.premium-42-of-israelis-back-west-bank-annexation-including-two-state-supporters-1.7047313 |accessdate=9 June 2019 |work=Haaretz |date=25 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2014, [[Yesh Atid]] leader [[Yair Lapid]] said that his centrist party would leave the governing coalition and topple the government if any West Bank settlements were annexed.

[[Anshel Pfeffer]], Netanyahu's unofficial biographer stated that the Prime Minister had no intention of going through with the plan, which, he argued, was an electoral move to secure more votes. Long-time Israeli critic of the Israel-South Africa apartheid analogy, [[Benjamin Pogrund]], who was born in South Africa, commented that were the proposal enactment, it would be tantamount to implementing an apartheid regime, and stated that his former assessment would therefore change: '[At] least it has been a military occupation. Now we are going to put other people under our control and not give them citizenship. That is apartheid.

Secondly, it would violate the vision of a [[two-state solution]] set forth in the [[Oslo Accords]]. Thirdly, the permanent and day-to-day control of a civilian population by a foreign power, denying it the right to naturalize or participate in politics, would perpetuate a [[democratic deficit]].<ref name="lawfare" />
