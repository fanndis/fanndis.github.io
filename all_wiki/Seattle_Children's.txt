'''Seattle Children's''', formerly '''Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center''', formerly Children's Orthopedic Hospital, is a [[children's hospital]] in the [[Laurelhurst, Seattle|Laurelhurst]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The hospital specializes in the care of infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 in several specialties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/emergency-department/|title=Emergency Department in Seattle|website=Seattle Children’s Hospital|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21|archive-date=2020-01-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116152100/https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/emergency-department/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Inpatient Care|url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/healthcare-professionals/access-services/inpatient-care/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Seattle Children’s Hospital|language=en}}</ref> The hospital is also ranked #10 children's hospital nationwide by the U.S. News and World Report.

==History==
The hospital was founded as the seven-bed Children's Orthopedic Hospital in 1907 by [[Anna Herr Clise]] after her 5-year-old son, Willis, died of inflammatory [[rheumatism]] in 1898.<ref>[http://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/history/ "1907: The Beginning of Seattle Children's"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209224806/http://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/history/ |date=2012-12-09 }}.  Accessed online 09 November 2012.</ref> It was originally a ward of the downtown [[Seattle General Hospital]]. It moved to a cottage on [[Queen Anne, Seattle|Queen Anne Hill]] the next year, and in 1911 local luminaries including Herbert Gowen and [[Mark A. Matthews]] dedicated a full 40-bed hospital at the same location.<ref>[http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/curtis&CISOPTR=988&CISOBOX=1&REC=3 "Laying the cornerstone of the Children's Orthopedic Hospital, Seattle."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211101854/http://content.lib.washington.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fcurtis&CISOPTR=988&CISOBOX=1&REC=3 |date=2013-12-11 }}.

In 1953, Children's moved to a new campus in [[Laurelhurst, Seattle, Washington|Laurelhurst]], east of the University of Washington.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

A research division, Seattle Children's Research Institute, was established in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/history/|title=Seattle Children’s History|website=Seattle Children’s Hospital|access-date=2020-05-09|archive-date=2020-07-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715230933/https://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/history/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2007, Seattle Children's purchased a seven-story building in the [[Denny Triangle, Seattle, Washington|Denny Triangle]], near downtown Seattle and [[South Lake Union, Seattle, Washington|South Lake Union]].<ref>{{cite news| first= Ángel| last= González| title= Children's Hospital acquires Denny Triangle tower| date= 2007-12-27| publisher= The Seattle Times| url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004093747_childrens27.html| work= | accessdate= 2007-12-27| archive-date= 2007-12-28| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071228162823/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004093747_childrens27.html| url-status= live}}</ref> With this purchase, Children's acquired nearly 2 square blocks for the research insititute.<ref>[http://masterplan.seattlechildrens.org/commonQuestions.aspx "Seattle Children's Master Plan Common Questions."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618140534/http://masterplan.seattlechildrens.org/commonQuestions.aspx |date=2008-06-18 }}.

In 2013, Seattle Children's opened a 330,000 square foot expansion at the main campus in [[Seattle]]. The expansion included a new cancer and critical care unit as well as a new emergency department with 38 exam rooms. The facility added 80 new private beds in single patient rooms. The building is expected to use 47 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than similar-sized hospitals in the region.<ref>{{cite news| first= Meghan| last= Pembroke| title= Seattle Children's Hospital opens Building Hope expansion and first teen and young adult cancer unit| date= 2013-04-22| publisher= PR Newswire| url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-building-hope-expansion-and-first-teen-and-young-adult-cancer-unit-204063921.html| work= | accessdate= 2016-05-24| archive-date= 2016-06-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160624035148/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-building-hope-expansion-and-first-teen-and-young-adult-cancer-unit-204063921.html| url-status= live}}</ref>

In 2013 Seattle Children's filed a [[lawsuit]] against the Washington State [[Insurance commissioner]] for certifying insurance plans in the state's new [[Health insurance marketplace|health insurance exchange]] (established under the [[Affordable Care Act]]) for failing to provide coverage for the hospital; the hospital also filed an administrative appeal with the insurance commissioner's office.<ref>Amy Snow Landa for the Seattle Times.

== Controversy ==
In 2015 the hospital warned the public that due to its improper sterilization of surgical equipment, around 12,000 children and young adults treated there since 2010 were at risk of infection from bacteria or blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV; it had issued a similar warning two years earlier.<ref>Sandi Doughton  for the Seattle Times.
