The city is located on the [[San Joaquin River]] in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]] and had an estimated population of 312,697 by the California Department of Finance for 2019. Stockton is the [[List of largest California cities by population|13th]] largest city in California and the [[List of United States cities by population|62nd]] largest city in the United States. It was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.

Built during the [[California Gold Rush]], Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012 Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal [[bankruptcy]] in US history, which had multiple causes including financial mismanagement in the 1990s, generous [[fringe benefits]] to unionized city employees,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stockton-bankruptcy-cause-idUSBRE8621DL20120703|title=How Stockton went broke: A 15-year spending binge|date=2012-07-03|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-16|language=en}}</ref> and the [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]]. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.

==Geography==

Stockton is situated amidst the [[Arable land|farmland]] of California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], a subregion of the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of [[waterways]], which make up the [[California Delta]].

[[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]], inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] and the dredged [[San Joaquin River]] connect the city with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to its west, creating the [[Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel]]. Stockton and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] are California's only [[Inland port|inland sea ports]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city occupies a total area of {{convert|64.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi}} (4.76%) is water.

==History==

When Europeans first visited the Stockton area, it was occupied by the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley [[Yokuts people|Yokuts Indians]]. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods.  A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the [[Stockton Channel]] in downtown Stockton.<ref name="historycity">{{cite web|title=History A Look into Stockton's Past Before the Gold Rush|url=http://www.stocktongov.com/discover/history/hist.html|publisher=City of Stockton|access-date=21 February 2016}}</ref>

The [[Siskiyou Trail]] began in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that led through the [[Sacramento Valley]] over the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and into present-day [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/592072|title=Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Jackson County|access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref>

The extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by [[Plains and Sierra Miwok|Miwok Indians]] for centuries. During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[San Joaquin River]] was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products.

; Mexican era

Capt. [[Charles Maria Weber]], a German, emigrated to America in 1836 (originally named Karl, he changed his name to Charles shortly after his arrival). After spending time in [[Texas]], he came overland from Missouri to California with the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] in 1841. Weber went to work for [[John Sutter]], who vouched for "Carlos Maria Weber" to Mexican authorities. In 1842 Weber settled in the [[Pueblo of San José]].

As an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with Guillermo (William) Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to [[Mexico]], which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]], a land grant of 11 square [[league (unit)|leagues]] on the east side of the San Joaquin River.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GR_4157|title=A History of Stockton from Its Organization up to the Present Time | first=George Henry|last=Tinkham |year=1880|page=[https://archive.org/details/GR_4157/page/n430 397] |publisher=W.M. Hinton & Co.}}</ref>

Gulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired it in 1845. In 1846 Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the [[Mexican–American War]] broke out.  Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captain by Mexican Gen. [[José Castro]], which he declined; he later, however, accepted the position of captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Capt. Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.

; Gold rush era

At the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Weber's rancho on their way to the goldfields. When Weber decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to [[California Gold Rush|gold-seekers]] was more profitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.stockton.ca.us/Awards/WeberAward.cfm |title=Captain Charles M.

As the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, the city grew rapidly as a miners' supply point during the Gold Rush. Weber built the first permanent residence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] on a piece of land now known as Weber Point.<ref name="historycity"/>  During the Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]. During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including "Weberville," "Fat City," "Mudville" and "California's Sunrise Seaport."<ref name="uopabout">{{cite web|title=About Stockton|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/General-Questions/About-Stockton.html|website=www.pacific.edu|publisher=University of the Pacific|access-date=31 October 2016}}</ref>  In 1849 Weber laid out a town, which he named "Tuleburg," but he soon decided on "Stockton" in honor of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Robert F. Stockton]]. Stockton was the first community in California to have a name that was neither Spanish nor [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] in origin.<ref name=facts>{{cite web|title=Stockton Facts|url=http://www.visitstockton.org/about-us/fun-facts/|publisher=Stockton Convention & Visitors Bureau|access-date=31 October 2016}}</ref>

; Chinese immigration

Thousands of Chinese came to Stockton from the [[Kwangtung]] province of China during the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China and the discovery of gold in California. After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] and remained in Stockton. By 1880 Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ugly-legacy-latino-couple-finds-racist-covenant-housing-paperwork-n1082476|title=An ugly legacy: Latino couple finds racist covenant in housing paperwork|last=Aviles|first=Gwen|date=November 15, 2019|work=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-16|quote=No persons other than those wholly of the white Caucasian race shall use, occupy or reside upon any part of or within any building located on the above described real property, except servants or domestics of another race employed by or domiciled with a white Caucasian owner or tenant,}}</ref> The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton's finest hotels of the time. Only after the [[Magnuson Act]] was repealed in 1962 were American-born Chinese allowed to buy property and own buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spirit of Stockton's Chinatown|url=http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|publisher=Downtown Stockton Alliance|access-date=21 February 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202214924/http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|archive-date=February 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Some State of California and City of San Francisco Anti-Chinese Legislation and Subsequent Action|url=http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/resources/resource_2_4.pdf|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|access-date=26 February 2016|year=2006}}</ref>

; Incorporation

The city was officially incorporated on July 23, 1850, by the county court, and the first city election was held on July 31, 1850. In 1851 the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals and the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870 the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian. Many Chinese were immigrating to California as workers in these years, especially for the [[Transcontinental Railroad]].<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=California - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

[[Benjamin Holt]] settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the [[Holt Manufacturing Company]].

On April 22, 1918, British Army Col. [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton]] visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors to haul heavy guns and supplies during [[World War I]], and Swinton publicly thanked Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war effort.<ref>''Caterpillar Times'' report, May 1918, pages 5 to 8.</ref> During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort of armored fighting vehicle on Holt's caterpillar tractors, but without success (although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate source and were not directly derived from Holt machines).<ref>''Eyewitness, being Personal Reminiscences of Certain Phases of the Great War, Including the Genesis of the Tank,'' by Major-General Sir Ernest D.

On January 10, 1920, a major fire on Main Street threatened an entire city block. A blaze was discovered in the basement of the Yost-Dohrmann store about 2 a.m., which was gutted, and adjacent businesses were damaged by flames and water. Damage was estimated at $150,000.<ref>United Press, “Stockton Is Scene Of $150,000 Fire,” ''Riverside Daily Press'', Riverside, California, Saturday 10 January 1920, Volume XXXV, Number 9, page 1.</ref>

Stockton is the site of the first [[Sikh]] temple in the United States; [[Gurdwara Sahib Stockton]] opened on October 24, 1912.

In 1933 the [[Port of Stockton|port]] was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to [[San Francisco Bay]], was deepened and completed. This created commercial opportunities that fueled the city's growth. [[Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot]] was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Historic California Posts: Stockton Ordnance Depot |url=http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/StocktonOrdDepot.html |website=californiamilitaryhistory.org |publisher=The California State Military Museum |access-date=11 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214014614/http://californiamilitaryhistory.org/StocktonOrdDepot.html |archive-date=14 December 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> During the [[Great Depression]] the town's canning industry became the battleground of a labor dispute resulting in the [[Stockton Cannery Strike of 1937|Spinach Riot]] of 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS19370427.2.62#|title=The Cornell Daily Sun 27 April 1937 — The Cornell Daily Sun|website=cdsun.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. One of 15 temporary detention sites run by the [[War Relocation Authority|Wartime Civilian Control Administration]], the center held some 4,200 [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese-Americans removed]] from their West Coast homes under [[Executive Order 9066]], while they waited for transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. The center opened on May 10, 1942, and operated until October 17, when the majority of its population was sent to [[Rohwer War Relocation Center|Rohwer]], Arkansas. The former incarceration site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stockton%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |title=Stockton (detention facility) |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

In September 1996 the [[Base Realignment and Closure|Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] announced the final closure of Stockton's Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island. Formerly known as [[Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot]], the island's facilities had served as a major communications outpost for submarine activities in the Pacific during the Cold War.

==Economic history==

[[File:Commercial & Savings Bank - Stockton, CA.jpg|thumb|The historic Commercial & Savings Bank building, Stockton.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}

Historically an agricultural community, Stockton's economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications and [[manufacturing]].

Stockton's central location, relative to both San Francisco and [[Sacramento]], as well as its proximity to the state and interstate freeway system, together with its comparatively inexpensive land costs, have prompted several companies to base their regional operations in the city.

===Construction and public spending===

[[File:Kluft-photo-Stockton-Metro-Airport-July-2009-Img 0085c.jpg|thumb|View across Stockton metropolitan airport, 2009.]]

Beginning in the late 1990s, Stockton had commenced some revitalization projects.<ref>McGarth, M. (2016). Stockton, California: A My Brother's Keeper Community. National Civic Review 105 (1). https://doi.org/10.1002/ncr.21261</ref> Newly built or renovated buildings include the Bob Hope Theater, Regal City Centre Cinemas and IMAX, [[San Joaquin Regional Transit District|San Joaquin RTD]] Downtown Transit Center, Lexington Plaza Waterfront Hotel, Hotel Stockton, [[Stockton Arena]], the [[San Joaquin County Administration Building]], and the [[Banner Island Ballpark|Stockton Ballpark]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A new downtown marina and adjacent Joan Darah Promenade were added along the south shore of the Stockton Deep Water Channel during 2009. Various public art projects were also installed throughout the area (see Stockton's public art section).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the summer 2018 the mayor of Stockton tested universal [[basic income]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/09/technology/stockton-california-basic-income-experiment/index.html |title=This California town will give a $500 monthly stipend to residents}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-income/california-city-fights-poverty-with-guaranteed-income-idUSKCN1J015D |title=California city fights poverty with guaranteed income}}</ref>{{needs update|date=August 2019}}

===Real estate bubble===
[[File:StocktonCalifornia_2012.jpg|thumb|Stockton California 2012 aerial view]]
The Stockton real estate market was disproportionately affected by the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]], and the city led the United States in [[foreclosure]]s for that year, with one of every 30 homes posted for foreclosure.<ref name="Christie">{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/08/14/real_estate/California_cities_lead_foreclosure/index.htm |title=California cities fill top 10 foreclosure list |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=August 14, 2007 |access-date=2010-02-04}}</ref> From September 2006 to September 2007, the value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.<ref name="money.cnn.com">{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/real_estate/REOs_tough_on_sellers/index.htm |title=Home sellers suffer amid wave of foreclosures |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=December 2, 2008 |access-date=2010-02-26}}</ref>

Stockton's [[Weston Ranch]] neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], a now defunct national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the 2000s' speculative [[housing bubble]]. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in United States.<ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities">{{Cite journal| url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/most-dangerous-cities-lifestyle-real-estate-dangerous-american-cities_slide_12.html| title=America's Most Dangerous Cities| journal=Forbes| date=2009-04-23| access-date=2010-02-04}}</ref>

Stockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal year, and the city had the country's highest [[foreclosure]] rate (9.5%) as well. Stockton also had an unemployment rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton was rated by [[Forbes]] in 2009 as America's fifth most dangerous city because of its [[crime rate]].<ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities"/> In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, Forbes named it one of the three worst places to live in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589887,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Forbes Magazine Names Worst Places to Live in America | date=March 24, 2010 | access-date=June 5, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531224243/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589887,00.html | archive-date=May 31, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===City bankruptcy===

Following the 2008 financial crisis, in June 2012 Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. It was surpassed by [[Detroit bankruptcy|Detroit]] in July 2013. The city approved a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013,<ref name="Smith">{{cite web|url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131004/A_NEWS/310040326 |title=Council approves Chap. 9 exit plan |first=Scott |last=Smith |date=2013-10-04 |access-date=2013-11-06 |work=[[The Record (Stockton)|The Record]]}}</ref> and voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the exit.<ref name="Marcum">{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-tax-measure-election-20131106,0,5437212.story#axzz2jt4QaQcs |title=Stockton voters approve of new tax measure for bankrupt city | first=Diana | last=Marcum |date=2013-11-06 |access-date=2013-11-06 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>

The collapse in real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city's revenue base. On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9 bankruptcy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stockton, California Chapter 9 Voluntary Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/7DR4LZQ/City_of_Stockton_California__caebke-12-32118__0001.0.pdf|website=PacerMonitor|publisher=PacerMonitor|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> On April 1, 2013, the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] Eastern District of California ruled that Stockton was eligible for bankruptcy protection.

The Stockton bankruptcy case lasted more than two years and received nationwide attention. On October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved a bankruptcy exit plan by a six-zero vote<ref name="Smith" /> to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento. Voters approved a 3/4-cent sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the bankruptcy exit.<ref name="Marcum" />

On October 30, 2014, a [[federal bankruptcy judge]] approved the city's bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned pension payments to retired workers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lifsher|first1=Marc|last2=Petersen|first2=Melody|title=Judge approves Stockton bankruptcy plan; worker pensions safe|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stockton-pension-court-ruling-cuts-20141029-story.html|access-date=30 October 2014|work=LA Times|date=30 October 2014}}</ref> The city exited from Chapter 9 bankruptcy on February 25, 2015.

On January 17, 1989, the Stockton Police Department received a threat against Cleveland Elementary School from an unknown person. Later that day, Patrick Purdy, who was later found to be mentally ill, opened fire on the school's playground with a semi-automatic rifle, killing five children, all Cambodian or Vietnamese refugees, and wounding 29 others, and a teacher, before taking his own life.

=== Fire department ===

The Stockton Fire Department was first rated as a Class 1 fire department by the [[Insurance Services Office]] in 1971.
