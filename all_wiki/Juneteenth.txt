President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Emancipation Proclamation]] had officially outlawed slavery in Texas and the other states in rebellion against the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] almost two and a half years earlier. Enforcement of the Proclamation generally relied on the advance of Union troops. Texas being the most remote of the [[slave states]] had a low presence of Union troops as the [[American Civil War]] ended; thus enforcement there had been slow and inconsistent before Granger's announcement.<ref name="Gates" /> Although Juneteenth generally celebrates the end of slavery in the United States, it was still legal and practiced in two [[Border states (American Civil War)|Union border states]] (Delaware and Kentucky) until later that year when ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution]] abolished [[chattel slavery]] nationwide in December.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Editors |first1=History com |title=13th Amendment |url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/thirteenth-amendment |website=HISTORY |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC. |access-date=19 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=10 Facts: The Emancipation Proclamation |url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/10-facts-emancipation-proclamation |website=American Battlefield Trust |publisher=American Battlefield Trust |access-date=19 June 2020 |language=en |date=9 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Amy |title=The Border States (U.S. National Park Service) |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-border-states.htm |website=National Park Service |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |access-date=19 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref>{{efn|name="war powers"}}

Celebrations date to 1866, at first involving church-centered community gatherings in Texas. It spread across [[Southern United States|the South]] and became more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a [[food festival]]. During the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s, it was eclipsed by the struggle for postwar civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with a focus on [[African American]] freedom and arts.<ref name="cruz">{{cite news|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|date=June 18, 2008|title=A Brief History of Juneteenth|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1815936,00.html|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> By the 21st century, Juneteenth was celebrated in most major cities across the United States.

Modern observance is primarily in local celebrations. Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs such as "[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]" and "[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]", and reading of works by noted [[African Americans|African-American]] writers such as [[Ralph Ellison]] and [[Maya Angelou]]. Celebrations include [[rodeos]], [[street fair]]s, [[barbecue|cookouts]], [[family reunion]]s, park parties, [[historical reenactment]]s, and Miss Juneteenth contests. The [[Mascogos]], descendants of [[Black Seminoles]], who escaped from U.S. slavery in 1852 and settled in [[Coahuila]], [[Mexico]], also celebrate Juneteenth.

Although this event is popularly thought of as "the end of slavery", emancipation for those enslaved in two Union [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] (Delaware and Kentucky), would not come until several months later, on December 18, 1865, when ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was announced.{{sfn|Wynn|2009|p=}}{{efn|name="war powers"}} The freedom of formerly enslaved people in Texas was given final legal status in a series of [[Texas Supreme Court]] decisions between 1868 and 1874.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Randolph |date=1984 |title=The End of Slavery in Texas: A Research Note |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=71–80 |jstor=30239840}}</ref>

The [[Great Depression]] forced many black people off farms and into the cities to find work. In these urban environments, African Americans had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. From 1936 to 1951 the [[Texas State Fair]] served as a destination for celebrating the holiday, contributing to its revival. In 1936 an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people joined the holiday's celebration in Dallas. In 1938, Texas governor [[James Allred|J. V.

== Celebrations ==
The holiday is considered the "longest running African-American holiday"{{sfn|Knight|2011|p=}} and has been called "America's second Independence Day".<ref name=":6" /> It is often celebrated on the third Sunday in June.<ref name="moskin2004" /> Historian Mitch Kachun considers that celebrations of the end of slavery have three goals: "to celebrate, to educate, and to agitate".{{sfn|Hume|Arceneaux|2008|p=156}} Early celebrations consisted of [[baseball]], fishing, and rodeos. African Americans were often prohibited from using public facilities for their celebrations, so they were often held at churches or near water. Celebrations were also characterized by elaborate large meals and people wearing their best clothing.{{sfn|Knight|2011|p=}} It was common for former slaves and their descendants to make a [[pilgrimage]] to Galveston.{{sfn|Jaynes|2005|p=}} As early festivals received news coverage, Janice Hume and Noah Arceneaux consider that they "served to assimilate African-American memories within the dominant 'American story'.{{Spaces}}"{{sfn|Hume|Arceneaux|2008|p=159}}

Observance today is primarily in local celebrations.<ref name=":8" /> In many places Juneteenth has become a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] holiday.{{sfn|Hume|Arceneaux|2008|p=158}} Traditions include public readings of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], singing traditional songs such as "[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]" and "[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]", and reading of works by noted [[Black studies|African-American writers]] such as [[Ralph Ellison]] and [[Maya Angelou]].<ref name=":8">Taylor, 2002. pp. 28–29.</ref> Celebrations include picnics, [[rodeo]]s, street fairs, cookouts, [[family reunion]]s, park parties, [[historical reenactment]]s, [[blues]] festivals and Miss Juneteenth contests.{{sfn|Knight|2011|p=}}{{sfn|Jaynes|2005|p=}}<ref name="moskin2004" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Nicole |date=June 13, 2017 |title=Hot Links and Red Drinks: The Rich Food Tradition of Juneteenth |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/dining/juneteenth-food-slavery-abolition.html |issn=0362-4331 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Acosta |first=Teresa Palomo |date=June 15, 2010 |title=Juneteenth |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lkj01 |access-date=June 5, 2020 |website=Texas Historical Society}}</ref> [[List of soft drink flavors|Strawberry soda]] is a traditional drink associated with the celebration.{{sfn|Jaynes|2005|p=}} The [[Mascogos]], the descendants of [[Black Seminoles]], who have resided in [[Coahuila]], [[Mexico]] since 1852, also celebrate Juneteenth.<ref name="El Universal">{{cite web |date=September 19, 2016|title=Mascogos.

Juneteenth celebrations often include lectures and exhibitions on African-American culture.{{sfn|Hume|Arceneaux|2008|p=156}} The modern holiday places much emphasis upon teaching about African-American heritage. Karen M. Thomas wrote in ''Emerge'' that "community leaders have latched on to [Juneteenth] to help instill a sense of heritage and pride in black youth." Celebrations are commonly accompanied by [[Voter registration in the United States|voter registration efforts]], the performing of plays, and retelling stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Karen M. |date=June 1993 |title=Texas: Juneteenth Day |journal=Emerge |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=31 }}</ref> The holiday is also a celebration of [[soul food]] and other food with African-American influences. In ''Tourism Review International'', Anne Donovan and Karen DeBres write that "Barbecue is the centerpiece of most Juneteenth celebrations".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Donovan |first1=Anne |last2=DeBres |first2=Karen |date=2006 |title=Foods of Freedom: Juneteenth as a Culinary Tourist Attraction |journal=Tourism Review International |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=379–389 |doi=10.3727/154427206776330562 }}</ref>
