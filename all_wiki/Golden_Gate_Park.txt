'''Golden Gate Park''', located in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]], is a large [[urban park]] consisting of {{convert|1017|acres}} of public grounds. It is administered by the [[San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department]], which began in 1871 to oversee the development of Golden Gate Park. Configured as a rectangle, it is similar in shape to but 20 percent larger than [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], to which it is often compared. It is over three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=out|disp=output only}}) long east to west, and about half a mile ({{convert|0.5|mi|abbr=out|1|disp=output only}}) north to south.<ref>{{Citation  | author=San Francisco Board of Park Commissioners | title=Third Biennial Report of the San Francisco Park Commissioners | year=1875 | page=55 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2MdAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA55 | location=San Francisco | publisher=Edward Bosqqui & Co. }}</ref> With 24 million visitors annually{{When|date=June 2020}}, Golden Gate is the third most-visited city park in the United States after Central Park and the Lincoln Memorial.<ref name="trust"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2018/8/22/17769694/golden-gate-park-trust-public-land-parkscore-2018|title=Golden Gate Park ranked third most popular park in US|first=Adam|last=Brinklow|work=Curbed SF|date=August 22, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

In the 1860s, San Franciscans began to feel the need for a spacious public park similar to [[Central Park]], which was then taking shape in [[New York City]]. Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the [[Outside Lands]], in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco's then-current borders. In 1865, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] proposed a plan for a park using native species suited for San Francisco's dry climate; however, the proposal was rejected in favor of a Central Park-style park needing extensive irrigation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-young-olmsted-drought-golden-gate-park-20150920-story.html |title=Op-Ed: The great park San Francisco needed — but rejected |first=Terence |last=Young |date=September 20, 2015 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the underlying purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. The tireless field engineer [[William Hammond Hall]] prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California's first state engineer and developed an integrated [[flood control]] system for the [[Sacramento Valley]]. The park drew its name from nearby [[Golden Gate]] Strait.

The plan and planting were developed by Hall and his assistant, [[John McLaren (gardener)|John McLaren]], who had apprenticed in Scotland, home of many of the 19th-century's best professional gardeners. John McLaren, when asked by the Park Commission if he could make Golden Gate Park "one of the beauty spots of the world," replied saying, "With your aid gentleman, and God be willing, that I shall do." He also promised that he'd "go out into the country and walk along a stream until he found a farm, and that he'd come back to the garden and recreate what nature had done."<ref name=":0" /> The initial plan called for grade separations of transverse roadways through the park, as [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] had provided for Central Park, but budget constraints and the positioning of the Arboretum and the Concourse ended the plan. In 1876, the plan was almost replaced by one for a racetrack, favored by "[[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|the Big Four]]" millionaires: [[Leland Stanford]], [[Mark Hopkins Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], [[Collis P. Huntington]], and [[Charles Crocker]]. Stanford, who was president of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], was also one of the owners of the Ocean Railroad Company, which ran from Haight Street across the park to its south border, then out to the beach and north to a point near Cliff House. It was Gus Mooney who claimed land adjacent to the park on Ocean Beach. Many of Mooney's friends also staked claims and built shanties on the beach to sell refreshments to the patrons of the park.  Hall resigned, and the remaining park commissioners followed. In 1882 Governor [[George C. Perkins]] appointed [[Frank M. Pixley]], founder and editor of [[The Argonaut]], to the board of commissioners of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Pixley was adamant that the Mooney's shanties be eliminated, and he found support with the San Francisco Police for park security. Pixley favored Stanford's company by granting a fifty-year lease on the route that closed the park on three sides to competition.<ref>John L. Levinsohn, "Frank Morrison Pixley of The Argonaut," The Book club of San Francisco, 1989.</ref> The original plan, however, was back on track by 1886, when [[streetcars]] delivered over 47,000 people to Golden Gate Park on one weekend afternoon (out of a population of 250,000 in the city).

[[File:John McLaren.jpg|thumb|left|[[John McLaren (park superintendent)|John McLaren]] served as superintendent of Golden Gate Park for 56 years.]]
The first stage of the park's development centered on planting trees in order to stabilize the dunes that covered three-quarters of the park's area. In order to transform the sand dunes into Greenland, John McLaren grew bent grass seeds obtained from France for two years. Once the seeds were grown, he planted them over the sand to hold the ground together. After this success, McLaren was able introduce new species of plants to the land, and is credited to have added over 700 new types of trees to California within the span of one year.<ref name=":12x">{{Cite book|title=The Immortal San Franciscans for Whom the Streets Were Named|last=Block|first=Eugene B.|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=1971}}</ref> By 1875, about 60,000 trees, mostly [[Eucalyptus globulus]], [[Monterey pine]], and [[Monterey cypress]], had been planted. By 1879, that figure more than doubled to 155,000 trees over {{convert|1000 |acre|abbr=on}}. Within his lifetime, McLaren is credited to have planted over two million trees within northern California as a whole. Another accomplishment of John McLaren is his creation of an open walking space along the Pacific shoreline on the western boundary of the park. Despite obstacles such as heavy tides and winds that carried sand inland towards the park, McLaren was able to build an [[esplanade]] by stacking thousands of tree boughs over the course of 20 years.<ref name=":12x" />

When he refused to retire at the customary age of 60 the San Francisco city government was bombarded with letters: when he reached 70, a charter amendment was passed to exempt him from forced retirement. On his 92nd birthday, two thousand San Franciscans attended a testimonial dinner that honored him as San Francisco's number one citizen. He lived in [[San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department|McLaren Lodge]] in Golden Gate Park until he died in 1943, aged 96. McLaren Avenue, <!-- San Francisco, CA 94121, --> in [[Sea Cliff, San Francisco, California|Sea Cliff]], near [[Lincoln Park (San Francisco)|Lincoln Park]] is named after him.<ref name=":12x" />

In 1903, a pair of Dutch-style [[windmill]]s were built at the extreme western end of the park. These pumped water throughout the park. The north windmill was restored to its original appearance in 1981 and is adjacent to Queen Wilhelmina tulip garden, a gift of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.golden-gate-park.com/queen-wilhelmina-tulip-garden.html |title=Queen Wilhelmina Tulip Garden |website=Golden Gate Park.com |access-date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> These are planted with [[tulip]] [[bulb]]s for winter display and other flowers in appropriate seasons. The Murphy Windmill in the southwest corner of the park was restored in September 2011.

=== 1906 earthquake relief ===
After the earthquake shook San Francisco in 1906, Golden Gate Park became a site of refuge for many who found themselves without shelter. The undeveloped Outside Lands became a prime location to house these masses of people, and "earthquake shacks" popped up all throughout the area. Of the 26 official homeless encampments in the Golden Gate Park region, 21 were under the control of the United States Army.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/1906-earthquake-relief-efforts-living-accommodations.htm|title=1906 Earthquake: Refugee Camps – Presidio of San Francisco (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-05}}</ref>

The United States Army was able to house 20,000 people in military style encampments, and 16,000 of the 20,000 refugees were living at the Presidio.<ref name=":02" /> Within the Presidio were four major encampments including a camp exclusively for Chinese immigrants.<ref name=":02" /> Despite being simple lodgings the army organized 3,000 tents into a geometric grid complete with streets and addresses.<ref name=":02" />  "The Army constructed a virtual town with large residential barracks [with temporary] tented housing, latrines and bathhouses, laundries, and other services."

Not only was the standard of military organization high, but the social organization was also up to an acceptable standard despite the aftermath of the earthquake and fires. Reports indicate that small communities formed within the tent neighborhoods. The children of the refugees established play areas, and the adults congregated in the mess halls to socialize.<ref name=":02" />

Finally, in June 1906, the Presidio tent camps were shut down. To replace these tents the city of San Francisco built more permanent living quarters. As mentioned earlier these earthquake shacks were built to house those still homeless after the earthquake and subsequent fires. Army Union carpenters built these shacks, and residents paid off the cost of construction at a rate of two dollars a month for twenty-five months.<ref name=":02" />

The camps mostly catered to persons who were unable to find any other accommodations away from the city or were "not capable of self support or who had no relatives to take care of them". The refugee camps at Golden Gate Park were primarily used as an interim location while the Ingleside horse stables were renovated to house human tenants. The relief camps in the park were eventually phased out as the city recovered, but select buildings remain today.

===Later years===
During the Great Depression, the San Francisco Parks and Recreation Department ran out of public funds. Thus, the duties of the department were transferred to the [[Works Progress Administration|Works Progress Administration (WPA)]], a government program designed to provide employment and community improvements during the economic woes of the 1930s. Within the park, the WPA is responsible for the creation of several features such as the Arboretum, the archery field, and the model yacht club. In addition, the WPA reconstructed 13 miles of roads throughout the park and the built the San Francisco Police Department's horse stables. Another WPA contribution, Anglers Lodge and the adjoining fly casting pools, is still in use today. It is home to the Golden Gate Angling & Casting Club (formerly known as the San Francisco Fly Casting Club). The horseshoe pits were also entirely created by WPA employees.<ref name="FoundSF">{{cite web|last1=Keegan|first1=Timothy|title=W.P.A.

Most of the water used for landscape watering and for various water features is now{{When|date=January 2015}} provided by groundwater from the city's Westside Basin Aquifer.<ref name=westside>{{cite news | url=http://cityparksurvey.tpl.org/reports/report_display.asp?rid=27 | publisher=San Francisco Public Utilities Commission | title=Groundwater | year=2011 | access-date=March 4, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003753/http://cityparksurvey.tpl.org/reports/report_display.asp?rid=27 | archive-date=December 3, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In the 1950s, the use of this effluent during cold weather caused some consternation, with the introduction of artificial [[detergent]]s but before the advent of modern biodegradable products. These "hard" detergents would cause long-lasting billowing piles of foam to form on the creeks connecting the artificial lakes and could even be blown onto the roads, forming a traffic hazard.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}

A sliver of park at the far east end of Golden Gate Park, the [[Panhandle (San Francisco)|Panhandle]], lies north of [[Haight-Ashbury]], and it was the site of the [[Human Be-In]] of 1967, preceding the [[Summer of Love]].

==Music Concourse area==
[[File:Golden Gate Park - Spreckels Temple of Music 02.jpg|thumb|right|Spreckels Temple of Music on the [[Music Concourse]].]]
{{main|Music Concourse}}
The [[Music Concourse]] is a sunken, oval-shaped open-air plaza originally excavated for the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894]]. Its focal point is the Spreckels Temple of Music, also called the "Bandshell," where numerous music performances have been staged. During the fall, spring, and summer seasons, various food trucks are often parked behind the Bandshell, providing local food options to visitors of the Music Concourse. Parkwide bicycle and surrey rentals are also available behind the bandshell and at Haight and Stanyan on the east edge of Golden Gate Park. The area also includes a number of statues of various historic figures, four fountains, and a regular grid array of heavily [[pollarded]] trees. Since 2003, the Music Concourse has undergone a series of improvements to include an underground 800-car parking garage and pedestrianization of the plaza itself. It is surrounded by various cultural attractions, including:

===De Young Museum===
{{Main|De Young (museum)}}
[[File:M. H. de Young Memorial Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The new [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] opened in 2005.|189x189px]]
[[File:De Young Museum at Night 2015.jpg|thumb|The [[De Young (museum)|De Young Museum]] photographed on a foggy night in 2015. |245x245px]]
Named after [[M. H. de Young]], the [[San Francisco]] newspaper magnate, the [[De Young Museum]] is a fine arts museum that was opened in January 1921. Its original building, the Fine Arts Building, was part of the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894|1894 Midwinter Exposition]], of which Mr. de Young was the director. The Fine Arts Building featured several artists, twenty-eight of whom were female. One of these revolutionaries was [[Helen Hyde]], who is featured in the De Young Museum today. Once the fair ended, the Egyptian-styled building remained open "brimful and running over with art."  Most of these pieces were paintings and sculptures purchased by De Young himself, and others were donations of household antiques from the older community, which were "more sentimental than artistic." By 1916, the Fine Arts Building's collection had grown to 1,000,000 items, and a more suitable museum was necessary.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Golden Gate: The Park of a Thousand Vistas|last = Wilson|first = Katherine|publisher = The Caxton Printers|year = 1950|location = Caldwell, Idaho|pages = 52–58}}</ref>

Construction to build a new museum began in 1917. With funds donated by De Young, and [[Louis Christian Mullgardt|Louis Mullgardt]] as head architect, the De Young Museum was completed in 1921 in a "sixteenth century [[Spanish Renaissance]] design, with pale salmon colored façades that were burdened with rococo ornamentation." At its center was a 134-foot tower from which its wings extended. At the entrance was the Pool of Enchantment, which consisted of the sculptured Indian boys created by [[Melvin Earl Cummings|M. Earl Cummings]]. The museum contained four wings: the East Wing (featuring ever-changing paintings, sculptures and photography by artists such as [[Vincent van Gogh|Vincent Van Gogh]]); the Central Wing (famous American and European work); the Northeast wing (Asian collections); and the West Wing (artistic history of San Francisco).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = San Francisco|last = Work Projects|first = Administration|publisher = Hastings House Publishing|year = 1947|location = New York, New York|pages = 338–342}}</ref>

The original De Young Memorial Museum stood for most of the twentieth century, until 2001 when it was completely rebuilt, reopening in 2005. The head-architects, [[Herzog & de Meuron|Jacques Herzog]] and [[Herzog & de Meuron|Pierre de Meuron]], when asked on their design, said they wanted to create a place "where the art would be less hierarchically presented – more like contemporary art than like bijoux."<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title = Architect: The Work of the Pritzker Prize Laureates in Their Own Words|last = Petalson|first = Ruth|publisher = Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers|year = 2010|location = New York, New York|pages = 118–121}}</ref> The building is mostly constructed of copper, and its unique design was created with the idea that the "building would be enhanced not only by sunlight but also by San Francisco's constant fog."<ref name=":5" /> Since the opening of the De Young in 1921, its galleries have mostly changed, but some of the art originally featured during the fair and in the early twentieth century still exists in the museum today. The galleries of [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Asian art]] have since been relocated, but the De Young still features American art, Modern art, African art, textiles and sculptures, and special alternating exhibitions.

The California Academy of Sciences was founded in 1853, just three years after California was made a state, making it the oldest scientific institution in the western United States. Evolutionist [[Charles Darwin]] corresponded on the initial organization of the early institution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = San Francisco's Golden Gate Park|last = Pollock|first = Christopher|publisher = Graphic Arts Center Publishing Company|year = 2001|location = Portland, Oregon|pages = 59–61}}</ref> The original museum consisted of eleven buildings built between 1916 and 1976 located on the former site of the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894|1894 Midwinter Fair]]'s Mechanical Arts Building in Golden Gate Park.<ref name=":8" /> The structure was largely destroyed in the 1989 earthquake and just three of the original buildings were conserved for the new construction: the African Hall, the North American Hall, and the [[Steinhart Aquarium]].<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title = Renzo Piano Building Workshop – Projects – By Type – California Academy of Sciences|url = http://www.rpbw.com/project/68/california-academy-of-sciences/|website = www.rpbw.com|access-date = 2015-11-24|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151125123724/http://www.rpbw.com/project/68/california-academy-of-sciences/|archive-date = November 25, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The new building opened in 2008 at the same location in the park.

The academy also contains a 2.5-acre living roof with almost 1.7 million native California plants<ref name=":2" /> and domes that cover the planetarium and rainforest exhibitions. The soil of the roof is six inches deep, which reduces storm water runoff by more than 90%<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title = Designing Our Future: Sustainable Landscapes|url = http://www.asla.org/sustainablelandscapes/cas.html|website = www.asla.org|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref> and naturally cools the interior of the museum, thereby reducing the need for air-conditioning. The glass panels of the living roof also contain cells that collect more than 5% of the electricity needed to power the museum.<ref name=":8" /> Due to its eco-friendly materials and natural sources of energy, the California Academy of Sciences has been named the country's only LEED-platinum certified museum, granted by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]].<ref name=":2" />

===Japanese Tea Garden===
{{Main|Japanese Tea Garden (San Francisco)}}The [[Japanese Tea Garden (San Francisco)|Japanese Tea Garden]] is the oldest public Japanese garden in the United States and occupies five of the 1,017 acres (412 ha) of the Golden Gate Park.[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-15|<sup>[15]</sup>]] It currently stands adjacent to the [[De Young (museum)|de Young Museum]] and is rumored as the site of introduction for the [[fortune cookie]] to America.[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-17|<sup>[17]</sup>]]

George Turner Marsh, an Australian immigrant, originally created the garden as a "Japanese Village" exhibit for the [[California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894|1894 Midwinter Exposition]].<ref name=":14">James R. Smith, "California Midwinter International Exposition-1894," from San Francisco's Lost Landmarks (Word Dancer Press, 2005): pp.111–126</ref> Following the fair, a handshake agreement with John McLaren would allow Japanese Horticulturalist Makoto Hagiwara to take over the garden. Hagiwara would oversee modifications in the Garden's transition from a temporary exhibit to a permanent installment within the park. Hagiwara and his family would continue to occupy the garden, maintaining the landscape and design of the garden until 1942.<ref name=":13x">{{Cite book|title=San Francisco's Golden Gate Park: A Thousand and Seventeen Acres of Stories|last=Pollock|first=Christopher|publisher=West Winds Press|year=2001|pages=76}}</ref>

Hagiwara himself died in 1925, leaving the garden in the hands of his daughter, Takano Hagiwara, and her children. They lived there until 1942 when they were evicted from the gardens and forced into internment camps by way of [[Executive Order 9066]]. During World War II, anti-Japanese sentiment led to the renaming of the garden as the "Oriental Tea Garden." After the war, a letter-writing campaign enabled the garden to be formally reinstated as the Japanese Tea Garden in 1952.<ref name=":13x" /> In January 1953, "a classical Zen garden was added to the Tea Garden" as well as the Lantern of Peace. The Lantern of Peace, weighing 9,000 pounds and currently in the Japanese Tea Garden, was a gift from the Japanese Government as a way to mend the relationship between the U.S and Japan that was damaged from World War II.<ref name=":13x" /> In addition, a plaque, designed by [[Ruth Asawa]], now stands at the entrance of the gardens as a tribute meant to honor Hagiwara and his family for their care-taking of the gardens.<ref name=":14" /> The garden also still has features such as the Drum Bridge and the [[Tea house|Tea House]] from the Midwinter Exposition.[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-16|<sup>[16]</sup>]]

As is typical among Japanese style tea gardens, the Golden Gate Park's tea garden has it own stepping stone pathways, stone lanterns, and variety of plants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Japanese Tea Garden|last=Keane|first=Marc P.|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=2009|pages=201–236}}</ref> In the mix there are dwarf trees, bamboo, and azaleas adorning the gardens.

The Japanese Tea Garden serves as a spot of tranquility in the middle of the various activities that take place at the Golden Gate Park[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-18|<sup>[18]</sup>]] and provides visitors "a place in which it is possible to be at one with nature, its rhythms, and changing beauties."[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-19|<sup>[19]</sup>]] The Japanese Tea Garden brings in more than $1 million to the Golden Gate Park and the city annually. There is a constant debate concerning whether or not changes should be made to the garden. Adding souvenir shops and a diversity of food options at the garden historically brings in more money to the organization monitoring the Golden Gate Park, the Recreation and Park Commission. Selling products that share knowledge about Japanese gardens and culture also helps maintain the Japanese Tea Garden's authenticity.[[Golden Gate Park#cite note-20|<sup>[20]</sup>]]

==== History ====
[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Conservatory of Flowers]] opened in 1879.]]

The Conservatory of Flowers opened in 1879 and stands today as the oldest building in Golden Gate Park.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|title = Conservatory of Flowers {{!}} San Francisco Recreation and Park|url = http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/conservatory-of-flowers/|website = sfrecpark.org|access-date = 2015-11-30}}</ref> The Conservatory of Flowers is one of the largest conservatories in the US, as well as one of few large Victorian greenhouses in the United States.<ref name="wmf.org">{{Cite web|title = Golden Gate Park Conservatory of Flowers {{!}} World Monuments Fund|url = https://www.wmf.org/project/golden-gate-park-conservatory-flowers|website = www.wmf.org|access-date = 2015-11-30}}</ref> Built of traditional wood and glass panes, the Conservatory stands at 12,000 square feet<ref name="sfparksalliance.org">{{Cite web|title = Conservatory of Flowers {{!}} San Francisco Parks Alliance|url = http://www.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/conservatory-flowers|website = www.sfparksalliance.org|access-date = 2015-11-30}}</ref> and houses 1,700 species of tropical, rare and aquatic plants.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Though it wasn't originally constructed, William Hammond Hall included the idea of a conservatory in his original concept for the design of the park.<ref name="wmf.org"/> The idea was later realized with the help of twenty-seven of the wealthiest business owners in San Francisco.<ref name="sfparksalliance.org"/>

In 1883, a boiler exploded and the main dome caught fire. A restoration was undertaken by Southern Pacific magnate Charles Crocker. It survived the earthquake of 1906, only to suffer another fire in 1918. In 1933 it was declared unsound and closed to the public, only to be reopened in 1946. In 1995, after a severe storm with {{convert|100|mph|0|abbr=on}} winds damaged the structure, shattering 40% of the glass, the conservatory had to be closed again. It was cautiously dissected for repairs and finally reopened in September 2003.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}

=== Windmills ===
{{main|Golden Gate Park windmills}}
[[File:The North Windmill.jpeg|left|frameless|220x220px|North Windmill in Golden Gate Park.]]
Before the construction of the windmills, Golden Gate Park was paying the Spring Valley Water Works up to 40 cents per 1000 gallons of water.<ref name="Pamphlets on Silviculture">{{Cite book|title = Pamphlets on Silviculture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W8JDAAAAIAAJ|date = 1912-01-01}}</ref> To avoid this expense the North (Dutch) Windmill was commissioned in 1902 when Superintendent John McLaren deemed the Park's pumping plant insufficient to supply the additional water essential to the life of the Park. A survey and inspection of the vast area west of Strawberry Hill revealed a large flow of water toward the ocean. The North windmill was constructed to reclaim the drainage towards the Pacific Ocean and direct fresh well water back into the park.<ref name="Pamphlets on Silviculture"/> Alpheus Bull Jr., a prominent San Franciscan, designed the North Windmill. The Fulton Engineering Company received the bid for the ironwork, and Pope and Talbot Lumber Company donated sails ("spars") of Oregon pine. The North Windmill was installed, standing 75 feet tall with 102 foot long sails. The Windmill pumps water up an elevation of 200 feet with a capacity of 30,000 gallons of water per pump per hour, supplying and replenishing Lloyd Lake, Metson Lake, Spreckels Lake and Lincoln Park.<ref name="Windmill">{{Cite web

Samuel G Murphy provided from his own means, $20,000 to erect the windmill. The South Windmill (Murphy Windmill) stands as the largest in the world, having the longest sails in the world, since its construction, with the ability to lift 40,000 gallons of water per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== Carousel ===
[[File:Golden Gate Park carousel 01.jpg|thumb|The carousel building in Golden Gate Park.]]An ornate [[carousel]] displaying a [[bestiary]] is housed in a circular building near the children's playground. The carousel was built in 1914 by the Herschell-Spillman Company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Gate Park Carousel|url=http://www.golden-gate-park.com/golden-gate-park-carousel.html |website=Golden Gate Park.com |access-date=January 15, 2015}}</ref> The building was occupied by three previous carousels before the current attraction was purchased by [[Herbert Fleishhacker]] from the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in 1941. The 1914 carousel has undergone several major renovations, the first, a transition from steam to electric power with the assistance of the [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]] Company.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Koret Playground & Carousel {{!}} San Francisco Recreation and Park|url = http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/koret-childrens-quarter/|website = sfrecpark.org|access-date = 2015-12-02}}</ref> In 1977 the carousel closed for safety concerns and The San Francisco Arts Commission hired local artist Ruby Newman to oversee the artistic restoration. Her crew of craftspeople restored the badly deteriorated carousel and she hand painted all animals, chariots, and decorative housing (she holds the copyright). The carousel was re-opened in 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ruby Newman Fine Arts Studio|url = http://www.rubynewman.com/main/carousel.html|website = www.rubynewman.com|access-date = 2015-12-02}}</ref> Presently, the carousel includes sixty two animals, a German Band Organ, and painted landscapes of the bay area by Ruby Newman.

Encompassing the carousel is the Koret Playground, originally the Children's Quarters, which was envisioned to be a primary feature in the Golden Gate Park's beginnings. Funded by Senator William Sharon, the facility was finished in 1888, and designated a recreational space for children and their mothers.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Papers of Frederick Law Olmsted: The Last Great Projects, 1890–1895|last = Olmsted|first = Frederick|publisher =JHU Press |date=20 January 2015 |isbn =978-1-4214-1603-8 |page =316 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gq5BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA446}}</ref> At the time, it was the first public children's playground in the United States; offering swings, indoor enclosures, open sitting areas and the original carousel to community youth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = San Francisco Landmarks|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dVlNARtSe-AC&pg=PA79|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9780738595801|first = Catherine|last = Accardi}}</ref> In 2007, the [[Koret Foundation]] funded renovations.{{Cn|date=July 2020}}

[[File:Crepuscular rays in ggp 2.jpg|thumb|right|Stow Lake, the largest of the manmade lakes in Golden Gate Park, offers boat rentals.]]

'''Stow Lake''' surrounds the prominent [[Strawberry Hill (San Francisco)|Strawberry Hill]], now an island with an electrically pumped [[waterfall]]. The lake was named for W.W. Stow who gave $60,000 for its construction. Strawberry Hills' waterfall was named Huntington Falls after its benefactor Collis P. Huntington. Stow was the first artificial lake constructed in the park and Huntington was the park's first artificial waterfall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aikman|first1=Tom Girvan|title=Boss Gardener The Life and Times of John McLaren|date=1988|publisher=Don't Call It Frisco Press|isbn=0-917583-18-3|pages=58, 59|edition=1st}}</ref> The falls are fed by a reservoir located atop Strawberry Hill. Water is pumped into the reservoir from Elk Glen Lake, the South Windmill, wells, and the city's water supply to keep the system of lakes flowing eastward from Stow.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite book|last1=Mallick|first1=George J.|title=The Artificial Lakes of the Golden Gate Park, the Water Reclamation Plant, and the Auxiliary Water Sources: The Existing Irrigation System|date=1973|pages=31}}</ref>

Rowboats and pedalboats can be rented at the boathouse. Much of the western portion of San Francisco can be seen from the top of this hill. The reservoir at its top also supplies a network of high-pressure water mains that exclusively supply specialized fire hydrants throughout the city. The lake itself also serves as a reservoir from which water is pumped to irrigate the rest of the park should other pumps stop operating.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
In the past the Hill was also topped by Sweeny Observatory, but the building was ruined by the 1906 earthquake and plans to replace it were not approved by park commissioners.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pollock|first1=Christopher|title=Golden Gate Park: San Francisco's Urban Oasis in Vintage Postcards|date=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0-7385-2853-6|pages=62, 121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rel1swFUAAoC&q=observatory&pg=PP1|access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref>

Two bridges connect the inner island to the surrounding mainland: the Roman Bridge and the Stone (or Rustic) Bridge.

'''Spreckels Lake / model boat facility'''
{{Main|Spreckels Lake}}
[[File:ModelYachtUpwind5861.jpg|thumb|150px|right|San Francisco Model Yacht Club boat on Spreckels Lake.]]
Spreckels Lake is an artificial [[reservoir]] behind a small [[Embankment dam|earthen dam]] that lies on the north side of the Golden Gate Park between Spreckels Lake Drive and Fulton Street to the north, and John F. Kennedy Drive to the south and named after sugar-fortune heir and then San Francisco Parks Commissioner [[Adolph B. Spreckels]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Press Reference Library (Southwest Edition): Notables of the Southwest | chapter=Adolph B.

One can usually find both [[Model yachting#Sail.E2.80.93driven yachts|'sail driven,' self-guided Yachts]] and electric or gas/nitro powered [[Radio-controlled boat|radio-controlled model boats]] of many types and designs plying the lake's waters most times of year.

'''Elk Glen Lake''' is the park's deepest ornamental lake, measuring over 6&nbsp;ft. deep on average. The lake acts as a reservoir for water from the Reclamation Plant before it is pumped to either Stow Lake or the reservoir atop Strawberry Hill.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite book|last1=Mallick|first1=George J.|title=The Artificial Lakes of the Golden Gate Park, the Water Reclamation Plant, and the Auxiliary Water Sources: The Existing Irrigation System|date=1973|pages=32}}</ref>

'''Mallard Lake''' is landlocked and not a part of the park's irrigation system.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

'''Metson Lake''' lies west of Mallard Lake and east of the Chain of Lakes. This body of water has a capacity of over 1.1 million gallons that overflow into South Lake or can be redirected elsewhere for irrigation purposes.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

'''Chain of Lakes'''
Many naturalistically landscaped lakes are placed throughout the park: several are linked together into chains, with pumped water creating flowing creeks. Out of the original 14 natural marshy lakes within the sand dunes Golden Gate Park was built in, only 5 remain, three of which are the Chain of Lakes. The three lakes, North, Middle, and South Lake, are located along the Chain of Lakes Drive.

'''North Lake''' is the largest of the three, and is known for its water birds that often live on the small islands within the lake.<ref name="Golden Gate Park Lakes">{{Cite web|title = Golden Gate Park Lakes|url = https://goldengatepark.com/golden-gate-park-lakes.html|website = Golden Gate Park|access-date = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}</ref> Some of the birds spotted are [[egret]]s, belted kingfishers, [[duck]]s, and [[great blue heron]]s. It is surrounded by a paved walkway that is often used by families, joggers, and dog walkers.<ref name="sfrecpark.org">{{Cite web|title = Chain of Lakes {{!}} San Francisco Recreation and Park|url = http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/chain-of-lakes/|website = sfrecpark.org|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref>

In 1898, [[John McLaren (horticulturist)|McLaren]] started a landscaping project, inspired by Andrew Jackson Downing's teachings on building with nature. Seven islands were planted within the North Lake in 1899, using different species of shrubs and trees. A gazebo was built, and wooden footbridges were used to connect the different islands within the lake. Both the gazebo and the bridges were removed in order to conserve nesting birds on the islands.<ref>{{Cite book|title = San Francisco's Golden Gate Park: A Thousand and Seventeen Acres of Stories.|last = Katz|first = Erica|publisher = Westwiinds Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-1558685451|location = Portland, Oregon|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/sanfranciscosgol0000poll}}</ref>
North Lake is the final of the Chain of Lakes that flow into each other south to north, making it the final destination of the lakes' water pumped in from the Water Reclamation Plant. Should the plant's water not meet the lake's needs the water level is maintained by well water pumped from the North Windmill.

[[File:San Francisco Bison.jpg|thumb|Bison Paddock, Golden Gate Park]]

'''Middle Lake''' is particularly known for bird-watching due to the visits of migrant species of birds like [[tanager]]s, [[warbler]]s and [[vireo]]s. It is surrounded by a dirt trail and vegetation.<ref name="sfrecpark.org"/> The lake resembles the [[marsh]]es that existed before Golden Gate Park, and is known for being a more remote and romantic setting.<ref name="Golden Gate Park Lakes"/>

'''South Lake''' is the smallest of the three lakes, and borders Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.<ref name="Golden Gate Park Lakes"/>  This lake is the smallest in the Chain of Lakes. Its water is sourced from either a direct flow from Metson Lake, or by Stow Lake water released by a valve. It does not contribute to irrigation in the park but it does feed into Middle Lake. Its only noteworthy bird population is its ducks.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

===Bison Paddock===
[[American bison|Bison]] (''Bison bison'') have been kept in Golden Gate Park since 1891, when a small herd was purchased by the park commission.<ref>{{cite web | first=David |last=Gardner | title=Bison Paddock | url=http://www.lightight.com/GGP/act_images/Act1P07.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122232954/http://www.lightight.com/GGP/act_images/Act1P07.html| publisher=Lightight Photography | date=September 16, 2003 | archive-date=2007-11-22 | access-date=January 5, 2011}}</ref> At the time, the animal's population in North America had dwindled to an all-time low, and San Francisco made a successful effort to breed them in captivity. In 1899, the paddock in the western section of the park was created. At its peak and through a successful captive breeding program, more than 100 calves were produced at Golden Gate Park, helping preserve the iconic bison population numbers in North America, which has been critical to the culture and livelihood of Native Americans.

In 1984, Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]]'s husband, [[Richard C. Blum]], purchased a new herd as a birthday present for his wife.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-24/news/mn-791_1_golden-gate-park |title=Where Buffalo Roam : Bison, With Names Like King Lear and Lady Macbeth, Have Home in Golden Gate Park |last=Morain |first=Dan |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 24, 1991 |access-date=January 28, 2015 }}</ref> The older bison in the paddock today are descendants of this herd.

=== Hippie Hill ===
[[File:Hippie Hill.JPG|thumb|217x217px|Peace Sign drawn on a walkway at Hippie Hill]]
Nestled in the trees between the [[Conservatory of Flowers]] and [[Haight Street]], '''Hippie Hill''' displays a lifestyle unique to [[San Francisco]]. East of the Golden Gate Park tennis courts, the green space known as Hippie Hill is a gentle sloping lawn just off of Kezar Drive and overlooking Robin Williams Meadow,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Robin Williams Meadow sign unveiled in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park |url=https://abc7news.com/society/watch-live-robin-williams-meadow-sign-unveiled-in-golden-gate-park/4245959/ |work=ABC 7 News |location=San Francisco, CA |date=September 14, 2018 |access-date=September 20, 2018 }}</ref> with Eucalyptus and Oak on either side.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Summer of Love: Haight-Ashbury at Its Highest|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=acPHXpbzQ_AC|publisher = John Libbey Eurotext|date = 1995-01-01|isbn = 9780867194210|first = Gene|last = Anthony}}</ref> Additionally, the hill contains several uncommon trees: coast banksia, [[Alectryon excelsus|titoki]], turpentine, and [[Campsis radicans|cow-itch]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Trees of Golden Gate Park and San Francisco|last=McClintock|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Publishers Press|year=2001|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=191}}</ref>

Hippie Hill has been a part of San Francisco's history, namely the [[Summer of Love]], in 1967, a large counterculture movement that partially took place on the hill. With its close proximity to Haight Street, the main site of the Summer of Love, the movement often overflowed onto the hill. During this era, people gathered in the area to connect with one another through many activities, including the playing of music, consumption of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Marijuana (word)|marijuana]], and expression of [[hippie]] ideals. With time, area residents began to complain of the flower children's open sexuality, nude dancing, panhandling, and excess litter.<ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=San Francisco's Golden Gate Park: A Thousand and Seventeen Acres of Stories|last=Pollock|first=Christopher|publisher=West Winds Press|pages=36}}</ref>

Through this movement, music became to have its own history on the hill as well. Musicians and bands such as [[Janis Joplin]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[George Harrison]] all played free shows for the public near by.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Haight: Love, Rock, And Revolution|last=Selvin|first=Joel|publisher=Insight Editions|year=2014|location=San Rafael, California|pages=38, 70, 106}}</ref> Today, improvised drum circles form on the weekends where people come together and fill the hill with a constant beat for hours on end.<ref name=":13" /> A space filled with their culture, the hill played a major part in the hippies' ability to openly use drugs and express themselves as the police adopted a policy of looking the other way.<ref name=":92">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Golden-Gate-Park-4-20-pot-festivities-a-hit-with-5416678.php|title=Golden Gate Park 4/20 Pot Festivities A Hit With Happy Horde|website=SFGate|access-date=2015-11-19}}</ref>

Though the police have been known to crack down on certain occurrences in the park, the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]] are lenient with activity on the hill.<ref name=":13" /> Starting from the Summer of Love when the police were unable to address the enormity of the situation, some activity is overlooked.<ref name=":13"/> As supervisor [[London Breed]] stated, "smoking anything in any city park is illegal, but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events."<ref name=":92" /> The police department has stated that they are not naïve enough to attempt to catch all the people smoking marijuana on the hill, but as Police Chief Greg Suhr said, "There are plenty of other things that come with it that we will not have."<ref>{{Cite web|title = 'Hippie Hill' Crackdown Expected At SF's Golden Gate Park, 4/20 Festivities|url = http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/16/hippie-hill-crackdown-expected-at-sfs-golden-gate-park-420-festivities/|access-date = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

=== Plants ===
A diverse collection of plants, from all over the world, can be found in Golden Gate Park. Acacias, like the [[Sydney golden wattle]] from Australia, were some of the first planted in the park by William Hammond Hall to stabilize the sand dunes. They still play that role in the western portion of the park and are common all around the park.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClintock|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Trees of Golden Gate Park and San Francisco|date=2001|publisher=Heyday Books|location=Berkeley, California|pages=25–27}}</ref>

While ninety-six percent of the park is considered not a natural area, four out of the thirty-two San Francisco locations designated as natural areas by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department's Natural Areas Program are found in Golden Gate Park. These are the Oak Woodlands, the Lily Pond, Strawberry Hill, and Whiskey Hill.<ref>{{cite web|title=Natural Resources Management Plan|url=http://sfrecpark.org/wpcontent/uploads/SNRAMP_LocationMap.pdf|website=San Francisco Recreation and Parks|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Natural Areas FAQs|url=http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/natural-areas-program/natural-areas-faqs/|website=San Francisco Recreation and Parks|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref>

The [[California live oak]] is the only tree native to the park.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClintock|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Trees of Golden Gate Park and San Francisco|date=2001|publisher=Heyday Books|location=Berkeley, California|pages=176–177}}</ref> Some of the oldest plants in the park are the coast live oaks in the Oak Woodlands in the northeastern portion of the park which are hundreds of years old.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Maloof|first1=Joan|title=CA: Oak Woodlands of Golden Gate Park|url=http://www.oldgrowthforest.net/oak-woodlands-of-golden-gate-park|website=Old-Growth Forest Network|access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nature in the City: San Francisco's Natural Heritage|url=http://sfrecpark.org/wp-content/uploads/nature_in_city_map.pdf|website=San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department}}</ref> Oaks also grow on Strawberry Hill and in the AIDS Memorial Grove.

Other than the oak trees, the plants that are currently in the park are non-native, some of which are considered invasive species. Many have disrupted the ecosystem and harm birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects in the park. Volunteers with the Strawberry Hill Butterfly Habitat Restoration Project are removing and replacing invasive plant species to help restore the butterfly population on Strawberry Hill. Under the Significant Natural Resource Areas Management Plan, the city will remove many invasive species and replace them with native plants.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beatley|first1=Timothy|title=Handbook of Biophilic City Planning & Design|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|page=109}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Forestry Restoration|url=http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/natural-areas-program/forestry-restoration/|website=San Francisco Recreation and Parks|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Holt|first1=Tim|title=Special attention for Golden Gate Park butterflies|url=http://www.sfgate.com/outdoors/article/Special-attention-for-Golden-Gate-Park-butterflies-4965860.php|website=SFGate|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref>

[[Eucalyptus globulus|Blue gum eucalyptus]], [[Monterey pine]], and [[Monterey cypress]] were the most commonly planted trees in the park during the late 1800s. Blue gum continued to grow and spread and is now one of the most important trees found in the park. They can be found near McClaren Lodge, on Hippie Hill, and in a eucalyptus forest near Middle Lake. Monterey pines are also prevalent today and can found in the Strybing Arboretum, the Japanese Tea Garden, and in the western portions of the park around the Buffalo Paddock.<ref name="Heyday Books">{{cite book|last1=McClintock|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Trees of Golden Gate Park and San Francisco|date=2001|publisher=Heyday Books|location=Berkeley, California|pages=75–76,89,156–157}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chain of Lakes|url=http://sfrecpark.org/destination/golden-gate-park/chain-of-lakes/|website=San Francisco Recreation and Parks|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref>

[[Redwoods]] were planted in the park during the 1880s and can be found all around the park, most notably in Heroes Grove, Redwood Memorial Grove, AIDS Memorial Grove, Stanyan Meadows, on top of Hippie Hill, and in the Panhandle.<ref name="Heyday Books"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Redwoods: The Original San Francisco Giants|url=https://www.sfbotanicalgarden.org/garden/redwoods-2012.html|website=San Francisco Botanical Garden|access-date=28 November 2017}}</ref>

It is a tribute to William Shakespeare and his works, decorated with flowers and plants that are mentioned in his plays. The entrance is an ornate metal gate that says "Shakespeare Garden" intertwined with vines. Directly past the entrance is a walkway overarched with trees and lined with small flowers and a sundial in the center. The main area has a large moss tree and benches. At the end of the garden there is a wooden padlocked shelf containing a bust of William Shakespeare himself. The cast was made and given to the garden by George Bullock in 1918 and has remained behind locked doors since around 1950 to prevent people from cutting off pieces of the statue to melt down.<ref name="Garden of Shakespeare's Flowers">{{Cite web|title = Garden of Shakespeare's Flowers|url = https://goldengatepark.com/garden-of-shakespeares-flowers.html|website = Golden Gate Park|access-date = 2015-11-19|language = en-US}}</ref> Around the bust, there are four plaques, originally six, with quotes from Shakespeare.

== Sports and recreation ==
Golden Gate park contains many areas for sports and recreation including tennis courts, soccer fields, baseball fields, lawn bowling fields, an angling and casting club, a disc golf course, horseshoe pits, an archery range, the polo field, and Kezar Stadium. Golden Gate park formed the first Lawn Bowling Club in the United States in 1901, with an Edwardian style clubhouse constructed in 1915.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 13 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Golden Gate Park|url = https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/san-francisco/things-you-didn-t-know-about-golden-gate-park-sf|website = thrillist|access-date = 2015-12-03}}</ref>

=== Kezar Stadium ===
{{Main|Kezar Stadium}}

[[Kezar Stadium]] was built between 1922 and 1925 in the southeast corner of the park. It has hosted various athletic competitions throughout its existence. It served as the home stadium of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] of the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] and [[NFL]] from 1946 to 1970, and for one season in 1960, it hosted the [[Oakland Raiders]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]] 
[[File:Renovated Kezar Stadium.jpg|right|thumb|Kezar Stadium was home to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] from 1946 to 1970.]]
The old 59,000-seat stadium was demolished in 1989 and replaced with a modern 9,044-seat stadium, which includes a replica of the original concrete arch at the entryway.

The stadium has been used in recent years for soccer, lacrosse, and track and field. The stadium also holds the annual city high school football championship, the Turkey Bowl. The Turkey Bowl dates back to 1924 and is played each Thanksgiving. The game was held at Lowell High School in 2014 because Kezar was closed due to renovation of the running track. [[Galileo High School]] has the most overall wins in the game (16) after breaking [[Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California)|Lincoln High School]]'s record four-game winning streak in 2009.<ref name=":6">{{cite news|last = Drumwright|first = Steve|date = November 27, 2008|title = Turkey Day game to decide San Francisco high school football champion|newspaper = [[The San Francisco Examiner]]}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{cite news |date = November 26, 2009|last = Winegarner|first = Beth|title = Galileo defeats Lincoln 35-0|url = http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/galileo-defeats-lincoln-35-0/Content?oid=213966|newspaper = [[The San Francisco Examiner]]|access-date = January 25, 2015}}</ref>

The stadium also hosts the football game in the three-part [[Bruce-Mahoney Trophy]] competition between [[Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory]] and [[Saint Ignatius College Preparatory]], two [[Catholic]] [[high schools]] in San Francisco, in addition to serving as the home field for Sacred Heart Cathedral's football program.

Historically, many major music festivals took place in the park, including the Human Be-In, which featured bands like the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane.<ref>{{Cite book|title = California Babylon|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PXSzAAAAQBAJ|publisher = St. Martin's Griffin|date = 2013-09-24|isbn = 9781466854147|first1 = Kristan|last1 = Lawson|first2 = Anneli|last2 = Rufus}}</ref> More contemporary music festivals such as the Outside Lands and Hardly Strictly Bluegrass also take place on or nearby the Polo Fields.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hardly Strictly Bluegrass 13 – Fri Oct 4, Sat Oct 5, & Sun Oct 6, 2013|url = http://www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com/2012/|website = www.hardlystrictlybluegrass.com|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref> One of the largest public gatherings in San Francisco took place in the Polo Fields—a public Rosary in 1961 with 550,000 people.<ref>{{Cite web|title = St. Paul Street Evangelization – San Francisco, CA|url = http://streetevangelization.com/sanfrancisco/|website = St. Paul Street Evangelization – San Francisco, CA|access-date = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}</ref> Public political events were also held at the field, such as the anti-Vietnam War rally in 1969 and the Tibetan Freedom Concert in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|title = From Freeing Tibet to Rebooting Judaism – Q&A|url = http://forward.com/culture/qa/11482/from-fighting-for-a-free-tibet-to-rebooting-judais-00377/|website = The Forward|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref>

Now in the 21st century, the Polo Field is split into two divisions: the inner soccer field, and the flat-style cycling velodrome found around the field itself. Today many sports are played in the polo fields, including soccer, cross country running, and various types of cycling. The cycling track is still alive, with a large amount of time-trial races held every cycling season.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Polo Field Smack Down|url = http://polofieldsmackdown.com/|website = Polo Field Smack Down|access-date = 2015-11-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151125095018/http://polofieldsmackdown.com/|archive-date = November 25, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> A cyclist in 2013 set a record in the park by riding a total of 188.5 miles on the Polo Field velodrome, circling it 279 times for a total of 10 hours moving.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.strava.com/activities/63951434|title = Polo Fields 300k|date = 2013-06-30|website = Strava.com|publisher = Strava, Inc.|last = Moyer|first = Fred}}</ref>

=== Archery Range ===
Archery was first organized in Golden Gate Park in 1881.<ref name=":8y" /> However, there was not a devoted range specifically for archery until around 1933. In 1936, during Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, many parts of Golden Gate Park, including the archery range, were improved as part of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA).<ref>{{Cite web|title = W.P.A.

carved to serve as a backdrop for stray arrows. Bales of hay are used as targets and are provided by the Golden Gate Joad Archery Club as well as donations from other donors.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Where We Teach Archery – Golden Gate Park Archery Range {{!}} Golden Gate Junior Olympic Archery Development|url = http://www.goldengatejoad.com/learn-archery-2/where-we-teach-archery/#.VlSo9Hh-k5h|website = www.goldengatejoad.com|access-date = 2015-11-24}}</ref> The Golden Gate Park Archery Range is located right inside the park off of 47th Street and Fulton Street. It is open whenever the park itself is open and is free to use by anyone. There is no staff and equipment is not offered to be rented at the range, however there are archery stores nearby for rentals and there are multiple groups that offer training and lessons.

== Golden Gate Park Nursery ==

[[File:Green Houses.jpg|left|thumb|Green houses inside of Golden Gate Park Nursery]]
Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has remained one of the few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners.<ref>{{Cite book|title = San Francisco's Golden Gate Park: A Thousand and Seventeen Acres of Stories|last = Pollock|first = Chris|publisher = WestWinds|year = 2001|location = Portland, Or|pages = 89}}</ref> The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://fromthethicket.com|title = Golden Gate Park: Views from the Thicket|date = January 2011|last = Schenker|first = Heath}}</ref> This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://sfbotanicalgarden.org/plant-sales/index.html|title = San Francisco Botanical Garden : Plant Sales|publisher = San Francisco Botanical Garden Society}}</ref> Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park.<ref name=":0" />

==Homeless population==

In 2017, there were approximately 7,500 homeless people living in San Francisco.<ref name=":'1">{{cite web|last1=Placzek|first1=Jessica|title=Homelessness: You've got questions, we've got answers|url=https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/06/22/homelessness-youve-got-questions-weve-got-answers/|website=KQED News|publisher=KQED|access-date=30 November 2017}}</ref> Around 40 to 200 of these 7,000 people were estimated reside in the park as of 2013.<ref name=":sfgov">{{cite web|title=Golden Gate Park's Homeless Population|url=http://civilgrandjury.sfgov.org/2012_2013/Golden_Gate_Park's_Homeless_Population_Final_06-12-13.pdf|website=SFGov.org|publisher=City and County of San Francisco|ref=SFGOV|date=June 2013|pages= 9, 10}}</ref> Around half of the homeless population in Golden Gate Park are short-term residents that leave after a certain amount of time, and the other half are more long-term residents. Short-term residents tend to be younger, while permanent residents tend to be older, military veterans. Most of the homeless population is male.  It is estimated that around 60% of the population may have a mental disability. However, it is hard to gather data about the population due to a variable population.<ref name=":sfgov" />

The city government of San Francisco has attempted to establish various outreach programs in order to help the homeless population. The city's government stated in 2013 that "current outreach efforts to inform park dwellers about support services are limited, and efforts that do take place are not documented in a way that makes it possible to analyze their efficiency or success".<ref name=":sfgov" />

The City of San Francisco has grappled with what to do about camps of homeless people living in Golden Gate Park, which have been criticized as unsanitary, and "demoralizing" for park users and workers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Dan|title=Campers Get 3 Days to Vacate Golden Gate Park / Mayor reveals homeless sweep plan|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1995-08-24/news/17812860_1_homeless-campers-golden-gate-park-homeless-people|access-date=September 11, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 24, 1995}}</ref> The camps have been described by journalists as full of garbage, broken glass, hypodermic needles, and human excrement, and the people in them are described as suffering from serious addictions and often behaving aggressively with police and park gardeners.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Ken|title=Ken Garcia: Homeless in Golden Gate Park: An old story that never ends|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/ken-garcia-homeless-in-golden-gate-park-an-old-story-that-never-ends/Content?oid=2158186|access-date=January 25, 2015|newspaper=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=May 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Buchanan| first=Wyatt| title=the Situation at Golden Gate Park | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/THE-SITUATION-AT-GOLDEN-GATE-PARK-Not-a-place-2579045.php | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle|SF Gate]] | date=July 29, 2007 | access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Nevius|first=C.W.|title=Golden Gate Park update – fewer needles, homeless campsites|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-09-23/bay-area/17263512_1_homeless-campers-golden-gate-park-police-sweeps|access-date=September 11, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 23, 2007}}</ref> There have been occasional incidents of violence against homeless people in the park, including the 2010 park beating to death of a homeless man and an attack on park visitors by dogs owned by a park resident, also in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aldax|first=Mike|title=Crackdown on midnight mayhem|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/crackdown-on-midnight-mayhem/Content?oid=2161308|access-date=January 25, 2015|newspaper=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=September 2, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s, then-Mayor Willie Brown sought unsuccessfully to borrow the Oakland Police Department's helicopters in order to find homeless people's camps.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roschelle|first1=Anne|last2=Wright|first2=Talmadge|editor1-last=Hall|editor1-first=Tim|editor2-last=Miles|editor2-first=Malcolm|title=Urban Futures: Critical Commentaries on Shaping Cities|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=156}}</ref>

Starting in 1988 under then-mayor [[Art Agnos]], and continuing under the direction of subsequent mayors including [[Frank Jordan]], [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]], and [[Gavin Newsom]], San Francisco police have conducted intermittent sweeps of the park aimed at eliminating the camps.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vega|first=Cecilia, Heather Knight|title=SAN FRANCISCO / Crackdown in Golden Gate Park / Few homeless leave on deadline; city wants to offer help, services|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-09-29/bay-area/17311145_1_golden-gate-park-homeless-people-central-park|access-date=September 11, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 29, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Marinucci|first=Carla, Alex Barnum, Jaxon Van Derbeken|title=Brown Intensifies Hard-Line Tactics to Rid Park of Encampments / Nighttime copter checks ordered|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/1997-11-07/news/17763134_1_golden-gate-park-emergency-shelter-system-homeless-encampments|access-date=September 11, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 7, 1997}}</ref> Tactics have included information campaigns designed to inform homeless residents about city services available to help them; waking sleeping homeless people and making them leave the park; issuing citations for infractions and misdemeanors such as camping, trespassing, or public intoxication, which carry penalties of $75 to $100;<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelkar|first=Kamala|title=Golden Gate Park homeless ignore outreach efforts|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/golden-gate-park-homeless-ignore-outreach-efforts|access-date=September 11, 2011|newspaper=[[The San Francisco Examiner]]|date=November 5, 2009}}</ref> and the seizure and removal from the park of homeless people's possessions. During the night, police urge visitors to Golden Gate Park to be careful around homeless people.

The crackdowns have been criticized by anti-poverty activists and civil liberties groups, who say the measures attack only the symptoms of homelessness, while ignoring its root causes, and criminalize the poor for their poverty while ignoring their property rights and constitutional rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Yumi|title=Homeless Sue S.F.
