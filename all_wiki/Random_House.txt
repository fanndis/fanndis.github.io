==History==
Random House was founded in 1927 by [[Bennett Cerf]] and [[Donald Klopfer]], two years after they acquired the [[Modern Library]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] from publisher Horace Liveright, which reprints classic works of literature. Cerf is quoted as saying, "We just said we were going to publish a few books on the side at random," which suggested the name Random House.<ref>[http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bennett_alfred_cerf.html C250.columbia.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408223715/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bennett_alfred_cerf.html |date=April 8, 2016 }}, Bennet Alfred Cerf Biography</ref> In 1934 they published the first authorized edition of [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in the Anglophone world.<ref>{{cite book|title=The most dangerous book: the battle for James Joyce's Ulysses|first=Kevin|last=Birmingham|location=London|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2014|isbn=9781784080723}}</ref> {{blockquote|''Ulysses'' really launched Random House. ... Random House grew into a formidable publisher over the next two decades. In 1936, it absorbed the firm of Smith and Haas—Robert Haas became the third partner until retiring and selling his share back to Bennett and Donald in 1956—which added authors including [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]], [[Isak Dinesen]], [[André Malraux]], [[Robert Graves]], and [[Jean de Brunhoff]], who wrote the Babar children's books. Random House also hired legendary editors Harry Maule, Robert Linscott, and Saxe Commins, and they brought authors such as [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Robert Penn Warren]] with them.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernstein, Robert L.|authorlink=Robert L.

Random House entered reference publishing in 1947 with the ''American College Dictionary'', which was followed in 1966 by its first unabridged [[dictionary]].
In October 1959, Random House went public at $11.25 a share. This move drew other publishing companies, such as [[Simon & Schuster]], to later go public.<ref name="Another">{{cite book|last1=Korda|first1=Michael|title=Another Life : a memoir of other people|url=https://archive.org/details/anotherlifememoi00kord|url-access=registration|date=1999|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-679-45659-7|edition=1st}}</ref>
American publishers [[Alfred A. Knopf]], Inc. and [[Pantheon Books]] were acquired by Random House in 1960 and 1961, respectively; works continue to be published under these imprints with editorial independence, such as [[Everyman's Library]], a series of classical literature reprints.
In 1965, [[RCA]] bought Random House as part of a diversification strategy. Random House acquired the paperback book publisher [[Ballantine Books]] in 1973.<ref>{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| title = Random House in Deal For Ballantine Books| work = The New York Times| accessdate = November 3, 2019| date = January 9, 1973| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/09/archives/random-house-in-deal-for-ballantine-books.html}}</ref> RCA sold Random House to [[Advance Publications]] in 1980.<ref name=Another/><ref>{{cite web|title=RCA History|url=http://www.bobsamerica.com/rca-history.html|website=bobsamerica|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref>

===Acquisition by Bertelsmann===
In 1998, [[Bertelsmann AG]] bought Random House and merged it with [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] [[Dell Books|Dell]] and it soon went global.<ref>Random House Company History, from [http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Random-House-Inc-Company-History.html Fundinguniverse.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304174822/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Random-House-Inc-Company-History.html |date=March 4, 2012 }}.

[[Phyllis E.

Coinciding with the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the publishing industry was hit hard with weak retail sales. In May 2008, Random House CEO Peter Olson stepped down and Bertelsmann replaced Olson with Marcus Dohle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/business/media/21random.html|title=Publishing Outsider Picked to Head Random House|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=May 21, 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 26, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By October of that year, Doubleday, a division of Random House announced that they would lay off 16 people or about 10% of its workforce.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/books/29book.html|title=Doubleday Publishing Lays Off 10% of Its Employees|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=October 28, 2008|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 27, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In early December, what became known as Black Wednesday in publishing circles, many publishers including Random House took steps by restructuring their divisions and laying off employees.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/new-editor-at-random-house-layoffs-at-doubleday-and-broadway/|title=New Editor at Random House, Layoffs at Doubleday and Broadway|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=December 17, 2008|website=ArtsBeat|access-date=May 17, 2018}}</ref> The reorganization consolidated and created three divisions—Random House Publishing Group, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group and Crown Publishing Group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20090119/16845-random-puts-its-house-in-order.html|title=Random Puts Its House in Order|website=Publishers Weekly|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/major-reorganization-at-random-house/|title=Major Reorganization at Random House|last=Rich|first=Motoko|website=ArtsBeat|access-date=April 3, 2016}}</ref>[[Susan Kamil]], was named editorial director for Dial Press and editor-in-chief of Random House imprints reporting to Gina Centrello, the president and publisher of the Random House Publishing Group.<ref name=":1" /> There were layoffs in the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] imprint (now part of [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf Publishing Group]]) and [[Dial Press]], [[Bantam Books|Bantam Dell]], and [[Spiegel & Grau]] were moved from Doubleday over to the Random House imprints.

Random House also has an entertainment production arm for film and television, Random House Studio; one release in 2011 was ''[[One Day (2011 film)|One Day]]''. The company also creates story content for media including video games, social networks on the web, and mobile platforms. It is one of the largest English-language publishers, along with the group formerly known as the "Big 6", now known as the "Big Five".<ref>The Big Six publishers, which have since been reduced to the "Big Five" by the merger on July 1, 2013 of Penguin and Random House, were Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group/Macmillan, Hachette, HarperCollins, Penguin Books, Random House; and Simon & Schuster.</ref>

===Merger with Penguin===
In October 2012, Bertelsmann entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Pearson plc]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Random House and [[Penguin Group]]. The merger was completed on July 1, 2013, and the new company is [[Penguin Random House]].<ref>{{Cite news|title =Penguin and Random House in deal talks|date=October 26, 2012|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|last2=Wiesmann|first2=Gerrit|accessdate=August 12, 2013|work=[[Financial Times]]|department=Media}}{{Registration required}}</ref> When founded, Bertelsmann owned 53% of the joint venture while Pearson owned 47%.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/business/media/merger-of-penguin-and-random-house-is-completed.html |title=Penguin and Random House Merge, Saying Change Will Come Slowly |last=Bosman |first=Julie |date=July 1, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331|access-date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> Pearson sold 22% of its shares to Bertelsmann in July 2017, and since April 2020, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann, making Random House division again wholly owned by German parent. At the time of the acquisition the combined companies controlled 25% of the book business with more than 10,000 employees and 250 independent publishing imprints and with about $3.9&nbsp;billion in annual revenues.<ref name=":0" /> The move to consolidate was to provide leverage against [[Amazon.com]] and battle the shrinking state of [[bookstore]]s.<ref name=":0" />

In October 2018, Penguin Random House merged two of its most known publishing lines, Random House and the Crown Publishing Group. According to Madeline McIntosh, chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., the two lines "will retain their distinct editorial identities."''<ref name=":3">{{Cite news |author=Alexandra Alter |date=October 18, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/books/penguin-random-house-merges-two-of-its-successful-publishing-lines.html |title=Penguin Random House Merges Two of its Successful Publishing Lines |work=The New York Times |access-date=November 16, 2018}}{{Registration required}}</ref> ''McIntosh explained some of the motivation behind the merger in a memo to employees, writing, "Book discovery and buying patterns continue to shift, resulting in growth opportunities in the nonfiction categories in which Crown in particular already has a strong foothold: food, lifestyle, health, wellness, business, and Christian."''<ref name=":3"/> ''"We must invest even more aggressively in title-level and scaled marketing programs, capabilities and partnerships," she added.''<ref name=":3"/> ''Detailing additional growth strategies, McIntosh explained of the merger, "We will need to do two things simultaneously. First, we must expand and strengthen the expert publishing teams who are specialized in and dedicated to each category. Second, we must invest even more aggressively in title-level and scaled marketing programs, capabilities, and partnerships. This will ensure that we not only maximize the sales for each individual book but also keep pace with consumer trends."''<ref>{{Cite news |author=John Maher |date=October 18, 2018 |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/78369-random-house-crown-merge.html |title=The Random House and Crown Publishing Groups Merge |work=Publishers Weekly|access-date=November 16, 2018 }}</ref>

=== International branches ===
Random House, Inc. maintains several independently managed subsidiaries around the world.

'''The Random House Group''' is one of the largest general book publishing companies in the UK and is based in London. 
The Group comprises five publishing companies: Cornerstone Publishing, [[Vintage Books|Vintage Publishing]], [[Ebury Publishing]], Random House Children's Publishers UK and [[Transworld Publishers]], with more than 40 diverse imprints. Its distribution business services its own imprints as well as 60 other UK publishers.  The Random House archive and library is located in [[Rushden]] in Northamptonshire.

The Random House Group also operates branches in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (as a joint venture under the name '''Random House Struik'''), and India as part of its overseas structure. In Australia offices are in Sydney and [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.randomhouse.com.au/about/contacts.aspx|title = Contacts|accessdate = March 3, 2014|website = Random House Books Australia|publisher = Random House|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929231658/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/about/contacts.aspx|archivedate = September 29, 2013}}</ref> In New Zealand it is based in [[Glenfield, New Zealand|Glenfield]], [[Auckland]], while Random House's Indian headquarters are located in New Delhi.

'''Verlagsgruppe Random House''' was established after Bertelsmann's 1998 acquisition of Random House, grouping its German imprints (until then operating as Verlagsgruppe Bertelsmann) under the new name; before April 2020, it has explicitly no legal part of the worldwide Penguin Random House company and a hundred percent subsidiary of Bertelsmann instead but de facto is led by the same management. It is the second largest book publisher in Germany with more than 40 imprints, including historic publishing houses [[Goldmann (publisher)|Goldmann]] and [[Heyne Verlag]], as well as C. Bertelsmann, the publishing house from which today's Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA would eventually evolve. Verlagsgruppe Random House is headquartered in [[Munich]] (with additional locations in [[Gütersloh]] (where Bertelsmann is headquartered), [[Cologne]], and [[Aßlar]]), employs about 850 people, and publishes roughly 2,500 titles per year. Following the formation of Penguin Random House, a '''Penguin Verlag''' (with no legal connection to Penguin Books) was founded for the German market in 2015, as part of the Verlagsgruppe Random House. With Bertelsmann acquiring full ownership of Penguin Random House in April 2020, Verlagsgruppe Random House is being reintegrated with the main Penguin Random House company.<ref name="acq">{{cite web |title=Bertelsmann Completes Full Acquisition of Penguin Random House |url=https://www.bertelsmann.com/news-and-media/news/bertelsmann-completes-full-acquisition-of-penguin-random-house.jsp |publisher=[[Bertelsmann]]}}</ref>

It is headquartered in [[Barcelona]] with locations in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]], and the United States. From 2001 until November 2012, it was a joint venture with Italian publisher [[Mondadori]] (Random House Mondadori).

Until January 2012, it used to hold a 25% stake in [[McClelland & Stewart]], with the remaining 75% being controlled by the [[University of Toronto]]. It is now the sole owner of McClelland & Stewart.
