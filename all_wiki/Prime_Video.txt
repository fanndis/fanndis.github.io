'''Amazon Prime Video''', or simply '''Prime Video''', is an American [[Video on demand#Subscription%20models|subscription video on-demand]] [[Over-the-top media service|over-the-top]] [[Streaming media|streaming]] and [[Renting|rental]] service of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com, Inc.]], offered as a standalone service or as part of Amazon's [[Amazon Prime|Prime subscription]]. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Amazon Studios]] or licensed to Amazon, as [[List of Amazon original programming|Prime Originals]] (or Amazon Originals) or Exclusives, with the service also hosting content from other providers, content add-ons, live sporting events, and video rental and purchasing services.

Operating worldwide, the service may require a full Prime subscription to be accessed. In countries such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Germany]], the service can be accessed without a full Prime subscription,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/getstarted/ref=sv_atv_5#prime_video|title=Amazon Prime Video subscription|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref> whereas in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Turkey]] and [[Italy]], it can only be accessed through a dedicated website. Prime Video additionally offers a content add-on service in the form of channels, called Amazon Channels, or Prime Video Channels, which allow users to subscribe to additional video subscription services from other content providers within Prime Video, such as [[HBO Go|HBO]], [[Starz|StarzPlay]], and [[Shudder (streaming service)|Shudder]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=Alexis|title=Amazon Prime Just Got Way Better With A Ton Of Old HBO Shows|journal=The Huffington Post|date=April 23, 2014|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/netflix-amazon-prime_n_5197950.html|accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref> 

Launched on September 7, 2006 as Amazon Unbox in the United States, the service grew with an expanding library, and added the Prime Video membership upon the development of the Prime subscription.

On March 18, 2020, [[Thierry Breton]], a European commissioner in charge of digital policy of the [[European Union]] urged streaming services including Amazon Prime Video to limit their services. The request came as a result of the prevention of Europe's broadband networks from crashing as tens of millions of people start [[telecommuting|working from home]], an outcome of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. According to the EU, the streaming platforms should consider offering only standard definition, rather than high-definition, programs and users should be responsible for their data consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/b4ab03db-de1f-4f98-bcc2-b09007427e1b|title= EU warns of broadband strain as millions work from home|work=[[Financial Times]]|location=San Francisco|accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> On March 20, 2020, Amazon said that they have already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates while also maintaining a quality streaming, "We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to [[COVID-19]].

Amazon had historically withheld support for [[Apple TV]] and Google's [[Chromecast]] platform. In October 2015, the company banned the sale of these devices on its online marketplace because they do not support the Prime Video ecosystem. This led to critics arguing that Amazon was displaying [[protectionism]] against devices that could be deemed as undue competitors to its own [[Fire TV]] products.<ref name="nyt-amazonstopselling">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Stop Selling Apple TV and Chromecast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/amazon-to-stop-selling-apple-tv-and-chromecast.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 October 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="bloomberg-ccban">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Ban Sale of Apple, Google Video-Streaming Devices
