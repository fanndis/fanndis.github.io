In November 2019, Adams gifted Park Walk [[Primary School]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], [[England]], with a brand new, state-of-the-art playground. It was all possible thanks to his charity, ''The Bryan Adams Foundation''. The center was inaugurated on Friday 29 November and is equipped with all the latest generation safety systems, such as the floor able to cushion the blows and possible falls of children. But not only that, the park guarantees a truly unique gaming experience. There is, in fact, an area for parkour, [[climbing wall]], ropes, beams and Roman rings. All for fun and for the psychomotor growth of the little ones. And again: the area, thus redeveloped, is also equipped with an outdoor [[library]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/rockstar-bryan-adams-opened-new-17357510|title=Why rockstar Bryan Adams opened a new playground in West London|date=5 December 2019|first=Kingsley|last=Thomas|website=mylondon.news|language=en-US|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref> In previous years, Adams had built a [[playground]] for ''Ashburnham Community School'' in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] in London with his foundation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mylondon.news/news/west-london-news/bryan-adams-helps-chelsea-school-10471486|title=Bryan Adams helps Chelsea school build all-weather outdoor area|date=20 November 2015|first=Cooper|last=Goolistan|website=mylondon.news|language=en-US|access-date=25 November 2020}}</ref>
