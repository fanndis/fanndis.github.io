'''Easter egg''' is a term used to describe a message, image, or feature hidden in a video game, film, or other, usually in electronics, medium. The term used in this manner was coined around 1979 by Steve Wright, the then Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, to describe a hidden message in the [[Atari]] video game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'', in reference to an [[egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]].

==Origin==
{{see also|Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg}}
[[File:Adventure Easteregg.PNG|thumb|right|The secret room in ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]'' with [[Warren Robinett]]'s credit]]
The use of the term "Easter egg" to describe secret features in video games originates from the 1980 video game ''[[Adventure (1980 video game)|Adventure]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]] game console, programmed by employee [[Warren Robinett]]. At the time, [[Atari Corporation|Atari]] did not include programmers' names in the game credits, fearing that competitors would attempt to steal their employees. Robinett, who disagreed with his supervisor over this lack of acknowledgment, secretly programmed the message "Created by Warren Robinett" to appear only if a player moved their [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] over a specific pixel (dubbed the "Gray Dot") during a certain part of the game and entered a previously "forbidden" part of the map where the message would be found. When Robinett left Atari, he did not inform the company of the acknowledgment that he included in the game. Shortly after his departure, the "Gray Dot" and his message were discovered by a player. Atari's management initially wanted to remove the message and release the game again until this was deemed too costly. Instead, Steve Wright, the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, suggested that they keep the message and, in fact, encourage the inclusion of such messages in future games, describing them as Easter eggs for consumers to find.<ref name="Wolf">{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.P.|title=Encyclopedia of Video Games: The Culture, Technology, and Art of Gaming|date=2012|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9780313379369|page=177}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Play Atari Adventure|url=http://my.ign.com/atari/adventure|website=IGN|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name="Baker">{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=How One Man Invented the Console Adventure Game|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/warren-robinett-adventure/|website=WIRED|access-date=2 September 2016|date=13 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Salen|first1=Katie|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Eric|title=The Game Design Reader: A Rules of Play Anthology|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262195364|pages=690–713|oclc=58919795}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Letter to Atari|url=http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|website=2600 Connections|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=September 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013192403/http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016|date=August 4, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/technology/easter-eggs-tesla-google.html|title=The Secret History of 'Easter Eggs'|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 8, 2019|last=Pogue|first=David|accessdate=August 8, 2019}}</ref>

==In video games==
While Robinett's message in ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' led to the use of the phrase Easter egg, Easter eggs were included in previous video games. The first text adventure game, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1976), from which ''Adventure'' was fashioned, included several secret words. One of these was "[[Xyzzy (computing)|xyzzy]]", a command which enabled the player to move between two points in the game world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jerz|first1=Dennis G.|title=Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original "Adventure" in Code and in Kentucky|journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly|date=2007|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations}}</ref> In 2004, an Easter egg displaying programmer Bradley Reid-Selth's surname was found in ''Video Whizball'' (1978), a game for the [[Fairchild Channel F]] system.<ref name="Wolf"/> According to research by [[Ed Fries]], the first known Easter egg in an arcade game was in ''[[Starship 1]]'' (1977), programmed by Ron Milner. By triggering the cabinet's controls in the right order, the player could get the message "Hi Ron!" to appear on the screen. Fries described it as "the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an Easter egg". The existence of this Easter egg wasn't published until 2017, leading Fries to suggest that, as more than one hundred arcade games predate ''Starship 1'', earlier Easter eggs may still be undiscovered.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Machkovech|first1=Sam|title=The arcade world's first Easter egg discovered after fraught journey|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/the-arcade-worlds-first-easter-egg-discovered-after-fraught-journey/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=22 March 2017|language=en-us|date=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref name="Fries">{{cite web|last1=Fries|first1=Ed|title=The Hunt For The First Arcade Game Easter Egg|url=http://kotaku.com/the-hunt-for-the-first-arcade-game-easter-egg-1793593889|website=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=24 March 2017|date=24 March 2017}}</ref> Fries noted that some Atari arcade cabinets were resold under the [[Kee Games]] label and included changes to the hardware that would make the game appear different from the Atari version. ''[[Anti-Aircraft (video game)|Anti-Aircraft II]]'' (1975) included a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien UFOs. Fries surmised that this feature may have been intended for a Kee Games release. For this reason, and because it required a hardware modification, Fries questioned whether it met the definition of an Easter egg.<ref name="Fries"/>

Since ''Adventure'', there has been a long history of video game developers placing Easter eggs in their games.<ref name="Consalvo">{{cite book|last1=Consalvo|first1=Mia|title=Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Videogames|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262033657}}</ref>{{rp|19}} Most Easter eggs are intentional - an attempt to communicate with the player or a way of getting even with management for a slight. Easter eggs in video games have taken a variety of forms, from purely ornamental screens to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play. The Easter egg included in the original ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' (1997) is an example of the latter; [[catapult]] projectiles are changed from stones to cows.<ref name="Consalvo"/>{{rp|19}} 

More elaborate Easter eggs include [[Level (video gaming)#Secret levels|secret levels]] and developers' rooms - fully functional, hidden areas of the game. Developers' rooms often include inside jokes from the [[fandom]] or development team and differ from a [[debug menu|debug room]] in that they are specifically intended for the player to find. Some games even include hidden [[minigame]]s as Easter eggs. In the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' (1993), the original ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' (1987) game can be played in its full version by using a home computer in a character's room.<ref name="Björk">{{cite book|last1=Björk|first1=Staffan|last2=Holopainen|first2=Jussi|title=Patterns In Game Design|date=2005|publisher=Charles River Media|location=Hingham, Massachusetts|isbn=9781584503545|page=235|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFQfyODK4wAC&pg=PA235|access-date=25 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Optical Information Systems Update/library & Information Center Applications|journal=CD-ROM World|date=February 1994|volume=9|issue=1–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwoQAQAAMAAJ&q=Day+of+the+Tentacle+easter+egg|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=Meckler Publishing|language=en|quote=The best Easter egg of all is the entire Maniac Mansion game, which appears on a computer in Doctor Fred's mansion.

Other Easter eggs originated unintentionally. The [[Konami Code]], a type of [[cheat code]], became an intentional Easter egg in most games, but originated from Konami's ''[[Gradius]]'' (1985) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The programmer, [[Kazuhisa Hashimoto]], created the code as a means to rapidly [[debug]] the game by giving the player's avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game. These types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but, in the case of ''Gradius'', Hashimoto forgot to remove it and the code was soon discovered by players. Its popularity inspired Konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an Easter egg.<ref name="Wolf"/><ref name="Björk"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Garmon|first1=Jay|title=Geek Trivia: The cheat goes on|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/geek-trivia-the-cheat-goes-on/|website=TechRepublic|access-date=16 April 2008|language=en|date=5 March 2007}}</ref>

Technical issues may also create unintentional Easter eggs. [[Jon Burton]], founder of [[Traveller's Tales]], announced that many seemingly apparent Easter eggs in their [[Sega Genesis]] games came about as a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting Sega's strict certification for their games, [[Exception handling|catching any exceptions during execution]] to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification. For example, [[Cartridge tilting|hitting the side]] of the ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996) cartridge while it was slotted in the console would bring the game back to the Level Select screen, which Burton explained was the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error, such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console's microprocessor was temporarily lost.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=How hitting a game cartridge unlocks gaming's weirdest Easter egg|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/smack-cartridge-for-level-select-behind-gamings-weirdest-easter-egg/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=4 October 2017|language=en-us|date=4 October 2017}}</ref>

In [[computer software]], Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands. The results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small video game hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software.

In the [[TOPS-10]] operating system (for the DEC [[PDP-10]] computer), the {{code|make}} command is used to invoke the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] editor to create a file. If given the file name argument {{code|love}}, so that the command reads {{code|make love}}, it will pause and respond [[Make love, not war|{{code|not war?}}]] before creating the file.<ref name="Montfort">{{cite book|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System |date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262012577|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqePfdz_x6gC&pg=PA59 |access-date=25 January 2013}}</ref> This same behavior occurred on the [[RSTS/E]] operating system, where TECO will provide this response.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other [[Unix]] [[operating system]]s respond to "{{code|why}}" with "{{code|why not}}" (a reference to ''[[The Prisoner (computer game)|The Prisoner]]'' in [[BSD|Berkeley Unix]], 1977).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Some versions of the DEC [[OpenVMS]] operating system have concealed [[exit status]] codes, including a reference to the [[Monty Python]] [[Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook]] skit; "{{code|exit %xb70}}" returns the message "%SYSTEM-W-FISH, my hovercraft is full of eels" while "{{code|exit %x34b4}}" returns a reference to an early [[Internet meme]]: "%SYSTEM-F-GAMEOVER, [[All your base are belong to us]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenVMS Undocumented Features|url=https://www.parsec.com/os/openvms/undocumented.php?page=12|website=PARSEC Group|access-date=6 April 2016|language=en}}</ref>

Many [[personal computers]] have much more elaborate eggs hidden in [[read-only memory|ROM]], including lists of the developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music, or images of the entire development team. Easter eggs in the 1997 version of [[Microsoft Office]] include a hidden [[flight simulator]] in [[Microsoft Excel]] and a [[pinball]] game in [[Microsoft Word]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Anonymous|title=Excel Easter Egg - Excel 97 Flight to Credits|url=http://eeggs.com/items/718.html|website=The Easter Egg Archive|access-date=4 January 2011|language=en|date=19 July 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arima|first1=Kevin|title=Word (Microsoft) Easter Egg - Pinball in Word 97|url=http://eeggs.com/items/763.html|website=The Easter Egg Archive|access-date=4 January 2011|language=en|date=20 July 2009}}</ref> Since 2002, Microsoft does not allow any hidden or undocumented code as part of its [[trustworthy computing]] initiative.<ref name=Larry>{{cite web |author1=Larry Osterman |title=Why no Easter Eggs? |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/10/21/483608.aspx |website=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=MSDN Blogs |access-date=July 10, 2018 |date=October 21, 2005}}</ref>

* In 2000, [[Al Milgrom]] inserted a message into ''[[Universe X: Spidey]]'' #1 insulting his previous boss, Marvel Editor in Chief [[Bob Harras]], following Harras' termination from [[Marvel Comics]]. On Page 28, panel 3, the spines of books on a bookshelf in the background read, "HARRAS HA HA, HE'S GONE, GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH HE WAS A NASTY S.O.B." The message was spotted after the book was printed but before it went on sale; the copies that were printed for consumers were destroyed. However, 4,000 preview copies were distributed to retailers as part of a "[[First-look deal|First Look]]" deal, and these are today considered rare collectors' items. Milgrom was "apparently fired and allegedly (and quietly) re-hired several weeks later".<ref name="Johnston"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=McCallum|first1=Diana|title=6 Comic Book Easter Eggs That Stuck It to The Man|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_18984_6-comic-book-easter-eggs-that-stuck-it-to-man.html|website=[[Cracked.com]]|access-date=4 November 2017|date=4 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Universe X Spidey 1 Harras Slander Variant|url=http://www.recalledcomics.com/UniverseXSpidey1RecalledHarras.php|website=Recalled Comics|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

* Indonesian artist [[Ardian Syaf]] is known to engage in the practice of hiding Easter egg references to political figures in the backgrounds of his artwork.

===Broadcast media===
Unlike DVDs and computer games, broadcast radio and television programs contain no executable code. Easter eggs may still appear in the content itself, such as a [[hidden Mickey]] in a Disney film or a real telephone number instead of a [[555 (telephone number)|555]] [[fictitious telephone number]].{{Original research inline|date=November 2017}} A [[2014 Super Bowl]] advertisement was leaked online in which a lady gives a man a real telephone number, which the advertiser had hidden as a marketing ploy; the first caller to the number received a pair of tickets to the game.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Merda|first1=Chad|title=Easter egg in Old Spice Super Bowl ad yields two tickets to curious fan|url=http://voices.suntimes.com/news/easter-egg-in-old-spice-super-bowl-ad-yields-two-tickets-to-curious-fan/|website=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=March 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091642/http://voices.suntimes.com/news/easter-egg-in-old-spice-super-bowl-ad-yields-two-tickets-to-curious-fan/|archivedate=April 2, 2015|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The 1980s animated series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'' featured a character called [[Loo-Kee]] who typically appeared once per episode, hidden in a single screenshot.

More recent broadcast media, where viewers have access to high-resolution digital copies or streaming services, may include further Easter eggs that can only be found by freezing the show at certain points. In the anthology series ''[[Black Mirror]]'', the producers have included Easter eggs that reference past episodes, or tie into future episodes, as a means of loosely tying together all episodes into a single ''Black Mirror'' universe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/black-mirror-season-4-episodes-charlie-brooker-annabel-jones-interview-spoilers-1033807 |title='Black Mirror' Bosses on "San Junipero" Sequel and an Unpredictable Season 4 |first=Jackie |last=Strause |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=14 December 2017 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215053422/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/black-mirror-season-4-episodes-charlie-brooker-annabel-jones-interview-spoilers-1033807 |archive-date=15 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Security concerns==
Security author Michel E. Kabay discussed security concerns of Easter eggs in 2000, saying that, while software quality assurance requires that all code be tested, it is not known whether Easter eggs are. He said that, as they tend to be held as programming secrets from the rest of the product testing process, a "[[logic bomb]]" could also bypass testing. Kabay asserts that this undermined the [[Trusted Computing Base]], a paradigm of trustworthy hardware and software in place since the 1980s, and is of concern wherever personal or confidential information is stored, as this may then be vulnerable to damage or manipulation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kabay|first1=M.E.|title=Easter eggs and the Trusted Computing Base|url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/sec/0327sec1.html|website=Network World|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en|date=27 March 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615213259/http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/sec/0327sec1.html|archivedate=15 June 2006}}</ref><!-- For this reason, many developers have stopped the practice of adding Easter eggs to their software. -- UNSOURCED since May 15, 2006, highly replicated after that. Do not add back without earlier source. --Lexein. See Talk. --> Microsoft created some of the largest and most elaborate Easter eggs, such as those in [[Microsoft Office]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schultz|first1=Greg|title=Take a look back at Microsoft Word Easter Eggs|url=http://www.zdnet.com/photos/take-a-look-back-at-microsoft-word-easter-eggs_p6/160791#photo|website=ZDNet|access-date=5 October 2012|language=en|date=29 August 2010|quote=Microsoft's developers hid multiple Easter Eggs in Word 95/97/2000.}}</ref> In 2005, Larry Osterman of Microsoft acknowledged Microsoft Easter eggs, and his involvement in development of one, but described them as "irresponsible", and wrote that the company's [[Operating System]] division "has a 'no Easter Eggs' policy" as part of its [[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative.<ref name=Larry/>

In 2006, [[Douglas W. Jones]] said that while "some Easter eggs may be [[copyright trap|intentional tools used to detect illegal copying]], others are clearly examples of unauthorized functionality that has slipped through the quality-control tests at the vendor". While hidden Easter eggs themselves are harmless, it may be possible for [[malware]] to be hidden in similar ways in voting machines or other computers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Neuman|first1=Peter G.|title=A Conversation with Douglas W.

[[Netscape Navigator]] contributor [[Jamie Zawinski]] stated in an interview in 1998 that harmless Easter eggs impose a negligible burden on shipped software, and serve the important purpose of helping productivity by keeping programmers happy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spolsky|first1=Joel|authorlink1=Joel Spolsky|title=Joel on Software|date=2004|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781590593899|page=280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdxrDYZyNLUC&pg=PA280|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}</ref>

==Contemporary works about Easter eggs==
<!-- this section is NOT for listing easter eggs. It should be for works where Easter eggs are part of the narrative. All entries must have third-party sourcing -->
Easter eggs have become more widely known to the general public and are referenced in contemporary artworks.
* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]", the existence of video Easter eggs across seventeen [[DVD]]s leads to solving the protagonists' dilemma.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wilkins |first1=Alasdiar |title=Doctor Who: "Blink"/"Utopia" |url=https://tv.avclub.com/doctor-who-blink-utopia-1798180187 |website=[[The A.V.

* In [[Ernest Cline]]'s novel ''[[Ready Player One]]'' and its [[Ready Player One (film)|film adaptation]], the protagonists are competing with others to find various Easter eggs within a large [[virtual reality]] environment. The final challenge includes identifying and reaching the Easter egg from the Atari ''Adventure'' game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gach |first1=Ethan |title=The Real-Life Atari Secret That Inspired Ready Player One |url=https://kotaku.com/the-real-life-atari-secret-that-inspired-ready-player-o-1824221173 |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=August 5, 2019 |date=March 30, 2018}}</ref>
