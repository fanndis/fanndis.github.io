== NBC career ==
[[File:LukeRussert (cropped1).JPG|thumb|right|Russert at the 2008 Democratic National convention]]

In August 2008, just after his graduation from Boston College and a month after the death of his father, NBC News hired Russert as a correspondent covering youth issues as part of its coverage of the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. He was assigned to cover both the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[2008 Republican National Convention|Republican]] conventions.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/07/31/2008-07-31_nbc_news_hires_luke_russert_to_cover_rep.html "NBC News hires Luke Russert to cover Republican, Democratic Conventions"], ''Daily News'', July 31, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/nbc-hires-luke-russert-as-a-correspondent/ "NBC Hires Luke Russert as a Correspondent"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 31, 2008</ref> His election day report, which explored the impact of Barack Obama's win on young people, contributed to NBC's News & Documentary Emmy award for its 2008 Election Night coverage.<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC Universal Media Village|url=https://www.nbcumv.com/talent/luke-russert/bios_read_more?0|website=Talent Bios: Luke Russert}}</ref>

He has openly acknowledged that critics in the media, including some colleagues, have leveled accusations of unqualified [[nepotism]], because of both his father's position at NBC and his mother's position as a Vanity Fair correspondent, given that he had virtually no professional experience at the time of his hiring. He stated that he merely attempts to ignore it.<ref name=Nepotism>{{cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|title=The Education of Luke Russert| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/12/06/luke-russert-finds-his-footing-at-msnbc.html#|accessdate=2013-10-17|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=2010-12-06}}</ref>

From May 2009 to July 2016, he worked for NBC News on Capitol Hill as a Congressional correspondent covering the House of Representatives. He made headlines in 2010 when he received a public apology from Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY), who was at the time serving as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman. Congressman Rangel had criticized Russert's aggressive questioning over an ethics report that showed Rangel's fiscal indiscretions and illegal donation solicitations, but then reversed his stance and apologized to Russert instead.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ciarello|first1=Joe|title=Rep.

In 2011, he also reported on [[Hurricane Irene]] for NBC News.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rothstein|first1=Betsy|title=Luke Russert Declares Himself a 'Dunkin' Guy'|url=http://www.adweek.com/fishbowldc/luke-russert-declares-himself-a-dunkin-guy/49943|website=Fishbowl DC|publisher=Ad Week}}</ref>

In February 2012, Russert made his primetime debut on NBC's [[Dateline NBC|''Dateline'']] with [http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/02/10/10374404-conviction-a-reporters-10-year-quest-for-answers-in-a-little-known-murder-case "Conviction,"] which examined whether the 1998 murder conviction of Jon-Adrian Velazquez was justified or whether Velazquez was wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder he didn't commit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conviction|url=http://www.lukerussert.net/conviction/|website=LukeRussert.net}}</ref> The episode was nominated for a News & Documentary Emmy award for Best Report in a News Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Sara|title=CBS, PBS Lead Nominations for News & Documentary Emmys|url=http://www.thewrap.com/cbs-pbs-lead-nominations-news-documentary-emmys-102471/|website=The Wrap}}</ref>

Russert has claimed that the American media is biased against people of religious faith, going so far as to suggest that it treats them with a certain degree of snark, labeling them as "puritanical" and "not understanding of others or of different viewpoints", which in his view is lazy and contributes to "[feeding] the snickering masses."<ref name="Media Bias">{{cite news|last=Brody|first=David|title=Luke Russert on Media's Faith Bias|url=http://www.cbn.com/tv/2733047813001|accessdate=2013-10-15|newspaper=Christian Broadcasting Network - The Brody File|date=2013-10-15}}</ref>

Russert hosted ''The Briefing'', a web-only show on msnbc.com; he has said he likes to think of it as a "younger man's ''Charlie Rose''".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Briefing|url=http://www.msnbc.com/the-briefing|website=MSNBC.com}}</ref>

Russert suddenly resigned from NBC in July 2016, saying he needed to evaluate his career opportunities.<ref name="LAT-quit" />

== Personal life ==
Russert is involved with charitable causes that were supported by his late father.<ref>{{cite web|title=26th Annual Tim Russert Congressional Dinner|url=http://www.bgcgw.org/2012/05/03/27th_annual_tim_russert_congressional_dinner|publisher=Boys & Girls Club of Greater Washington|accessdate=August 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207031020/http://www.bgcgw.org/2012/05/03/27th_annual_tim_russert_congressional_dinner|archive-date=February 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> On April 20, 2010, he took the role of [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]] of the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] of Greater Washington's annual Congressional dinner, which was renamed after his father.<ref>{{cite news|title=NitePics: Luke Russert Takes His Late Father's Role at Congressional Dinner|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/niteside/NitePics--91669239.html|accessdate=August 18, 2012|newspaper=NBCWashington.com|date=April 21, 2010}}</ref>

He has told POLITICO that, as a sports junkie, he makes sure to watch ESPN's ''[[SportsCenter]]'' and ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' and NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''. He also told POLITICO that his favorite watering holes in D.C. are Ireland's Four Fields in Woodley Park because its bartenders "pour a great Guinness, and on any given night you can catch some first-rate live music." He also likes Billy Martin's Tavern in Georgetown because "you never know who you will be seated next to at the bar. It could be a cop coming off his shift, a college student or even a congressman."<ref>{{cite web|title=Click: Luke Russert|url=http://www.politico.com/click/focus/luke_russert.html|publisher=POLITICO}}</ref>

He contributed an essay titled "What I Learned From My Dad" to [[Parade (magazine)|''Parade'']] for its June 19, 2011 issue.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russert|first1=Luke|title=What I Learned From My Dad|url=http://parade.com/22054/parade/luke-russert-what-i-learned-from-my-dad/|website=Parade}}</ref>

Russert is a member of the Buffalo Fan Alliance Board, an organization committed to keeping the [[Buffalo Bills]] within the city of [[Buffalo, New York]], the hometown of his father. In 2013, he said "I honestly think being a Bills fan is something that’s passed down into your blood. My grandfather was a die hard Bills fans and he passed it on to my dad. I was given a Buffalo Bills jersey when I was probably two years old, so there was really never any doubt that I’d be a Bills fan."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stolzenberg|first1=Anna|title=Through generations of Russerts, Bills legacy lives on|url=http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/Through-generations-of-Russerts-Bills-legacy-lives-on/e874ca71-f3b9-43a4-9a4d-7e4f79273bd3|website=Buffalo Bills News}}</ref>

In 2014, he penned an introduction, dedicated to his father, for the tenth anniversary of his father's bestselling book ''Big Russ and Me''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ariens|first1=Chris|title=Luke Russert Pens New Introduction to Tim Russert's 'Big Russ and Me'|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/luke-russert-pens-new-introduction-to-tim-russerts-big-russ-and-me/225300|website=TV Newser}}</ref>
