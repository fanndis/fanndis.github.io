The '''University of Cape Town''' ('''UCT''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Cape Town]] in the [[Western Cape]] province of [[South Africa]]. UCT was founded in 1829 as the [[South African College]] making it the oldest higher education institute in South Africa.<ref>https://www.brandsouthafrica.com/governance/education/south-africas-universities/?amp | South Africa's universities</ref> In terms of full university status, it is the oldest university in South Africa and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest extant university in Sub-Saharan Africa]] together with [[Stellenbosch University]] which received full university status on the same day in 1918.

Although UCT was founded by a private act of Parliament in 1918, the Statute of the University of Cape Town (issued in 2002 in terms of the Higher Education Act) sets out its structure and roles and places the Chancellor - currently, Dr [[Precious Moloi-Motsepe|Precious Moloi Motsepe]] - as the ceremonial figurehead and invests real leadership authority in the Vice Chancellor, currently Prof [[Mamokgethi Phakeng]], who is accountable to the University Council. Consisting of 57 departments organised in 6 faculties and the multidisciplinary Centre for Higher Education Development, the university has approximately 29000 to 30000 students in the liberal arts, pure sciences and professional degrees ranging from bachelor's degree ([[Education in South Africa#Higher education and training system|NQF 7]]) to Doctoral degree level ([[Education in South Africa#Higher education and training system|NQF 10]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=CHE {{!}} Council on Higher Education {{!}} Regulatory body for Higher Education in South Africa {{!}} Education {{!}} Innovation {{!}} University {{!}} South Africa|url=https://www.che.ac.za/#/moreite|website=www.che.ac.za|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> A vibrant student community consisting of over 100 societies and clubs caters to diverse interests such as religion, politics, culture, community outreach and sport, prominently appearing in national leagues such as, but not limited to, the [[Varsity Cup]]. The historic (and ongoing) academic, sporting and political rivalry between UCT and [[Stellenbosch University]] brought about the nickname "Ikeys". Stretching over six campuses in the Cape Town suburbs of [[Rondebosch]], Hiddingh, [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]], [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]] and the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront|V&A Waterfront]], the medium of instruction is solely in the English language.

UCT is the highest-ranked African university in the [[QS World University Rankings]], the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]], and the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]], and its Commerce, Law, and Medicine Faculties are consistently placed among the hundred best internationally. It is the only African member of the [[Global University Leaders Forum]] (GULF), within the [[World Economic Forum]], which is made up of 26 of the world's top universities.<ref name="McGill newsroom">{{cite web|title=Global University Leaders Forum Members|url=https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GULF_List_pager_2017_.pdf|accessdate=May 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519032944/https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GULF_List_pager_2017_.pdf|archive-date=19 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Five alumni, staff members and researchers associated with UCT have won the [[Nobel Prize]]. {{as of|2020|3}}, 35 UCT staff members are A-rated [[National Research Foundation (South Africa)|NRF]] researchers (constituting 30% of the national total)<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/research/leading-researchers/a-rated|title=NRF A-rated|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> and 88 staff members are members of the [[Academy of Science of South Africa|Academy of Sciences of South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/research/leading-researchers/assaf|title=Academy of Science of South Africa members|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early History ===
The University of Cape Town was founded in 1829 as the [[South African College]], a high school for boys. The college had a small tertiary-education facility, introduced in 1874<ref name=kannemeyer>{{cite book|title=J.M.Coetzee: A life in writing|first=J.C. |last =Kannnemeyer|publisher=Scribe|place=Melbourne|date=2012|page=77}}</ref> that grew substantially after 1880, when the discovery of gold and diamonds in the north - and the resulting demand for skills in mining - gave it the financial boost it needed to grow. The College developed into a fully fledged university during the period 1880 to 1900, thanks to increased funding from private sources and the government.

During these years, the College built its first dedicated science laboratories, and started the departments of mineralogy and geology to meet the need for skilled personnel in the country's emerging diamond and gold-mining industries. The UCT crest was designed in 1859 by [[Charles Davidson Bell]], Surveyor-General of the [[Cape Colony]] at the time. Bell was an accomplished artist who also designed medals and the triangular Cape stamp. Another key development during this period was the admission of women. In 1886 the Professor of Chemistry, Paul Daniel Hahn, convinced the council to admit four women into his chemistry class on a trial basis. Owing to the exceptional standard of work by the women students, the College decided to admit women students permanently in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1887.

The years 1902 to 1918 saw the establishment of the Medical School, the introduction of engineering courses and a Department of Education. UCT was formally established as a university in 1918,<ref name=kannemeyer/> on the basis of the [[Alfred Beit]] bequest and additional substantial gifts from mining magnates [[Julius Wernher]] and Otto Beit. The new university also attracted substantial support from well-wishers in the Cape Town area and, for the first time, a significant state grant.
[[File:UCT_Upper_Campus_landscape_view.jpg|thumb|A view of the Upper Campus at [[Groote Schuur]] on the slopes of Devil's Peak; the university moved here in 1928.]]
In 1928, the university was able to move the bulk of its facilities to the magnificent site at [[Groote Schuur]] on the slopes of Devil's Peak on land bequeathed to the nation by [[Cecil John Rhodes]] as the site for a national university. UCT celebrated its centenary the following year.

=== Apartheid era ===

Apart from establishing itself as a leading research and teaching university in the decades that followed, UCT earned itself the nickname "Moscow on the Hill" during the period 1960 to 1990 for its sustained opposition to apartheid, particularly in higher education.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History introduction|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/about/history|last=University of Cape Town|website=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/about/history|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

The university admitted its first small group of black students in the 1920s. The number of black students remained relatively low until the 1980s and 90s, when the institution, reading and welcoming the signs of change in the country, committed itself to a deliberate and planned process of internal transformation. From the 1980s to the early 1990s, the number of black students admitted to the university rose by 35 percent. By 2004, nearly half of UCT's 20,000 students were black and just under half of the student body was female. Today the university boasts having one of the most diverse campuses in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/about/history|title=Main website of the University of Cape town}}</ref>

=== Post-Apartheid era ===

[[Rhodes Must Fall]] (stylised as #RhodesMustFall) was a protest [[Social movement|movement]] that began on 9 March 2015, originally directed against a statue at the University of Cape Town (UCT) that commemorates [[Cecil Rhodes]]. The campaign for the statue's removal received global attention<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Martin|title=The symbolic statue dividing a South African university|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-31945680|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref name="YaleRhodes">{{cite web | url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/04/01/rhodes-must-fall-everywhere/ | title=HLOPHE: Rhodes must fall everywhere | publisher=Yale Daily News | date=1 April 2015 | accessdate=9 April 2015 | author=Hlophe, Wadantu}}</ref> and led to a wider movement to "[[Decolonize|decolonise]]" education across South Africa.<ref name="YaleRhodes" /><ref name="postcoloianlist">{{cite web | url=http://postcolonialist.com/civil-discourse/rhodes-must-fall-decolonisation-symbolism-happening-uct-south-africa/ | title="Rhodes Must Fall" – Decolonisation Symbolism – What is happening at UCT, South Africa? | publisher=The Post Colonialist | date=29 March 2015 | accessdate=9 April 2015 | author=Kamanzi, Brian}}</ref> On 9 April 2015, following a UCT Council vote the previous night, the statue was removed.

It formally began at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and spread to UCT and [[Rhodes University]] and then the rest of the South African universities.  It called for the abolition of tuition fee increases for the 2016 academic year. Diverse demands arose such as the abolition of fees and decolonisation of higher education which led to substantial changes at South African public universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://csvr.org.za/pdf/An-analysis-of-the-FeesMustFall-Movement-at-South-African-universities.pdf|title=An analysis of the FeesMustFall Movement at South African universities|website=CSVR|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref> At UCT, the Senate began a widespread curriculum reform process and the university began the process of the renaming of buildings on campus (the most notable example was when Jameson Hall was renamed to [[Sarah Baartman]] Hall in 2019).

In September 2019, Film and Media studies student Uyinene Mrwetyana went missing. After the community and police began searching, her body was discovered in the Cape Flats area of Cape Town and Luyanda Botha was arrested and convicted for her rape and murder.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Nkanjeni|first=Unathi|url=https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-09-09-five-shocking-revelations-in-uyinene-mrwetyanas-murder-case/|title=Five Shocking Revelations in Uyinene Mrwetyana's Murder Case|date=9 September 2019|work=Times Live|access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> [[Murder of Uyinene Mrwetyana|Her death]] and the rape and death of other women precipitated widespread public outcry that led to a campus shutdown<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2019-09-04-academic-classes-and-tests-suspended-5-and-6-september|title=Academic classes and tests suspended for 5 and 6 September|date=4 September 2019|work=University of Cape Town News|access-date=21 March 2020}}</ref> and protests on campus, at the Parliament precinct in Cape Town CBD and at campuses around South Africa.

[[File:Uct-rag-concert-at-kirstenbosch-gardens-001.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Hiddingh Hall Library on Hiddingh Campus in [[Gardens, Cape Town|Gardens]], [[Cape Town]].]]
The main teaching campus, known as Upper Campus, is located on the [[Cecil Rhodes|Rhodes]] Estate on the slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]]. This campus contains, in a relatively compact site, the faculties of [[Science]], [[Engineering]], [[Commerce]], and [[Humanities]] (except for the arts departments), as well as Smuts Hall and Fuller Hall [[Dormitory|residences]]. Upper Campus is centered on Sarah Baartman Hall, the location for graduation and other ceremonial events, as well as many examinations. The original buildings and layout of Upper Campus were designed by [[JM Solomon]] and built between 1928 and 1930. Since that time, many more buildings have been added as the university has grown. Upper Campus is also home to the main library, The Chancellor Oppenheimer library which holds the majority of the University's 1.3 million volume collection.

Contiguous with Upper Campus, but separated from it by university sports fields and the [[M3 road (Cape Town)|M3 expressway]], are the Middle and Lower Campuses. These campuses, which are spread through the suburbs of [[Rondebosch, Cape Town|Rondebosch]], [[Rosebank, Cape Town|Rosebank]] and [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]], contain the [[Law]] faculty, the [[South African College of Music]], the School of Economics, most of the student residences, most of the university administrative offices, and various sporting facilities. The state of the art artificial grass [[soccer]] field has been approved by FIFA for training for [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uct.ac.za/dailynews/?id=7052 |title=University of Cape Town / Newsroom & publications / Daily news |publisher=Uct.ac.za |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The Upper, Middle and Lower Campuses together are often referred to as the "main campus".

The Faculty of [[Health Sciences]] is located on the [[Medical School]] campus next to the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]]. The [[Michaelis School of Fine Art|Fine Arts]] and [[Drama]] departments are located on the Hiddingh Campus in central [[Cape Town]]. The University's original building, now known as the ''Egyptian Building'', on the Hiddingh campus, was built in the [[Egyptian Revival]] style. The only other campus built in this style was the [[Medical College of Virginia]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the United States. The [[University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business|UCT Graduate School of Business]] is located on the [[Breakwater Lodge]] Campus at the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]].

The [[Baxter Theatre Centre]], located on the Lower Campus, is part of the University of Cape Town; it is also the second largest performing arts complex in Cape Town, after the [[Artscape Theatre Centre]]. It has three venues:
*the 665-seat Main Theatre
*the 638-seat Concert Hall, with a [[Rudolf von Beckerath|Von Beckerath]] organ
*the 172-seat Golden Arrow Studio

For his contribution of the tract of land which the campus was founded on, a bronze [[statue of Cecil Rhodes]] was erected in 1934 on the Upper Campus, overlooking the university's rugby fields. The statue was removed in April 2015 following [[Rhodes Must Fall|pressure from student groups]] due to its representation of South Africa's colonialist apartheid past and the university's inadequate representation of black students, faculty, and staff.

===Residential halls===
The university has 19 student residences (or "rez" as known colloquially), offering both single-gender and mixed-gender housing. College House is the oldest university residence in Africa, being established in 1887.

===Administration and governance===
[[File:Kgethi.jpg|thumb|150px|Prof [[Mamokgethi Phakeng]] became the University's second black female Vice-Chancellor after [[Mamphela Ramphele]].]]
The University of Cape Town was originally incorporated as a public university by a [[private act|private act of Parliament]] in 1918. At present it is incorporated and structured by an institutional statute issued under the provisions of the [[Higher Education Act, 1997]].

The titular head of the University is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]; this is a ceremonial position without executive power. The primary role of the Chancellor is to confer degrees on behalf of the University, and to represent the University to the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/about/management/chancellor|title=Chancellor|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> The current Chancellor is fashion entrepreneur and philanthropist Dr [[Precious Moloi-Motsepe]] who was elected in November 2019 and assumed the role on 1 January 2020<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pityana|first=Sipho|url=http://www.news.uct.ac.za/article/2019-08-30-uct-elects-new-chancellor|title=UCT elects new Chancellor|date=30 August 2019|work=UCT News|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> after the expiration of Ms [[Graça Machel]]'s second consecutive 10-year term.

=== Academic divisions===
The university is composed of six Faculties (Commerce, Engineering and the Built Environment, Health Sciences, Sciences and Humanities) which together comprise 57 departments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/faculties-departments/faculty-factsheets|title=Faculty factsheets|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> Faculties are helmed by a Dean<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uct.ac.za/main/about/management/deans|title=Deans|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> and their administrative and operational matters are administered by a Director. The Senate has delegated substantial powers to the faculties in academic matters over their internal protocol and management  such as on matters concerning class timetables, admission requirements, academic exclusion, examinations, research projects and so on. Faculties vary substantially in student size and in buildings occupied, with the Commerce faculty having the highest student population and the Law faculty having the lowest while the Humanities faculty spans the most buildings followed by the Faculty of Health Sciences with the Commerce and Law faculties having (by far) the lowest physical footprint.<ref name=":7" />

Notwithstanding interdisciplinary research units and centers, additional academic structures exist that eschew the faculty-based organisational structure. The multidisciplinary Center for Higher Education Development ranks on an equal level as the faculties and the UCT Graduate School of Business maintains substantial latitude over its internal affairs despite being nominally part of the Faculty of Commerce. The interdisciplinary School of Information Technology, comprising the Departments of Information Systems and of Computer Science in the Commerce and Science faculties is neither a faculty nor a department but a coordinating mechanism to promote IT education and research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sit.uct.ac.za/sit/about|title=Introducing the School of IT|website=UCT School of IT|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>

== Funding ==
[[File:The_Hub,_Chancellor_Oppenheimer_Library,_University_of_Cape_Town.jpg|right|thumb|The central section of the Chancellor Oppenheimer Library.]]
The university's endowment (the financial capital and investment funds on which it can draw to carry out its work)<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-fund.asp|title=Endowment Fund Definition|last=Chen|first=James|date=3 April 2019|website=Investopedia|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> is deposited with the UCT Foundation (a legally independent nonprofit organisation) and it is managed by the Investment Office.<ref name=":5" /> Through the Distinguishing UCT fundraising campaign, the university is trying to raise its endowment. As of 2019, its designated endowment stands at R2.5 billion and its undesignated endowment stands at R676 million with R133 million raised for infrastructure projects (bringing the total undesignated endowment to R809 million which the university aims to increase to R1 billion).<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://distinguishinguct.uct.ac.za/cause/|title=The Campaign|website=Distinguishing UCT|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

There have been several campaigns at the university to divest its endowment. Fossil Free UCT was formally established in 2015 as a campaign by environmental activism lobbying groups and student organisations, most notably the Green Campus Initiative compel UCT to divest from fossil fuel companies which resulted in a non-binding resolution passed by UCT's Convocation in 2017 to support the divestment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.uct.ac.za/UCTGCI/projects/climate-action-project/divestment/|title=Divestment: Fossil Free UCT Timeline|website=UCT Green Campus Initiative|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> Student lobby groups, most notably the Palestinian Solidarity Front and the SRC called on the university's management to [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|divest from Israeli companies and organisations]] working in the [[Palestinian Occupied Territories]] (among other demands), which, in the end, the university refused to do.<ref>Price, Max. ''UCT response to calls to support anti-Israel measures.'' Issued by the Office of the Vice Chancellor, University of Cape Town, 2018.</ref>

The university's income comes from a combination of government grants, tuition fees, donations, investment and research income. In the 2017/2018 financial year, the university received R1.415 billion in state subsidies, R1.428 billion in tuition fees and R539 million in other income. R1.2 billion was committed to student financial aid for both undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University, the government through the NSFAS scheme and the university's partners and donors.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.uct.ac.za/images/userfiles/files/yearinreview/UCT_YearInReview_2018.pdf|title=Year in Review 2018|website=University of Cape Town|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

== Students and staff ==

{{As of|2016}}, there were 29,074 students enrolled (18,421 undergraduates and 10,653 postgraduates) and 4,542 staff were employed (1,179 academic and 3,363 professional, administrative, support and service staff).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uct.ac.za/main/explore-uct/factsheets|title=Fact sheets {{!}} University of Cape Town|website=www.uct.ac.za|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>

The UCT Employment Equity Plan April (2010 to 2015) indicated moderate but consistent changes in the demographic makeup of the staff body. The five-year plan specified specific targets ranging from between about 5% to 10% adjustments in the representation of SA black staff. According to the plan the staff makeup would have changed by 2015 by achieving either parity or more SA black staff than SA white in all categories other than senior lecturer and professor positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uct.ac.za/about/transformation/policies/ |title=Transformation Plan & Policies: UCT Employment Equity Plan (2010 - 2015) |work=About the University |publisher=University of Cape Town |accessdate=20 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320155618/https://www.uct.ac.za/about/transformation/policies/ |archive-date=20 March 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola noted that, in 2017, UCT employed 45 white professors, 38 black African, [[Cape Coloured]] or [[Indian South African]] professors, 67 foreign national professors and 7 who did not disclose their race.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-03-17-new-uct-vice-chancellor-transformation-student-engagement-high-on-the-agenda/|title=New UCT Vice-Chancellor: Transformation, student engagement high on the agenda {{!}} Daily Maverick|last=Merwe|first=Marelise Van Der|work=Daily Maverick|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Student life ==
UCT had 36 different sports clubs in 2003, including [[team sport]]s, [[individual sport]]s, [[extreme sport]]s and [[martial arts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsclubs.uct.ac.za/clubs.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030409074704/http://sportsclubs.uct.ac.za/clubs.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 April 2003 |title=Current Sports Clubs |publisher=Sportsclubs.uct.ac.za |accessdate=8 June 2007 }}</ref>

The University's sports teams, in particular the [[rugby union]] team, are known as the "[[Ikey Tigers]]" or the "Ikeys". The "Ikey" nickname originated in the 1910s as an [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] epithet applied to UCT students by the students of [[Stellenbosch University]], because of the supposed large number of Jewish students at UCT.<ref>{{cite book |last=Swanson |first=Felicity |editor=Field, Sean |title=Imagining the City: Memories and Cultures in Cape Town |url=http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/full_title_info.asp?id=2193 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 June 2007 |year=2007 |publisher=HSRC Press |location=Cape Town |isbn=978-0-7969-2179-6 |page=210 |chapter=‘Die SACS kom terug’: intervarsity rugby, masculinity and white identity at the University of Cape Town, 1960s-1970s |chapter-url=http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/download.asp?filename=013%20-%2011_Imagining_the_City~216200731940PM.pdf |display-editors=etal |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070426132201/http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/full_title_info.asp?id=2193 |archive-date=26 April 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Stellenbosch is UCT's traditional rugby opponent; an annual "Intervarsity" match is played between the two universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uct.ac.za/students/recreation/sports/overview/ |title=University of Cape Town / Current students / Sports, societies & recreation |publisher=Uct.ac.za |accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> The [[University of Cape Town F.C.|University of Cape Town Football Club]] also known as the "Ikeys Warriors" is the main team for association football (soccer), representing the university at tournaments such as [[Varsity Football (South Africa)|Varsity Football]].

As of 2007 there were more than 80 student societies at UCT, falling into five categories:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dsa.uct.ac.za/student-development/student-societies-organisations/overview/ |title=Student Affairs: Societies|accessdate=8 June 2020 |publisher=University of Cape Town}}</ref> 
* Academic societies for those interested in a particular field of study or studying a particular topic: The most prominent of these include the History and Current Affairs Society (HCA), the Space and Astronomy Society (SpaceSoc, also a [[SEDS]] South Africa chapter), [[UNASA UCT|the United Nations Association of South Africa]] (UNASA), and the Students for Law and Social Justice (SLSJ).
* Political societies, including branches of the youth wings of national political parties such as the [[South African Students Congress]] (SASCO), the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)#Democratic Alliance Youth|Democratic Alliance Students Organisation]] (DASO), and the [[African National Congress Youth League]].
* Religious societies, some of which are associated with religious denominations or local places of worship.
* National/cultural societies for students from particular countries or particular ethnic backgrounds.
* Special interest societies (such as RainbowUCT, the university's [[LGBTI]] society, UCT Mountain & Ski Club, UCT Ballroom and Latin dancing) for those interested in various activities or issues.

In addition to the plethora of student societies, there are several student organisations dedicated to the development of communities surrounding the University in the Cape Metropolitan Area. Some of the biggest include: [[SHAWCO]], Ubunye and RAG.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uct.ac.za/students/services/community/SHAWCO/ |title=Student Community Service: SHAWCO |accessdate=1 March 2010 |publisher=University of Cape Town |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129183309/http://www.uct.ac.za/students/services/community/SHAWCO/ |archive-date=29 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Recently, several students movements have developed, such as the [[Green Campus Initiative (UCT)|Green Campus Initiative]].

== Controversies ==

A debate at UCT over the removal of a statue of [[Cecil Rhodes]] spawned [[Rhodes Must Fall]] movement. The [[FeesMustFall]] movement, which began at Wits and spread to UCT, was inspired by the Rhodes Must Fall protests.

=== Destruction and censorship of art ===
Since the removal of the Rhodes statue, other art has been removed or destroyed. FeesMustFall students burned 23 of the university's historical paintings in February 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.groundup.org.za/article/rhodes-must-fall-protesters-destroy-uct-artworks/|title=Rhodes Must Fall protesters burn UCT art|last=Furlong|first=Ashleigh|date=17 February 2016|work=GroundUp|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>

According to GroundUp, art experts connected to the university are concerned about intolerance towards art at the institution, as UCT has removed and censored 75 further "vulnerable" art which it claims are offensive to students.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.groundup.org.za/article/uct-safe-space-art/|title=Is UCT a safe space for art?|last=Meersman|first=Brent|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=":2">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nc0CBuZ3f8 "Human Rights investigates the removal of artworks from UCT"], [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] Digital News, 5 May 2017</ref>

An Artworks Task Team was set up in September 2015 to assess art at the university "with a view to transformation and inclusivity",<ref name=":2" /> and went about finding "artworks on campus that may be seen to recognize or celebrate colonial oppressors and/or which may be offensive or controversial", and specifically artworks deemed to be "offensive" in their depiction of black people. Both [[Stanley Pinker]]’s ''Decline and Fall'', which makes ironic use of colonial iconology, and [[Breyten Breytenbach]]'s ''Hovering Dog'', which shows a black person wearing a white mask and a white person wearing a black mask, were removed;<ref name=":1" /> and [[Diane Victor]]’s ''Pasiphaë'', which depicts black farmers with allusions to Greek mythology, was covered by a wooden panel.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/now-snowflake-students-are-covering-up-paintings/18240|title=Now snowflake students are covering up paintings|last=Gillespie|first=Todd|date=12 April 2016|work=Spiked Online|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>{{better source|opinion pieces should not be used as sources for factual claims|date=April 2020}} In response, Breyten Breytenbach remarked that UCT were making fools of themselves,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-04-11-letter-to-the-editor-breyten-breytenbach-on-vanishing-uct-artworks-and-blank-minds/|title=Letter to the Editor: Breyten Breytenbach on vanishing UCT artworks and blank minds|last=Breytenbach|first=Breyten|date=11 April 2016|website=The Daily Maverick|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref> while Diane Victor thought UCT's actions were “slightly comical” and her artwork was being understood on a “simplistic level”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.groundup.org.za/article/prominent-artwork-covered-uct/|title=Prominent artwork covered up at UCT|last=Furlong|first=Asheligh|date=8 April 2016|work=GroundUp|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>

[[Jacques Rousseau (secular activist)|Jacques Rousseau]], then chair of the Academic Freedom Committee, told GroundUp: “There are a number of artworks in UCT’s collection that could legitimately be regarded as problematic. Even so, any piece of art is potentially offensive to someone, and the very point of art is to provoke reflection and sometimes discomfort." The Academic Freedom Committee noted with "grave concern recent instances of threats to [[academic freedom]]".<ref name=":1" />

The [[South African Human Rights Commission]] was investigating the matter as of May 2017, in order to determine whether the University was infringing on the constitutional right to freedom of expression, in particular the right to artistic creativity.<ref name=":2" />

== Popular culture ==
