Born in [[Chicago]], Stevens served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]] and graduated from [[Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law|Northwestern University School of Law]]. After clerking for Justice [[Wiley Blount Rutledge]], he co-founded a law firm in Chicago, focusing on [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]]. In 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Stevens to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]. Five years later, President [[Gerald Ford]] successfully nominated Stevens to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Justice [[William O. Douglas]]. He became the senior associate justice after the retirement of [[Harry Blackmun]] in 1994. Stevens retired during the administration of President [[Barack Obama]] and was succeeded by [[Elena Kagan]].

Stevens's majority opinions in landmark cases include ''[[Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council]]'', ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'', and ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]''. Stevens is also known for his dissents in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', ''[[Bush v.

The family lived in [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]], and Stevens attended the [[University of Chicago Laboratory Schools]] where he graduated in 1937. He later attended the [[University of Chicago]], where he majored in [[English studies|English]], was inducted into [[Phi Beta Kappa]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbk.org/justices|title=PBK - Phi Beta Kappa Supreme Court Justices|website=www.pbk.org}}</ref> and graduated with highest honors in 1941.<ref name=":4">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/john-paul-stevens-dead.html|title=Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, Who Led Liberal Wing, Dies at 99|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|date=July 16, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 19, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> While in college, Stevens also became a member of the [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-justice-ohn-paul-stevens-chicago-ties-20190717-spdktsolojdlznw2zquvn3wo5q-story.html|title=Retired Justice John Paul Stevens had many ties to Chicago — here are a few of them|last=Greene|first=Morgan|date=July 16, 2019|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724200723/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-justice-ohn-paul-stevens-chicago-ties-20190717-spdktsolojdlznw2zquvn3wo5q-story.html|archive-date=July 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

He began work on his master's degree in English at the university in 1941 but soon decided to join the [[United States Navy]]. He enlisted on December 6, 1941, one day before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and served as an intelligence officer in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] from 1942 to 1945.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/john-paul-stevens-dies-supreme-court.html|title=John Paul Stevens: Canny Strategist and the 'Finest Legal Mind' Ford Could Find|last=[[Adam Liptak|Liptak, Adam]]|date=July 16, 2019|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 18, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Stevens was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the codebreaking team whose work led to the downing of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane in 1943 ([[Operation Vengeance]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" />

Stevens married Elizabeth Jane Shereen in June 1942.

With the end of World War II, Stevens returned to Illinois, intending to return to his studies in English, but was persuaded by his brother Richard, who was a lawyer, to attend [[law school]]. Stevens enrolled in the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] in 1945 (the [[G.I. Bill]] mostly paying his way), where he would go on to earn the highest [[Grade (education)|GPA]] in the history of the law school.<ref name=":0" /> He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1947, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and first in his class.<ref>{{Cite web

=== Legal career, 1947–1970 ===
Stevens's stellar academic performance in law school inspired several prominent Northwestern faculty members to recommend him for a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] clerkship.<ref name=":0" /> He served as a [[List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States#Wiley Blount Rutledge|clerk]] to Justice [[Wiley Rutledge]] during the 1947–48 term.<ref name=":3" />

Following his clerkship, Stevens returned to Chicago and joined the law firm of Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson & Raymond (which, in the 1960s, would become [[Jenner & Block]]). Stevens was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1949. He determined that he would not stay long at the Poppenhusen firm after being docked his pay for the day he took off to travel to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to swear his oath of admission. During his time at the firm, Stevens began his practice in [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].

In 1951, he returned to Washington, DC, to serve as associate counsel to the Subcommittee on the Study of Monopoly Power of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] of the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. During this time, the subcommittee worked on several highly publicized investigation concerns in many industries, most notably [[Major League Baseball]].<ref name=":3" />

In 1952, Stevens returned to Chicago and, together with two other young lawyers with whom he had worked at Poppenhusen, Johnston, Thompson & Raymond, formed his own law firm: Rothschild, Stevens, Barry & Myers. It soon developed into a successful practice, with Stevens continuing to focus on antitrust cases. His growing expertise in antitrust law led to an invitation to teach the "Competition and Monopoly" course at the University of Chicago Law School, and from 1953 to 1955, he was a member of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]'s National Committee to Study Antitrust Laws. At the same time, Stevens was making a name for himself as a first-rate antitrust litigator and was involved in a number of trials. He was widely regarded by colleagues as an extraordinarily capable and impressive lawyer with a fantastic memory and analytical ability, and authored a number of influential works on antitrust law.<ref>John Paul Stevens, Exemptions from Antitrust Coverage, 37 Antitrust L.J. 706 (1972); John Paul Stevens, Cost Justification, 8 Antitrust Bull. 413 (1963); John Paul Stevens, The Regulation of Railroads, 19 Antitrust L.J. 355 (1961); John Paul Stevens, The Robinson–Patman Act Prohibitions, 38 Chicago Bar Rec. 310 (1956); John Paul Stevens, Tying Arrangements, in Northwestern Antitrust Conference on the Antitrust Laws and the Attorney General's Committee Report (1955); John Paul Stevens, Defense of Meeting the Lower Price of a Competitor, in 1953 Summer Institute on Federal Antitrust Laws, University of Michigan Law School; Book Review, 28 Notre Dame L.

In 1969, the Greenberg Commission, appointed by the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] to investigate [[Sherman Skolnick]]'s corruption allegations leveled at former chief justice [[Ray Klingbiel]] and current chief justice [[Roy Solfisburg]], named Stevens as their counsel, meaning that he essentially served as the commission's [[special prosecutor]].<ref name=":0" /> The commission was widely thought to be a whitewash, but Stevens proved them wrong by vigorously prosecuting the justices, forcing them from office in the end.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Illinois Justice: The Scandal of 1969 and the Rise of John Paul Stevens|last=Manaster|first=Kenneth A.|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2001|location=[[Chicago]]}}</ref> As a result of the prominence he gained during the Greenberg Commission, Stevens became the second vice president of the [[Chicago Bar Association]] in 1970.

=== Judicial career, 1970–2010 ===
Stevens's role in the Greenberg Commission catapulted him to prominence and was largely responsible for [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]]'s decision to appoint Stevens as a judge of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] on November 20, 1970. His nomination was put forth by a former [[University of Chicago]] classmate, Illinois Senator [[Charles H. Percy]].<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/a_man_of_moderation|title=Man of Moderation: Last Justice of 'Greatest Generation,' Says Farewell|last=Ward|first=Stephanie Francis|date=May 1, 2019|work=[[ABA Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724201008/http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/a_man_of_moderation|archive-date=July 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

When [[Harry Blackmun]] retired in 1994, Stevens became the senior associate justice and thus assumed the administrative duties of the Court whenever the post of [[Chief Justice of the United States]] was vacant or the chief justice was unable to perform his duties. Stevens performed the duties of chief justice in September 2005, between the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] and the swearing-in of his replacement, Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], and presided over oral arguments on a number of occasions when the chief justice was ill or recused. Also in September 2005, Stevens was honored with a symposium by [[Fordham Law School]] for his 30 years on the Supreme Court, and President Ford wrote a letter stating his continued pride in appointing him.<ref>[http://law.fordham.edu/17679.htm The Jurisprudence of Justice John Paul Stevens] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112192207/http://law.fordham.edu/17679.htm |date=November 12, 2013}}, ''[[Fordham Law School]]'', April 9, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://law.fordham.edu/assets/Newsroom/FordhamLRev74_PresidentFordLetter.pdf.pdf Justice John Paul Stevens, 30 Years on the Supreme Court] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211145239/http://law.fordham.edu/assets/Newsroom/FordhamLRev74_PresidentFordLetter.pdf.pdf |date=December 11, 2011}}, President Ford, ''[[Fordham Law School]]'', September 21, 2005.</ref>

In a 2005 speech, Stevens stressed the importance of "learning on the job"; for example, during his tenure on the Court, Stevens changed his views on [[affirmative action]] (initially opposed), as well as on other issues.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/washington/18memo.html?hp Justice Stevens Renounces Capital Punishment], April 18, 2008.</ref> President Ford praised Stevens in 2005: "He is serving his nation well, with dignity, intellect and without partisan political concerns."<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-10-09-bush-miers-edit_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bush's words saddle Miers: 'She's not going to change' | first=Tony | last=Mauro | date=October 9, 2005 | access-date=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

=== Tenure and age ===
Stevens retired on June 29, 2010 as the [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States by time in office|third-longest-serving justice]] in the history of the Supreme Court with 34 years and six months of service and just three days short of tying the tenure of the second-longest serving justice in history, [[Stephen Johnson Field]], who had retired on December 1, 1897. The longest-serving justice is Stevens's immediate predecessor, Justice [[William O. Douglas]], who served 36½ years and retired on November 12, 1975. He was the last veteran of the [[Burger Court]] to remain on the bench.

Stevens was also the second-oldest justice, at age 90 years and two months at retirement, behind [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] who retired at the age of 90 years and 10 months on January 12, 1932. On July 23, 2015, Stevens became the longest-lived retired justice, surpassing [[Stanley Forman Reed]] who died at age 95 years and 93 days on April 2, 1980.

On June 26, 2015, Stevens attended the Court's announcement of the opinion in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'', in which the Court ruled 5–4 that recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] is protected under the Constitution's [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html|title=Supreme Court Ruling Makes Same-Sex Marriage a Right Nationwide|last1=Liptak, Adam|date=June 25, 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 27, 2015|quote=Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired in 2010, was on hand for the decision|author1-link=Adam Liptak}}</ref>

[[Abner Mikva]], a close friend, said that as a judge, Stevens refused to discuss politics. "He was more particular about it than a lot of them," Mikva stated.<ref name=":5" />

In 2018, Stevens told a Boca Raton crowd that [[Brett Kavanaugh]]'s performance during recent Senate hearings should disqualify him from the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] bench, citing the potential for political bias should he serve on the Supreme Court.<ref name=":6">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kavanaugh-stevens/kavanaugh-does-not-belong-on-supreme-court-says-retired-justice-stevens-idUSKCN1ME2P8|title=Kavanaugh does not belong on Supreme Court, retired Justice Stevens says|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|access-date=October 5, 2018}}</ref> Kavanaugh was nominated by Republican president [[Donald Trump]].<ref name=":6" />

== Judicial philosophy ==
On the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], Stevens had a moderately [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] record. Early in his tenure on the Supreme Court, Stevens had a relatively moderate voting record. He voted to reinstate [[capital punishment in the United States]] and opposed race-based admissions programs, such as the program at issue in ''[[Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke|Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'', {{Ussc|438|265|1978}}. However, on the more conservative [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] Court, Stevens joined the more liberal justices on issues such as [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]], [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay rights]] and [[federalism]]. His [[Segal–Cover score]], a measure of the perceived liberalism/conservatism of Court members when they joined the Court, places him squarely on the conservative side of the Court.<ref name="perceived">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/polisci/jsegal/QualTable.pdf|title=Perceived Qualifications and Ideology of Supreme Court Nominees, 1937-2012|last1=Segal|first1=Jeffrey A.|access-date=April 4, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215100705/http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/polisci/jsegal/QualTable.pdf|archive-date=February 15, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, a 2003 statistical analysis of Supreme Court voting patterns found Stevens the most liberal member of the Court.<ref>''See'', [http://pooleandrosenthal.com/the_unidimensional_supreme_court.htm The Unidimensional Supreme Court, July 10, 2003.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113065927/http://pooleandrosenthal.com/the_unidimensional_supreme_court.htm |date=January 13, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Lawrence Sirovich, [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/1132164100v1 "A Pattern Analysis of the Second Rehnquist Court"], Proceedings of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] 100 (June 24, 2003).</ref> President Ford expressed no regrets about Stevens' drift toward liberalism, writing in a 2005 letter to ''[[USA Today]]'', "Justice Stevens has made me, and our fellow citizens, proud of my three decade old decision to appoint him to the Supreme Court."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Gerald |author-link=Gerald Ford |date=September 21, 2005 |title=Letter from Gerald R.

Stevens's jurisprudence has usually been characterized as [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]]. Stevens, unlike most justices, reviewed petitions for [[certiorari]] within his chambers instead of having his [[law clerk]]s participate as part of the [[cert pool]] and usually wrote the first drafts of his opinions himself;<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> when asked to explain why, he said: "I'm the one hired to do the job." He further explained that he continued to learn about cases and legal theories as he drafted his opinions and re-evaluates his positions on cases while writing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peppers |first=Todd C. |date=2006 |title=Courtiers of the Marble Palace: The Rise and Influence of the Supreme Court Law Clerk |location=[[Redwood City, California]] |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=195 |isbn=9780804753814}}</ref>

He was not an [[originalism|originalist]] (such as [[Antonin Scalia]]) nor a pragmatist (such as Judge [[Richard Posner]]), nor did he pronounce himself a cautious liberal (such as Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]).<ref name=":1" /> He was considered part of the liberal bloc of the Court starting in the mid-1980s, and was dubbed the "chief justice of the liberal Supreme Court",<ref>Lawrence D.

In 1985s ''[[City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.|Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center]]'', {{Ussc|473|432|1985}}, Stevens argued against the Supreme Court's famous "[[strict scrutiny]]" doctrine for laws involving "suspect classifications", putting forth the view that all classifications should be evaluated on the basis of the "rational basis" test as to whether they could have been enacted by an "impartial legislature". In ''[[Burnham v. Superior Court of California]]'', {{Ussc|495|604|1990}}, Stevens demonstrated his independence with a characteristically pithy concurrence.

Stevens was once an impassioned critic of [[affirmative action]]; in addition to the 1978 decision in ''Bakke'', he dissented in the case of ''[[Fullilove v. Klutznick]]'', {{Ussc|448|448|1980}}, which upheld a minority set-aside program. He shifted his position over the years and voted to uphold the [[affirmative action]] program at the [[University of Michigan Law School]] challenged in 2003's ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', {{Ussc|539|306|2003}}.

Stevens wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in 2006, in which he held that certain military commissions had been improperly constituted. He also wrote a lengthy dissenting opinion in ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'', arguing the majority should not make a decision so broad that it would overturn precedents set in three previous Supreme Court cases. When reviewing his career at the Supreme Court in his 2019 book, ''The Making of a Justice: Reflections on My First 94 years'', Stevens lamented being unable to persuade his colleagues against a decision for ''Citizens United'', which he described as "a disaster for our election law."<ref>[[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Rosen, Jeffrey]], ''[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/justice-stevens-was-impartial-end/594184/?silverid-ref=NTgzMTI1ODYxODM2S0 The Impartial Justice]'', The Atlantic, July 17, 2019</ref>

[[File:US Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens - 1976 official portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Stevens's official portrait, 1976]]

=== Freedom of speech ===
Stevens's views on obscenity under the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] changed over the years. He was initially quite critical of constitutional protection for obscenity, rejecting a challenge to [[Detroit]] zoning ordinances that barred adult theaters in designated areas in 1976's ''[[Young v. American Mini Theatres]]'', {{Ussc|427|50|1976}}, ("[E]ven though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of [[erotic]] materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society's interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different, and lesser, magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate"), but later in his tenure adhered firmly to a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] free speech approach on obscenity issues, voting to strike down a federal law regulating online obscene content considered "harmful to minors" in 2002's ''[[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2002)|ACLU v. Ashcroft]]'', {{Ussc|535|564|2002}}, which in a dissenting opinion Stevens argued that while "[a]s a parent, grandparent, and great-grandparent", he endorsed the legislative goal of protecting children from pornography "without reservation": "As a judge, I must confess to a growing sense of unease when the interest in protecting children from prurient materials is invoked as a justification for using criminal regulation of speech as a substitute for, or a simple backup to, adult oversight of children's viewing."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=03-218|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw}}</ref>

Perhaps the most personal and unusual feature of his jurisprudence was his continual referencing of World War II in his opinions. For example, Stevens, a World War II veteran, was visibly angered by [[William Kunstler]]'s flippant defense of flag-burning in oral argument in 1989's ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', {{Ussc|491|397|1989}} and voted to uphold a prohibition on flag-burning against a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] argument. Stevens wrote, "The ideas of liberty and equality have been an irresistible force in motivating leaders like [[Patrick Henry]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]], schoolteachers like [[Nathan Hale]] and [[Booker T. Washington]], the [[Philippine Scouts]] who fought at [[Bataan]], and the soldiers who scaled the bluff at [[Omaha Beach]]. If those ideas are worth fighting for—and our history demonstrates that they are—it cannot be true that the flag that uniquely symbolizes their power is not itself worthy of protection from unnecessary desecration."

Stevens generally supported students' right to free speech in public schools. He wrote sharply-worded dissents in ''[[Bethel v. Fraser]]'', {{Ussc|478|675|1986}} and ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', {{Ussc|551|393|2007}}, two decisions that restricted students' freedom of speech. However, he joined the court's ruling on ''[[Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier]]'', {{Ussc|484|260|1988}} which upheld a principal's censorship of a [[student newspaper]].

=== Establishment Clause ===
In ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'', {{Ussc|472|38|1985}}, striking down an Alabama statute mandating a minute of silence in public schools "for meditation or silent prayer", Stevens wrote the opinion for a majority that included justices [[William J. Brennan Jr.|William Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], and [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]]. He affirmed that the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] is binding on the States via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and that: "Just as the right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of a broader concept of individual freedom of mind, so also the individual's freedom to choose his own creed is the counterpart of his right to refrain from accepting the creed of the majority. At one time, it was thought that this right merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been examined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all."

Stevens wrote a dissent in ''[[Van Orden v. Perry]]'', {{Ussc|545|677|2005}},  in which he was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; he argued that the ten commandments displayed in the [[Texas Capitol]] grounds transmitted the message: "This State endorses the divine code of the 'Judeo-Christian' God." The Establishment Clause, he wrote, "at the very least ... has created a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property", and that it "demands religious neutrality—Government may not exercise preference for one religious faith over another". This includes a prohibition against enacting laws or imposing requirements that aid all religions as against unbelievers, or aid religions that are based on a belief in the existence of God against those founded on different principles.

=== Commerce clause and states' rights ===
When interpreting the [[interstate commerce clause]], Stevens consistently sided with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. He dissented from ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', {{Ussc|514|549|1995}} and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', {{Ussc|529|598|2000}}, two prominent cases in which the [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] court changed direction by holding that Congress had exceeded its constitutional power under the commerce clause. He then authored ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', {{Ussc|545|1|2005}}, which permits the federal government to arrest, [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who use [[medical marijuana]] regardless of whether such use is legally permissible under state law.

=== Fourth Amendment ===
Stevens had a generally libertarian voting record on the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which deals with [[search and seizure]]. Stevens authored the majority opinion in ''[[Arizona v. Gant]]'', which held that "police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant's arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest." He dissented in ''[[New Jersey v. T. L. O.]]'', {{Ussc|469|325|1985}} and ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'', {{Ussc|515|646|1995}}, both involving searches in schools. He was a dissenter in ''[[Oliver v. United States]]'', {{Ussc|466|170|1984}}, a case relating to the [[open-fields doctrine]]. However, in ''[[United States v. Montoya De Hernandez]]'', {{Ussc|473|531|1985}}, he sided with the government, and he was the author of ''[[United States v. Ross]]'', {{Ussc|456|798|1982}}, which permits the police to search closed containers found in the course of searching a vehicle. He also authored the dissent in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', {{Ussc|533|27|2001}}, which held that the use of thermal imaging requires a warrant.

In a 2009 paper, [[Ward Farnsworth]] argued that Stevens' "dissents against type" (in Stevens' case, votes in dissent in favor of the government's position and against the accused, such as the one in ''Kyllo'') suggest that while Stevens "[believed] strongly in laying out resources for the sake of accuracy and opportunities to protest an unfair trial, [he is] not nearly as concerned about restraining the government at the front end of the process, when it is gathering evidence—for the costs of invaded rights then are to ''liberty'' rather than to ''accuracy''".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth| first=Ward|author-link=Ward Farnsworth|title=Dissents against type|ssrn=1282072|year=2009}}</ref>

=== Death penalty ===
Stevens joined the majority in ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', {{Ussc|428|153|1976}}, which overruled ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', {{Ussc|408|238|1972}} and again allowed the use of the death penalty in the United States. In later cases such as ''[[Thompson v. Oklahoma]]'', {{Ussc|487|815|1988}} and ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', {{Ussc|536|304|2002}}, Stevens held that the Constitution forbids the use of the death penalty in certain circumstances. Stevens opposed using the death penalty on [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] offenders; he dissented in ''[[Stanford v. Kentucky]]'', {{Ussc|492|361|1989}} and joined the Court's majority in ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', {{Ussc|543|551|2005}}, overturning ''Stanford''. In ''[[Baze v. Rees]]'', {{Ussc|553|35|2008}}, Stevens voted with the majority in upholding [[Kentucky]]'s method of lethal injection, because he felt bound by ''[[Precedent|stare decisis]]''. However, he opined that "state-sanctioned killing is&nbsp;... becoming more and more anachronistic" and agreed with former justice [[Byron White]]'s assertion that "the needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purposes ... would be patently excessive," in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] (quoting from White's concurrence in ''Furman'').<ref>Greenhouse, Linda (April 17, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/washington/17scotus.html?_r=1&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all "Justices Uphold Lethal Injection in Kentucky Case"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', retrieved April 12, 2010.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-5439.ZC1.html|title=BAZE v.

He questioned whether Kentucky Derby second-place finisher [[Eight Belles]] died more humanely than those on death row.<ref>Slater, Dan (May 12, 2008), [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2008/05/12/eight-belles-euthanasia-more-humane-than-capital-punishment/?mod=WSJBlog/trackback/ "Eight Belle's Euthanasia: More Humane Than Capital Punishment?"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Associated Press, retrieved April 12, 2010.</ref> He explained that his death penalty decisions were influenced, in part, by an increasing awareness through [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] of the fallibility of death sentences, and the fact that death-qualified juries come with a set of biases.<ref>Weiss, Debra Cassens (May 7, 2010).[http://www.abajournal.com/weekly/article/stevens_explains_death_penalty_stance_bow_ties "Stevens Explains Death Penalty Stance, Bow Ties"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130116102722/http://www.abajournal.com/weekly/article/stevens_explains_death_penalty_stance_bow_ties |date=January 16, 2013}}.

== Other significant opinions ==
=== ''Chevron'' ===
Stevens authored the majority opinion in ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'', {{Ussc|467|837|1984}}.<ref>Breyer, Stewart, Sunstein & Vermeule, ''Administrative Law & Regulatory Policy'', p. 247.</ref> The opinion stands for how courts review administrative agencies' interpretations of their organic statutes. If the organic statute unambiguously expresses the will of Congress, the court enforces the legislature's intent. If the statute is unclear (and is thus thought to reflect a Congressional delegation of power to the agency to interpret the statute), and the agency interpretation has the force of law, courts defer to an agency's interpretation of the statute unless that interpretation is deemed to be "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute". This doctrine is now generally referred to as "''Chevron'' deference" among legal practitioners.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Sanford N.|date=February 26, 1996|title=Who Says It's a Crime?: Chevron Deference to Agency Interpretations of Regulatory Statutes That Create Criminal Liability|url=http://works.bepress.com/sanford_greenberg/2/|journal=[[University of Pittsburgh Law Review]]|volume=58}}</ref>

Unlike some other members of the court, Stevens was consistently willing to find [[Organic statute (United States)|organic statutes]] unambiguous and thus overturn agency interpretations of those statutes. (See his majority opinion in ''[[Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Cardoza-Fonseca]]'', {{Ussc|480|421|1987}}, and his dissent in ''Young v. Community Nutrition Institute'', {{Ussc|476|974|1986}}.) Although ''Chevron'' has come to stand for the proposition of deference to agency interpretations, Stevens, the author of the opinion, was less willing to defer to agencies than the rest of his colleagues on the Court.

=== ''Crawford v. Marion County Election Board'' ===
Stevens wrote the lead opinion in ''[[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board]]'', a case where the Court upheld the right of states to require an official photo identification card to help ensure that only citizens vote. [[Chief Justice John Roberts]] and Justice Anthony Kennedy joined this opinion, and justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and [[Samuel Alito]] agreed with them on the outcome. Edward B. Foley, an election law expert at [[Ohio State University]], said the Stevens opinion might represent an effort to "depoliticize election law cases."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/washington/29scotus.html|title=In a 6-to-3 Vote, Justices Uphold a Voter ID Law|last=[[Linda Greenhouse|Greenhouse, Linda]]|date=April 29, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=July 24, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Stevens's vote in ''Crawford'' and his agreement with the Court's conservative majority in two other cases during the 2007–2008 term (''[[Medellin v.

Rees]]'') led [[University of Oklahoma]] law professor and former Stevens clerk [[Joseph Thai]] to wonder if Stevens was "tacking back a little bit toward the center."<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Press |first1=The Associated |title=Justice Stevens hard to predict |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2008/05/10/justice-stevens-hard-to-predict/ |access-date=July 17, 2019 |work=The Denver Post |date=May 10, 2008}}</ref>

=== ''Bush v. Gore'' ===
In ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{Ussc|531|98|2000}}, Stevens wrote a scathing dissent on the Court's ruling to stay the recount of votes in [[Florida]] during the 2000 presidential election. He believed that the holding displayed "an unstated lack of confidence in the impartiality and capacity of the state judges who would make the critical decisions if the vote count were to proceed". He continued, "The endorsement of that position by the majority of this Court can only lend credence to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted by today's decision. One thing, however, is certain. Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."

=== Second Amendment ===
Stevens wrote the primary [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' {{Ussc|554|570|2008}}, a [[list of landmark court decisions in the United States|landmark case]] which amended the interpretation of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] and the [[right to keep and bear arms]]. ''DC v. Heller'' [[judicial review in the United States|struck down]] provisions of the [[Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975]] and held that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] protects an individual's right to possess a [[firearm]] unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. His dissent was joined by justices [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]]; the majority opinion was written by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].

Stevens stated that the court's judgment was "a strained and unpersuasive reading" which overturned longstanding [[precedent]], and that the court had "bestowed a dramatic upheaval in the law."<ref name="Greenhouse">{{Cite news |first=Linda |last=Greenhouse |author-link=Linda Greenhouse |title=Justices Rule for Individual Gun Rights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/washington/27scotuscnd.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 27, 2008 |access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> Stevens also stated that the amendment was notable for the "omission of any statement of purpose related to the right to use firearms for hunting or personal self-defense" which was present in the Declarations of Rights of [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776#Declaration of Rights|Pennsylvania]] and [[Constitution of Vermont (1777)|Vermont]].<ref name="Greenhouse" /> The Stevens dissent seems to rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders would have made the individual right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the "militia" preamble and exact phrase "to keep and bear arms" demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts' later "collective-right" reading of the Miller decision constitutes {{Lang|la|[[stare decisis]]|italic=yes}}, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the [[National Firearms Act]]) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, "The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons. ...&nbsp;I could not possibly conclude that the Framers made such a choice."

LXVI, no. 14 (September 26, 2019), pp.&nbsp;20, 22, 24. John Paul Stevens, "a throwback to the postwar liberal Republican [U.S. Supreme Court] appointees", questioned the validity of "the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]], which holds that you cannot sue any state or federal government agency, or any of its officers or employees, for any wrong they may have committed against you, unless the state or federal government consents to being sued" (p.&nbsp;20); the propriety of "the increasing resistance of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to most meaningful forms of [[gun control]]" (p.&nbsp;22); and "the constitutionality of the [[death penalty]]... because of incontrovertible evidence that innocent people have been sentenced to death."
