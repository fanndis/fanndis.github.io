"'''3-Way (The Golden Rule)'''" is a song recorded by American [[comedy music]] group [[The Lonely Island]] featuring American singers [[Justin Timberlake]] and [[Lady Gaga]]. It appeared as an [[SNL Digital Short]] in the May 21, 2011 episode of the American [[sketch comedy]] television series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), which saw Timberlake and Gaga as the [[Saturday Night Live#Hosts and musical guests|host and musical guest]], respectively. It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 24, three days after the broadcast. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song was written by [[Andy Samberg]], [[Akiva Schaffer]], [[Jorma Taccone]], and Timberlake, while produced by [[The Futuristics]] with additional production from [[Asa Taccone]] and Ryan & Smitty. Samberg and Timberlake were nervous about presenting the idea to Gaga, who initially failed to find the humor in the song.

The music video, which aired on the ''SNL'' broadcast, is a sequel to the "[[Motherlover]]" sketch and finds Samberg and Timberlake reprising their roles from that skit as they sing about having a [[threesome]] with Gaga. The song and sketch received positive reviews from critics who called it one of the funniest moments of the episode. "3-Way (The Golden Rule)" received a nomination at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]] for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, but it lost to another song from the same ''SNL'' episode.

==Background and writing==

In the midst of the announcement that [[Justin Timberlake]] would host ''Saturday Night Live'' on May 21, 2011, many media commentators speculated that there would be a recurrence of the two characters that he and comedian [[Andy Samberg]] portrayed in past SNL Digital Shorts ("[[Dick in a Box]]" and "[[Motherlover]]").<ref name="tvsquad">{{Cite news |url= http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/05/23/snl-digital-short-three-way-timberlake-gaga-samberg-video/ |title= ''SNL'' Digital Short: '3-Way' With Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga and Andy Samberg |last= Hughes |first= Jason |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate= May 24, 2011 |newspaper= TV Squad }}</ref> Speculation only increased when photos of Samberg and Timberlake shooting a music video, donning the same suits worn in "Dick in a Box", were released to the media.<ref name="hp">{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/22/timberlake-samberg-snl-three-way_n_865225.html|title= Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga & Andy Samberg In Three-Way ''SNL'' Digital Short |last= Hartsell|first= Carol|date=May 22, 2011 |accessdate= May 24, 2011 |newspaper= [[HuffPost]] }}</ref>

The track named "3-Way (The Golden Rule)", was written on May 19, with the music video being shot a day later. It was written by [[Andy Samberg]], [[Akiva Schaffer]], [[Jorma Taccone]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[The Futuristics]], with the latter producing the track with [[Asa Taccone]] and Ryan & Smitty.<ref name="liner"/> Samberg confirmed that the song was written with keeping Gaga in mind since she was set to appear on ''Saturday Night Live'' that week, along with Timberlake. "We knew we wanted to do another one with Justin and thought it would be awesome to get [Gaga] involved just to up the ante, because we had already done two", he concluded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/the-lonely-island-talks-about-the-slightly-more-ma-99057|title=The Lonely Island talks about the slightly more mature Wack Album|last=Kompanek|first=Christopher|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2015|work=[[The A.V.

A [[new jack swing]] song, "3-Way (The Golden Rule)"'s premise follows the early 1990s pop duo (Samberg and Timberlake) finding themselves invited to a threesome with "the girl [they] met at the [[Payless ShoeSource]]" (Gaga).<ref name="time">{{Cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/22/justin-timberlake-and-andy-samberg-join-lady-gaga-on-snl-finale/ |title= Justin Timberlake and Andy Samberg Join Lady Gaga for 'Threeway' on SNL Finale |last= Carbone|first=Nick|date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate= May 24, 2011 |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] }}</ref><ref name="bestsketch">{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/justin-timberlake-lady-gaga-snl-191023 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first=Aaron | last=Couch | title=Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga on SNL: The Best Sketches (VIDEO) | date=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="rsrev"/> Gaga's character acknowledges that "most guys won't freak together," but the two conclude that "it's not gay, when it's in a three-way," and that they should follow "The Golden Rule".

I wish that they filmed the backstage scenario as both Justin and Andy Samberg tried simultaneously to pitch this idea to me and they both choked on the way in.

==Critical response==
The song and sketch received positive reviews from critics. Matt Donnelly of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the skit, writing, "Timberlake and Samberg work an intentionally cheesy R&B shtick with hilarious results."<ref name="Donnelly">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/05/justin-timberlake-gaga-snl-andy-samberg-3way.html|title=Justin Timberlake scores Lady Gaga and Andy Samberg for '3-Way' on 'SNL'|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|date=May 23, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 3, 2011}}</ref> Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented, "The old-school rap details were impeccable as always," though he was unsure about the intentions of the song's lyrics.

However, Annie Galvin from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' criticized the song, saying that the composition of the track was comparable to that of their previous release "Motherlover", explaining that it fell "flatter than most of the other songs on the album".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/the-lonely-island-the-wack-album|title=The Lonely Island: The Wack Album|date=June 11, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2015|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref> "3-Way" received a nomination for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]].

The music video for "3-Way" was shot on May 20, 2011, the same day the song was recorded, and aired as the [[SNL Digital Short]] during the May 21 ''SNL'' broadcast.<ref name="liner"/> Timberlake and Samberg appear in the video as their characters aka "2:30 AM,"<ref>http://www.wmagazine.com/people/celebrities/2011/10/justin-timberlake-amanda-seyfried-in-time-cover-story/</ref> from the "[[Dick in a Box]]" and "[[Motherlover]]" sketches.<ref name="Huffington">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/22/timberlake-samberg-snl-three-way_n_865225.html|title=Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga & Andy Samberg In Three-Way 'SNL Digital Short' (VIDEO)|date=May 22, 2011|work=[[HuffPost]]|accessdate=October 3, 2011|first=Carol|last=Hartsell}}</ref> "3-Way" is a sequel to the "Motherlover" sketch.<ref name="Byrne"/> The clip begins with each half of the duo exiting the house of the other's mother (played by [[Patricia Clarkson]] and [[Susan Sarandon]])<ref name="Huffington"/> as the mothers grab the young men seductively. Timberlake and Samberg then greet each other, simultaneously saying, "Your mom says hi. [[Jinx (children's game)|Jinx]]!" before they are seen in various locations around town as they sing the song's introduction ("yeah yeah yeah" repeated several times). Timberlake sings about his plans to have a sexual encounter with a girl he met the previous week at a Payless ShoeSource store, while Samberg reveals similar plans about "a cutie [...] who loves the way I knock on her boots." They then leave, agreeing to meet back with each other in a few hours. They are both then seen outside of Gaga's apartment, where it is revealed that both of them agreed to have sex with her, though they did not know the other was also planning to do the same. She explains that she invited them both there so that they could have a threesome, which they quickly agree to do, citing the "golden rule" that "it's not [[gay]] when it's in a 3-way." Later, Gaga walks back into the bedroom with a bowl of cereal to find Timberlake and Samberg under the covers together, apparently not realizing she has left.
