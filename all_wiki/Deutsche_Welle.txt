DW has been broadcasting since 1953. It is headquartered in Bonn, where its radio programmes are produced. However, television broadcasts are produced almost entirely in Berlin. Both locations create content for DW's news website.

It is also a provider of [[live streaming world news]] which can be viewed via its website, [[YouTube]], and various [[mobile devices]] and [[digital media players|digital media and audio]].

As of 2018, around 1,500 employees and 1,500 freelancers from 60 countries work for Deutsche Welle in its offices in Bonn and Berlin.<ref name="German profile">{{cite web|title = Profil DW|url = https://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/DE/Bundesregierung/BeauftragtefuerKulturundMedien/medien/deutscheWelle/_node.html|publisher = Deutsche Welle|access-date = 2017-11-06|language = de|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171019042346/https://www.bundesregierung.de/Webs/Breg/DE/Bundesregierung/BeauftragtefuerKulturundMedien/medien/deutscheWelle/_node.html|archive-date = 19 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Director-General of DW is [[Peter Limbourg]].

==History==
===Beginnings===
DW's first shortwave broadcast took place on 3 May 1953 with an address by the then West German President, [[Theodor Heuss]]. On 11 June 1953, [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] public broadcasters signed an agreement to share responsibility for Deutsche Welle. At first, it was controlled by [[Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk]] (NWDR). In 1955, NWDR split into [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] (WDR), WDR assumed responsibility for Deutsche Welle programming. In 1960, Deutsche Welle became an independent public body after a court ruled that while broadcasting ''to'' Germany was a state matter, broadcasting ''from'' Germany was part of the federal government's foreign-affairs function. On 7 June 1962 DW joined [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] as a national broadcasting station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundestag.de/blob/410184/fb231184dbeb8473b6ce405adec4274f/wd-10-012-14-pdf-data.pdf |title=Data |website=www.bundestag.de |language=ru}}</ref> Deutsche Welle was originally headquartered in the West German city of [[Cologne]]. After [[German reunification|reunification]], when much of the government relocated to Berlin, the station's headquarters moved to Bonn.

===German reunification===
With [[German reunification]] in 1990, [[Radio Berlin International]] (RBI), [[East Germany|East Germany's international broadcaster]] ceased to exist. Some of the RBI staff joined Deutsche Welle and DW inherited some broadcasting facilities, including transmitting facilities at [[Nauen]], as well as RBI's frequencies.

'''DW (TV)''' began as '''RIAS-TV''', a television station launched by the [[West Berlin]] broadcaster RIAS (Radio in the American Sector / [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor]]) in August 1988; they also acquired the German Educational Television Network in the United States. The fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German- and English-language television channel broadcast via [[satellite]], DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, 2 hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.

Deutsche Welle took over some of the former independent radio broadcasting service [[Deutschlandfunk]]'s foreign-language programming in 1993, when Deutschlandfunk was absorbed into the new [[Deutschlandradio]].

In addition to radio and television programming, DW sponsored some published material. For example, the South-Asia Department published ''German Heritage: A Series Written for the South Asia Programme'' in 1967 and in 1984 published ''African Writers on the Air''. Both publications were transcripts of DW programming.

===Internet presence===
In September 1994, Deutsche Welle was the first public broadcaster in Germany with an internet presence, initially '''www-dw.gmd.de''', hosted by the GMD Information Technology Research Center. For its first two years, the site listed little more than contact addresses, although DW's ''News Journal'' was broadcast in [[RealAudio]] from Real's server beginning in 1995, and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]''{{'}}s initial web presence, which included news articles from the newspaper, shared the site. In 1996, it evolved into a news website using the URL '''dwelle.de'''; in 2001, the URL changed to '''www.dw-world.de''', and was changed again in 2012, to '''www.dw.de'''. Deutsche Welle purchased the domain '''dw.com''', which previously belonged to [[DiamondWare]], in 2013; DW had attempted to claim ownership of the address in 2000, without success. DW eventually moved to the '''www.dw.com''' domain on 22 June 2015. According to DW, their website delivers information by topic with an intuitive navigation organized to meet users' expectations. The layout offers more flexibility to feature pictures, videos and in-depth reporting on the day's events in a multimedia and multilingual fashion. They also integrated their Media Center into the dw.de website making it easier for users to access videos, audios and picture galleries from DW's multimedia archive of reports, programs and coverage of special issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/dw-introduces-new-website-and-tv-program/a-15714267|title=DW introduces new website and TV program {{!}} DW {{!}} 05.02.2012|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

DW's news site is in seven core languages ([[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], English, German, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese for Brazil]], and Russian), as well as a mixture of news and information in 23 other languages in which Deutsche Welle broadcasts. [[Persian language|Persian]] became the site's eighth focus language in 2007.

German and European news is DW's central focus, but the site also offers background information about Germany and German language courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/learn-german/s-2469|title=Learn German|website=www.dw.com|access-date=2017-08-05}}</ref> '''''Deutsch, Warum Nicht?''''' (literally: ''German, Why Not?'') is a personal course for learning the German language, created by Deutsche Welle and the [[Goethe-Institut]].<ref>[http://www.dw.de/learn-german/deutsch-warum-nicht/s-2548 ''Deutsch, Warum Nicht?'']. ''Deutsche Welle''. Retrieved 5 August 2017.</ref>

===Recent events===
In 2001, Deutsche Welle (in conjunction with ARD and [[ZDF]]) founded the ''German TV'' subscription channel for North American viewers. The project was shut down after four years owing to low subscriber numbers. It has since been replaced by the [[DW-TV]] channel (also a subscription service).

Unlike most other international broadcasters, DW-TV does not charge terrestrial stations for use of its programming, and as a result, ''[[Journal (German TV programme)|Journal]]'' and other programmes are rebroadcast on numerous [[public broadcasting]] stations in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In the [[Philippines]], selected Anglophone programmes are shown nationwide on [[Net 25]].

Deutsche Welle is still suffering from financial and staffing cuts. Its budget was reduced by about €75&nbsp;million over five years, and of the 2,200 employees it had in 1994, only 1,200 remain. Further cuts are still expected.{{when|date=April 2018}}

In 2003, the German government passed a new "Deutsche Welle Act", which defined DW as a tri-media organization, making the Deutsche Welle website an equal partner with DW-TV and DW Radio. The website is available in 30 languages, but focuses on German, English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, and Arabic. Persian became the eighth focus language in 2007.

In March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels, namely DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+. DW-TV Asia (DW-TV Asien in German) contains 16 hours of German programming and 8 hours in English, whilst DW-TV Asia+ contains 18 hours of English programmes plus 6 hours of German programmes.<ref>[http://www.dw.com/en/two-dedicated-channels-provide-gateway-to-europe/a-3930041 Two New Dedicated Channels Provide Gateway to Europe: Two DW-TV channel launched in Asia] Deutsche Welle.</ref>

In August 2009, DW-TV's carriage in the United Kingdom on [[Sky Digital (UK & Ireland)|Sky]] channel 794 ceased, although the channel continues to be available via other European satellites receivable in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055640587|title=No more DW-TV on Sky/Astra|work=Boards|access-date=15 May 2015}}</ref>

In 2011, DW announced a major reduction of service including the closure of most of its FM services in the Balkans (except for [[Romani language|Romani]]), but that it would expand its network of FM partners in Africa. The radio production for Hausa, Kiswahili, French, and Portuguese for Africa were optimized for FM broadcasts and DW also produces a regional radio magazine daily in English, to be rebroadcast by partners in Africa.

Audio content in Arabic is distributed online, via mobile, or rebroadcast by partners.

DW announced it would focus on FM partnerships for Bengali, Urdu, Dari/Pashtu, and Indonesian for South Asia, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

On 1 November 2011, DW discontinued shortwave broadcasts in German, Russian, Persian, and Indonesian and ended its English service outside Africa. Chinese programming was reduced from 120 minutes to 60 minutes a week. As of November 2011, DW only broadcast radio programming via shortwave in: Amharic, Chinese, Dari, English and French for Africa, Hausa, Kiswahili, Pashtu, Portuguese for Africa and Urdu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/deutsche-welle-changes-in-radio-broadcasts-starting-this-summer/a-6529299|title=Changes in radio broadcasts starting this summer|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=19 July 2015}}</ref>

The budget of the Deutsche Welle for 2016 was 301.8&nbsp;million euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horizont.net/medien/nachrichten/Etataufstockung-Deutsche-Welle-erhaelt-mehr-als-zehn-Millionen-zusaetzlich-137721|title=Etataufstockung: Deutsche Welle erhält mehr als zehn Millionen zusätzlich}}</ref>

=== Rebranding television news ===
On 22 June 2015, DW TV launched a 24-hour English-language news channel with a new design and a new studio as part of a rebrand to [[DW News]]. Previously, DW's news programmes were called [[Journal (German TV programme)|''Journal'']] and broadcast in English in 3-, 15- and 30-minute blocks. The new channel offers 30-minute updates every hour and 60-minute programmes twice a day on weekdays. DW News broadcasts from Berlin but frequently has live social media segments hosted from a specially-designed studio in Bonn. The German, Spanish and Arabic channels also received a new design.

At the same time, DW's news website moved from a .de [[URL]] to .com and added a social media stream to its front page. The refreshed DW services were launched under the tagline 'Made for Minds'.

===Plans for the future===
Deutsche Welle has developed a [[Two-tier system|two-tier]] approach that they are using for future growth of their company which consists of a global approach and a regional approach. Within their global approach, DW has now made plans to boost its competitiveness market throughout the world with news and television coverage. The plan implements covering mostly all regions of the world with two television channels in each region. With some exclusions, the entire world will be covered. Hours covered ranges throughout regions and the coverage will be in 4 different languages: German, English, Spanish, and Arabic.<ref name=":0" />

The regional approach looks at marketing over the internet to offer news coverage in languages other than the 4 being offered. With updates on DW's website news will be better tailored to each region. Over time, their plan is to diversify their online coverage with more regional content being covered.<ref name=":0" />

==Controversy or censorship==
On 10 April 2019, DW announced that [[Venezuela]]'s state telecoms regulator [[National Commission of Telecommunications|Conatel]] had halted its Spanish-language channel. By 15 April, the broadcasting service was restored.<ref>Vivian Sequera and Andrea Shalal (15 April 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-media-germany/german-state-owned-tv-says-it-returns-to-venezuela-screens-idUSKCN1RR221 German state-owned TV says it returns to Venezuela screens] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Also in 2019, the Russian [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] accused DW of calling on Russians to take part in recent anti-government protests, and threatened it would take action against the outlet under domestic law if it made such calls again.<ref>Andrey Ostroukh (8 August 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-deutschewelle/russia-accuses-deutsche-welle-of-urging-russians-to-take-part-in-protests-idUSKCN1UY23E Russia accuses Deutsche Welle of urging Russians to take part in protests] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Shortly after, Russia's parliament accused DW of breaking [[Elections in Russia|election legislation]] and asked the foreign ministry to consider revoking the German broadcaster's right to work in the country.<ref name="reuters.com">Maria Kiselyova (6 November 2019), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-germany-deutschewelle/russias-foreign-ministry-opposes-call-to-ban-deutsche-welle-ifax-idUSKBN1XG0Z1 Russia's foreign ministry opposes call to ban Deutsche Welle: Ifax] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> By November, Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] declared he did not support banning foreign media outlets.<ref name="reuters.com"/>

There has also been controversy in the way the German broadcasters of DW cover domestic stories. In German society, journalists have been known to shape perspectives of the national identity using terms or the themes they choose to cover. According to William Silcock, "research in the bicultural (German and English) newsroom at Deutsche Welle provided the opportunity to see how national myths were forged and maintained by the dominant culture and how such myths were accepted or resisted by the other." Silcock explains his research by saying, "Transporting an understanding of the past{{snd}}this German national myth{{snd}}through global television was an unarticulated, but very present, goal of the Deutsche Welle’s news organization." <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Silcock|first=B.

==Shortwave relay stations==

===Transmitter sites in Germany===
The [[Jülich radio transmitter]] site began operation in 1956 with eleven 100&nbsp;kW [[Telefunken]] transmitters.

The Wertachtal site was authorized in 1972 and began service with four 500&nbsp;kW transmitters. By 1989 there were 15 transmitters, four of which relayed the [[Voice of America]].

The Nauen transmitter site was inherited from Radio Berlin International. RBI's Russian-made three 500&nbsp;kW and one 100&nbsp;kW transmitters were replaced by four Telefunken 500&nbsp;kW transmitters and four rotatable antennas. Deutsche Welle no longer uses any of its transmitters in Germany.
