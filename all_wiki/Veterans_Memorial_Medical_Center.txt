The '''Veterans Memorial Medical Center''' (formerly known as '''Veterans Memorial Hospital''') was established in 1955 with full [[United States Government|US Government]] assistance under the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|US Veterans Administration]] to provide quality hospitalization, medical care and treatment to Filipino veterans as provided by U.S. public law. The patients were originally those who suffer from service-connected disabilities arising from their services with the [[USAFFE]], recognized guerrilla units, [[Philippine Scouts]], and [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], which was later extended to [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] retirees and their [[military dependent|dependents]].

==History==
The Veterans Memorial Medical Center was established pursuant to ''Public Law 865'', 80th U.S. Congress on July 8, 1948 which provided $9.4 million for the construction of a hospital facility with the land to be donated by the Philippine government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Veterans Memorial Medical Center:: ABOUT US::|url=http://www.vmmc.gov.ph/about.php}}</ref> The law was implemented in the country by an agreement between the U.S. and the Philippines signed by then Pres. [[Elpidio Quirino]] and the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Myron Cowen. Various amendments have been introduced and the latest is ''Republic Act 6948'' which has liberalized the definition of veterans which now included the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] (AFP) retirees.<ref name="GovPH-RA6948">{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 6948 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1990/04/09/republic-act-no-6948/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=20 April 2020 |date=9 April 1990}}</ref> Likewise, the hospitalization [[veteran's benefits|benefit]] was extended to the [[military dependent|veteran dependents]]. It is one of three units under the [[Philippine Veterans Affairs Office]] (PVAO). PVAO is a bureau under the [[Department of National Defense (Philippines)|Department of National Defense]]. The other two units under PVAO are the PVAO Proper, and Military Shrines Service.

The {{convert|55|ha|adj=on}} land was originally intended to be location of the new [[Malacanan Palace]] on the original masterplan of Quezon City in 1939. It is now being eyed to be privatized as part of the Quezon City Central Business District Redevelopment Plan or [[Triangle Park]].

==Service Coverage==
Filipino veterans covered under this program embrace:  
#  The [[Philippine Revolutionary Army|Philippine Revolutionary Forces]] that took up arms against the Spaniards and the Americans during the past Philippine revolutions and wars,  
#  members of the First [[Philippine National Guard]]s, either before or after its integration into the Army of the United States of America,
#  Filipino citizens who are enlisted and or commissioned and served during [[World War I]] under the Allied Armed Forces,
#  [[Philippine Scouts]] who were in the service prior to October 6, 1945, with wartime service,
#  [[USAFFE]] with wartime service in the Philippines,
#  Recognized [[World War II]] guerrilla units in the Philippines and
#  [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] units that participated in the [[Korean War]].
All that a patient needs to present in seeking admission is a certificate of his military service from the Philippine Veterans Board and this plus his marriage certificate and birth certificate of minor child if the dependent is in need of hospital care. Emergency cases, however, may be brought to the hospital directly after which pertinent papers may be secured later on.
