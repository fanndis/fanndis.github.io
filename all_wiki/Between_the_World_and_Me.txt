'''''Between the World and Me''''' is a 2015 nonfiction book written by [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]] and published by [[Spiegel & Grau]]. It is written as a letter to the author's teenage son about the feelings, symbolism, and realities associated with being [[Black Americans|Black]] in the United States. Coates recapitulates [[American history]] and explains to his son the "racist violence that has been woven into American culture." Coates draws from an abridged, autobiographical account of his youth in [[Baltimore]], detailing the ways in which institutions like the school, the police, and even "the streets" discipline, endanger, and threaten to disembody black men and women. The work takes structural and thematic inspiration from [[James Baldwin]]'s 1963 epistolary book ''[[The Fire Next Time]]''. Unlike Baldwin, Coates sees [[white supremacy]] as an indestructible force, one that Black Americans will never evade or erase, but will always struggle against.

The novelist [[Toni Morrison]] wrote that Coates filled an intellectual gap in succession to James Baldwin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/james-baldwin-tanehisi-coates/399413/|title=Can Ta-Nehisi Coates Measure up to the Legacy of James Baldwin?|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|date=2015-07-23|work=[[The Atlantic]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> Editors of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described the book as exceptional.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/books/review-in-between-the-world-and-me-ta-nehisi-coates-delivers-a-desperate-dispatch-to-his-son.html|title=Review: In 'Between the World and Me,' Ta-Nehisi Coates Delivers a Searing Dispatch to His Son|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=2015-07-09|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/ta-nehisi-coates-and-a-generation-waking-up|title=Ta-Nehisi Coates and a Generation Waking Up|last=Bennett|first=Brit|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2015-07-15|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> The book won the 2015 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]]<ref name=NationalBookAwards>{{cite web|last=Dwyer|first=Colin|title=Finalists Unveiled For This Year's National Book Awards|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/14/448053224/finalists-unveiled-for-this-years-national-book-awards|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=[[NPR]]|date=October 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name="NYTimes-NatlBookAward-2015">{{cite web|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|title=Ta-Nehisi Coates Wins National Book Award|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/us/ta-nehisi-coates-wins-national-book-award.html|accessdate=19 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 November 2015}}</ref> and was a finalist for the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Finalist: Between the World and Me, by Ta-Nehisi Coates (Spiegel & Grau)|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/ta-nehisi-coates|accessdate=19 April 2016|work=[[Pulitzer Prize]]}}</ref>

Coates was inspired to write ''Between the World and Me'' following a 2013 meeting with sitting United States President [[Barack Obama]]. Coates, a writer for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', had been reading James Baldwin's 1963 ''[[The Fire Next Time]]'' and was determined to make his second meeting with the president less deferential than his first.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/my-president-was-black/508793/|title=My President Was Black|last=Coates|first=Ta-Nehisi|date=January–February 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=2019-04-23|issn=1072-7825}}</ref> As he left for Washington, D.C., his wife encouraged him to think like Baldwin, and Coates recalled an unofficial, fiery meeting between Baldwin, Black activists, and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1963. When it was his turn, Coates debated with Obama whether his policy sufficiently addressed racial disparities in the universal health care rollout. After the event, Obama and Coates spoke privately about a blog post Coates had written criticizing the president's call for more personal responsibility among African Americans. Obama disagreed with the criticism and told Coates not to despair.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/>

As Coates walked to the train station, he thought about how Baldwin would not have shared Obama's optimism, the same optimism that supported many [[Civil Rights Movement]] activists' belief that justice was inevitable. Instead, Coates saw Baldwin as being fundamentally "cold," without "sentiment and melodrama" in his acknowledgment that the movement could fail and that requital was not guaranteed. Coates found this idea "freeing" and called his book editor, [[Chris Jackson (publisher)|Christopher Jackson]], to ask "why no one wrote like Baldwin anymore." Jackson proposed that Coates try.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/>

''Between the World and Me'' is Coates's second book, following his 2008 memoir ''The Beautiful Struggle''. Since then, and especially in the 18 months including the [[Ferguson unrest]] preceding his new book's release, Coates somberly believed less in the soul and its aspirational sense of eventual justice. Coates felt that he had become more radicalized.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/> The book's title comes from [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright's]] poem "Between the World and Me,"<ref name="NYT: review"/> originally published in the July/August 1935 issue of ''[[Partisan Review]]''.<ref>Butler, Robert, ed. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/317459232 ''The Richard Wright Encyclopedia''].

==Summary==
{{Quote box|quote="You must always remember," Coates writes to Samori, "that the sociology, the history, the economics, the graphs, the charts, the regressions all land, with great violence, upon the body."|source=From ''Between the World and Me'' as excerpted in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/>|width=30em|quoted=1}}
''Between the World and Me'' takes the form of a book-length letter from the author to his son, adopting the structure of Baldwin's ''The Fire Next Time''; the latter is directed, in part, towards Baldwin's nephew, while the former addresses Coates's 15-year-old son.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/> Coates's letter is divided into three parts, recounting Coates's experiences as a young man, after the birth of his son, and during a visit with Mabel Jones. Coates contemplates the feelings, symbolism, and realities associated with being Black in the United States.<ref name="NYT: review"/> He recapitulates the American history of violence against Black people and the incommensurate policing of Black youth.<ref name="NYer: Charleston"/> The book's tone is poetic and bleak, guided by his experiences growing up poor and always at risk of bodily harm. He prioritizes the physical security of African-American bodies over the tradition in Black Christianity of optimism, "uplift," and faith in eventual justice (i.e., being on God's side). As Coates discussed in a 2015 interview at the [[Chicago Humanities Festival]], he was inspired by his college [https://www.femst.ucsb.edu/people/eileen-boris professor Eileen Boris] who utilized an extended metaphor of the physical body for exploitation by objectification in her course, “History of Women in America" at Howard University. Her teachings inspired Coates's theme of the physical and visceral experience of racism on the body. His background, which he describes as "physicality and chaos," leads him to emphasize the daily corporeal concerns he experiences as an African-American in U.S. culture. Coates's position is that absent the religious rhetoric of "hope and dreams and faith and progress," only systems of [[White supremacy]] remain along with no real evidence that those systems are bound to change.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/> In this way, he disagrees with [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s]] optimism about integration and [[Malcolm X]]'s optimism about nationalism.

Coates gives an abridged, autobiographical account of his youth "always on guard" in Baltimore and his fear of the physical harm threatened by both the police and the streets. He also feared the rules of [[code-switching]] to meet the clashing social norms of the streets, the authorities, and the professional world. He contrasts these experiences with neat suburban life, which he calls "the Dream" because it is an exclusionary fantasy for White people who are enabled by, yet largely ignorant of, their history of privilege and suppression. To become conscious of their gains from slavery, segregation, and voter suppression would shatter that Dream.<ref name="NYT: review"/> The book ends with a story about Mabel Jones, the daughter of a sharecropper, who worked and rose in social class to give her children comfortable lives, including private schools and European trips. Her son, Coates's college friend [[Prince Jones|Prince Carmen Jones Jr.]], was mistakenly tracked and killed by a policeman. Coates uses his friend's story to argue that racism and related tragedy affects Black people of means as well.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/><ref name="NPR-MorningEdition-BTWAM-2015">{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Michele|title=Ta-Nehisi Coates Looks At The Physical Toll Of Being Black In America|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/07/10/421469553/ta-nehisi-coates-looks-at-the-physical-toll-of-being-black-in-america|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[Morning Edition]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=10 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="NPR-FreshAir-PoliceBrut-2015">{{cite web|authorlink=Terry Gross|author=Gross, Terry|title=Ta-Nehisi Coates On Police Brutality, The Confederate Flag And Forgiveness|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/13/422554778/ta-nehisi-coates-on-police-brutality-the-confederate-flag-and-forgiveness|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=13 July 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==
After reading ''Between the World and Me'', novelist Toni Morrison wrote that Coates fills "the intellectual void" left by James Baldwin's death 28 years prior.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the book is "essential, like water or air."<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/> [[David Remnick]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described it as "extraordinary."<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/><ref name="NYer: Charleston"/>

[[Michiko Kakutani]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote that ''Between the World and Me'' functioned as a sequel to Coates's 2008 memoir, which displayed Coates's talents as an emotional and lyrical writer.<ref name=":0"/> Coates's use of "the Dream" (in reference to paradisal suburban life) confused her, and she thought Coates stretched beyond what is safely generalizable. In particular, she felt that the phrasing of his comments on [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] could be easily misread. Kakutani thought that Coates did not consistently acknowledge racial progress achieved over the course of centuries and that some parts read like the author's internal debate.<ref name="NYT: review"/> Benjamin Wallace-Wells of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine said that a sense of fear for one's children propels the book, and Coates's atheism gives the book a sense of urgency.<ref name="NY Mag: Hard Truths"/>

On November 18, 2015, it was announced that Coates had won the [[National Book Award]] for ''Between the World and Me''.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/19/us/ta-nehisi-coates-wins-national-book-award.html|title=Ta-Nehisi Coates Wins National Book Award|author=Alter, Alexandra|date=November 18, 2015}}</ref> [[NPR]]'s Colin Dwyer had considered it the favorite to win the prize, given the book's reception.<ref name=NationalBookAwards/> It also won the 2015 [[Kirkus Prize]] for nonfiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/prize/2015/finalists/|title=2015 Finalists {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>

The book topped [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for nonfiction on August 2, 2015, and remained number 1 for three weeks. It topped the same list again during the week of January 24, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/20/ta-nehisi-coates-interview-between-the-world-and-me-black-america|title=How Ta-Nehisi Coates's letter to his son about being Black in America became a bestseller|author=Adams, Tim|date=September 20, 2015}}</ref>
