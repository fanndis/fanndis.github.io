'''Jessica Pegula''' (born February 24, 1994) is an American professional [[tennis]] player.

==Career==
On August 30, 2011, Pegula was granted a wildcard exemption into the main draw of the US Open doubles tournament where she was paired with [[Taylor Townsend (tennis)|Taylor Townsend]]. They eventually lost in the third round to the third-seeded team of [[Vania King]] and [[Yaroslava Shvedova]].

In March 2012, Pegula was given a wildcard to the qualifying draw in Indian Wells, and surprised higher ranked players [[Bojana Jovanovski]] and [[Paula Ormaechea]] to qualify for the main draw where she lost to [[Magdaléna Rybáriková]] in three sets.

Pegula made her Grand Slam singles debut at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|2015 US Open]] as a qualifier. She defeated [[Shuko Aoyama]], [[Margarita Gasparyan]] and [[Melanie Oudin]] to reach the main draw where she beat [[Alison Van Uytvanck]] in the first round. In the second, Pegula was defeated by [[Dominika Cibulkova]], in three sets.

In 2018, Pegula reached her first WTA singles final at the [[2018 Coupe Banque Nationale – Singles|Tournoi de Québec]] as a qualifier. She beat [[Kristýna Plíšková]], [[Ons Jabeur]], second seed [[Petra Martić]] and fifth seed [[Sofia Kenin]] en route to the final, where she lost to eighth seed [[Pauline Parmentier]] in straight sets. This brought her ranking back inside the top 200 and helped her finish the year inside the top 125.

===2019: First WTA title===
Pegula began the year primarily playing on the ITF Circuit, before cracking inside the top 100 in February for the first time in her career. This allowed her to enter several larger [[WTA Tour]] events, including in [[2019 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]] and [[2019 Miami Open – Women's Singles|Miami]]. Her best result during the early clay court season came in [[2019 Volvo Car Open – Singles|Charleston]], where she upset world No. 12, [[Anastasija Sevastova]], en-route to the third round. This helped her break inside the top 75 for the first time. She also competed in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament other than the US Open for the first time. She was defeated in the first round of the [[2019 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]] by eventual champion [[Ashleigh Barty]] before falling in the same stage at [[2019 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] to [[Mihaela Buzărnescu]].

Pegula achieved the best result of her career at the start of the North American hardcourt season when she won her first WTA career singles title at the [[2019 Citi Open – Women's Singles|Washington Open]], defeating [[Camila Giorgi]] in the final.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/news/what-you-work-pegula-romps-first-wta-singles-title-citi-open |title='This is what you work for': Pegula romps to first WTA singles title at Citi Open |last=Juzwiak |first=Jason |date=2019-08-04 |website=WTA Tennis |language=en |access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> This took her to a new career-high ranking of world no. 55. Despite failing to win another main draw match the rest of the season, Pegula finished the year ranked inside the top 100 for the first time, at No. 76.

===2020: ASB Classic finalist===
Jessica started her 2020 tennis season in Auckland at the [[2020 ASB Classic|ASB Classic]]. She defeated [[CiCi Bellis]] in the first round. She followed this up with two more straight set victories over [[Tamara Zidanšek]] and [[Alizé Cornet]] to reach the semifinals. In the semi-finals, she beat [[Caroline Wozniacki]] in three sets to advance to her third career WTA singles final. Facing off against compatriot and 23-time Grand Slam singles winner [[Serena Williams]] for the first time, Pegula lost in straight sets. She then competed at the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]] for the first time, where she was defeated by another American, [[Taylor Townsend]], in straight sets in the first round.

Pegula's next big triumph came at the [[2020 Western & Southern Open – Women's Singles|Western & Southern Open]], a Premier 5 tournament. Having already beaten two Russians to qualify for the main draw, she opened her campaign with a straight sets win over American [[Jennifer Brady]] followed by a win over another countrywoman, 2019 French Open semifinalist [[Amanda Anisimova]]. She then caused a huge upset by defeating fifth seed and world No. 11, [[Aryna Sabalenka]], in the third round, thus advancing to her first quarterfinal at any WTA Premier level event. Her run came to an end with a straight-sets loss to 14th seed [[Elise Mertens]]. This took her ranking back inside the top 65.

At the [[2020 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]], Pegula recovered from a set down to record her first Grand Slam main-draw win since the 2015 US Open, defeating [[Marie Bouzková]] in a third-set tiebreak. She then beat [[Kirsten Flipkens]] to advance to the third round of a Grand Slam event for the first time, where she will face sixth seed and former world No. 2, [[Petra Kvitová]].

==World TeamTennis==
Pegula will be making her [[World TeamTennis]] debut in 2020, and will be joining the [[Orlando Storm]] at the start of the season, beginning July 12 at [[The Greenbrier]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wtt.com/2020/06/16/world-teamtennis-adds-stars-tiafoe-puig-raonic-bouchard-sock-as-rosters-set-for-2020/ |title=World TeamTennis Adds Stars Tiafoe, Puig, Roanic, Bouchard, & Sock As Rosters Set For 2020 |website=WTT.com |date=June 16, 2020 }}</ref>

Pegula emerged as one of the top players in the WTT 2020 season. After the dismissal of [[Danielle Collins]], Pegula went on to play women's singles, women's doubles with [[Darija Jurak]], and mixed doubles with [[Ken Skupski]] and [[Tennys Sandgren]]. She posted a strong 9-2 record in singles to help the Storm earn a No. 3 seed in the WTT Playoffs. The Storm would ultimately fall to the [[Chicago Smash]] in the semifinals.
