In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital deal-by-deal to pursue [[leveraged buyout]] investments, including a failed takeover battle for [[Chi-Chi's]].<ref name=chichi /><ref name=littleknowncarlyle />  The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990.

Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001.  In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that [[Shafiq bin Laden]], a member of the [[Bin Laden family]], had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.<ref name=TheBookOnBush/><ref name=glassman/><ref name=TheEconomist/><ref name=TheGuardian/><ref name=Nsnbc/>  Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bin Laden Family Is Tied To U.S. Group |date=September 27, 2001 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> These connections would later be profiled in [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 911]]''.  The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11 attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/26/business/bin-laden-family-liquidates-holdings-with-carlyle-group.html |title=Bin Laden Family Liquidates Holdings With Carlyle Group |first=Kurt |last=Eichenwald |date=October 26, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=21 August 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421092850/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5DD1031F935A15753C1A9679C8B63 |archive-date=2008-04-21}}</ref>

===2002–2006===
Buyouts declined after the collapse of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com bubble]] in 2000 and 2001. But after the two-stage buyout of [[Dex Media]] at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain high-yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed.

As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]], [[Blackstone Group]], and [[TPG Capital]].  In 2005, Carlyle, together with [[Clayton Dubilier & Rice]] and [[Merrill Lynch]] completed the $15.0&nbsp;billion leveraged buyout of [[The Hertz Corporation]], the largest car rental agency from [[Ford]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/business/08ford.html |title=Ford Said to Be Ready to Pursue a Hertz Sale |first1=Andrew Ross |last1=Sorkin |first2=Danny |last2=Hakim |date=September 8, 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/13/business/13hertz.html |title=Ford Completes Sale of Hertz to 3 Firms |first=Jeremy W. |last=Peters |date=September 13, 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its [[Riverstone Holdings]] affiliate partnered with [[Goldman Sachs Capital Partners]] in the $27.5&nbsp;billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of [[Kinder Morgan]], one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by [[Richard Kinder]], the company's co-founder and a former president of [[Enron]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/business/29kinder.html |title=Kinder Morgan Agrees to an Improved Buyout Offer Led by Its Chairman |first=Jad |last=Mouawad |date=August 29, 2006 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising [[Blackstone Group]], [[Permira]] and [[TPG Capital]], in the  $17.6 billion takeover of [[Freescale Semiconductor]].  At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of [[SunGard]]. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply.

===Ownership changes===
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners.  In 2001, the [[California Public Employees' Retirement System]] ([[CalPERS]]), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB981067457259999794 |title=Deals & Deal Makers: Calpers Buys 5% Stake in Carlyle Group For $175 Million, Invests in Some Funds |first=Kara |last=Scannell |date=February 2, 2001 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>  The investment was valued at about $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.<ref name=Heath2007>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/20/AR2007092000451.html  |title=Government of Abu Dhabi Buys Stake in Carlyle  |last=Heath  |first=Thomas  |date=September 21, 2007 |newspaper=The Washington Post   |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014051109/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/20/AR2007092000451.html  |archive-date=October 14, 2008}}</ref>

In September 2007, [[Mubadala Development Company]], an investment vehicle for the government of [[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]], purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.<ref name=Heath2007/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/business/worldbusiness/21carlyle.html |title=Carlyle to Sell Stake to a Mideast Government |first=Andrew Ross |last=Sorkin |date=September 21, 2007 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubadala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights."  The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development, was later withdrawn.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sacbee.com/103/story/849713.html |title=Bill limiting CalPERS, CalSTRS investments withdrawn |first=Dale |last=Kasler |date=April 9, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Sacramento Bee]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215160947/http://www.sacbee.com/103/story/849713.html |archive-date=February 15, 2009}}</ref>

In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the [[NASDAQ]].  The firm, which at the time managed about $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering.  Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304743704577380111481098448.html |title=Carlyle Prices IPO at Lower Range |first1=Gregory |last1=Zuckerman |first2=Lynn |last2=Cowan |date=May 2, 2012 |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>

The [[Guernsey]]-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expected its creditors to seize its remaining assets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/bankingFinancial/idUSL1350338420080313 |title=Carlyle Capital in default, on brink of collapse |first=Reed |last=Stevenson |date=March 13, 2008 |work=Reuters}}</ref> Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make [[Margin calls|margin call]]s or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/10/AR2008031001016.html |title=Carlyle Founders Consider Cash Infusion |first=Thomas |last=Heath |date=March 11, 2008 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the [[Federal Reserve]] gave Wall Street's [[primary dealer]]s the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/business/12fed.html |title=Fed Hopes to Ease Strain on Economic Activity |first=Edmund L. |last=Andrews |date=March 12, 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220165119/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/business/12fed.html  |archivedate=December 20, 2013}}</ref>

On March 12, 2008, [[BBC News Online]] reported that "instead of underpinning th

"will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7293663.stm |title=Hedge fund on verge of collapse |date=March 13, 2008 |website=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition  under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tridenttrust.com/PDFs/company.pdf |title=The Companies (Guernsey) Laws, 1994 To 1996, As Amended |website=TridentTrust |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910093351/http://www.tridenttrust.com/PDFs/company.pdf |archive-date=September 10, 2008}}</ref> for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlylecapitalcorp.com/News/Press%20Releases/2007/item10306.html |title=Carlyle Capital Corporation Intends To File For Compulsory Winding Up In Guernsey |date=March 16, 2008 |website=Carlyle Capital Corporation Limited |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225092641/http://www.carlylecapitalcorp.com/News/Press%20Releases/2007/item10306.html |archive-date=December 25, 2008}}</ref>

In September 2017 the court ruled that Carlyle had no liability in the lawsuit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/86b58820-9173-11e7-bdfa-eda243196c2c |title=Carlyle executives exonerated over collapsed bond fund |last1=DeJarnette |first1=Jordan |newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref>

==In documentaries==
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' and [[William Karel]]'s ''[[The World According to Bush]]''.

In ''Fahrenheit 9/11'', Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/index.php?id=19 |title=Factual Back-Up for Fahrenheit 9/11: Section Four |first=Michael |last=Moore |website=MichaelMoore.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627224430/http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/index.php?id=19 |archive-date=June 27, 2009}}</ref>  Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with [[George H. W. Bush]] and his Secretary of State [[James Baker]], both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author [[Dan Briody]], who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the [[September 11 attacks]] because it owned military contractor [[United Defense]].<ref name=noeffect>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/feb/15/film.filmnews  |title=Fahrenheit 9/11 had no effect, says Carlyle chief  |first1=Nils  |last1=Pratley |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]  |date=February 15, 2005}}</ref>  A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other [[private equity firm]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/mar/23/iraq.theobserver |first=Jamie |last=Doward |title='Ex-presidents club' gets fat on conflict |date=May 23, 2003 |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref>
