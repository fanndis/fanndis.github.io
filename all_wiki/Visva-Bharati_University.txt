'''Visva-Bharati''' ({{IPA-bn|biʃːɔbʱaroti|lang}}) is a [[Public university|public]] research [[Central University (India)|central university]] and an [[Institution of National Importance]] located in [[Santiniketan]], [[West Bengal]], India. It was founded by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] who called it ''Visva-Bharati'', which means the communion of the world with India. Until independence it was a college. Soon after independence, the institution was given the status of a central university in 1951 by an act of the Parliament.

==Overview==
''[[The Hindu]]'' writes, "Santiniketan in many ways is still quite different compared to other universities in the country. Located at Bolpur in Birbhum district of West Bengal, the university still has the rural trappings that Tagore dreamt of. The classes are still held in the open under the shade of huge mango trees and students and tutors alike still travel by cycles to keep pollution at bay. The old buildings, even those that were made up of mud walls and thatched roofs, are still intact and find a place within the main campus. While some are preserved for historical value, others are functional in all aspects. While for tourists the place could only be place for sight-seeing, the studious and the academically-inclined can easily feel the scholastic vibrations. Many, especially the Bengalis, have deep reverence for the place and take the visit as a pilgrimage to pay their respects to Tagore. Almost every festival, be it the local ‘ Poush mela' or the more universal ‘Raksha Bandhan' or ‘Holi,' is celebrated in its originality by the students, locals and staff on the campus... Tagore visualised it as a ‘seat of learning', and his vision was taken forward by Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru. Both played a stellar role in its becoming a Central University in 1951."<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.thehindu.com/features/education/college-and-university/tagores-vision-of-an-institution/article2987625.ece| title = Tagore's Vision of an Institution |work= Colleges |first=Sumit| last= Bhattacharjee| publisher = The Hindu, 26 March 2012  |accessdate   =11 September 2019| date = 26 March 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Visva-Bharati University 1971 stamp of India.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1971 stamp dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Visva-Bharati University, featuring [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and university building]]
The origins of the institution date back to 1863 when [[Debendranath Tagore]] was given a tract of land by the zamindar of [[Raipur, Birbhum|Raipur]], zamindar of Kirnahar and he set up an ''[[ashram]]'' at the spot that has now come to be called ''chatim tala'' at the heart of the town. The ashram was initially called Brahmacharya Ashram, which was later renamed Brahmacharya Vidyalaya. It was established with a view to encouraging people from all walks of life to come to the spot and meditate. In 1901 his youngest son [[Rabindranath Tagore]] established a co-educational school inside the premises of the ashram.

From 1901 onwards, Tagore used the ashram to organise the Hindu Mela, which soon became a centre of nationalist activity. Through the early twentieth century the zamindars of [[Surul]] (Sarkar Family), another neighbouring village, a few minutes by cycle from the Uttarayan Complex, and the zamindars of Taltore, a village just north of the university town, continued to sell their lands and other properties to the ashram and the college that was being built on this spot. The entire neighbourhood of Purbapalli belonged to the former zamindars of Taltore.

Rabindranath Tagore believed in open air education and had reservations about any teaching done within four walls. This was due to his belief that walls represent conditioning of mind. Tagore did not have a good opinion about the Western method of education introduced by the British in India; on this subject, Tagore and Gandhiji's opinion matched. Tagore once said, "I do not remember what I was taught, I only remember what I learnt." Tagore's idea on education was that every person is genius and that all students may not bloom at the same time. So he devised a new system of learning in Visva-Bharati. He allowed students to continue their course till the student and his teacher both are satisfied.

At Visva-Bharati, if a course demanded by a student is not available, then the university will design a course and bring teachers for that course. The university would not be bothered by the consideration of whether there is a demand for the course.

==Campus==
Visva-Bharati University is located about {{cvt|160|km}} by road from [[Kolkata]] in the twin towns of Santiniketan and Sriniketan, in the district of [[Birbhum district|Birbhum, West Bengal]]. The nearest railway station is [[Bolpur Shantiniketan railway station|Bolpur (Santiniketan)]] on the Eastern Railway and the air terminal is [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport|Kolkata Airport]]. The Institute's buildings and departments are scattered among the two towns.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Santiniketan|url=https://www.visvabharati.ac.in/Santiniketan.html|access-date=27 November 2020|website=www.visvabharati.ac.in}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Sriniketan|url=http://www.visvabharati.ac.in/Sriniketan.html|access-date=27 November 2020|website=www.visvabharati.ac.in}}</ref>

The twin towns of Santiniketan and Sriniketan are surrounded by [[Bolpur]] to the north, Kheya to the south, [[Surul]] to the east and [[Prantik]] to the west. The towns and the university are not far from the river Kopai which flows to the south.

The paridarshaka of this university is the [[president of India]], the pradhana is the [[governor of West Bengal]] while the acharya is the [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]]. The ''samsad'' or University Court is the supreme authority of the University and has the power to review the acts of the ''Karma Samity'' (Executive Council) and the ''Siksha Samity'' (Academic Council). The Executive Council is the highest executive body of the University. The Academic Council is the highest academic body of the University and is responsible for the maintenance of standards of instruction, education and examination within the university. It has the right to advise the Executive Council on all academic matters.  The university is run by its ''Karma Samity'' (Executive Council) which is chaired by the acharya.

===Cultural festivals===
This university is especially famous for its cultural festivals:

* Basanta Utsab (Spring Festival): This festival is identified with ''doljatra'' or ''holi'', which is held on the grounds in front of Patha Bhavana.
* [[Poush Mela]] (Winter Fair): It is the annual winter fair which is held every ''Poush'' which coincides with December on ''Purono Melar Maath'' opposite the ashram and next to the Uttarayan complex, as well as on Melar Maath (Bhubandangar Maath), which is next to the administrative block. The fair is meant to encourage the local people of Birbhum and outlying districts to come and exhibit and sell their wares. ''Jatras'', such as [[Alkap]], are staged and Bouls perform at the fair. On the first day of the fair, (23 December), the university organises an Upasana Sabha at Chatimtala (under a chatim tree), the spot where Maharshi Debendranath Tagore established his ashram for the first time in 1863. On 24 December the university organises a display of lights and fireworks on Melar Maath, a custom started by the poet, Rabindranath Tagore himself. On Christmas Day, the university organises the Christo Utsab, which is meant as a mark of respect for all religions.
