[[File:Statueofliberty.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|During the infancy of the United States, for many immigrants, the [[Statue of Liberty]] was their first view of the country. It signified new opportunities in life and thus the statue is an iconic symbol of the American Dream.]]
The '''American Dream''' is a national [[ethos]] of the [[United States]], the set of ideals (democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity and equality) in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, as well as an upward [[Socio-economic mobility in the United States|social mobility]] for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. In the definition of the American Dream by [[James Truslow Adams]] in 1931, "life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement" regardless of [[Social class in the United States|social class]] or circumstances of birth.<ref name="LOC">{{Cite web|title=Lesson Plan: The American Dream|url=https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/american-dream/#students|access-date=2020-10-30|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref>

The American Dream is rooted in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], which proclaims that "[[all men are created equal]]" with the right to "[[life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness]]."<ref name=vanityfair>{{cite journal |last=Kamp |first=David |journal=Vanity Fair |date=April 2009 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/04/american-dream200904 |title=Rethinking the American Dream |accessdate=June 20, 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090530024942/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/04/american-dream200904| archive-date= May 30, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, the [[U.S. Constitution]] promotes similar freedom, in the Preamble: to "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity".

== History ==
The meaning of the "American Dream" has changed over the course of history, and includes both personal components (such as home ownership and upward mobility) and a global vision. Historically the Dream originated in the mystique regarding [[Frontier Thesis|frontier life]]. As the Governor of Virginia noted in 1774, the Americans "for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled". He added that, "if they attained Paradise, they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west".<ref>Lord Dunmore to Lord Dartmouth, December 24, 1774, quoted in John Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (1944) p. 77</ref>

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th&nbsp;century, many well-educated Germans fled the failed [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 revolution]]. They welcomed the political freedoms in the New World, and the lack of a hierarchical or aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for individual aspirations. One of them explained:

<blockquote>The [[German American|German emigrant]] comes into a country free from the despotism, privileged orders and monopolies, intolerable taxes, and constraints in matters of belief and conscience. Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases. No passport is demanded, no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements&nbsp;... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here. The rich stand on the same footing as the poor; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation&nbsp;... [In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine 'right of birth.' In such a country the ''talents, energy and perseverance'' of a person&nbsp;... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies.<ref>F. W. Bogen, ''The German in America'' (Boston, 1851), quoted in Stephen Ozment, ''A Mighty Fortress: A New History of the German People'' (2004) pp.&nbsp;170–71</ref></blockquote>

The [[California Gold Rush|discovery of gold in California in 1849]] brought in a hundred thousand men looking for their fortune overnight—and a few did find it. Thus was born the [[California Dream]] of instant success. Historian [[H. W. Brands]] noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:

<blockquote>The old American Dream&nbsp;... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's "Poor Richard"...&nbsp;of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream&nbsp;... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill."<ref>H. W. Brands, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bd6KDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The age of gold: the California Gold Rush and the new American dream]'' (2003) p. 442.</ref></blockquote>

Historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] in 1893 advanced the [[Frontier Thesis]], under which [[American democracy]] and the American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the process—the moving frontier line—and the impact it had on [[American pioneer|pioneers]] going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with [[egalitarianism]], a lack of interest in [[high culture]], and violence. "American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the [[Susan Constant]] to Virginia, nor in the [[Mayflower]] to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier," said Turner.<ref>{{cite book|author=Turner, Frederick Jackson|title=The Frontier in American History|page = 293|chapter = The Significance of the Frontier in American History|year=1920|chapter-url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/turner/}}</ref> In the thesis, the [[American frontier]] established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled "[[The Significance of the Frontier in American History]]", delivered to the [[American Historical Association]] in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as ''The Frontier in American History.''<ref>Turner, ''The Frontier in American History'' (1920) chapter 1</ref> Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines.<ref>{{cite journal|at=p. 195|jstor=494720|title=Frederick Jackson Turner Reconsidered|journal=The History Teacher|volume=27|issue=2|last1=Bogue|first1=Allan G.|year=1994|doi=10.2307/494720}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
Freelance writer [[James Truslow Adams]] popularized the phrase "American Dream" in his 1931 book ''Epic of America'':

{{quote|But there has been also the ''American dream'', that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for every man, with opportunity for each according to his ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position... The American dream, that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, though that has doubtlessly counted heavily. It has been much more than that. It has been a dream of being able to grow to fullest development as man and woman, unhampered by the barriers which had slowly been erected in the older civilizations, unrepressed by social orders which had developed for the benefit of classes rather than for the simple human being of any and every class.{{CN|date=October 2020}}|author=|title=|source=}}

[[Martin Luther King&nbsp;Jr.]], in his "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" (1963) rooted the [[civil rights movement]] in the African-American quest for the American Dream:<ref>Quoted in James T. Kloppenberg, ''The Virtues of Liberalism'' (1998). p. 147</ref>

<blockquote>We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands&nbsp;... when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in their formulation of the [[U.S. Constitution |Constitution]] and the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence |Declaration of Independence]].</blockquote>

== Literature ==
The concept of the American Dream has been used in popular discourse, and scholars have traced its use in American literature ranging from the ''Autobiography'' of [[Benjamin Franklin]],<ref>J. A. Leo Lemay, "Franklin's Autobiography and the American Dream," in J. A. Leo Lemay and P. M. Zall, eds. ''Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography'' (Norton Critical Editions, 1986) pp.&nbsp;349–360</ref> to Mark Twain's ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1884), Willa Cather's ''[[My Ántonia]]'',<ref>James E.

Scott Fitzgerald's ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), Theodore Dreiser's ''[[An American Tragedy]]'' (1925) and [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'' (1977).<ref>Harold Bloom and Blake Hobby, eds. ''The American Dream'' (2009)</ref> Other writers who used the American Dream theme include [[Hunter S. Thompson]], [[Edward Albee]],<ref>Nicholas Canaday, Jr., "Albee's The American Dream and the Existential Vacuum."

As Huang shows, the American Dream is a recurring theme in the fiction of Asian Americans.<ref>{{cite book   | title = How to Be South Asian in America: Narratives of Ambivalence and Belonging | author= anupama jain |publisher = Temple University Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ckiNRF9YZtgC&q=How+to+Be+South+Asian+in+America:+Narratives+of+Ambivalence+and+Belonging | date = 2011  | isbn = 9781439903032 | accessdate = 27 November 2018}}</ref><ref>Guiyou Huang, ''The Columbia guide to Asian American literature since 1945'' (2006), pp 44, 67, 85, 94.</ref>

=== American ideals ===
Many American authors added American ideals to their work as a theme or other reoccurring idea, to get their point across.<ref>Neumann, Henry. Teaching American Ideals through Literature. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1918. Print.</ref> There are many ideals that appear in [[American literature]] such as, but not limited to, all people are equal, [[The United States of America]] is the Land of Opportunity, independence is valued, The American Dream is attainable, and everyone can succeed with hard work and determination. [[John Winthrop]] also wrote about this term called, [[American exceptionalism]]. This ideology refers to the idea that Americans are, as a nation, elect.<ref>Symposium: The Role of the Judge in the Twenty-first Century. Boston: Boston U Law School, 2006. Print.</ref>

=== Literary commentary ===
[[File:Anti-emigration.propaganda.1869.png|thumb|European governments, worried that their best young people would leave for America, distributed posters like this to frighten them (this 1869 Swedish anti-emigration poster contrasts Per Svensson's dream of the American idyll (left) and the reality of his life in the wilderness (right), where he is menaced by a mountain lion, a big snake and wild Indians who are scalping and disembowelling someone).<ref>The pictures originally illustrated a cautionary tale published in 1869 in the Swedish periodical ''Läsning för folket'', the organ of the Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge (''Sällskapet för nyttiga kunskapers spridande'').

The American Dream has been credited with helping to build a cohesive American experience, but has also been blamed for inflated expectations.<ref name=Greider>[[William Greider|Greider, William]]. ''The Nation'', May 6, 2009. [https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/future-american-dream/ ''The Future of the American Dream'']</ref> Some commentators have noted that despite deep-seated belief in the egalitarian American Dream, [[Wealth in the United States|the modern American wealth structure]] still perpetuates racial and class inequalities between generations.<ref name=Johnson6>Johnson, 2006, pp. 6–10. "The crucial point is not that inequalities ''exist'', but that they are being perpetuated in recurrent patterns—they are not always the result of individual success or failure, nor are they randomly distributed throughout the population. In the contemporary United States, the structure of wealth systematically transmits race and class inequalities through generations despite deep-rooted belief otherwise."</ref> One [[Sociology|sociologist]] notes that advantage and disadvantage are not always connected to individual successes or failures, but often to prior position in a social group.<ref name=Johnson6/>

Since the 1920s, numerous authors, such as [[Sinclair Lewis]] in his 1922 novel ''[[Babbitt (novel)|Babbitt]]'', and [[F.&nbsp;Scott Fitzgerald]], in his 1925 classic, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', [[Satire|satirized]] or ridiculed [[materialism]] in the chase for the American dream. For example, Jay Gatsby's death mirrors the American Dream's demise, reflecting the pessimism of modern-day Americans.<ref>Dalton Gross and MaryJean Gross, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D7iRLn8ZsAIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Understanding The Great Gatsby]'' (1998) p. 5</ref> The American Dream is a main theme in the book by [[John Steinbeck]], ''[[Of Mice and Men]]''. The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a [[ranch]], so they can "live off the fatta the lan'" and just enjoy a better life. The book later shows that not everyone can achieve the American Dream, although it is possible to achieve for a few. A lot of people follow the American Dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich. Some posit that the ease of achieving the American Dream changes with technological advances, availability of infrastructure and information, government regulations, state of the economy, and with the evolving cultural values of [[Demographics of the United States|American demographics]].

In 1949, [[Arthur Miller]] wrote ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', in which the American Dream is a fruitless pursuit. Similarly, in 1971 [[Hunter S. Thompson]] depicted in [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream'']] a dark psychedelic reflection of the concept—successfully illustrated only in wasted pop-culture excess.<ref>Stephen E. Ambrose, Douglas Brinkley, ''Witness to America'' (1999) p. 518</ref>

The novel ''[[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|Requiem for a Dream]]'' by Hubert Selby&nbsp;Jr. is an exploration of the pursuit of American success as it turns delirious and lethal, told through the ensuing tailspin of its main characters. [[George Carlin]] famously wrote the joke "it's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it".<ref name=Smith2010>Smith, Mark A. (2010) ''[http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/oso/public/content/oho_politics/9780199542628/oxfordhb-9780199542628-chapter-23.html The Mobilization and Influence of Business Interests]'' in L.

''Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt.'' pp. 226–227. Nation Books. {{ISBN|1568586434}}</ref>

<blockquote>The vaunted American dream, the idea that life will get better, that progress is inevitable if we obey the rules and work hard, that material prosperity is assured, has been replaced by a hard and bitter truth. The American dream, we now know, is a lie. We will all be sacrificed. The virus of corporate abuse – the perverted belief that only corporate profit matters – has spread to outsource our jobs, cut the budgets of our schools, close our libraries, and plague our communities with foreclosures and unemployment.</blockquote>

The American Dream, and the sometimes dark response to it, has been a long-standing theme in American film.<ref>Gordon B. Arnold. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zavWAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Projecting the End of the American Dream: Hollywood's Vision of U.S. Decline].'' Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2013.</ref> Many [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] films of the 1960s and 1970s ridiculed the traditional quest for the American Dream. For example, ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), directed by [[Dennis Hopper]], shows the characters making a pilgrimage in search of "the true America" in terms of the [[hippie]] movement, drug use, and [[Commune|communal]] lifestyles.<ref>Barbara Klinger, "The Road to Dystopia: Landscaping the Nation in Easy Rider" in Steven Cohan, ed.

== Political leaders ==
Scholars have explored the American Dream theme in the careers of numerous political leaders, including [[Henry Kissinger]],<ref>Jeremi Suri, "[https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-pdf/32/5/719/1115106/dh-32-719.pdf Henry Kissinger, the American Dream, and the Jewish Immigrant Experience in the Cold War]," ''Diplomatic History,'' Nov 2008, Vol. 32 Issue 5, pp.&nbsp;719–747</ref> [[Hillary Clinton]],<ref>Dan Dervin, "The Dream-Life of Hillary Clinton", ''Journal of Psychohistory'', Fall 2008, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp.&nbsp;157–162</ref> Benjamin Franklin, and [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Edward J. Blum, "Lincoln's American Dream: Clashing Political Perspectives", ''Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association,'' Summer 2007, Vol. 28 Issue 2, pp.&nbsp;90–93</ref> The theme has been used for many local leaders as well, such as [[José Antonio Navarro]], the [[Tejano]] leader (1795–1871), who served in the legislatures of Coahuila y Texas, the Republic of Texas, and the State of Texas.<ref>David McDonald, ''Jose Antonio Navarro: In Search of the American Dream in Nineteenth-Century Texas'' (Texas State Historical Association, 2011)</ref>

In 2006 U.S.&nbsp;Senator [[Barack Obama]] wrote a memoir, ''[[The Audacity of Hope|The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream]]''. It was this interpretation of the American Dream for a young black man that helped establish his statewide and national reputations.<ref>Deborah F.

Political conflicts, to some degree, have been ameliorated by the shared values of all parties in the expectation that the American Dream will resolve many difficulties and conflicts.<ref>James Laxer and Robert Laxer, ''The Liberal Idea of Canada: Pierre Trudeau and the Question of Canada's Survival'' (1977) pp.&nbsp;83–85</ref>

{{quotebox|"'''A lot of Americans think the U.S. has more social mobility than other western industrialized countries.  This (study using medians instead of averages that underestimate the range and show less stark distinctions between the top and bottom tiers) makes it abundantly clear that we have less.

The ethos today implies an opportunity for Americans to achieve prosperity through hard work. According to The Dream, this includes the opportunity for one's children to grow up and receive a good education and career without artificial barriers. It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the prior restrictions that limited people according to their class, caste, religion, race, or ethnicity. Immigrants to the United States sponsored ethnic newspapers in their own language; the editors typically promoted the American Dream.<ref>Leara D. Rhodes, ''The Ethnic Press: Shaping the American Dream'' (Peter Lang Publishing; 2010)</ref> [[Lawrence Samuel]] argues:

<blockquote>For many in both the working class and the middle class, upward mobility has served as the heart and soul of the American Dream, the prospect of "betterment" and to "improve one's lot" for oneself and one's children much of what this country is all about. "Work hard, save a little, send the kids to college so they can do better than you did, and retire happily to a warmer climate" has been the script we have all been handed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence R.

A key element of the American Dream is promoting opportunity for one's children, Johnson interviewing parents says, "This was one of the most salient features of the interview data: parents—regardless of background—relied heavily on the American Dream to understand the possibilities for children, especially their own children".<ref>{{cite book|author=Heather Beth Johnson|title=American Dream and Power Wealth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0W19AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT43|date= 2014|publisher=Routledge|page=43|isbn=9781134728794}}</ref> Rank et al. argue, "The hopes and optimism that Americans possess pertain not only to their own lives, but to their children's lives as well.

Hanson and Zogby (2010) report on numerous public opinion polls that since the 1980s have explored the meaning of the concept for Americans, and their expectations for its future. In these polls, a majority of Americans consistently reported that for their family, the American Dream is more about spiritual happiness than material goods. Majorities state that working hard is the most important element for getting ahead. However, an increasing minority stated that hard work and determination does not guarantee success. Most Americans predict that achieving the Dream with fair means will become increasingly difficult for future generations. They are increasingly pessimistic about the opportunity for the working class to get ahead; on the other hand, they are increasingly optimistic about the opportunities available to poor people and to new immigrants. Furthermore, most support programs make special efforts to help minorities get ahead.<ref>Sandra L.

Writing after the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 general election]], [[Chris Hedges]] asserted that the surrender of the liberal elite to despotism creates a power vacuum, and quoted the novelist [[J.G.

== Four dreams of consumerism ==
Ownby (1999) identifies four American Dreams that the new consumer culture addressed. The first was the "Dream of Abundance" offering a cornucopia of material goods to all Americans, making them proud to be the richest society on earth. The second was the "Dream of a Democracy of Goods" whereby everyone had access to the same products regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or class, thereby challenging the aristocratic norms of the rest of the world whereby only the rich or well-connected are granted access to luxury. The "Dream of Freedom of Choice" with its ever-expanding variety of good allowed people to fashion their own particular lifestyle. Finally, the "Dream of Novelty", in which ever-changing fashions, new models, and unexpected new products broadened the consumer experience in terms of purchasing skills and awareness of the market, and challenged the conservatism of traditional society and culture, and even politics. Ownby acknowledges that the dreams of the new consumer culture radiated out from the major cities, but notes that they quickly penetrated the most rural and most isolated areas, such as rural Mississippi. With the arrival of the [[Ford Model T|model&nbsp;T]] after 1910, consumers in rural America were no longer locked into local general stores with their limited merchandise and high prices in comparison to shops in towns and cities. Ownby demonstrates that poor black Mississippians shared in the new consumer culture, both inside Mississippi, and it motivated the more ambitious to move to Memphis or Chicago.<ref>Ted Ownby, ''American Dreams in Mississippi: Consumers, Poverty, and Culture 1830–1998'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999)</ref><ref>Christopher Morris, "Shopping for America in Mississippi, or How I Learn to Stop Complaining and Love the Pemberton Mall," ''Reviews in American History" March 2001 v.29#1 103–110</ref>

== Other parts of the world ==
The aspirations of the "American Dream" in the broad sense of upward mobility have been systematically spread to other nations since the 1890s as American missionaries and businessmen consciously sought to spread the Dream, says Rosenberg. Looking at American business, religious missionaries, philanthropies, [[Hollywood]], [[labor union]]s and Washington agencies, she says they saw their mission not in catering to foreign elites but instead reaching the world's masses in democratic fashion. "They linked [[mass production]], mass marketing, and technological improvement to an enlightened democratic spirit&nbsp;... In the emerging litany of the American dream what historian Daniel Boorstin later termed a "democracy of things" would disprove both [[Malthus]]'s predictions of [[scarcity]] and [[Marx]]'s of [[class conflict]]." It was, she says "a vision of global social progress."<ref>Emily S. Rosenberg, ''Spreading the American Dream: American Economic and Cultural Expansion 1890–1945'' (1982) pp.&nbsp;22–23</ref> Rosenberg calls the overseas version of the American Dream "liberal-developmentalism" and identified five critical components: <blockquote>(1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America's own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of [U.S.] governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economic and cultural exchange.<ref>Rosenberg, ''Spreading the American Dream'' p. 7</ref></blockquote>

Knights and McCabe argued American management gurus have taken the lead in exporting the ideas: "By the latter half of the twentieth century they were truly global and through them the American Dream continues to be transmitted, repackaged and sold by an infantry of consultants and academics backed up by an artillery of books and videos".<ref>David Knights and Darren McCabe, ''Organization and Innovation: Guru Schemes and American Dreams'' (2003) p 35</ref>

=== After World War II ===
In [[West Germany]] after [[World War II]], says [[Reiner Pommerin]], "the most intense motive was the longing for a better life, more or less identical with the American dream, which also became a German dream".<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Reiner Pommerin]]|title=The American Impact on Postwar Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFifkWzTapoC&pg=PA84|year=1997|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=84|isbn=9781571810953}}</ref> Cassamagnaghi argues that to [[women in Italy]] after 1945, films and magazine stories about American life offered an "American dream." [[New York City]] especially represented a sort of [[utopia]] where every sort of dream and desire could become true. Italian women saw a model for their own emancipation from second class status in their [[patriarchal society]].<ref>Silvia Cassamagnaghi, "New York Nella Stampa Femminile Italiana Del Secondo Dopoguerra", ["New York in the Italian women's press after World War II"] ''Storia Urbana'' (Dec 2005) 28# 109, pp.&nbsp;91–111.</ref>

=== Britain ===
The American dream regarding home ownership had little resonance before the 1980s.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World'' (2009) p .252</ref> In the 1980s, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] worked to create a similar dream, by selling [[Public housing|public-housing]] units to their tenants. Her Conservative Party called for more home ownership: "HOMES OF OUR OWN: To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own&nbsp;... We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes."<ref>See [http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/con79.htm#sale "Conservative manifesto, 1979 ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522104806/http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/man/con79.htm#sale |date=May 22, 2013 }}</ref> Guest calls this Thatcher's approach to the American Dream.<ref>David E.

=== Russia ===
Since the [[fall of Communism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the American Dream has fascinated [[Russians]].<ref>Richard M.

In 2010 his administration announced a plan for widespread home ownership: "Call it the Russian dream", said Alexander Braverman, the Director of the Federal Fund for the Promotion of Housing Construction Development. Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], worried about his nation's [[Demographics of Russia|very low birth rate]], said he hoped home ownership will inspire Russians "to have more babies".<ref>Anastasia Ustinova, [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_27/b4185007612464.htm "Building the New Russian Dream, One Home at a Time"], ''Bloomberg Business Week,'' June 28 – July 4, 2010, pp.&nbsp;7–8</ref>

[[File:Shanghai from The Bund-Site.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Shanghai]] in 2019]]
The Chinese Dream describes a set of ideals in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is used by journalists, government officials and activists to describe the aspiration of individual self-improvement in Chinese society. Although the phrase has been used previously by Western journalists and scholars,<ref name=atlantic>{{cite news|last=Fallows|first=James|title=Today's China Notes: Dreams, Obstacles|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/05/todays-china-notes-dreams-obstacles/275544/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=May 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="economist2"/> a translation of a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article written by the American journalist [[Thomas Friedman]], "China Needs Its Own Dream", has been credited with popularizing the concept in China.<ref name="economist2">{{cite news|title=The role of Thomas Friedman|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2013/05/chinese-dream-0|newspaper=The Economist|date=May 6, 2013}}</ref> He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO JUCCCE's China Dream project,<ref name=FP>{{cite news|last=Fish|first=Isaac Stone|title=Thomas Friedman: I only deserve partial credit for coining the 'Chinese dream'|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/05/03/thomas_friedman_i_only_deserve_partial_credit_for_coining_the_chinese_dream|newspaper=Foreign Policy|date=May 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name="JUCCCE">{{cite web|title=China Dream|url=http://juccce.org/chinadream|publisher=JUCCCE}}</ref> which defines the Chinese Dream as [[sustainable development]].<ref name="JUCCCE"/> In 2013, China's new [[paramount leader]] [[Xi Jinping]] began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media.<ref name="economist">[https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21577070-vision-chinas-new-president-should-serve-his-people-not-nationalist-state-xi-jinping Xi Jinping and the Chinese Dream] ''[[The Economist]]'' May 4, 2013, p. 11 </ref>

The concept of Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of "American Dream". It stresses [[entrepreneurship]] and glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post-[[reform and opening|reform]] China, such as rural immigrants who moved to the urban centers and achieve magnificent improvement in terms of their living standards, and social life. Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress. 
The idea was put forward by [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] on November 29, 2012. The government hoped to revitalize China, while promoting innovation and technology to boost the international prestige of China. In this light, the Chinese Dream, like [[American exceptionalism]], is a [[Chinese nationalism|nationalistic]] concept as well.

Some 90% of Chinese families own their own homes, giving the country one of the [[List of countries by home ownership rate|highest rates of home ownership in the world]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Brown|first=Ellen|date=June 13, 2019 |title=The American Dream Is Alive and Well—in China|url=https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-american-dream-is-alive-and-well-in-china/|work=[[Truthdig]] |access-date=June 15, 2019|author-link=Ellen Brown}}</ref>
