'''''Disney Infinity 3.0''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Nonlinear gameplay#Sandbox mode|sandbox]] [[video game]] published by [[Disney Interactive Studios]] (the last game to be published by the company before their closure) for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Apple TV]], and is the third and final installment in the [[toys-to-life]] [[Disney Infinity|''Disney Infinity'' series]]. It was developed by [[Avalanche Software]], with additional help from [[Ninja Theory]], Studio Gobo, [[Sumo Digital]], and [[United Front Games]]. In contrast to how ''[[Disney Infinity 2.0]]'' focused on [[Marvel characters]] and playsets, ''3.0'' has a focus on the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. The game was announced on May 5, 2015, and was released on August 28, 2015 in Europe and on August 30, 2015 in North America.

==Gameplay==
''Disney Infinity 3.0'' features similar gameplay mechanics to ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]''. Although sharing many key elements, the game's combat system has been redesigned to become more in-depth and complex.<ref name=Combat/> The game's combat system is influenced by the ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' and [[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II|its sequel]], ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' and most of the [[Spider-Man]]'s aerial combat-themed [[Spider-Man in video games|video game series]] (except ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'').<ref name=Combat/> [[Lightsaber]]s have been integrated into combat, due to the inclusion of ''Star Wars'' characters. Characters who use lightsabers in combat can utilize additional weapons. For instance, playable character Luke Skywalker has the ability to use a blaster and a lightsaber, which used together can juggle enemies in the air.<ref name=Combat/> Full [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]] have been integrated, which allows the player to pause mid-combo and branch off into another variation of the combo.<ref name=Combat/> Playable characters with the ability to use the Force, in ''Star Wars'' mythology, have the ability to push and pull enemies during combat.<ref name=Combat/> Special attacks, which were introduced in ''Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes'', have returned. Only the bearer of a close-ranged weapon (such as lightsabers and other blade or staff weapons), including the characters who have their own primary close-ranged weapons (like Mulan, whose primary weapon is a staff,  similar to the Jedi and Sith's own primary lightsaber), and characters who can fly are able to perform an aerial combo.<ref name=Combat/> Instead of waiting for a progress bar to fill up for a special attack to be performed, a new feature allows the attack to be released early, but the effects of the attack are not as strong.<ref name=Combat/> Auto-lock when firing ranged weapons at targets has been enhanced, so players no longer have to move closer to enemies in order to auto-lock on their positions.<ref name=Combat/>

==Plot==

===''Twilight of the Republic''===
The ''Twilight of the Republic'' Playset storyline is based on the era of the ''Star Wars'' prequel trilogy. Set during the events of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], [[Yoda]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]] discover a reactivated Droid factory on the planet Geonosis.<ref name=Combat/> The four Jedi then decide to find out who is the mastermind behind the newly minted droid army.<ref name=EWKforbes/> As the story progresses, the pair cross paths with [[General Grievous]], [[Jabba the Hutt]], [[Cad Bane]], [[Mace Windu]], [[Sebulba]], [[Padme Amidala]] and the main antagonist [[Darth Maul]], and travel to planets Coruscant, Naboo, Geonosis and Tatooine.<ref name=Combat/>

===''Rise Against the Empire''===
The ''Rise Against the Empire'' Playset storyline is based on the events of the classic ''Star Wars'' trilogy, with some differences. The playset revolves around [[Luke Skywalker]], his sister [[Princess Leia|Leia]], [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] finding themselves locked in battle with [[Darth Vader]].<ref name=EWKforbes/>

===''The Force Awakens''===
A playset based on ''[[Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens]]'' was announced at the 2015 D23 Expo and released in December of that year; it features [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]], [[Kylo Ren]], and [[Poe Dameron]] as playable characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2015/10/12/the-force-awakens-kylo-ren-poe-dameron/ |title=''Disney Infinity: The Force Awakens'' Dated, Adds Kylo Ren And Poe Dameron |work=[[Forbes]] |first=Andy |last=Robertson |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/disney-infinitys-star-wars-the-force-awakens-lets-john-boyega-play-with-himself/ |title=Disney Infinity's ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' lets John Boyega play with himself |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |first=Giancarlo |last=Valdes |date=December 9, 2015 |accessdate=December 22, 2015}}</ref>

===''Inside Out''===
In the ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' playset, Riley falls asleep watching a horror movie and chaos ensues in her subconscious. This scatters some of Riley's memories all over Imagination Land and the emotions must find and return them to headquarters before Riley awakens.

===''Marvel Battlegrounds''===
In the Marvel Battlegrounds playset, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] teams up with [[Ultron]] to manipulate all of the universe's heroes into fighting each other using robot duplicates while they steal one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] from the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian vault]]. All Marvel characters from ''[[Disney Infinity 2.0]]'' are playable in this playset, along with new characters introduced in 3.0. This is the first and only ''Disney Infinity'' play set to utilize four-player local gameplay.

===''Finding Dory''===
In the ''[[Finding Dory]]'' playset, Dory learns of a flood at the Marine Life Institute that has washed the littlest fish into all the wrong tanks. Together with Nemo, Marlin, Hank, Bailey and Destiny, she returns to rescue them and lead them out to safety. Along the way, she makes new fish friends and customizes a new reef area as a sanctuary for the rescued fish.

===Toy Box Takeover===
The Toy Box Takeover expansion game begins with Mickey summoning his friends. When [[List of The Incredibles characters#Syndrome|Syndrome]] gets his hands on Merlin and Mickey's Wand he teams up with all the other villains for control of the Toy Box. Toy Box Takeover features six dungeon crawler-style levels that can be accessed by any playable character. The player must take down Syndrome's minions before confronting him in his protected base.

===Toy Box Speedway===
The Toy Box Speedway expansion game is a battle racing game, similar to the races in the Cars Play Set from the original ''Disney Infinity'' and the ''Mario Kart'' game series.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/05/12/disney-infinity-3-0-meets-mario-kart-in-the-speedway-toy-box.aspx|title=Disney Infinity 3.0 Meets Mario Kart In The Speedway Toy Box|author=|date=|website=gameinformer.com}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://infinityinquirer.com/2015/05/05/details-of-the-four-new-toy-box-game-discs-in-disney-infinity-3-0/|title=Details Of The Four 'New' Toy Box Game Discs In Disney Infinity 3.0 – Infinity Inquirer|author=|date=5 May 2015|website=infinityinquirer.com}}</ref> Like its dungeon-crawler counterpart, Toy Box Takeover, any playable character may enter it.

==Characters==

The following is a list of character figurines that have been released and announced for ''Disney Infinity 3.0''. The starter pack, which includes the game and Infinity Base, contains figures for [[Ahsoka Tano]] ([[Ashley Eckstein]]) and [[Anakin Skywalker]] ([[Matt Lanter]]), and one playset based on ''[[Star Wars]]''. Additional figures and playsets are sold in special packs, while certain figures are sold separately.<ref name=playsets>{{cite web | url=https://infinity.disney.com/news/3204/disney-infinity-3-revealed | title=DISNEY INFINITY 3.0 REVEALED | website=Disney Infinity | date=May 5, 2015 | accessdate=May 6, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518075249/https://infinity.disney.com/news/3204/disney-infinity-3-revealed | archive-date=May 18, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition to these new characters, who were introduced for this game, all previous character figures and Power Discs from previous game series are compatible with this current game, similar to ''Disney Infinity 2.0''.<ref name=PrevFigCompat>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/05/05/our-7-favorite-things-about-disney-infinity-3-0/|title=Our 7 Favorite Things About Disney Infinity 3.0 |website=Disney Lifestyle |publisher=[[Disney|Walt Disney]] |date=May 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2016}}</ref>

==Development==
Since ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'', there have been hints of ''[[Star Wars]]'' joining the line of games. The "ultimate unlocks" in the first two ''Infinity'' games were a lightsaber and a landspeeder, respectively. Prior to the release of ''[[Disney Infinity 2.0]]'' in 2014, series producer John Vignocchi hinted that a future installment could have characters from [[Lucasfilm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/will-disney-infinity-add-star-728299|title=Will 'Disney Infinity' Add 'Star Wars' in 2015?|first=Graeme|last=McMillan|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2012|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The title's existence was first revealed following a leak from Chinese retailer Taobao showing potential character and figure designs for the third installment.<ref name="NE Rumor">{{cite web|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-disney-infinity-3-0-character-lineup-to-feature-olaf-mulan-inside-out-and-more/|title=Rumor: Disney Infinity 3.0 character lineup to feature Olaf, Mulan, Inside-Out, and more|work=Nintendo Everything|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> German retailer Saturn would later leak images of the game's Starter Pack featuring the characters of [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]] from ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-star-wars-figures-to-be-a-part-of-disney-infinity-3-0/|title=Rumor: Star Wars figures to be a part of Disney Infinity 3.0|work=Nintendo Everything|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The game was officially revealed by ''[[Game Informer]]'' on May 5, 2015.<ref name="GI Reveal">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/05/05/june-cover-revealed-disney-infinity-3-0.aspx?|title=June Cover Revealed – Disney Infinity 3.0|first=Jeff|last=Cork|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nintendoeverything.com/disney-infinity-3-0-officially-confirmed-featured-in-this-months-game-informer/|title=Disney Infinity 3.0 officially confirmed, featured in this month's Game Informer|work=Nintendo Everything|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

Studio Gobo and [[Ninja Theory]] were among development groups that worked on the game's Playsets.<ref name=EWKforbes/> In order to create a more complex combat system, compared to the first two installments, Disney decided to also have Ninja Theory revamp the game's combat, after [[LucasArts]] had expressed interest in working with the company.<ref name=Combat>{{cite web|last1=Hilliard|first1=Kyle|title=Fighting The Clone Wars: Ninja Theory's Take On Star Wars|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/05/13/twilight-of-the-republic-ninja-theory-brings-devil-may-cry-lessons-to-star-wars-and-disney-infinity.aspx|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref>

==Release==
''Disney Infinity 3.0'' was released on August 30, 2015 in North America. The Starter Pack, which includes the game disc, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano character figurines, one playset piece (Twilight of the Republic), one web card and the Disney Infinity Base, was released on the game's launch. The game also received a [[Digital distribution of video games|digital download]] release.<ref name=EWKforbes/> Exclusively in Europe, ''Disney Infinity 3.0'' had a game disc-only release without the figurines, web cards and Disney Infinity Base, that are included in the Starter Pack.<ref name=EWKforbes/>

A Saga Bundle Starter Pack was available at launch for the PS3 and PS4. It contains the basic starter pack, Rise Against the Empire playset, and [[Boba Fett]] figure. Boba Fett was a timed exclusive to this pack and was released on his own in March 2016.

Power Disc Packs, which unlock additional content in the game, are no longer sold in blind packs, contrary to the use of blind packs in the previous two games.<ref name=EWKforbes/> Instead, power discs were released in identifiable packaging.<ref name=EWKforbes/>

A special Power Disc based on [[Mickey Mouse]]'s ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' role was given out at Disney's 2015 D23 Expo. Controversially, it is an expo exclusive and was not sold in stores. Despite this, it does not affect a player's chance to get 100% completion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infinityinquirer.com/2015/08/17/psa-the-king-mickey-power-disc-is-not-in-hall-of-heroes-will-not-affect-100-completion-or-achivements/|title=PSA: The King Mickey Power Disc Is NOT In Hall Of Heroes; Will Not Affect 100% Completion or {{sic|Achi|vements|nolink=yes|expected=achievements}} – Infinity Inquirer|author=|date=17 August 2015|website=infinityinquirer.com}}</ref>

''Disney Infinity 3.0'' received very positive reviews from video game critics who praised the refinements to the Toy Box, Play Sets, combat, and reduced bugs.

===End of non-console support===
Between the March 2016 releases of the ''Marvel Battlegrounds'' Play Set and the then-new Marvel and Baloo figures, and the cancellation of the ''Disney Infinity'' series, players of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mobile game|mobile]] and [[Apple TV]] versions noticed that the game was not updated for those platforms to support the new figures or Play Set. The ''Disney Infinity'' account confirmed that the new content would be available on consoles.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=DisneyInfinity|date=March 12, 2016|number=708737231024947201|title=At this time, the new content will only be available on console.

===Closure===
Due to Disney's decision to shut down Avalanche Software and end its toys-to-life business, Disney began to gradually retire the ''Disney Infinity'' franchise, leaving it as a trilogy. On July 29, 2016, the in-game purchase system was completely removed for the Windows (except the [[Steam (service)|Steam]] version), iOS, Android, and Apple TV versions of the game. Before they did, Disney closed its game without letting anyone know. On September 30, 2016, the Windows (standalone launcher version), Apple TV, Google, and Amazon versions of the game were removed from their respective online stores (and became unplayable), and new toybox submissions ceased to be accepted. The Steam versions of ''2.0'' and ''3.0'' were also taken down with Disney Interactive announcing that "Gold Editions" of all installments of the trilogy would be provided to allow continued use of the full games and all their content after the online servers are shut down.<ref name="Steam 3.0 update">{{cite web|title=9/30: Disney Infinity Update |url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/361640/announcements/detail/827925118556100140 |website=[[Steam (software)|steamcommunity.com]] |publisher=[[Disney Interactive Studios]] |accessdate=7 October 2016 |date=30 September 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009145739/http://steamcommunity.com/games/361640/announcements/detail/827925118556100140 |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> Anyone who purchased [[downloadable content]] for those versions in-game or via Steam received the "Gold Editions" for free, and any webcodes that were redeemed still apply.<ref name="Steam 3.0 update" /> Disney released the "Gold Editions" of all three ''Disney Infinity'' games—including [[Disney Infinity (video game)|the first game]], which was previously never released either on Steam or in a full version (with playsets) on PC—on December 9, 2016 via Steam.<ref name="gold-editions-release">{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Nicholas|title=Disney Infinity Gold Editions released on Steam|url=http://wwg.com/2016/12/10/disney-infinity-gold-editions-released-on-steam/|website=WWG|publisher=ComicBook.com|accessdate=10 December 2016|date=10 December 2016}}</ref> The original Steam releases of the second and third games were completely delisted and disabled.<ref name="gold-editions-release" /> On January 3, 2017, in-game purchases in the [[Windows 8]]/[[Windows 10|10]] versions (from the [[Windows Store]]) were disabled as well. On the morning of March 3, 2017, in addition to the discontinuation of all aforementioned online services, Disney also shut down all officially related websites, including Online Profiles linked to Disney Accounts and the official forums. Apple TV and Windows 8/10 versions were unplayable as well on that day.

===Legacy===
