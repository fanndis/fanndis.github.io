In May 1999, Anwar along with other leaders of the INC, [[Sharad Pawar]] and [[P. A. Sangma]], rebelled against a foreign-origin [[Sonia Gandhi]] being chosen as the party's Prime Minister-candidate ahead of the [[1999 Indian general election|general election]]. In an open letter, they questioned her "experience and understanding of public life" in being able to rule a country "with a population of 980 million".<ref>{{cite news |title=The controversial letter to Sonia Gandhi |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/may/17pawar2.htm |accessdate=27 October 2018 |publisher=Rediff.com |date=17 May 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325045125/https://www.rediff.com/news/1999/may/17pawar2.htm# |archive-date=25 March 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A few days later, they were expelled from the party's prime membership for six years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Iype |first1=George |title=CWC expels threesome for six years |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/may/20pawar2.htm |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Rediff.com |date=20 May 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624004252/http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/may/20pawar2.htm# |archive-date=24 June 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They later quit the party and formed [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP).
