'''''Language Log''''' is a collaborative language [[blog]] maintained by [[Mark Liberman]], a [[Phonetics|phonetician]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

Most of the posts focus on [[language]] use in the media and in popular culture.  Text available through [[Google Search]] frequently serves as a [[Text corpus|corpus]] to test hypotheses about language. Other popular topics include the [[linguistic descriptivism|descriptivism]]/[[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]] debate, and linguistics-related news items. The site has occasionally held contests in which visitors attempt to identify an obscure language.

{{As of | 2012}} Denham and Lobeck characterized Language Log as "one of the most popular language sites on the Internet".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Denham |first1=Kristin |last2=Lobeck |first2=Anne |title=Linguistics for Everyone: An Introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3qJLY4YZBiwC |edition=2 |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=2012 |page=14 |isbn=9781111344382 |access-date=June 30, 2015 |quote= The Language Log ... has a few thousand daily visitors and is one of the most popular language sites on the Internet.}}</ref> {{As of|2011|6}} it received an average of almost 21,000 visits per day.<ref>[http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=sm7languagelog Language Log's Sitemeter stats]</ref> In May 2006 Liberman and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] published a compilation of some of their blog posts in book form under the title ''Far from the Madding Gerund and Other Dispatches from Language Log''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Liberman |first1=Mark |author-link1=Mark Liberman |last2=Pullum |first2=Geoffrey K. |author-link2=Geoffrey K.

==Specialties==

''Language Log'' was started on July 28, 2003, by Liberman and Pullum, a linguist then at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] (Pullum has since moved to the [[University of Edinburgh]]). One early post about a woman who wrote ''egg corns'' instead of ''[[acorn]]s'' led to the coinage of the word ''[[eggcorn]]'' to refer to a type of sporadic or idiosyncratic re-analysis. Another post about commonly recycled phrases in newspaper articles, e.g. "If [[Eskimo]]s have N words for snow, X surely have Y words for Z", resulted in the coinage of the word ''[[snowclone]]''. Both phenomena are common topics at the blog, as is ''[[linguification]]'', or the use of metaphors that turn factual observations into claims about language in general (many of which are false).

The blog has a number of recurring themes, including the difficulty of transcribing spoken utterances accurately, misuse or misunderstanding of linguistic science in the media, criticism of the popular style guide ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' by [[E. B. White]] and [[William Strunk Jr.]], and complaints about what the contributors see as the pedantry of ill-informed prescriptivists, including that of some [[copy editing|copyeditors]] (one of the blog's tags is "prescriptivist poppycock").<ref>{{cite web |url= http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=257 |title=Today's little amuse-bouche |access-date=July 6, 2009 |last= Zwicky |first=Arnold |author-link=Arnold Zwicky |date=June 20, 2008 |work=Language Log |quote=I am certainly not down on copy editors in general. I've had several bad experiences of my own, and I've heard much worse from others. But I've also been well served by excellent copy editors, and I've even spent some time being one.}}</ref> In addition, the site has critically addressed opinions and theories related to the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] concerning the relationship between culture, thought and language. Another common topic on the blog is the handling of [[taboo]] language in the media. Regular contributor [[Arnold Zwicky]] wrote a series of posts describing which words are considered [[obscenity|obscene]] in various publications, paying particularly close attention to the way these words are "asterisked" in the different media forms.

== Becky Award ==

The Becky Award is a tongue-in-cheek award given out by the site. It is named after the sixteenth-century humanist [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]], who claimed to have proved that the language of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] was [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (his mother tongue).

The award for 2006 went to [[Louann Brizendine]] for her bestselling book, ''The Female Brain'', which makes two principal claims: that women use language very differently from men, and that the causes of these differences are hormonal. ''Language Log''{{'}}s contributors quoted ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' ("riddled with scientific errors"), tracked down references in little-known journals, and presented counterarguments using the same referenced sources that Brizendine's claims drew from to demonstrate their lack of scientific reliability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003998.html |first=Mark |last=Liberman |title=The Envelope, Please |date=January 3, 2007 |work=Language Log}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002602.php |title=2006 Becky Award |publisher=Language Hat |date=January 3, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |author-link=Geoffrey Nunberg |last=Nunberg |first=Geoffrey |url= http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/beckies.html |title=The Language of Eve |work=Fresh Air |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=3 January 2007 |via=ISchool.Berkeley.edu}}</ref>
