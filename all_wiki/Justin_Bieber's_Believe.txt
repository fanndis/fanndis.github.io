==Plot==
The sequel to ''[[Justin Bieber: Never Say Never|Never Say Never]]'' continues to focus on Bieber's rise to international fame as he embarks on his [[Believe Tour]]. In new interviews with Bieber, the movie reveals long-awaited answers to questions about his passion to make music, relationships and coming of age in the spotlight as well as never-before-seen concert footage, and behind-the-scenes access. The film also features interviews with Justin's mother [[Pattie Mallette]], mentor [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond IV]], manager [[Scooter Braun]], recording artist [[Ludacris]], as well as others.

==Background==
Rumors of a sequel to ''Never Say Never'' began surfacing in the media around May 2012, when Bieber himself hinted a possible sequel for some time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disneydreaming.com/2012/05/30/justin-bieber-hints-at-never-say-never-movie-sequel/ |title=Justin Bieber Hints At "Never Say Never" Movie Sequel |publisher=Disney Dreaming.com |date=2012-05-30 |access-date=2014-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213014142/http://www.disneydreaming.com/2012/05/30/justin-bieber-hints-at-never-say-never-movie-sequel/ |archive-date=December 13, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It wasn't until January 2013 when the project was confirmed by Bieber himself tweeting about it. Concert footage was filmed during Justin's [[Believe Tour]] on January 26–27, 2013 at [[Miami]]'s [[American Airlines Arena]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Rogers |url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/01/27/justin-bieber-believe-3d-movie-filming-miami/ |title=Justin Bieber Filming New 3D Movie In Miami |publisher=Hollywood Life.com |date=2013-01-27 |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref> Two months later, in March 2013, a $4–5 million budget was appointed for the production of the sequel.<ref name=budget2/> On October 11, 2013, it was confirmed that [[Jon M.

==Release==
===Box office===
In the United States, ''Believe'' grossed $3.1 million during its first three days and was projected to generate $4.5 million in ticket sales during its five-day debut.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/justin-bieber-doc-believe-bombs-667838 |title=Justin Bieber Doc 'Believe' Bombs at Box Office, Most Fans a No Show |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2013-12-28 |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref> This is a dismal performance compared to his 2011 film which grossed $12.4 million on its opening day and $29.5 million during its opening weekend. On its third day (a Friday), ''Believe'' grossed just $790,000, putting it in an underwhelming 14th place just two days after its release.<ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"/> The film made a domestic total of $6,206,566 before closing on January 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=believe.htm |title=Believe (2013) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=2014-01-16 |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref> Overseas, the film earned $4,773,591, totaling the film's worldwide take to $10,980,157.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web|url= https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=believe.htm|title= Believe (2013)|work= [[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher= [[IMDb]]|access-date= December 30, 2013}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The film was met with mixed to negative reviews from critics. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 53% rating, based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 5.08/10.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/justin_biebers_believe/ | title=Justin Bieber's Believe (2013) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | access-date=May 7, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports a 39 out of 100 rating, based on 10 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/justin-biebers-believe | title=Justin Bieber's Believe Reviews: Metacritic | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | access-date=July 11, 2014}}</ref>

Mark Hirsh of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated the film "...amounts to damage control by way of distraction". David Edelstein of Vulture said, "My 15-year-old daughter beliebes with all her heart that Justin is everything he appears to be: an angel from on high (he descends to the stage on giant wings fashioned from guitars, drums, and other implements of his magic) but also humble, a guy in a room writing songs from the heart, songs he needs so bad just to get out. Most of those songs are about how much he wants to be your boyfriend. The work is hard, given that there are a limited number of words that rhyme with 'girl.' Squirrel. Hurl. In one number, he tells his fans that he needs a safety belt and lifts his shirt to put it on, revealing his well-defined abs. The roar shook the movie theater. Later, someone's home video shows a little girl opening a Christmas gift containing tickets to a Bieber concert. When she is finished shrieking and then weeping she begins to speak in tongues."

Todd Gilchrist of ''[[Sharon Waxman|The Wrap]]'' said, "Ultimately, it's hard to look at the film from any sort of non-fan perspective and not see it as less than [[hagiography]] – a tribute to Bieber's success, and a complimentary portrait of how well he's supposedly dealt with it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/justin-bieber-believe-review-beliebers |title='Justin Bieber's Believe' Review: Portrait of an Artist Who's No Longer a 'Baby' |publisher=TheWrap.com |date=2013-12-25 |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref> Matt Joseph of ''We Got This Covered'' concluded that, "Even if it doesn't ask all the right questions or provide the answers we're looking for, the film is a perfectly harmless piece of work that will send fangirls the world over into a tizzy and entertain those who still haven't fully hopped onto the Belieber train."<ref>[https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/justin-biebers-believe-review/ "Justin Bieber's Believe Review"]. We Got This Covered.com</ref> Pamela McClintock of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that "many of Bieber's fans are staying away. Rivals question why Open Road—owned by giant exhibitors [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal]] and [[AMC Theatres|AMC]]—decided to open ''Believe'' on Christmas, the most crowded time of the year."<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/justin-bieber-doc-believe-bombs-667838 "Box Office: Bieber Doc 'Believe' Bombs, Most Fans a No Show"]. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.</ref>

Stephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote the film "reveals little about the singer", adding "it offers no insights and few anecdotes about the real Justin Bieber". He gave the movie a rating of one and a half stars out of five, stating that "he's human, after all. If only the documentary would show it."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/justin-biebers-believe-movie-review-documentary-reveals-little-about-the-singer/2013/12/26/6e5c3472-6e5e-11e3-a523-fe73f0ff6b8d_story.html |title='Justin Bieber's Believe' movie review: Documentary reveals little about the singer |publisher=Washington Post.com |date= |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref> Mikael Wood of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized the film writing "talent is perhaps the least interesting thing about him" although stating in favor of fans that "those as hopelessly devoted may get something out of ''Believe'' but they deserve more."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood |first=Mikael |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-justin-bieber-believe-movie-review-20131228,0,7926956.story#axzz2ppF862YC |title=Review: 'Justin Bieber's Believe' is one for the zealots |publisher=LA Times.com |date=2013-12-27 |access-date=2014-03-14}}</ref>

Sheila O'Mally of [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film two and a half out of three stars. O'Mally said the film was "a strangely uneven experience, and you sense that there may be some really interesting questions that could be asked and answered, if everyone could stop being so in awe of the young pop-music god in their midst."<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Malley|first=Sheila|title=Justin Bieber's Believe movie review (2013) {{!}} Roger Ebert|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/justin-biebers-believe-2013|access-date=2020-06-14|website=rogerebert.com/|language=en}}</ref>
