'''Dorothy Frances Edith Wilding''' (10 January 1893 – 9 February 1976) was an English professional portrait photographer from [[Gloucester]], who established successful studios in both London and New York. She is known for her portraits of the [[British Royal Family]], some of which were used to illustrate [[Definitive stamp|postage stamps]], and in particular for her studies of actors and celebrities which fused glamour with modernist elegance. The historian Val Williams noted Wilding's combination of business savvy and deep understanding of aesthetic impact: 'nobody knew better than Dorothy Wilding the power of the photograph to create or destroy the desired image.'<ref name="Williams">{{Cite book|title=Women Photographers: The Other Observers 1900 to the Present|last=Williams|first=Val|publisher=Virago|year=1986|isbn=0-86068-624-8|location=|pages=150-154}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wilding wanted to become an actress or artist, but these careers were not encouraged by her uncle, in whose family she lived, so she chose instead photography, which she started to learn from the age of sixteen.<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/content/designers/wilding.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110818/http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/content/designers/wilding.html|title=Stamp Designers|archivedate=4 July 2008|work=stampmagazine.co.uk}}</ref> Wilding obtained studio experience with the American portraitist [[Marian Nielson]], before working as a re-toucher for Richard Speight in [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]]; in 1914, she opened her first studio.<ref name="Williams"/>

==Career==
By 1929 Wilding had already moved studio a few times and in her [[Bond Street]] studio attracted theatrical stars and shot her first [[British Royal Family]] portrait of the 26-year-old [[Prince George, Duke of Kent|Prince George]] (later [[Duke of Kent#Second creation, 1934|Duke of Kent]]) in 1928. Six years later Wilding was selected to take the official engagement photographs of Prince George before his marriage to Princess Marina of Greece. In 1935 a sitting booked for a Mrs Simpson on a Friday found Wilding away from the studio. Instead her leading deputy camera operator Maryon Parham took photographs of [[Wallis Simpson]], the future Duchess of Windsor, who was accompanied to the studio by Edward, Prince of Wales at a time when the relationship was not mentioned in the British press. A hand-coloured image from this session would later appear on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, marking Wallis as "Woman of the Year". 

Wilding opened a second studio in New York City on 56th Street in 1937.<ref name="NPG"/> The studio was designed in collaboration with her architect husband [[Rufus Leighton-Pearce]]. A further important series of Royal Sittings were also taken when Wilding was based in America. These were eventually followed by the famous Wilding portrait of the newly ascended [[Elizabeth II]] that was used for a series of [[Definitive stamp|definitive postage stamps]] of Great Britain used between 1952 and 1967, and a series of Canadian stamps in use from 1954 to 1962. A previous portrait sitting of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], wife of [[George VI]], had turned into a double portrait of the royal couple and was adapted for the 1937 Coronation issue stamp. That portrait led to her being the first woman awarded a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] to be the official photographer to a King and Queen at their coronation.<ref name="NPG">{{Cite web |url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07951/dorothy-wilding |title=Dorothy Wilding Biography|website=National Portrait Gallery |url-status=live |accessdate=2020-03-20}}</ref>

An autobiography, ''In Pursuit of Perfection'', was published in 1958.
