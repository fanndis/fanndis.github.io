== The Summit Conference ==

=== Background ===
The Antalya summit is the 10th edition of the G20 leaders' meeting. Together, the G20 represent around 90% of global GDP, 80% of global trade and two-thirds of the world’s population.

This year, Turkey holds the rotating Presidency of the G20. The G20 members are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. The European Union thus is a full member of the G20 and is represented at G20 summits by the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council.
The G20 members have invited Spain as a permanent invitee. Additionally, Zimbabwe was invited as they are the 2015 chair of the African Union, Malaysia was invited as they are the 2015 Chair of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Senegal was representing the New Partnership for Africa's Development, and Azerbaijan and Singapore were also invited.

The 11th edition of the G20 summit will be hosted by [[China]] in [[Hangzhou]], in 2016.

=== Results ===
The G20 summit was mostly focused on political rather than economic issues due to the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|terrorist attacks in Paris]], in which 130 people were killed. As an organization dealing with global issues of financial and economic cooperation, the G20 decided to change the format of the session. Nevertheless, the format has always been efficient enough so we can expect success in the implementation of the decisions, taken during the summit.

According to the summit results, in addition to the pre-planned communiqué, the parties adopted a declaration on [[Anti-terrorism legislation|fighting terrorism]]. "We condemn in the most serious way the heinous terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13 and in Ankara on October 10th. They are unacceptable insults to all humanity," read a joint G20 statement. The heads of state expressed their readiness to fight terrorism in all its forms, including taking steps to resist economic terrorism.<ref name=VK>{{cite web|title=Summit results in Antalya: G20 had to engage in politics instead of economics|url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/Summit-results-in-Antalya-G20-had-to-engage-in-politics-instead-of-economy.html|publisher=Vestnik Kavkaza News|accessdate=4 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208150244/http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/Summit-results-in-Antalya-G20-had-to-engage-in-politics-instead-of-economy.html|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

"The fight against terrorism is a major priority for all of our countries and we reiterate our resolve to work together to prevent and suppress terrorist acts through increased international solidarity and cooperation," read the joint statement. "We extend our deepest condolences to the victims of terrorist attacks and their families. We reaffirm our solidarity and resolve in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and wherever it occurs."<ref name=TVT>{{cite web|title=Struggle Against Terror The Top Priority: G-20 Leaders|url=http://www.thevoicetimes.com/struggle-against-terror-the-top-priority-g-20-leaders/|publisher=The Voice Times|accessdate=4 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208160733/http://www.thevoicetimes.com/struggle-against-terror-the-top-priority-g-20-leaders/|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref>
