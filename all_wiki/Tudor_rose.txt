[[File:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|The Tudor rose is a combination of the [[red rose of Lancaster]] and the [[white rose of York]].]]
The '''Tudor rose''' (sometimes called the '''Union rose''') is the traditional floral [[heraldic badge|heraldic emblem]] of England and takes its name and origins from the [[House of Tudor]], which united the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].  The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

In the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] (1485), [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], of the House of Lancaster, took the crown of England from [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], of the House of York. He thus brought to an end the retrospectively dubbed "[[Wars of the Roses]]." Kings of the [[House of Lancaster]] had sometimes used a red or gold rose as a badge; and the [[House of York]] had lately used a white rose as a badge. Henry's father was [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund Tudor]], and his mother was [[Lady Margaret Beaufort|Margaret Beaufort]] from the House of Lancaster; in January 1486 he married [[Elizabeth of York]] to bring all factions together. (In battle, Richard III fought under the banner of the boar, and Henry under the banner of the dragon of his native Wales.) The white rose versus red rose juxtaposition was Henry's invention.<ref name="penn">Penn, Thomas.

</ref> The historian Thomas Penn writes:

{{quote|The "Lancastrian" red rose was an emblem that barely existed before Henry VII. Lancastrian kings used the rose sporadically, but when they did it was often gold rather than red; [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], the king who presided over the country's descent into civil war, preferred his badge of the [[antelope]]. Contemporaries certainly did not refer to the traumatic civil conflict of the 15th century as the "Wars of the Roses". For the best part of a quarter-century, from 1461 to 1485, there was only one royal rose, and it was white: the badge of Edward IV. The roses were actually created after the war by Henry VII.<ref name=penn/>|}}

On his marriage, Henry VII adopted the Tudor rose badge conjoining the [[White Rose of York]] and the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]].  The Tudor rose is occasionally seen divided in quarters (heraldically as "quartered") and vertically (in [[heraldry|heraldic terms]] ''per pale'') red and white.<ref>Wise, p. 22</ref> More often, the Tudor rose is depicted as a [[double rose]],<ref>Fox-Davies, ''The Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 270</ref> white on red and is always described, heraldically, as "[[Proper (Heraldry)|proper]]" (that is, naturally-coloured, despite not actually existing in nature).

===Historical uses===

Henry VII was reserved in his usage of the Tudor rose. He regularly used the Lancastrian rose by itself, being the house to which he belonged. His successor [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], descended from both houses, would use the rose more often.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Age of Reformation: the Tudor and Stewart Realms, 1485-1603|last=Ryrie|first=Alec|publisher=Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group|year=2017|pages=47}}</ref>

When [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], died in 1502, his tomb in [[Worcester Cathedral]] used both roses; thereby asserting his royal descent from both the houses of Lancaster and York.<ref name=":0" />

During his reign, Henry VIII had the legendary "[[Round Table]]" at [[Winchester Castle]] – then believed to be genuine – repainted.<ref>Starkey, p. 41</ref> The new paint scheme included a Tudor rose in the centre. Previous to this, his father Henry VII had built the [[Henry VII Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] (it was later used for the site of his tomb) and it was decorated principally with the Tudor rose and the [[Beaufort portcullis]] – as a form of propaganda to define his claim to the throne.

The Tudor rose badge may appear ''slipped and crowned'': shown as a cutting with a stem and leaves beneath a crown; this badge appears in [[Nicholas Hilliard]]'s "Pelican Portrait" of Elizabeth I and since an Order in Council (dated 5 November 1800), has served as the royal [[floral emblem]] of England.

The Tudor rose may also appear ''[[dimidiation|dimidiated]]'' (cut in half and combined with half another emblem) to form a compound badge.  The [[Westminster Tournament Roll]] includes a badge of Henry and his first wife [[Catherine of Aragon]] with a slipped Tudor rose conjoined with Catherine's personal badge, the Spanish [[pomegranate]];<ref>Fox-Davies (1909), p. 276</ref> their daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] bore the same badge.<ref>Boutell, p. 229</ref> Following his ascent to the English throne, [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] used a badge consisting of a Tudor rose dimidiated with a [[Scottish thistle]] and surmounted by a royal crown.<ref>Fox-Davies (1907), p. 117.</ref> The Tudor rose was also used in the coat of arms of [[William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/terryolmsted/index-6/chapter-262/rudolf-ii|title=Rudolf II - terryolmsted|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>

===Contemporary uses===
{{ref-improve-section|date=November 2018}}
The crowned and slipped Tudor rose is used as the plant badge of England, as Scotland uses the [[thistle]], Wales uses the [[leek]], and Ireland uses the [[shamrock]] (Northern Ireland sometimes using [[flax]] instead). As such, it is seen on the dress uniforms of the [[Yeomen Warders]] at the [[Tower of London]], and of the [[Yeomen of the Guard]]. It features in the design of the [[British twenty pence coin|20-pence coin]] minted between 1982 and 2008, and in the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. It also features on the [[Arms of Canada|coat of arms of Canada]].

As part of the badge of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], the Tudor rose represents England alongside the floral badges of the other constituent parts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The heraldic badge of the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] future flagship aircraft carrier [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] uses a Tudor rose with colours divided vertically (''per pale''), inheriting the heraldry of the early twentieth century [[Dreadnought#Super-dreadnoughts|super-dreadnought]] oil-fired [[fast battleship]] [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]. The Tudor rose makes up part of the [[cap badge]] of the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The Tudor rose is used as the emblem of [[The Nautical Training Corps]], a uniformed youth organisation founded in [[Brighton]] in 1944 with 20 units in [[South East England]]. The corps badge has the Tudor Rose on the shank of an anchor with the [[motto]] "For God, Queen and Country". It is also used as part of the Corps' cap badge. 

The Tudor rose is also prominent in a number of towns and cities. The Royal Town of [[Sutton Coldfield]], uses the emblem frequently, due to the town being given [[List of place names with royal patronage in the United Kingdom|Royal Town]] status by Henry VIII. The Tudor rose appears on the [[coat of arms of Oxford]]. It is also notably used (albeit in a monochromatic form) as the symbol of the [[VisitEngland]], England's [[tourist board]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitengland.com/|title=Home|last=rradmin|date=2018-03-26|website=VisitEngland|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref> 

The borough and county of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]] uses a Tudor rose on its [[Flags of New York City|flag]] and seal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/nyregion/new-york-today-nyc-borough-flags-mermaid-parade.html|title=New York Today: Decoding Our Borough Flags|last=Levine|first=Alexandra S.|date=2017-06-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The flag and seal of [[Annapolis, Maryland]], features a Tudor rose and a thistle surmounted with a crown. The city of [[York, South Carolina]] is nicknamed "The White Rose City", and the nearby city of [[Lancaster, South Carolina]] is nicknamed "The Red Rose City".
