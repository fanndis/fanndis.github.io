In 2001 she directed Jackson again in ''[[The Caveman's Valentine]]''<ref name="mahoganycafe.com"/> about a [[schizophrenic]] homeless man trying to solve a murder mystery.<ref>Hurd (2007), p. 138.</ref> In 2002 Lemmons conceived and helmed the tribute to [[Sidney Poitier]] for the 74th Annual [[Academy Award]] show.

In 2007, she directed [[Talk to Me (2007 film)|''Talk to Me'']] that was centered around the television personality and activist Ralph Waldo "Petey" Greene Jr. that was played by [[Don Cheadle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11909705|title='Talk to Me' Director Kasi Lemmons on Petey Greene|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> For the film [[Talk to Me (2007 film)]], Lemmons received the [[NAACP Image Awards]] for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture and was named as Best Director by the [[African-American Film Critics Association]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indie Reframed|date=2016-11-01|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0392-4|editor-last=Badley|editor-first=Linda|editor-last2=Perkins|editor-first2=Claire|editor-last3=Schreiber|editor-first3=Michele|editor-last4=Schreiber|editor-first4=Michele|doi = 10.3366/edinburgh/9781474403924.001.0001}}</ref> In a [https://ff2media.com 2007 interview] with FF2 Media's [[Jan Lisa Huttner]], Lemmons said ''Talk to Me'' "became a film about a time when change was possible and even revolution was possible. We didn’t know what was going to happen. It was a very devastating time and a very frightening time, but it was alive. It was alive."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.films42.com/chats/kasi-lemmons.asp|title=Kasi Lemmons, Sensational Sista|website=www.films42.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>

Lemmons's 2019 film ''[[Harriet (film)|Harriet]]'', a biographical film about Harriet Tubman, premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Its star, [[Cynthia Erivo]], was nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{Citation|title=Harriet|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4648786/|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Lemmons said to the Los Angeles Times about her research for ''Harriet'': “All the elements of a great adventure film are right there in the Harriet Tubman story. It’s about a woman who was running a whole lot of her life so action did not have to be imposed. It’s inherent. The jeopardy, the movement, the courage, that’s all inherent and we wanted to let that play out on screen because we need our female hero stories. This one is about a tiny black woman who did incredible things.”

Lemmons explained during an interview that she considered writing to be central to her task as a director: "I've been writing scripts all the time, pretty much every day for fourteen years.... I have to write scripts, because that's the only way I can write parts that will get a lot of people whom I really want to work with involved."<ref>[[Wheeler Winston Dixon]], Rutgers University Press, Jul 11, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bgXQ7qaC7nYC&pg=PR4&lpg=PR4&dq=%22Film+Talk%22+%22Directors+at+Work%22+Dixon&source=bl&ots=KVaukJA15u&sig=2llGTqV07-fY-8TbLNT2e8MozVc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EkVhVMfrA7X9sATPtIKoBA&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Film%20Talk%22%20%22Directors%20at%20Work%22%20Dixon&f=false Film Talk: Directors at Work]; retrieved November 10, 2014 (see page 195); {{ISBN|978-0-8135-4077-1}}</ref>
