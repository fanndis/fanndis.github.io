Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink"<ref name=store /> in [[New Bern, North Carolina]], [[United States]], in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold. 

It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, "Pepsi" because it was advertised to relieve [[dyspepsia]]<ref name="TompkinsBaughman1994">{{cite book|author1=Vincent Tompkins|first=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73IOPUVwruUC|title=American Decades: 1900-1909|author2=Judith Baughman|author3=James W.

In 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi-Cola from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer [[Barney Oldfield]] was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi-Cola, describing it as "A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race." The advertising theme "Delicious and Healthful" was then used over the next two decades.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Pepsi – FAQs|url=http://www.pepsiusa.com/faqs.php?section=highlights|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506010751/http://www.pepsiusa.com/faqs.php?section=highlights|archive-date=May 6, 2008|accessdate=October 12, 2009|website=|publisher=[[PepsiCo]]|quote=1909: Automobile racing pioneer Barney Oldfield becomes the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi when he appears in newspaper ads describing Pepsi: "A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race."

In 1923, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcy—in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark.<ref name=store/> Megargel was unsuccessful in efforts to find funding to revive the brand and soon Pepsi's assets were purchased by [[Charles Guth]], the president of [[Loft, Inc.]] Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace [[Coca-Cola]] at his stores' fountains after [[the Coca-Cola Company]] refused to give him additional discounts on syrup. Guth then had Loft's chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/42028#p21|title=Guth v.

On three occasions between 1922 and 1933, the Coca-Cola Company was offered the opportunity to purchase the Pepsi-Cola company, and it declined on each occasion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Pendergrast|authorlink=Mark Pendergrast|title=For God, Country and Coca-Cola|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|pages=192–193|isbn=0-465-05468-4}}</ref>

===Growth in popularity===
During the Great Depression, Pepsi-Cola gained popularity following the introduction in 1934 of a 12-ounce bottle. Prior to that, Pepsi and Coca-Cola sold their drinks in 6.5-ounce servings for about $0.05 a bottle. With a radio advertising campaign featuring the popular jingle "Nickel, Nickel" – first recorded by the [[Tune Twisters]] in 1940 – Pepsi encouraged price-conscious consumers to double the volume their nickels could purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://baerpm.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/flashback-friday-nickel-nickel/|title=Flashback Friday- "Nickel Nickel"|last=Marketing|first=Baer Performance|date=2011-07-01|website=Baer Performance Marketing|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adage.com/article/news/pepsi-cola-advertising-years/65047|title=Pepsi-Cola Advertising Through the Years |date=1998-07-20|website=adage.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> The jingle is arranged in a way that loops, creating a never-ending tune:<blockquote>"Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that's a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you."<ref name="alot">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=1939 Radio Commercial (Twice as Much for a Nickel)|url=http://www.oldradiofun.com/downloads/Commercials.19xx.xx.xx_Pepsi_Cola.mp3|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615171027/http://www.oldradiofun.com/downloads/Commercials.19xx.xx.xx_Pepsi_Cola.mp3|archivedate=June 15, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2012|website=|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi's status.

[[File:Pepsi Cola logo 1940.svg|thumb|90px|The stylized Pepsi-Cola wordmark used from 1940 to 1950. It was reintroduced in 2014.]]
Pepsi's success under Guth came while the Loft Candy business was faltering. Since he had initially used Loft's finances and facilities to establish the new Pepsi success, the near-bankrupt Loft Company sued Guth for possession of the Pepsi-Cola company. A long legal battle, ''[[Guth v. Loft]]'', then ensued, with the case reaching the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] and ultimately ending in a loss for Guth.

===Marketing===

From the 1930s through the late 1950s, "[[Pepsi-Cola Hits The Spot]]" was the most commonly used slogan in the days of old radio, classic motion pictures, and later television.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cross |first1=Mary |title=A Century of American Icons: 100 Products and Slogans from the 20th-Century Consumer Culture |date=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0313314810  |accessdate=4 September 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/centuryofamerica00cros/page/103/ |pages=103-105}}</ref> Its jingle (conceived in the days when Pepsi cost only five cents) was used in many different forms with different lyrics. With the rise of radio, Pepsi utilized the services of a young, up-and-coming actress named [[Polly Bergen]] to promote products, oftentimes lending her singing talents to the classic "...Hits The Spot" jingle.

Film actress [[Joan Crawford]], after marrying Pepsi-Cola president [[Alfred N. Steele]] became a spokesperson for Pepsi, appearing in commercials, television specials, and televised [[beauty pageants]] on behalf of the company. Crawford also had images of the soft drink placed prominently in several of her later films. When Steele died in 1959, Crawford was appointed to the Board of Directors of Pepsi-Cola, a position she held until 1973, although she was not a board member of the larger PepsiCo, created in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joancrawfordbest.com/latimespepsi.htm|title=LA Times: Joan Crawford Appointed to Pepsi Board|publisher=Joancrawfordbest.com|date=May 7, 1959|accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

Pepsi has been featured in several films, including ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985), ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' (1992), ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999), and ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite news|last=Bricken|first=Rob|date=March 7, 2013|url=http://io9.com/5989200/20-lies-back-to-the-future-ii-told-us-besides-the-hoverboard|title=20 Lies Back to the Future II Told Us (Besides the Hoverboard)|access-date=May 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Leigh|first=Stephen|date=September 15, 2011|title=The Worst Movie Product Placements Of All Time|work=|url=http://whatculture.com/film/the-worst-movie-product-placements-of-all-time.php|url-status=live|access-date=May 5, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508181534/http://whatculture.com/film/the-worst-movie-product-placements-of-all-time.php|archivedate=May 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1992, the [[Pepsi Number Fever]] marketing campaign in the [[Philippines]] accidentally distributed 800,000 winning bottle caps for a 1 million [[Philippine peso|peso]] grand prize, leading to riots and the deaths of five people.<ref name="seattletimes">{{cite news|last1=Drogin|first1=Bob|title=Pepsi-Cola Uncaps A Lottery Nightmare -- Bombings, Threats Follow Contest With Too Many Winners|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930726&slug=1712840|accessdate=9 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Seattle Times Company|date=26 July 1993}}</ref>

In 1996, PepsiCo launched the highly successful [[Pepsi Stuff]] marketing strategy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Reuters|date=1996-04-03|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;Pepsi Introduces a New LookFor Its International Markets|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/03/business/media-business-advertising-pepsi-introduces-new-lookfor-its-international.html|access-date=2020-09-30|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> "Project Blue" was launched in several international markets outside the United States in April.<ref name=":1" /> The launch included extravagant publicity stunts, such as a Concorde airplane painted in blue colors (which was owned by Air France) and a banner on the Mir space station.

The Project Blue design was first tested in the United States in June 1997, and was released worldwide in 1998 to celebrate Pepsi's 100th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pepsi launches lavish 'blue' campaign|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/04/02/Pepsi-launches-lavish-blue-campaign/6584828421200/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=UPI|language=en}}</ref> It was at this point, the logo began to be referred to as the Pepsi Globe.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-12|title=The history of the Pepsi logo|url=https://99designs.com/blog/famous-design/pepsi-logo-history/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=99designs|language=en-US}}</ref>

In October 2008, Pepsi announced that it would redesign its logo and re-brand many of its products by early 2009. In 2009, Pepsi, [[Diet Pepsi]], and [[Pepsi Max]] began using all lower-case fonts for name brands. The brand's [[Pepsi Globe|blue and red globe trademark]] became a series of "smiles," with the central white band arcing at different angles depending on the product until 2010. Pepsi released this logo in U.S. in late 2008, and later it was released in 2009 in [[Canada]] (the first country outside of the United States for Pepsi's new logo), Brazil, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Colombia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Panama, Chile, Dominican Republic, the Philippines, and Australia. In the rest of the world, the new logo was released in 2010. The old logo is still used in several international markets, and has been phased out most recently in [[France]] and [[Mexico]].

====Niche marketing====

[[Walter Staunton Mack Jr.|Walter Mack]] was named the new president of Pepsi-Cola and guided the company through the 1940s. Mack, who supported [[progressivism|progressive]] causes, noticed that the company's strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored [[African American]]s or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying blacks. Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called "the Negro market" was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S.<ref name="WSJ">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116831396726171042|title=How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=January 9, 2016}}</ref> Mack realized that blacks were an untapped [[niche market]] and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them.<ref name="nytboyd">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/06boyd.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=May 6, 2007|title=Edward F.

In 1947, Walter Mack resumed his efforts, hiring [[Edward F. Boyd]] to lead a twelve-man team. They came up with advertising portraying black Americans in a positive light, such as one with a smiling mother holding a six pack of Pepsi while her son (a young [[Ron Brown]], who grew up to be [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]])<ref name="latboyd">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/05/local/me-boyd5|title=Edward Boyd, 92; Pepsi ad man broke color barriers|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Jocelyn Y.|last=Stewart|date=May 5, 2007|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> reaches up for one. Another ad campaign, titled "Leaders in Their Fields", profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Ralph Bunche]] and photographer [[Gordon Parks]].

Boyd also led a sales team composed entirely of blacks around the country to promote Pepsi. [[Racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow laws]] were still in place throughout much of the U.S.; Boyd's team faced a great deal of discrimination as a result,<ref name="capparellreview" /> from insults by Pepsi co-workers to threats by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name="latboyd" /> On the other hand, it was able to use its anti-racism stance as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of the Coca-Cola Company for segregationist [[governor of Georgia]] [[Herman Talmadge]].<ref name="nytboyd" /> As a result, Pepsi's market share as compared to Coca-Cola's shot up dramatically in the 1950s with African American soft-drink consumers three times more likely to purchase Pepsi over Coke.<ref>Brian D. Behnken, Gregory D. Smithers (2015). "Racism in American Popular Media: From Aunt Jemima to the Frito Bandito". p. 34. ABC-CLIO</ref> After the sales team visited Chicago, Pepsi's share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time.<ref name="nytboyd" />

Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s. The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, ladies groups, schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as [[Duke Ellington]] and Lionel Hampton to promote Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.<ref>Stephanie Capparell, "How Pepsi Opened Door to Diversity." ''CHANGE'' 63 (2007): 1-26 [http://www.comlabgames.com/45-870N/instructor/01_day/How_Pepsi_Opened_Door_to_Diversity.pdf online].</ref>

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted [[Aunt Jemima]]s and [[Uncle Ben's|Uncle Bens]], whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead, it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.<ref>Stephanie Capparell, ''The Real Pepsi Challenge: The Inspirational Story of Breaking the Color Barrier in American Business'' (2007).</ref>

This focus on the market for black people caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. It did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear white customers would be pushed away.<ref name="nytboyd" /> In a national meeting, Mack tried to assuage the 500 [[bottling company|bottlers]] in attendance by pandering to them, saying "We don't want it to become known as a nigger drink."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200702/20070227_boyd.html|first=Tavis|last=Smiley|authorlink=Tavis Smiley|date=February 27, 2007|title=Edward Boyd|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|format=interview|accessdate=May 4, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205458/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200702/20070227_boyd.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and it was cut.<ref name="WSJ" />

Boyd was replaced in 1952 by Harvey C. Russell, who was notable for his marketing campaigns towards black youth in New Orleans. These campaigns, held at locales attended largely by black children, would encourage children to collect Pepsi bottle caps, which they could then exchange for rewards. One example is Pepsi's 1954 "Pepsi Day at the Beach" event, where New Orleans children could ride rides at an amusement park in exchange for Pepsi bottle caps. By the end of the event, 125,000 bottle caps been collected. According to ''The Pepsi Cola World'', the New Orleans campaign was a success; once people's supply of bottle caps ran out, the only way they could get more was to buy more Pepsi.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Weems Jr. |first1=Robert E. |title=Desegregating the dollar: African American consumerism in the twentieth century |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=0-8147-9290-1 |pages=50-51}}</ref>

====Rivalry with Coca-Cola====
{{Main|Cola wars}}
According to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted [[blind taste test]]s in stores, in what was called the "[[Pepsi Challenge]]". These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi to Coca-Cola. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the "Challenge" across the nation. This became known as the "[[Cola Wars]]".

In 1985, [[the Coca-Cola Company]], amid much publicity, changed its [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]]. The theory has been advanced that [[New Coke]], as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge. However, a consumer backlash led to Coca-Cola quickly reintroducing the original formula as "Coca-Cola Classic".

In 1989, [[Billy Joel]] mentioned the rivalry between the two companies in the song "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]". The line "Rock & Roller Cola Wars" refers to Pepsi and Coke's usage of various musicians in advertising campaigns. Coke used [[Paula Abdul]], while Pepsi used [[Michael Jackson]]. Both companies then competed to get other musicians to advertise its beverages.

According to ''[[Beverage Digest]]''{{'}}s 2008 report on carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo's U.S. market share is 30.8 percent, while the Coca-Cola Company's is 42.7 percent.<ref>[http://www.beverage-digest.com/pdf/top-10_2009.pdf "Special Issue: Top-10 CSD Results for 2008"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419085508/http://www.beverage-digest.com/pdf/top-10_2009.pdf |date=April 19, 2009 }}, ''Beverage Digest'', March 30, 2009 (PDF)</ref> Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi in most parts of the U.S., notable exceptions being central [[Appalachia]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]].

Overall, Coca-Cola continues to outsell Pepsi in almost all areas of the world. However, exceptions include: [[Oman]], [[India]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Guatemala]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Northern Ontario]].<ref>[http://www.strategymag.com/articles/magazine/20041015/vive.html Vive la difference], ''Strategy Magazine'', October 2004</ref>

Pepsi had long been the drink of [[French-Canadian]]s, and it continues to hold its dominance by relying on local [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] celebrities (especially [[Claude Meunier]], of ''[[La Petite Vie]]'' fame) to sell its product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cassies.ca/caselibrary/winners/PepsiMeunier.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Pepsi 'Meunier' Campaign|publisher=Canadian Advertising Success Stories (Cassies) Case Library|accessdate=August 21, 2007}}</ref> PepsiCo introduced the Quebec slogan "here, it's Pepsi" (''Ici, c'est Pepsi'') in response to Coca-Cola ads proclaiming "Around the world, it's Coke" (''Partout dans le monde, c'est Coke'').

As of 2012, Pepsi is the third most popular carbonated drink in India, with a 15% market share, behind [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] and [[Thums Up]]. In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.8% of the Indian market share.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-06-26/the-top-5-sodas-in-india-by-market-share The top 5 sodas in India by market share, Euromonitor International via Bloomberg, June 26, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128080745/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-06-26/the-top-5-sodas-in-india-by-market-share |date=November 28, 2012 }}</ref> By most accounts, Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977, when it left India because of the new foreign exchange laws which mandated majority shareholding in companies to be held by Indian shareholders. The Coca-Cola Company was unwilling to dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the [[Foreign Exchange Regulation Act]] (FERA), thus sharing its formula with an entity in which it did not have majority shareholding. In 1988, PepsiCo gained entry to India by creating a joint venture with the Punjab government-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation (PAIC) and Voltas India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994. In 1993, the Coca-Cola Company returned in pursuance of India's [[Liberalization]] policy.<ref>[http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2005/India-Coca-Cola-Pepsi14mar05.htm "India: Soft Drinks, Hard Cases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203085741/http://mindfully.org/Water/2005/India-Coca-Cola-Pepsi14mar05.htm |date=February 3, 2006 }}, ''The Water Dossier'', March 14, 2005</ref>

In Russia, Pepsi initially had a larger market share than Coke, but it was undercut once the [[Cold War]] ended. In 1972, PepsiCo struck a barter agreement with the then government of the [[Soviet Union]], in which PepsiCo was granted exportation and Western marketing rights to [[Stolichnaya]] vodka in exchange for importation and Soviet marketing of Pepsi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=267835&area=/insight/insight__economy__business/|title=Pepsi's comeback, Part II|accessdate=July 21, 2007|author=Robert Laing|publisher=Mail & Guardian online|date=March 28, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215047/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=267835&area=%2Finsight%2Finsight__economy__business%2F|archivedate=September 27, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.free-essays.us/dbase/b5/lvt48.shtml Coke Vs.

Reminiscent of the way that Coca-Cola became a cultural icon and its global spread spawned words like "[[cocacolonization]]", Pepsi-Cola and its relation to the Soviet system turned it into an icon. In the early 1990s, the term "Pepsi-stroika" began appearing as a pun on "[[perestroika]]", the reform policy of the Soviet Union under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Critics viewed the policy as an attempt to usher in Western products in deals there with the old elites. Pepsi, as one of the first American products in the Soviet Union, became a symbol of that relationship and the Soviet policy. This was reflected in Russian author Victor Pelevin's book "[[Generation P]]".

In 1992, following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Coca-Cola was introduced to the Russian market. As it came to be associated with the new system and Pepsi to the old, Coca-Cola rapidly captured a significant market share that might otherwise have required years to achieve. By July 2005, Coca-Cola enjoyed a market share of 19.4 percent, followed by Pepsi with 13 percent.<ref>[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/12/30/041.html "Coke Versus Pepsi, Santa Versus Moroz"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210103301/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/12/30/041.html |date=February 10, 2006 }}, ''The Moscow Times'', December 30, 2005</ref>

Pepsi was introduced in Romania in 1966, during the early liberalization policies of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], opening up a factory at [[Constanța]] in 1967. This was done as a barter agreement similar to the one in the USSR, however, Romanian wine would be sold in the United States instead. The product quickly became popular, especially among young people, but due to the austerity measures imposed in the 1980s, the product became scarce and rare to find. Starting from 1991, PepsiCo entered the new Romanian market economy, and still maintains a bigger popularity than its competitor, Coca-Cola, introduced in Romania in 1992, despite heavy competition during the 1990s (sometime between 2000 and 2005, Pepsi overtook Coca-Cola in sales in Romania).<ref>[https://www.wall-street.ro/articol/Companii/81826/Interviu-Cum-a-ajuns-Pepsi-in-Romania.html “Interviu: Cum a ajuns Pepsi in Romania”].

Pepsi did not sell soft drinks in Israel until 1991. Many Israelis and some American Jewish organizations attributed Pepsi's previous reluctance to expand operations in Israel to fears of an Arab boycott. Pepsi, which has a large and lucrative business in the Arab world, denied that, saying that economic, rather than political, reasons kept it out of Israel.<ref>Tom Hundley [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-19/news/9202140910_1_arab-markets-pepsi-generation-arab-boycott Israel braces for new conflict: The soda war].
