In dismissing a challenge to the law on the basis that a change to the succession in Canada would require unanimous consent of all provinces under section 41(a) of the [[Constitution Act, 1982]], Quebec Superior Court Justice Claude Bouchard ruled that Canada "did not have to change its laws nor its Constitution for the British royal succession rules to be amended and effective" and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] committed Canada to having a lines of succession symmetrical to those of other Commonwealth realms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Deux profs de l'Université Laval déboutés dans la cause du "bébé royal"|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/201602/16/01-4951299-deux-profs-de-luniversite-laval-deboutes-dans-la-cause-du-bebe-royal.php|access-date=16 February 2016|work=Le Soleil|date=16 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217095139/http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/201602/16/01-4951299-deux-profs-de-luniversite-laval-deboutes-dans-la-cause-du-bebe-royal.php|archive-date=17 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=quebecappeal>{{cite news|title=La cause du "bébé royal" en appel|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201603/14/01-4960730-la-cause-du-bebe-royal-en-appel.php|last=Sèguin|first=Rhèal|date=15 March 2016|newspaper=Le Soleil|access-date=15 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316042540/http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201603/14/01-4960730-la-cause-du-bebe-royal-en-appel.php|archive-date=16 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ruling was upheld by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Marin|first1=Stephanie|title=Quebec Court of Appeal hearing case about who can inherit Canada's Crown|url=https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-court-of-appeal-hearing-case-about-who-can-inherit-canada-s-crown-1.3809400|access-date=April 26, 2018|work=CTV News|agency=Canadian Press|date=February 19, 2018}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] upheld the ruling when it declined to hear an appeal in April 2020.<ref name="scc"/>

[[Ted McWhinney]], another constitutional scholar, has argued that a future government of Canada could begin a process of phasing out the monarchy after the eventual demise of [[Elizabeth II]] "quietly and without fanfare by simply failing legally to proclaim any successor to the Queen in relation to Canada". This would, he claimed, be a way of bypassing the need for a constitutional amendment that would require unanimous consent by the federal parliament and all the provincial legislatures.<ref>Barbara Yaffe, "Ditching royals is easy, expert says

A number of [[List of Canadian awards|awards in Canada]] are likewise issued in the name of previous or present members of the royal family. Further, organizations will give commemorative gifts to members of the royal family to mark a visit or other important occasion.

=== Significance to Canadian identity ===
In his book, ''Continental Divide: the Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada,'' [[Seymour Martin Lipset]] argues that the presence of the Monarchy in Canada helps distinguish Canadian identity from American identity. Specifically, Lipset portrays the United States as a country of the revolution which struggled against "a historical source of legitimacy: a government's deriving its title-to-rule from a monarchy". Canada, meanwhile, is the country of the counter-revolution, which has willingly and successfully retained this source of legitimacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Skolnik|first=Michael L.|date=1990|title=Lipset's "Continental Divide" and the Ideological Basis for Differences in Higher Education between Canada and United States|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ420197|journal=Canadian Journal of Higher Education|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=81–93|issn=0316-1218}}</ref>

Unlike in the United Kingdom, the monarch is the only member of the Royal Family with a [[Title and style of the Canadian monarch|title established through Canadian law]]. There being no peerage in Canada, it would not be possible for others to be granted distinctly Canadian titles (as is the case for the [[Duke of Rothesay]] (Prince Charles) in [[Scotland]]), but they have always been, and continue to only be, accorded the use of a [[courtesy title]] in Canada, which is that which they have been granted via [[letters patent]] in the UK, though in Canada these are also translated to French.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://couronnecanadienne.gc.ca/fra/1396028704386/1396028775272| author=Government of Canada| title=Membres de la Famille royale| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| access-date=1 December 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102063140/http://couronnecanadienne.gc.ca/fra/1396028704386/1396028775272| archive-date=2 January 2016| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

According to the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust, [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]—due to his having lived in Canada between 1791 and 1800, and fathering [[Queen Victoria]]—is the "ancestor of the modern Canadian Royal Family".<ref name=Toffoli /> Nonetheless, the concept of the Canadian Royal Family did not emerge until after the passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, when Canadian officials only began to overtly consider putting the principles of Canada's new status as an independent [[Monarchy|kingdom]] into effect.<ref name=Parl>{{Harvnb| Galbraith| 1989| p=7}}</ref> At first, the monarch was the only member of the Royal Family to carry out public ceremonial duties solely on the advice of Canadian ministers; King [[Edward VIII]] became the first to do so when in July 1936 he dedicated the [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] in France.{{#tag:ref||group=n|name=Duties}} Over the decades, however, the monarch's children, grandchildren, cousins, and their respective spouses began to also perform functions at the direction of the Canadian Crown-in-Council, representing the monarch within Canada or abroad. But it was not until October 2002 when the term ''Canadian Royal Family'' was first used publicly and officially by one of its members: in a speech to the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut|Nunavut legislature]] at its opening, Queen Elizabeth II stated: "I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory."<ref>{{Cite book| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=4 October 2002| publication-date=1 September 2004| contribution=Speech Given by The Queen at the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on Friday 4 October 2002| contribution-url=http://www.etoile.co.uk/Speech/021004Queen.html| editor-last=Voost| editor-first=Geraldine| title=Etoile's Unofficial Royalty Site| place=Iqualuit| publication-place=London| publisher=Geraldine Voost| url=http://www.etoile.co.uk/| access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> Princess Anne used it again when speaking at Rideau Hall in 2014.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thecanadianpress.com/english/online/OnlineFullStory.aspx?filename=DOR-MNN-CP.15465426dc4f4d39a8a3cc7f30c12d04.CPKEY2008111303&newsitemid=30646704&languageid=1| last=Pedwell| first=Terry| title=Princess Anne to take part in Remembrance Day and rededication of memorial| publisher=The Canadian Press| access-date=1 December 2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604172205/http://www.thecanadianpress.com/english/online/OnlineFullStory.aspx?filename=DOR-MNN-CP.15465426dc4f4d39a8a3cc7f30c12d04.CPKEY2008111303&newsitemid=30646704&languageid=1| archive-date=4 June 2015}}</ref> By 2011, both Canadian and British media were referring to "Canada's royal family" or the "Canadian royal family".<ref>{{Cite news| last=Rayner| first=Gordon| newspaper=The Telegraph| title=Royal tour: Prince William and Kate Middleton fly to Canada for first overseas tour as married couple| location=London| date=30 June 2011| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-william/8608406/Royal-tour-Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-fly-to-Canada-for-first-overseas-tour-as-married-couple.html| access-date=5 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last=Palmer| first=Randall| title=Canadian cities ready to welcome Royals| newspaper=Toronto Sun| location=Toronto| date=30 June 2011| url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/06/30/canadian-cities-ready-to-welcome-royals| access-date=5 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last=Hough| first=Andrew| title=Royal tour: Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 14,000-mile first official trip| newspaper=The Telegraph| location=London| date=30 May 2011| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-william/8546311/Royal-tour-Kate-Middleton-and-Prince-Williams-14000-mile-first-official-trip.html| access-date=5 July 2011}}</ref>

The press frequently follows the movements of the royal family, and can, at times, affect the group's popularity, which has fluctuated over the years. Mirroring the mood in the United Kingdom, the family's lowest approval was during the mid-1980s to 1990s, when the children of the monarch were enduring their divorces and were the targets of negative [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] reporting.

[[File:François Ier Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Francis I of France]]; established colonies in [[Acadia]] and [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], 1534]]
The Canadian monarchy can trace its ancestral lineage back to the [[List of kings of the Angles|kings of the Angles]] and the early [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish kings]] and through the centuries since the claims of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] in 1497 and [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] in 1534; both being [[blood relative]]s of the current Canadian monarch. Former Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] said of the Crown that it "links us all together with the majestic past that takes us back to the [[Tudors]], the Plantagenets, the [[Magna Carta]], ''[[habeas corpus]]'', petition of rights, and English [[common law]]."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1168| last=Harper| first=Stephen| author-link=Stephen Harper| title=Prime Minister Harper introduces Australian counterpart to Parliament| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| access-date=12 November 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329125220/http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?id=1168| archive-date=29 March 2010}}</ref> Though the first French and British colonizers of Canada interpreted the hereditary nature of some indigenous North American chieftainships as a form of monarchy,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html| last=Odrowaz-Sypniewska| first=Margaret| title=The Four Indian Kings| publisher=The Courtly Lives of Kings, Peerage, Saints, Knights, and the Commoners| access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Ferguson| first=Will| author-link=Will Ferguson| title=The Lost Kingdom| journal=Maclean's| publisher=Rogers Communications| location=Toronto| date=27 October 2003| url=http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038| issn=0024-9262| access-date=23 December 2006}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2002| p=8}}</ref> it is generally accepted that Canada has been a territory of a monarch or a monarchy in its own right only since the establishment of [[Canada (New France)|colony of Canada]] in the early 16th century;<ref name=MacLeod6/> according to historian Jacques Monet, the Canadian Crown is one of the few that have survived through uninterrupted succession since before its inception.<ref name=Monet/>

After the Canadian colonies of France were, via war and treaties, ceded to the British Crown, and the population was greatly expanded by [[United Empire Loyalists|those loyal to George III]] fleeing north from persecution during and following the [[American Revolution]], [[British North America]] was in 1867 [[Confederation of Canada|confederated]] by [[Queen Victoria]] to form Canada as a [[Monarchy|kingdom]] in its own right.<ref name=DCHCrown /><ref name=Buck1 /><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/heritage/CorporateSeal/heraldry.htm| title=Heritage Saint John > Canadian Heraldry| publisher=Heritage Resources of Saint John and New Brunswick Community College| access-date=3 July 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617120638/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/heritage/CorporateSeal/heraldry.htm| archive-date=17 June 2011}}</ref> By the end of the First World War, the increased fortitude of [[Canadian nationalism]] inspired the country's leaders to push for greater independence from the King in his British Council, resulting in the creation of the uniquely Canadian monarchy through the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which was granted Royal Assent in 1931.<ref>{{Harvnb| MacLeod| 2012| p=9}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| last=Phillips| first=Stephen| title=Republicanism in Canada in the reign of Elizabeth II: the dog that didn't bark| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Summer 2004| issue=22| page=19| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=2004| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2004/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf| archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708032249/http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2004/Sum04PDFRepublicanism.pdf| archive-date=8 July 2009| url-status=dead| access-date=24 May 2009}}</ref> Only five years later, Canada had three successive kings in the space of one year, with the death of [[George V]], the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|accession and abdication]] of [[Edward VIII]], and his replacement by [[George VI]].

The latter became in 1939 the first reigning monarch of Canada to tour the country (though previous kings had done so before their accession). As the ease of travel increased, visits by the sovereign and other royal family members became more frequent and involved, seeing Queen Elizabeth II officiate at various moments of importance in the nation's history, one being when she proclaimed the country to be fully independent, via [[Constitution Act, 1982|constitutional patriation]], in 1982.<ref name=MacLeod11 /> That act is said to have entrenched the monarchy in Canada,<ref>{{Harvnb| MacLeod| 2012| p=12}}</ref> due to the stringent requirements, as laid out in the amending formula, that must be met in order to alter the monarchy in any way.<ref name=ElizabethII1982 />

Through the 1960s and 1970s, the rise of [[Quebec nationalism]] and changes in [[Canadian identity]] created an atmosphere where the purpose and role of the monarchy [[Debate on the monarchy in Canada|came into question]]. Some references to the monarch and the monarchy were removed from the public eye and moves were made by the federal government to constitutionally alter the Crown's place and role in Canada, first by explicit legal amendments and later by subtle attrition impelled by elements of the public service, the Cabinet, and governors general and their staff alike.<ref name=GardnerRight /><ref>{{Cite news| last=Joyal| first=Serge| author-link=Serge Joyal| title=Diminishing the Crown| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=10 June 2010| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/diminishing-the-crown/article1598033/| access-date=13 August 2010| location=Toronto}}</ref><ref name=Tidridge19>{{Harvnb| Tidridge| 2011| p=19}}</ref> But, provincial and federal ministers, along with loyal [[Monarchism in Canada|national citizen's organizations]], ensured that the system remained the same in essence.<ref>{{Harvnb| Phillips| 2004| p=20}}</ref> By 2002, the royal tour and associated [[fête]]s for [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|the Queen's Golden Jubilee]] proved popular with Canadians across the country,<ref>{{cite news| title=Queen drops puck, raises cheer in arena| publisher=CBC| date=6 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/06/queen_hockey021006.html| access-date=13 May 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen helps CBC TV mark 50th anniversary| publisher=CBC| date=10 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/10/queencbc021010.html| access-date=13 May 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title=Queen begins visit to New Brunswick| publisher=CBC| date=11 October 2002| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2002/10/11/queen_friday021011.html| access-date=13 May 2006}}</ref> though Canada's first republican organization since the 1830s was also founded that year.

Commentators have in the late 20th and early 21st centuries stated that contemporary Canadians had and have a poor understanding of the Canadian monarchy,<ref>{{Harvnb| Boyce| 2008a| p=115}}</ref> Michael D.

These comments were echoed by teacher and author Nathan Tidridge, who asserted that, beginning in the 1960s, the role of the Crown disappeared from provincial education curricula, as the general subject of civics came to receive less attention.<ref name="Tidridge19" /> He said Canadians are being "educated to be illiterate, ambivalent, or even hostile toward our constitutional monarchy".<ref name="Jackson11" /> [[Michael Valpy]] also pointed to the fact that "The crown's role in the machinery of Canada's constitutional monarchy rarely sees daylight. Only a handful of times in our history has it been subjected to glaring sunshine, unfortunately resulting in a black hole of public understanding as to how it works."<ref>{{Citation| last=Valpy| first=Michael| editor-last=Russell| editor-first=Peter H.| editor2-last=Sossin| editor2-first=Lorne| title=The 'Crisis'| journal=Parliamentary Democracy in Crisis| location=Toronto| publisher=University of Toronto Press| date=2009| page=4| url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Donovan.pdf}}</ref> He later iterated: "the public's attention span on the constitutional intricacies of the monarchy is clinically short".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/michael-valpy-who-takes-the-crown| last=Valpy| first=Michael| title=Who takes the Crown| date=8 June 2015| newspaper=National Post| access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>

In the 2010s, a "growing interest in the Crown and its prerogatives" was observed, as evidenced by "a burst of articles, books and conferences". This was attributed to the coincidental occurrence of publicly prominent events over a number of years, including the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute|2008 prorogation dispute]]; an increased use of royal symbols as directed by the Cabinet while headed by Stephen Harper, including two consecutive royal tours; court cases focusing on the Oath of Citizenship; and increasingly active governors. Smith and Philippe Lagassé noted in early 2016 that post-secondary students were giving more focus to the subject of the Crown.<ref name=Treble/>
