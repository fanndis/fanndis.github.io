The University of Bern operates at three levels: university, faculties and institutes. Other organizational units include interfaculty and general university units. The university's highest governing body is the Senate, which is responsible for issuing statutes, rules and regulations. Directly answerable to the Senate is the University Board of Directors, the governing body for university management and coordination. The Board comprises the Rector, the Vice-Rectors and the Administrative Director. The structures and functions of the University Board of Directors and the other organizational units are regulated by the Universities Act.<ref name="legal">{{cite web |title=Legal Matters |url=https://www.unibe.ch/university/organization/legal_matters/legal_collection/index_eng.html |website=unibe.ch |publisher=University of Bern |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>

[[File:UNI-bern-Front.jpg|left|thumb|Main building of the University of Bern]]
The University of Bern does not have a single large [[campus]] on the edge of the city, but has consistently pursued the principle of a university in the city. Most institutes and clinics are still in the Länggasse, the traditional university district adjoining the city centre,  within walking distance of one another. The Faculty of Theology and various institutes in the Faculty of Humanities are now housed in an old chocolate factory (the ''Unitobler''), and in 2005 the former women's hospital was refurbished to serve as a university centre for institutes in the Faculty of Law and Department of Economics (the ''UniS'').<ref>[http://www.bau.unibe.ch/strategien/leitziele.htm Leitziele für die räumliche Entwicklung der Universität Bern] Retrieved on Märch 25, 2011.</ref> The vonRoll site, another former factory building, is in the process of being refurbished to house the Faculty of Human Sciences and the Department of Social Sciences.

=== Early history: Collegiate school and academy (1500–1834) ===
The roots of the University of Bern go back to the sixteenth century, when, as a consequence of the [[Reformation]], a collegiate school was needed to train new pastors. As part of its reorganization of higher education, the government of Bern transformed the existing theological college into an [[academy]] with four faculties in 1805. Henceforth, it was possible to study not only theology in Bern, but also [[jurisprudence|law]] and [[medicine]].

=== The old university: New beginning and development (1834–1900) ===
As in other countries of Europe, nineteenth century politics in Switzerland were dominated by the struggle between [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] currents. The liberals gained control of the Canton of Bern in 1831 and in 1834 turned the academy into a university, with an academic staff of 45 to teach 167 students. Owing to the political situation, it was not until the [[Switzerland as a federal state|promulgation of the federal constitution]] in 1848 that the university was able to embark on a period of peaceful development. Between 1885 and 1900, the number of students doubled from 500 to 1,000. As a result, at the turn of the twentieth century the University of Bern was the largest university in Switzerland. This rapid growth reflected the university's attraction for foreign students, in particular [[Germany|Germans]] and [[Russia]]ns, who accounted for half of the total enrolment. It was also Russian female students who in the 1870s won the right for women to study.

=== The new university: New building and consolidation (1900–1950) ===
With the growing prosperity of the city of Bern, the university in the Länggasse quarter expanded at the end of the 19th century. In 1903, a new Main Building was inaugurated on the Grosse Schanze and the number of faculties increased. In 1908–09, three prominent persons put the University of Bern in the limelight. In 1908, [[Albert Einstein]] taught the first of three semesters of theoretical physics. The following year, Anna Tumarkin, a Russian philosopher, was appointed to an extraordinary professorship and thus became the first female professor at a European university entitled to examine doctoral and post-doctoral theses. Also in 1909, [[Theodor Kocher]], a Bernese surgeon, was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]]. In the following years the university consolidated its position as a small centre of higher learning with a stable enrollment of about 2,000 students.

=== The modern university: Expansion and reorganization (1950–2000) ===
After [[World War II]], a growing number of voices called for the expansion of tertiary education in Switzerland. The rapid growth in the 1950s and 1960s (enrolment at the University of Bern had already reached 5,000 in 1968) – generated pressure for expansion. The  completely revised University Act of 1996 transformed the University of Bern from an administrative division of the Department of Education of the Canton of Bern into an autonomous institution. a legal entity in its own right. The Act clearly defined the competencies of the university and of the state. The university passed another milestone in 1992, when its enrolment reached 10,000.

=== The university today: Bologna Reform and restructuring (since 2000) ===
The [[Bologna Process|Bologna Declaration]] ushered in the era of [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] credits and the bachelor's and master's degree structure. The university set strategic research priorities, such as [[Climatology|climate research]], and promoted inter-university cooperation. At the same time, the university reorganized its faculties. With the amendment to the University Act in summer 2010, the University Board of Directors acquired the right to choose its own ordinary professors and keep its own accounts separate from the state.
The University Board of Directors formulated a strategy in 2013, that  builds on the previous strategy of 2006, the 2012 mission statement and the performance mandate for the University from the Cantonal Government.<ref name="unibe2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rektorat.unibe.ch/unistab/content/planung_und_fuehrung/strategie/index_ger.html|publisher=rektorat.unibe.ch|title=Rektorat - Universität Bern|accessdate=4 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Faculties ===
[[File:Eingang - Botanischer Garten Bern.jpg|thumb|upright|Entrance to the [[Bern Botanical Gardens|Botanic Garden]]]]
The University of Bern has eight faculties:
* [[Theology]]
* [[Jurisprudence|Law]]
* Business, [[Economics]] and [[Social sciences|Social Sciences]]
* [[Medical sciences|Medicine]]
* [[Veterinary Medicine]] (Vetsuisse)
* [[Humanities]]
* [[Natural Sciences|Science]]
* [[Human Sciences]]

The medical faculties of the Universities of Bern and Basel have formed a strategic alliance in the fields of [[cardiac surgery]], [[neurosurgery]], [[pathology]] and [[microbiology]]. The Vetsuisse Faculty was created in 2006 through the merger of the Faculties of veterinary medicine of the Universities of Bern and [[University of Zurich|Zurich]]. The Humanities Faculty is comparable to the arts and sciences departments of American universities and offers majors in the three areas of art and culture, archaeology and history, and languages and literature. The Faculty of Science focuses on the natural and life sciences. The Human Sciences Faculty was founded in 2005 and offers study programmes in education, sports and psychology.

=== General university institutions ===
There are four general institutions associated with the University of Bern:
* Collegium generale (CG)
* Forum for University and Society (Forum für Universität und Gesellschaft, FUG)
* Interdisciplinary Centre for Gender Studies (Interdisziplinäres Zentrum für Geschlechterforschung, IZFG)
* Centre for Continuing University Education (Zentrum für universitäre Weiterbildung, ZUW)

The function of these general university institutions is to promote dialogue between students in different disciplines and faculties through interdisciplinary events for academic staff and students. The Centre for Continuing University Education (ZUW) focuses on scientific [[further education]]. The selection of topics in the ZUW programmes ranges from public administration through [[dentistry]] to [[pastoral care|spiritual guidance]]. In addition, the University of Bern has also taken the lead in the German-speaking world in creating a number of novel study programmes, for instance Evaluation.<ref>[http://www.zuw.unibe.ch/content/zentrum_fuer_universitaere_weiterbildung_zuw/index_ger.html Website of the ZUW] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816094041/http://www.zuw.unibe.ch/content/zentrum_fuer_universitaere_weiterbildung_zuw/index_ger.html |date=2013-08-16 }} Retrieved on 9 August 2013.</ref>
