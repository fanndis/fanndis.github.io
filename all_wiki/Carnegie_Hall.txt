It is located at 881 [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], occupying the east side of Seventh Avenue between West [[56th Street (Manhattan)|56th]] and [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]]s.

Designed by architect [[William Burnet Tuthill]] and built by philanthropist [[Andrew Carnegie]] in 1891, it is one of the most prestigious venues in the world for both classical music and popular music. Carnegie Hall has its own artistic programming, development, and marketing departments, and presents about 250 performances each season. It is also rented out to performing groups. The hall has not had a resident company since 1962, when the [[New York Philharmonic]] moved to [[Lincoln Center]]'s [[Avery Fisher Hall|Philharmonic Hall]] (renamed Avery Fisher Hall in 1973 and David Geffen Hall in 2015).<ref>{{cite news|first=Anthony|last=Thomasini|author-link=Anthony Tommasini|title=Music: Lang Lang opens Philharmonic Season as Avery Fisher Hall is Renamed|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/arts/music/review-lang-lang-opens-philharmonic-season-as-avery-fisher-hall-is-renamed.html?_r=0|date=September 25, 2015|access-date=December 25, 2015|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Carnegie Hall has 3,671 seats, divided among its three auditoriums. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962, and the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated the building as a city landmark in 1967.

Carnegie Hall is part of an artistic hub that developed around the two blocks of West 57th Street from [[Sixth Avenue]] west to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its opening in 1891 directly contributed to the development of the hub.<ref name="nyt199905092">{{Cite news|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=May 9, 1999|title=Streetscapes /57th Street Between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue; High and Low Notes of a Block With a Musical Bent|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/realestate/streetscapes-57th-street-between-avenue-americas-seventh-avenue-high-low-notes.html|access-date=November 18, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=November 13, 2001|title=Steinway Hall|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2100.pdf|access-date=November 12, 2020|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|pages=6–7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite fednyc|page=232}}</ref> The area contains several buildings constructed as residences for artists and musicians, such as [[130 West 57th Street|130]] and [[140 West 57th Street]], the Osborne Apartments, and the Rodin Studios.

== Architecture and venues ==
[[File:Carnegie_Hall_-_Entrance_(48155558951).jpg|thumb|Carnegie Hall's Main Entrance]]
Carnegie Hall is composed of three structures arranged in an "L" shape; each structure contains one of the hall's performance spaces. The original building, which houses the Isaac Stern Auditorium, is an eight-story rectangular building, designed by William Tuthill at the corner of 7th Avenue and 57th Street. The 16-story eastern wing contains the Weill Recital Hall and is located along 57th Street. The 13-story southern wing, at 7th Avenue and 56th Street, contains Zankel Hall.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/5b82f3e2-d183-472f-88f1-e4c82ffca307|title=Carnegie Hall|date=October 15, 1966|publisher=[[National Register of Historic Places]], [[National Park Service]]|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref>

===Main Hall (Stern Auditorium/Perelman Stage)===
[[File:Carnegie-hall-isaac-stern.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac Stern Auditorium]]
The Isaac Stern Auditorium seats 2,804 on five levels and was named after violinist [[Isaac Stern]] in 1997 to recognize his efforts to save the hall from demolition in the 1960s.<ref name="Stern">{{cite web|title=The A to Z of Carnegie Hall: S is for Stern|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/BlogPost.aspx?id=4294989134|date=September 23, 2013|publisher=Carnegie Hall|access-date=November 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709115621/https://www.carnegiehall.org/BlogPost.aspx?id=4294989134|archive-date=July 9, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The hall is six stories high with five levels of seating;<ref name=":0" /> visitors to the top balcony must climb 137 steps. All but the top level can be reached by elevator.<ref name="bronx.worldweb.com">{{cite web|title=Information: Accessibility|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Information/Accessibility/|publisher=Carnegie Hall|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

The main hall was home to the performances of the [[New York Philharmonic]] from 1892 until 1962. Known as the most prestigious concert stage in the US, almost all of the leading classical music and, more recently, popular music performers since 1891 have performed there. After years of heavy wear and tear, the hall was extensively renovated in 1986 (see below).

The Ronald O. Perelman Stage is 42 feet deep. The five levels of seating in the Stern Auditorium begin with the Parquet level, which has twenty-five full rows of thirty-eight seats and four partial rows at stage level, for a total of 1,021 seats. The First Tier and Second Tier consist of sixty-five boxes; the First Tier has 264 seats at eight seats per box and the Second Tier seats 238, with boxes ranging from six to eight seats each. Second from the top is the Dress Circle, seating 444 in six rows; the first two rows form an almost-complete semicircle. At the top, the balcony seats 837. Although seats with obstructed views exist throughout the auditorium, only the Dress Circle level has structural columns.<ref name="rentals">{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Stern Auditorium-Perelman Stage Rentals|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Rentals/Stern-Auditorium-Perelman-Stage-Rentals/|access-date=May 5, 2015|ref=rentals}}</ref>

===Zankel Hall===
Zankel Hall, which seats 599, is named after Judy and Arthur Zankel. Originally called simply Recital Hall, this was the first auditorium to open to the public in April 1891. Following renovations made in 1896, it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was leased to the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in 1898 and converted into a cinema, which opened as the Carnegie Hall Cinema in May 1961 with the film ''[[White Nights (1957 film)|White Nights]]'' by [[Luchino Visconti]]. It was reclaimed for use as a performance space in 1997. The completely reconstructed Zankel Hall is flexible in design and can be reconfigured in several different arrangements to suit the needs of the performers. It opened in September 2003.<ref name="nyt_20000130">{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|author-link=David W.

The 599 seats in Zankel Hall are arranged in two levels. The parterre level seats a total of 463 and the mezzanine level seats 136. Each level has a number of seats which are situated along the side walls, perpendicular to the stage. These seats are designated as boxes; there are 54 seats in six boxes on the parterre level and 48 seats in four boxes on the mezzanine level. The boxes on the parterre level are raised above the level of the stage. Zankel Hall is accessible and its stage is 44 feet wide and 25 feet deep—the stage occupies approximately one fifth of the performance space.<ref name="zankelrental">{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Zankel Hall Rental|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Rentals/Hall-Rentals/|access-date=May 5, 2015|ref=zankelrental}}</ref>

===Weill Recital Hall===
The Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall seats 268 and is named after [[Sanford I. Weill]], a former chairman of the board, and his wife Joan. This auditorium, in use since the hall opened in 1891, was originally called Chamber Music Hall (later Carnegie Chamber Music Hall); the name was changed to Carnegie Recital Hall in the late 1940s, and finally became Joan and Sanford I. Weill Recital Hall in 1986.

The Weill Recital Hall is the smallest of the three performance spaces, with a total of 268 seats. The Orchestra level contains fourteen rows of fourteen seats, a total of 196, and the Balcony level contains 72 seats in five rows.<ref name="weilhall">{{cite web|last1=Carnegie Hall|title=Weill Recital Hall|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/Information/Weill-Recital-Hall/|access-date=May 5, 2015|ref=weillhall}}</ref>

===Other facilities===
The building also contains the Carnegie Hall Archives, established in 1986, and the [[Rose Museum]], which opened in 1991. Until 2009 studios above the Hall contained working spaces for artists in the performing and graphic arts including music, drama, dance, as well as architects, playwrights, literary agents, photographers and painters. The spaces were unusual in being purpose-designed for artistic work, with very high ceilings, skylights and large windows for natural light. In 2007 the Carnegie Hall Corporation announced plans to evict the 33 remaining studio residents, some of whom had been in the building since the 1950s, including celebrity portrait photographer [[Editta Sherman]] and fashion photographer [[Bill Cunningham (American photographer)|Bill Cunningham]]. The organization's research showed that Andrew Carnegie had always considered the spaces as a source of income to support the hall and its activities. The space has been re-purposed for music education and corporate offices.<ref name="Goodman">{{cite news|first=Wendy|last=Goodman|title=Great Rooms: Bohemia in Midtown|url=http://nymag.com/homedesign/greatrooms/42385/|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=December 30, 2007|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Pressler">{{cite news|first=Jessica|last=Pressler|title=Editta Sherman, 96-Year-Old Squatter|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/10/editta_sherman_96-year-old_squ.html|work=New York|date=October 20, 2008|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

==History==

=== Founding and ownership ===
[[File:Andrew Carnegie, three-quarter length portrait, seated, facing slightly left, 1913.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Andrew Carnegie, 1913]]
Carnegie Hall is named after [[Andrew Carnegie]], who funded its construction. It was intended as a venue for the [[Oratorio Society of New York]] and the [[New York Symphony Society]], on whose boards Carnegie served. Construction began in 1890, and was carried out by Isaac A. Hopper and Company. Although the building was in use from April 1891, the official opening night was May 5, with a concert conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]] and Russian composer [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carnegiehall.org/ch/pages/1-3-1-3-1-3-1.aspx?pageid=4294981013|title=Tchaikovsky in America|publisher=Carnegie Hall official website|access-date=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905234401/https://www.carnegiehall.org/ch/pages/1-3-1-3-1-3-1.aspx?pageid=4294981013|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968416|title=1891 Andrew Carnegie's new Music Hall opens|access-date=September 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528220247/http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968416#|archive-date=May 28, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Carnegie Hall in 1895.jpg|thumb|Carnegie Hall in 1895]]
[[File:Carnegiehall 1910.jpg|thumb|Carnegie Hall in 1910]]

The hall was owned by the Carnegie family until 1925, when Carnegie's widow sold it to a real estate developer, Robert E. Simon. When Simon died in 1935, his son, [[Robert E. Simon, Jr.]], became owner. By the mid-1950s, changes in the music business prompted Simon to offer Carnegie Hall for sale to the New York Philharmonic, which booked a majority of the hall's concert dates each year. The orchestra declined, since it planned to move to [[Lincoln Center]], then in the early stages of planning. At the time, it was widely believed that New York City could not support two major concert venues. Facing the loss of the hall's primary tenant, Simon was forced to offer the building for sale. A deal with a commercial developer fell through, and in 1957, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] on the move to Lincoln Center, the building was slated for demolition to make way for a commercial skyscraper.<ref name="Inc1957">{{cite book|author=Time Inc|title=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UT8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91|date=September 9, 1957|pages=91–|issn=0024-3019}}</ref> Under pressure from a group led by violinist [[Isaac Stern]] and many of the artist residents, special legislation was passed that allowed the City of New York to buy the site from Simon for $5 million (which he would use to establish [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]), and in May 1960 the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation was created to run the venue. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1962.<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref name="nrhpinv">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000535}}| first=Richard| last=Greenwood| title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Carnegie Hall| date=May 30, 1975| publisher=[[National Park Service]]| access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="nrhpphotos">{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000535|photos=y}}| title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Carnegie Hall—Accompanying Photos| date=May 30, 1975| publisher=National Park Service| access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Renovations and additions===
In 1947, Robert Simon Jr., president of Carnegie Hall, undertook renovations of the hall which were carried out by New York firm, Kahn and Jacobs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stratigakos|first1=Despina|title=Elsa Mandelstamm Gidoni|url=https://pioneeringwomen.bwaf.org/elsa-mandelstamm-gidoni|website=Pioneerng Women of American Architecture|publisher=Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation|access-date=September 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Carnegie Hall History Timeline|url=https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History/Timeline|website=CarnegieHall.org|publisher=The Carnegie Hall Corporation}}</ref> The building was more extensively renovated in 1986 and 2003, by [[James Stewart Polshek]], who became better known through his post-modern [[planetarium]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Polshek and his firm, [[Polshek Partnership]], were involved since 1978 in four phases of the Hall's renovation and expansion including the creation of a Master Plan in 1980; the actual renovation of the main hall, the Stern Auditorium, and the creation of the Weill Recital Hall and Kaplan Rehearsal Space, all in 1986;<ref name="Timeline">{{cite web|title=History of the Hall: Timeline – 1986 Full interior renovation completed|publisher=Carnegie Hall|access-date=November 14, 2014|url=http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968843|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095338/http://www.carnegiehall.org/History/Timeline/Timeline.aspx?id=4294968843|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> the creation of the Rose Museum, East Room and Club Room (later renamed Rohatyn Room and Shorin Club Room, respectively), all in 1991; and, most recently, the creation of Zankel Hall in 2003.<ref name="nyt_20000130" /><ref name="nyt_20030912" />

The renovation was not without controversy. Following completion of work on the main auditorium in 1986, there were complaints that the famous acoustics of the hall had been diminished.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sounds in the night|first=Michael|last=Walsh|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963548-1,00.html|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 16, 1987|volume=129|issue=7}}</ref>  Although officials involved in the renovation denied that there was any change, complaints persisted for the next nine years. In 1995, the cause of the problem was discovered to be a slab of concrete under the stage. The slab was subsequently removed.<ref name="Kozinn">{{cite news|last=Kozinn|first=Allan|author-link=Allan Kozinn|title=A Phantom Exposed: Concrete at Carnegie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/us/a-phantom-exposed-concrete-at-carnegie.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1995|access-date=November 14, 2014|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In June 2003, tentative plans were made for the Philharmonic to return to Carnegie Hall beginning in 2006, and for the orchestra to merge its business operations with those of the venue. However, the two groups abandoned these plans later in 2003.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite news|title=N.Y.

In 2014, Carnegie Hall opened its Judith and Burton Resnick Education Wing, which houses 24 music rooms, one of which is large enough to hold an orchestra or a chorus. The $230 million project was funded with gifts from [[Sanford I. Weill|Joan and Sanford I. Weill]] and the Weill Family Fund, Judith and Burton Resnick, [[Lily Safra]] and other donors, as well as $52.2 million from the city, $11 million from the state and $56.5 million from bonds issued through the Trust for Cultural Resources of the City of New York.<ref name="Cooper2014">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Cooper|date=September 12, 2014|title=Carnegie Hall Makes Room for Future Stars: Resnick Education Wing Prepares to Open at Carnegie Hall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/arts/music/resnick-education-wing-prepares-to-open.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 14, 2014|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Most of the greatest performers of classical music since the time Carnegie Hall was built have performed in the Main Hall, and its lobbies are adorned with signed portraits and memorabilia. The [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]], frequently recorded in the Main Hall for [[RCA Victor]]. On November 14, 1943, the 25-year old [[Leonard Bernstein]] had his major conducting debut when he had to substitute for a suddenly ill [[Bruno Walter]] in a concert that was broadcast by [[CBS]],<ref>[[:File:1943 Nov 14 NYPhil Bernstein.jpg|Playbill]] and [[:File:1943 Nov 14 NYPhil Bernstein.ogg|CBS announcement]], concert on November 14, 1943</ref> making him instantly famous. In late 1950, the orchestra's weekly broadcast concerts were moved there until the orchestra disbanded in 1954. Several of the concerts were televised by NBC, preserved on [[kinescope]]s, and have been released on home video.

Many legendary jazz and popular music performers have also given memorable performances at Carnegie Hall including [[Benny Goodman]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Billy Eckstine]], [[At Carnegie Hall (Dave Brubeck Quartet album)|the Dave Brubeck Quartet]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Judy at Carnegie Hall|Judy Garland]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Simon and Garfunkel]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Shirley Bassey]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], all of whom made celebrated live recordings of their concerts there.

The hall has also been the site of many famous lectures, including the [[Tuskegee Institute Silver Anniversary Lecture]] by [[Booker T. Washington]], and the last public lecture by [[Mark Twain]], both in 1906.

The 2015–2016 season celebrated the hall's 125th anniversary and the launch of an unprecedented commissioning project of at least 125 new works with 'Fifty for the Future" coming from Kronos (25 by female composers and 25 by male composers).

==Management and operations==
Since July 2005, the Executive and Artistic Director of Carnegie Hall is Sir [[Clive Gillinson]], formerly managing director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].

The hall's operating budget for the 2008–2009 season was $84&nbsp;million. For 2007–2008, operating costs exceeded revenues from operations by $40.2&nbsp;million. With funding from donors, investment income and government grants, the hall ended that season with $1.9&nbsp;million more in total revenues than total costs.

==Carnegie Hall Archives==
It emerged in 1986 that Carnegie Hall had never consistently maintained an archive. Without a central repository, a significant portion of Carnegie Hall's documented history had been dispersed. In preparation for the celebration of Carnegie Hall's centennial in 1991, the management established the Carnegie Hall Archives that year.<ref name="Binkowski 2016">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zTfCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1|title=Opening Carnegie Hall: The Creation and First Performances of America's Premier Concert Stage|last=Binkowski|first=C.J.|publisher=McFarland, Incorporated, Publishers|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4766-2398-6|page=1|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Hill 2005">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rKsR6NeulcC&pg=PA45|title=Classical|last=Hill|first=B.|publisher=Facts On File, Incorporated|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8160-6976-7|series=American Popular Music|page=45|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>
