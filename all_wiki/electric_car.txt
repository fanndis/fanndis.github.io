Electric cars are a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]]. Low-speed electric vehicles, classified as [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle|Neighborhood Electric Vehicles]] (NEVs) in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html |title=US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100227044214/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html |archive-date=27 February 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdf |title=Citizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles) }}{{dead link |date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car using [[solar panel]]s as a power source is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to battery electric vehicles, but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

Electric cars were popular until advances in [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) cars ([[electric starter]]s in particular) and [[mass production]] of cheaper [[petrol]] (gasoline) and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] vehicles led to a decline. ICE cars' much quicker refueling times and cheaper production costs made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] that replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Laukkonen|first=J.D.|date=1 October 2013|title=History of the Starter Motor|url=http://www.crankshift.com/history-starter-motor/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921052450/http://www.crankshift.com/history-starter-motor/|archive-date=21 September 2019|access-date=30 September 2019|work=Crank Shift}}</ref>

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s. Batteries can be designed to supply the electrical current needed to support these motors. Electric motors have a flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, most electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have faster acceleration than average ICE cars, largely due to reduced drivetrain frictional losses and the more quickly-available torque of an electric motor.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gas-powered vs. Electric Cars: Which Is Faster? |url= https://auto.howstuffworks.com/gas-powered-vs-electric-cars-which-is-faster.htm |work=How Stuff Works |date=15 January 2019 |access-date=5 October 2020 |first=Cherise |last=Threewitt |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190322181830/https://auto.howstuffworks.com/gas-powered-vs-electric-cars-which-is-faster.htm |archive-date=22 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> However NEVs may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors.

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}
[[File:Energy flow in cars (recuperation in green).pdf|thumb|Energy efficiency of electric cars in towns and on motorways according to the [[United States Department of Energy|DoE]].]]

Internal combustion engines have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories; [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%; electric vehicles have efficiencies of 69-72%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 59-62%, when counted against required energy to recharge.<ref name=PEVs2>{{Cite book |title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington? |first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/10/electric-car-myth-buster-efficiency/ |title=Electric Car Myth Buster – Efficiency |date=2018-03-10 |website=CleanTechnica |language=en-US |accessdate=2019-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418004549/https://cleantechnica.com/2018/03/10/electric-car-myth-buster-efficiency/ |archive-date=18 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Electric motors are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. However, they are not equally efficient at all speeds. To allow for this, some cars with dual electric motors have one electric motor with a gear optimised for city speeds and the second electric motor with a gear optimised for highway speeds. The electronics select the motor that has the best efficiency for the current speed and acceleration.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2019/07/22/ev-transmissions-are-coming-and-its-a-good-thing/ |title=EV Transmissions Are Coming, And It's A Good Thing |first=Jennifer |last=Sensiba |work=CleanTechnica |date=2019-07-23 |access-date=2019-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723194905/https://cleantechnica.com/2019/07/22/ev-transmissions-are-coming-and-its-a-good-thing/ |archive-date=23 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.<ref name=TwoBillion/><ref name=PEVs2/>

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]], such as on the Nissan Leaf.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Can heat pumps solve cold-weather range loss for EVs?|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1124387_can-heat-pumps-solve-cold-weather-range-loss-for-evs|access-date=2020-11-13|website=Green Car Reports|language=en}}</ref> [[Positive Temperature Coefficient|PTC junction cooling]]<ref>{{cite patent |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}</ref> is also attractive for its simplicity&nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the 2008 Tesla Roadster.

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Renault Zoe and Tesla cars can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.<ref>{{cite web |author=NativeEnergy |url= https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130411184704/https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |archive-date=11 April 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603061952/http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |archive-date=3 June 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/ |title=Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen |website=teslarati.com |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2015-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221192753/http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/ |archive-date=21 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some electric cars (for example, the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]]) use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]] [[external battery|external batteries]] and USB fans or coolers, or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked; two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090707082048/http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |archive-date=7 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will, on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits (to the occupant).<ref>{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|author2=Transportation Research Board|author3=Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences|author4=Board on Energy and Environmental Systems|author5=Committee on the Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|title=Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRybeDbz8R8C&pg=PA71|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-07601-2|page=71|access-date=6 February 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191224152556/https://books.google.com/books?id=yRybeDbz8R8C&pg=PA71|archive-date=24 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Depending on where the battery is located, it may lower the center of gravity, increasing driving stability, lowering the risk of an accident through loss of control.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear, and no [[parking pawl]] may be present, the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case, the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic transmission car.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-03 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120403043125/http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |archive-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

When an internal combustion vehicle's accelerator is released, it may slow by [[engine braking]], depending on the type of transmission and mode. EVs are usually equipped with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] that slows the vehicle and recharges the battery somewhat.<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Lampton |title=How Regenerative Braking Works |date=23 January 2009 |website=HowStuffWorks.com |url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking.htm |accessdate=21 November 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190915134246/https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking.htm |archive-date=15 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Regenerative braking systems also decrease the use of the conventional brakes (similar to engine braking in an ICE vehicle), reducing brake wear and maintenance costs.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer batteries]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles.]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}

Lithium-ion-based batteries are often used for their high power and energy density.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What happens to old electric vehicle batteries?|url=https://www.whichcar.com.au/car-advice/what-happens-to-old-ev-batteries|access-date=2020-10-30|website=WhichCar|language=en-au}}</ref> Other battery types are cheaper, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]], but have a poorer power-to-weight ratio than lithium-ion. Batteries with different chemical compositions are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] that could be much lighter.

The majority of electric cars are fitted with a display of the expected range. This may take into account how the vehicle is being used and what the battery is powering. However, since factors can vary over the route, the estimate can vary from the actual range. The display allows the driver to make informed choices about driving speed and whether to stop at a charging point en route. Some [[roadside assistance]] organizations offer charge trucks to recharge electric cars in case of emergency.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/ |title=AAA says that its emergency electric vehicle charging trucks served "thousands" of EVs without power |first=Fred |last=Lambert |work=Electrek |date=2016-09-06 |access-date=2016-09-06 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160910081813/https://electrek.co/2016/09/06/aaa-ev-emergency-charging-truck/ |archive-date=10 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Charging===
{{update section |date=March 2019}}
{{main|Charging station}}
Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a [[charging station]] installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/ |title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle?

[[File:2014 BYD E6.jpg|thumb|[[BYD e6]] is able to recharge to 80% in 15 minutes]]

Compared to fossil fuel vehicles, the need for charging using public infrastructure is diminished because of the opportunities for home charging; vehicles can be plugged in and begin each day with a full charge, assuming the home charging station can charge quickly enough. An overnight charge of 8 hours using a 120-volt AC outlet will provide around {{convert|40|miles|km|round=5|order=flip|abbr=in}} of range, while a 240-volt AC outlet will provide approximately {{convert|180|miles|km|round=5|order=flip|abbr=in}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl |title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings |date=2018-03-09 |work=Union of Concerned Scientists |accessdate=2018-11-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181130071654/https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl |archive-date=30 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Charging an electric vehicle using public charging stations takes longer than refueling a fossil fuel vehicle. The speed at which a vehicle can recharge depends on the charging station's charging speed and the vehicle's own capacity to receive a charge. Connecting a vehicle that can accommodate very fast charging to a charging station with a very high rate of charge can refill the vehicle's battery to 80% in 15 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://eftm.com/2019/04/electric-cars-everything-you-need-to-know-58764 |title=Electric Cars - everything you need to know |date=2019-04-02 |website=EFTM |language=en-US |accessdate=2019-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222080829/https://eftm.com/2019/04/electric-cars-everything-you-need-to-know-58764 |archive-date=22 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Vehicles and charging stations with slower charging speeds may take as long as an hour to refill a battery to 80%. As with a mobile phone, the final 20% takes longer because the systems slow down to fill the battery safely and avoid damaging it.

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to substantially reduce the effective time to recharge.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners |title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners? |date=2016-07-19 |work=Machine Design |accessdate=2018-05-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180521191453/http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners |archive-date=21 May 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Electric vehicle charging plugs are not yet universal throughout the world. Europe uses the [[Combined Charging System|CCS]] standard, while [[CHAdeMO]] is used in Japan, and a [[Guobiao standards|GB/T]] standard is used in China. The United States has no de facto standard, with a mix of [[Combined Charging System|CCS]], [[Tesla Supercharger]]s, and [[CHAdeMO]] charging stations. However vehicles using one type of plug are generally able to charge at other types of charging stations through the use of plug adapters.<ref name="Autoblog2018">{{Cite news |url= https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/ |title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs |website=Autoblog |accessdate=2018-09-03 |language=en |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082058/https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/ |archive-date=3 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles with vehicle-to-grid capabilities could contribute energy to the grid. These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. The batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.<ref>{{cite news |title=Groupe Renault begins large-scale vehicle-to-grid charging pilot |url= https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/emily-folk/groupe-renault-begins-largescale-vehicletogrid-charging-pilot-20190322 |work=Renewable Energy Magazine |date=22 March 2019 |access-date=22 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190322175643/https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/emily-folk/groupe-renault-begins-largescale-vehicletogrid-charging-pilot-20190322 |archive-date=22 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles}}
{{See also|Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles}}

Several national, provincial, and local governments around the world have introduced policies to support the mass-market adoption of [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s. A variety of policies have been established to provide: financial support to consumers and manufacturers; non-monetary incentives; subsidies for the deployment of charging infrastructure; and long-term regulations with specific targets.<ref name=EVOutlook2020/><ref name=ICCT2020>{{cite web| url=https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV_city_policies_white_paper_fv_20200224.pdf | title=Analyzing Policies to Grow the Electric Vehicle Market in European Cities | first1=Sandra | last1=Wappelhorst | first2= Dale | last2=Hall | first3=Mike | last3=Nicholas | first4=Nic | last4=Lutsey |publisher=[[International Council on Clean Transportation]] | date=February 2020| accessdate=2020-06-18}}</ref>

Financial incentives for consumers are aiming to make electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars due to the higher upfront cost of electric vehicles. Depending on battery size, there are one-time purchase incentives such as [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles|grants and tax credits]]; exemptions from import duties; exemptions from [[toll road|road tolls]] and [[congestion charge]]s; and exemption of registration and annual fees.

The U.S. offers a [[Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles#United States|federal income tax credit]] up to {{USD|7,500}}.<ref name=IRS2009>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/irb/2009-48_IRB/ar09.html |title=Notice 2009–89: New Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328102104/http://www.irs.gov/irb/2009-48_IRB/ar09.html |archive-date=28 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The UK offers a [[Plug-in Car Grant]] up to {{GBP|4,500}} ({{USD|5,929}}).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.goultralow.com/changes-to-the-electric-car-grant/ |title=Electric car grant: the lowdown on the changes for 2016 |publisher=Go Ultra Low |date=2016-03-02 |accessdate=2016-03-02 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826172209/https://www.goultralow.com/changes-to-the-electric-car-grant/ |archive-date=26 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> France introduced a [[bonus-malus]] {{CO2}}-based tax that penalizes fossil-fuel vehicle sales.<ref name=EVOutlook2020/><ref name=ICCT2020/><ref name=QuotaEVS/> {{Asof|2020}}, monetary incentives are available in several [[European Union member states]], China, Norway, some provinces in Canada, South Korea, India, and other countries.<ref name=EVOutlook2020/>

== Psychological barriers to adoption ==
For the past century, most people have driven ICE cars, making them feel common, familiar, and low risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bergquist|first1=Magnus|last2=Nilsson|first2=Andreas|date=June 2016|title=I saw the sign: Promoting energy conservation via normative prompts|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|language=en|volume=46|pages=23–31|doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2016.03.005}}</ref> Even though EV technology has been around for over a century and modern EVs have been on the market for decades, multiple studies show that various psychological factors impair EV adoption.

=== Range anxiety ===
{{Main|range anxiety}}
A 2019 study found that the dominant fear hindering EV adoption was [[range anxiety]].<ref name="Brase">{{Cite journal|last=Brase|first=Gary L.|s2cid=52880808|date=2019-02-17|title=What Would It Take to Get You into an Electric Car? Consumer Perceptions and Decision Making about Electric Vehicles|journal=The Journal of Psychology|language=en|volume=153|issue=2|pages=214–236|doi=10.1080/00223980.2018.1511515|pmid=30260757|issn=0022-3980}}</ref> ICE car drivers are accustomed to going on trips without having to plan refueling stops, and may worry that an EV will lack the range to reach their destination or the closest charging station.<ref name="Günther">{{Cite journal|last1=Günther|first1=Madlen|last2=Rauh|first2=Nadine|last3=Krems|first3=Josef F.|date=April 2019|title=How driving experience and consumption related information influences eco-driving with battery electric vehicles – Results from a field study|journal=Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour|language=en|volume=62|pages=435–450|doi=10.1016/j.trf.2019.01.016}}</ref> Range anxiety has been shown to diminish among drivers who have gained familiarity and experience with EVs.<ref name="Günther" />

=== Identity concerns ===
This same study also found that people view driving an EV as an action taken by those with "stronger attitudes in favor of environmental and energy security" or by those that are "attracted to the novelty and status associated with being among the first to adopt new technology".<ref name="Brase" /> Thus, people may be resistant to EV ownership if they do not consider themselves [[environmentalist]]s or [[early adopter]]s of new technology, or do not want others to think of themselves in this way.

The perceived value associated with driving an EV can also differ by [[gender]]. A 2019 survey conducted in [[Norway]] found that people believe [[Woman|women]] drive EVs for sustainability purposes, while [[Man|men]] drive EVs for the new technology.<ref name="Anfinsen">{{Cite journal|last1=Anfinsen |first1=Martin |last2=Lagesen |first2=Vivian Anette |last3=Ryghaug |first3=Marianne|date=June 2019 |title=Green and gendered? Cultural perspectives on the road towards electric vehicles in Norway|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment |language=en|volume=71|pages=37–46|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2018.12.003|doi-access=free}}</ref> The thought process behind this [[stereotype]] is that "big and expensive cars are driven by men, while women drive smaller, less valuable cars".<ref name="Anfinsen" /> Since the reasons behind adopting EVs have a gender component, it can be argued that some fear driving an EV will result in a disconnect between their [[gender identity]] and how they are perceived by others.
