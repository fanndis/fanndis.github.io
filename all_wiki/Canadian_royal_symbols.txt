'''Canadian royal symbols''' are the visual and auditory identifiers of the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarchy]], including the [[viceroy]]s, in the country's federal and provincial jurisdictions. These may specifically distinguish organizations that derive their authority from the Crown (such as parliament or police forces), [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|establishments with royal associations]], or merely be ways of expressing [[Loyalist|loyal]] or [[Patriotism|patriotic]] sentiment.

Most royal symbols in Canada are based on inherited predecessors from [[France]], [[England]], and [[Scotland]], the evidence of which is still visible today, though, over time, adaptations have been made to include uniquely Canadian elements. Some representations were discarded during and after the 1970s, within an evolving [[Canadian identity]], while others were created over the same time and continue to be up to the present. Today, symbols of the monarchy can be seen in military badges, [[:Category:Canadian coats of arms|provincial and national coats of arms]], royal prefixes, [[Royal monuments in Canada|monuments]], and [[Royal eponyms in Canada|eponymous names of geographical locations and structures]].

==Purpose==
[[File:Mace of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.JPG|thumb|[[Ceremonial mace#Canada|Mace]] of the [[Legislative Assembly of Nunavut]]. The mace is a symbol of the authority the legislature derives from the monarch.]]
The use of royal symbols developed from the first royal emblems and images of [[List of French monarchs|French]], [[List of English monarchs|English]], [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish]], and, later, [[List of British monarchs|British monarchs]] that were brought by colonists to [[New France]] and [[British North America]] to represent the authority of the sovereign back in [[Europe]]. The first verifiable use of a royal symbol in Canada was when [[Jacques Cartier]] raised the Royal [[Arms of France]] on the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] in 1534.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~HeritageSaintJohn/CorporateSeal/heraldry.htm| title=Heritage Saint John > Canadian Heraldry| publisher=Heritage Resources of Saint John and New Brunswick Community College| accessdate=3 July 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306130913/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/~HeritageSaintJohn/CorporateSeal/heraldry.htm| archivedate=6 March 2005}}</ref> Since then, some icons were created for use uniquely in the Canadas—mostly coats of arms. But, only after the [[World War I|First World War]] did growing Canadian nationalism lead to changes in the appearance and meaning to Canadians of royal symbols. Since Canada gained [[Statute of Westminster 1931|full legislative independence]] from the United Kingdom in 1931, images of the reigning monarch have been employed to signify either Canada's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]],<ref name=RUF>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/union-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Citizenship and Identity > Symbols of Canada > The Royal Union Flag| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=24 September 2009}}</ref> the Crown's authority, loyalty to Canada,<ref name=DCH3>{{Cite journal| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| author-link=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Canada: Symbols of Canada| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2008| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/101/101-eng.pdf| page=3| accessdate=9 September 2009| ref=CITEREFDepartment_of_Canadian_Heritage2008}}</ref> or Canada's full statehood.<ref name=MacLeod17>{{Citation| last=MacLeod| first=Kevin S.| authorlink=Kevin S.

The main symbol of the monarchy is the sovereign him or herself, being described as "the personal expression of the Crown in Canada" and the [[Monarchy of Canada#Personification of the Canadian state|personification of the Canadian state]].<ref name=DCH3 /><ref>{{cite book| last=MacKinnon| first=Frank| title=The Crown in Canada| publisher=Glenbow-Alberta Institute| year=1976| location=Calgary| pages=[https://archive.org/details/crownincanada0000mack/page/69 69]| isbn=978-0-7712-1015-0| url=https://archive.org/details/crownincanada0000mack/page/69}}</ref> Thus, the image of the sovereign acts as an indication of that individual's authority and therefore appears on objects created by order of the [[Queen-in-Council|Crown-in-Council]], such as coins, postage stamps, and the [[Great Seal of Canada]]. Through the 1800s, effigies and pictures of the monarch—[[Queen Victoria]], especially—came to be symbolic of the wider [[British Empire]], to which Canada belonged. As with other royal symbols, though, the general domestic meaning of the sovereign's portrait altered through the 20th century. The [[Royal cypher|Royal Cypher]] is also regarded as a personal logo of the monarch, generally consisting of at least his or her initials. In Canada, the cypher has come to be indicative of the country's full sovereignty.<ref>{{Harvnb| MacLeod| 2008| p=61}}</ref>

Queen Elizabeth II has posed for a number of Canada's prominent photographers, the first being [[Yousuf Karsh]], who made a formal portrait of Elizabeth when she was a 17-year-old princess and, later, took a series of official pictures of the Princess, in formal and informal poses, just months before she acceded to the throne. Karsh was commissioned on two subsequent occasions to create series of pictures of the Queen and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]], once prior to Elizabeth's 1967 tour of Canada for the [[Canadian Centennial|centenary of Canada's confederation]], when he photographed the royal couple at [[Buckingham Palace]], and again in 1984, creating a set of portraits that included a shot of the Queen with her [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]], Shadow. Prior to her second tour of Canada as queen in 1959, Elizabeth requested that a Canadian photographer take her pre-tour pictures and [[Donald McKeague]] of [[Toronto]] was selected. Then, in 1973, [[Onnig Cavoukian]], also from Toronto, made a photographic portrait that was dubbed "The Citizen Queen" because of the informal way in which Elizabeth was depicted. [[Rideau Hall]] photographer John Evans captured the sovereign on film in 1977, during her [[Silver Jubilee]] stay in Ottawa; Evans portrayed the Queen following her return from [[Speech from the throne|opening parliament]].<ref name=CRHT /> More recently, photographic portraits of Queen Elizabeth II were made in 2002, as part of [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|her Golden Jubilee]] celebrations, and in 2005, when she marked the centenaries of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]].

A crown may also be found atop signs in [[Ontario]] for the [[Provincial highways in Ontario#King's Highways|King's Highways]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]]. A crown is also present on various [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Canada|Canadian decorations and medals]], as well as the insignia for all the country's orders, reflecting the monarch's place as the ''[[fount of honour]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hon/nat-honour-honneur/index-eng.htm |last=Royal Canadian Mounted Police |title=Honours and Recognition Programs > Canadian National Honours |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323114038/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/hon/nat-honour-honneur/index-eng.htm |archivedate=23 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/chart-tableau-eng.asp?ref=SM |last=Department of National Defence |authorlink=Department of National Defence (Canada) |title=DH&R Home > Canadian Honours Chart > Sacrifice Medal (SM) |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate=2 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114162425/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhr-ddhr/chc-tdh/chart-tableau-eng.asp?ref=SM |archivedate=14 November 2009 }}</ref> The crown may exist on a medallion as a part of the Royal Cypher and/or on the sovereign's head in effigy, though it can also be placed atop the medal of badge of an order.

In the 21st century, several Canadian decorations and medals were introduced that featured a uniquely Canadian [[diadem]], the ''Snowflake Diadem'', on the head of the sovereign's effigy. Designed, and approved by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008, the diadem is made up of alternating snowflakes and maple leaves.{{sfn|Jackson|2018|p=218}}<ref name=DJW /> However, the diadem does not physically exist; and is considered to be a "heraldic invention" for the purposes of "nationalizing the sovereign,"{{sfn|Jackson|2018|p=218}} symbolizing her status as the "Queen of Canada"<ref name=DJW /> Canadian decorations and medals that have an effigy with the Snowflake Diadem includes the [[Operational Service Medal (Canada)|Operational Service Medal]], [[Polar Medal (Canada)|Polar Medal]], [[Sacrifice Medal]], and the [[Sovereign's Medal for Volunteers]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gg.ca/honours/medals/hon04-sm_e.asp |last= Office of the Governor General of Canada |authorlink= Governor General of Canada |title= Honours > Medals > Sacrifice Medal |publisher= Queen's Printer for Canada |accessdate= 30 August 2009 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090209192807/http://gg.ca/honours/medals/hon04-sm_e.asp |archivedate= 9 February 2009 }}</ref>{{sfn|Jackson|2018|p=218}} The diadem is also depicted in the Diamond Jubilee Window in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|Canadian Senate foyer]].<ref name=DJW />

==Mace==
{{further|Parliament of Canada#Monarch}}
In the federal and provincial parliaments, [[Ceremonial mace|maces]] represent the authority of the monarch in the legislature. At the apex of each mace is a crown, substituting for the deadly bulge of the prehistoric club and the spiked ball of the medieval battle mace. Members of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly, or National Assembly cannot pass bills until the relevant mace has been placed before the speaker of the chamber. This acknowledges that parliament's power to legislate stems from the Crown.<ref name=CE2 />

==Flags==
{{See also|List of Canadian flags}}
[[File:Queen-Alberta2.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth II enters a car bearing the [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|monarch's Canadian royal standard]]]]
Similar to [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[flag]]s are utilised to represent royal authority and specific royal and viceroyal offices. The [[Flag of France#The Tricolore|standards of the kings of France]] were the first royal flags to be used in what is now Canada, a flag bearing the arms of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] being used as the symbol of [[New France]] after the colony was in 1663 reformed as a royal province of [[France]]. The contemporary [[Royal standards of Canada#Sovereign's standard|royal standard of the Canadian sovereign]] is a [[Banner#Heraldic banners|heraldic banner]] that bears the shield of the [[Arms of Canada|monarch's Canadian arms]] [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the personal device of Queen Elizabeth II—a crowned ''E'' in a circle of roses—and is used by the Queen whenever in Canada or acting on behalf of the country abroad, the flag being flown from any building or vehicle occupied by the monarch.<ref name=DCH2 /> This flag was created in 1961 to replace the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]], which had been previously used by the Canadian monarch in Canada and overseas.

The [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|flag of the governor general]] displays the crest of the Canadian royal arms—a crowned lion holding a maple leaf—and is used in a fashion akin to the sovereign's flag.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/emb/index_e.asp| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Heraldry > Emblems of Canada and of Government House > The Governor General's Flag| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=25 September 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://archive.today/20061009183849/http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/emb/index_e.asp| archivedate=9 October 2006}}</ref> Each of the provincial viceroys also has [[Flags of the Lieutenant Governors of Canada|a representative flag]], most being a blue field on which is displayed the shield of the province's arms surmounted by a crown. Prince [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; and [[Anne, Princess Royal]] also each have [[Royal standards of Canada#Other members of the Royal Family|their own personal Canadian standards]], which follow in precedence that of the viceroy of the relevant jurisdiction.

The [[Union Flag]] was formerly used as a national flag of Canada, prior to the adoption of the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]] in 1965.<ref name=flag>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/flag-canada-history.html|title=History of the National Flag of Canada|publisher=Department of Canadian Heritage|accessdate=27 November 2019|date=4 February 2019|website=canada.ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190912202105/https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/flag-canada-history.html|archive-date=12 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following the adoption of the Maple Leaf flag, the Union Flag was retained as an official flag of Canada and renamed the ''Royal Union Flag'' by parliamentary resolution, intended as a marker of Canada's loyalty to the Crown and membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=RUF /><ref name=flag/> Both it and the standard of royal France have a prominent place in the Royal Arms of Canada.

==Verbal and musical symbols==
Music and song are utilised in various ways as reminders and identifiers of the sovereign or viceroys. By tradition, the tune "[[God Save the Queen|God Save the King]]" (or "God Save the Queen" in the reign of a female monarch) was heard in the Canadian colonies since the late 18th century and continued to be played after [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867. In 1980, "[[O Canada]]" was adopted as the national anthem and "God Save the Queen" became, by convention, the [[Honors music|Royal Anthem]],<ref>{{Harvnb| Department of Canadian Heritage| 2008| p=4}}</ref> for use as a musical salute to the sovereign in person or as a display of loyalty in any circumstance. It was also incorporated into the Canadian Royal Salute, which is used upon the arrival of the governor general or a lieutenant governor and consists of the first six bars of the Royal Anthem followed by the first and last four bars of "O Canada".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ltgov.sk.ca/vice_regal_salute.htm| last=Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan| title=Lieutenant Governor > Royal Salute| publisher=Queen's Printer for Saskatchewan| accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref>

At official functions, regardless of whether or not the monarch is personally present, the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]] may be recited; it consists of a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to the health of the sovereign and is generally led by the host of or guest of honour at a ceremony, aside from the monarch him or herself. In [[English language|English]], the toast is: "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Queen of Canada," and in [[French language|French]]: "Mesdames et Messieurs, à la Reine du Canada." In the [[mess]] of regiments in which the monarch holds an honorary appointment, the toast is modified slightly to be read as: "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Queen of Canada, our Colonel-in-Chief," and in French: "Mesdames et Messieurs, à la Reine du Canada, notre colonel en chef." Where a band is present, the Royal Anthem is played following the recital of the Loyal Toast.<ref name=DND>{{Cite journal|last=Department of National Defence |author-link=Department of National Defence (Canada) |title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces |pages=449–450 |place=Ottawa |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |date=1 April 1999 |url=http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf |id=A-AD-200-000/AG-000 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |ref=CITEREF_Department_of_National_Defence_1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325162006/http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 }}</ref>
[[File:Citizenship ceremony Corus Quay. 04.jpg|thumb|Photo portrait of the sovereign at the front of a citizenship ceremony. A declaration of fealty to the sovereign forms a part of the [[Oath of Citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]].]]
The monarch also acts as the locus of fealty in the [[Oath of Allegiance (Canada)|Oath of Allegiance]], which also forms a part of the [[Oath of Citizenship (Canada)|Oath of Citizenship]]. This giving of allegiance to the sovereign has been described as the expression of "a solemn intention to adhere to the symbolic keystone of the Canadian Constitution as it has been and is, thus pledging an acceptance of the whole of our constitution and national life."<ref>{{cite court| litigants=Aralt Mac Giolla Chainnigh v. the Attorney-General of Canada| vol=T-1809-06| pinpoint=14.4| court=Federal Court of Canada| date=21 January 2008| url=http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2008/2008fc69/2008fc69.pdf| accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref>

The word ''royal'' itself is [[List of Canadian organizations with royal prefix|frequently used as a prefix]] to the name of an [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|organization that has gained the monarch's favour or patronage]]. The granting of this distinction falls within the [[Royal Prerogative]] and thus is conferred by the monarch through the office of her [[viceroy]], with input from the Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion Programme within the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] on whether or not the institution meets the designated criteria: The organization must have been in existence for at least 25 years,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/actvt/105-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > Reinforcement of constitutional links with the institutions of the Canadian Monarchy| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref> be financially secure, and be non-profit, amongst others.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/fr-rf/criter-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > The Canadian Monarchy > Royal patronage and the prefix "Royal"| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=27 September 2009}}</ref> Any organization that has been so honoured may receive appropriate royal insignia when petitioning the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] for a grant of armorial bearings or other emblem.

Similarly, ''crown'' is commonly used in language related to governance or law enforcement. Terms include ''[[Crown ward]]'', ''[[Crown land]]'', ''Crown held property'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dgcb-dgras/pd/fs-se/gm-mg/2009/414-011759Z-eng.asp| last=Department of National Defence| title=DCBA 414 011759Z Apr 09 MFSI Annual Rates for the Fiscal Year 2009/2010| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=16 May 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828111747/http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dgcb-dgras/pd/fs-se/gm-mg/2009/414-011759Z-eng.asp| archivedate=August 28, 2009 }}</ref> ''[[Crown corporations of Canada|Crown corporations]]'', ''[[Crown copyright]]'',<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |title=Canada |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/can_political_e/map.pdf |format=PDF |year=2006 |accessdate=16 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326043231/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/national/can_political_e/map.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 }}</ref> and ''the Crown'' can refer to the government's lawyers in courts of law.

==Calendar dates==
[[File:230505 fireworks4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Victoria Day]] fireworks display from [[Ontario Place]].]]
Certain dates are of royal significance in Canada. [[Victoria Day]] has been since 1834 a holiday to mark the birthday of Queen Victoria. After 1957, the same date was designated as the reigning monarch's [[Birthday#Official birthdays|official birthday]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/victoria-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > Victoria Day > Sovereign's Birthday| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=12 May 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205141327/http://pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/victoria-eng.cfm| archive-date=5 February 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref> At military sites, on navy vessels, and on government property, flags will also be flown to mark specific royal occasions, including [[Accession Day]] (6 February), the actual birthday of the monarch (presently 21 April), the official birthday of the monarch (Monday before 25 May), and the birthday of [[List of Canadian monarchs#List of royal consorts of Canada|the royal consort]] (10 June).<ref>{{Harvnb| Department of National Defence| 1999| p=309}}</ref>

Each year since 1932, the monarch has delivered the [[Royal Christmas Message]] to the British Commonwealth (later the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]); originally broadcast on the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] [[BBC World Service|Empire Service]], it is today shown in Canada on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] television and radio. Except for being read at observances by loyal societies, the Queen's Commonwealth Day (second Monday in March) message is ignored by the media in Canada.

==Geographic names==
There are hundreds of [[Royal eponyms in Canada|places named for Canadian monarchs]] and members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Royal Family]] all across Canada. No individual has been more honoured than Queen Victoria in the names of Canada's public buildings, streets, populated places, and physical features. The trend for naming places after the sovereign began after the Queen granted [[John Ross (Arctic explorer)|John Ross]] permission to name a small bay in the [[Northwest Passage]] after her. Following this, explorers and mapmakers gave the name ''Victoria'' to a multitude of geographical features all over the Canadian map; her name appears more than 300 times. Also, amongst the 280 postal divisions in Canada, more than half have at least one thoroughfare identified by the name ''Victoria''.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Rayburn| first=Alan| contribution=Biography > Women Leaders > Victoria| title=The Canadian Encyclopedia| editor-last=Marsh| editor-first=James Harley| place=Toronto| publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/victoria/| accessdate=24 September 2009| ref=harv| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910000712/http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008358| archivedate=10 September 2009}}</ref>
