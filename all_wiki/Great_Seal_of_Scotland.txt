[[File:The Great Seal of Scotland under HM Elizabeth II.jpg|thumb|350px|The Great Seal of Scotland under [[Elizabeth II]] in red [[beeswax]].]]

The '''Great Seal of Scotland''' ({{lang-gd|Seala Mòr na h-Alba}}) allows the monarch to authorise official documents without having to sign each document individually. Wax is melted in a metal mould or matrix and impressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes to make official. The earliest [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] impression, in the Treasury of [[Durham Cathedral]], is believed to be the Great Seal of [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]] and dates to 1094.

==History==
The [[Chancellor of Scotland|chancellor]] had the custody of the King's Seal. <ref>See list for years AD1057-1794, pp.&nbsp;78–82 in  "A political index to the histories of Great Britain and Ireland" by Robert Beatson: https://archive.org/stream/apoliticalindex02beatgoog#page/n88/mode/2up</ref>

Strictly, the continuation of the Great Seal of Scotland was guaranteed by the [[Treaty of Union]] which provided that "a Seal in Scotland after the Union be alwayes kept and made use of in all things relating to private Rights or Grants, which have usually passed the Great Seal of Scotland, and which only concern Offices, Grants, Commissions, and private Rights within that Kingdom". Hence, the [[Scotland Act 1998]] refers to the current seal as "the seal appointed by the Treaty of Union to be kept and made use of in place of the Great Seal of Scotland". Nevertheless, the seal is still commonly referred to as the Great Seal of Scotland.

Section 12 of the [[Treason Act 1708]], still in force today, makes it [[treason]] in Scotland to counterfeit the seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Ann/7/21/section/XII|title=Treason Act 1708|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>

The design of the Great Seal is a responsibility of the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]. The reverse of the seal shows the monarch on horseback, but is not changed from reign to reign—the current version is that engraved in 1911 for the accession of [[King George V]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The obverse is inscribed "ELIZABETH II D G BRITT REGNORVMQVE SVORVM CETER REGINA CONSORTIONIS POPULORUM PRINCEPS F D" and the figure on it is the same as on the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom]].<ref>The inscription is abbreviated Latin for "Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the Britains and of Her Other Kingdoms Queen, Head of the Commonwealth of Nations, Defender of the Faith". See [[Great Seal of the Realm]].</ref>

The Great Seal is administered by the keeper of the Great Seal, one of the [[Great Officers of State]]. From 1885 this office was held by the [[secretary for Scotland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/48-49/61/section/8/enacted|title=Secretary for Scotland Act 1885|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref> later the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. It transferred in 1999 to the [[first minister of Scotland]],<ref>Scotland Act 1998, section 45(7)</ref> whose place in the [[order of precedence in Scotland]] is determined by his or her office as keeper of the Great Seal. In practice the Seal is in the custody of the keeper of the Registers of Scotland, who has been appointed as deputy keeper.
