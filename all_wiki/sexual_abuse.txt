Spousal sexual abuse is a form of [[domestic violence]]. When the abuse involves threats of unwanted sexual contact or forced sex by a woman's husband or ex-husband, it may constitute [[rape]], depending on the jurisdiction, and may also constitute an assault.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Patricia|first1=Mahoney|title=The Wife Rape Fact Sheet|url=https://mainweb-v.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/wiferape.shtml|website=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center|publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref>

===People with developmental disabilities===
{{Main|Sexual abuse of people with developmental disabilities}}
People with developmental disabilities are often victims of sexual abuse. According to research, people with disabilities are at a greater risk for [[victimization]] of sexual assault or sexual abuse because of lack of understanding (Sobsey & Varnhagen, 1989).

===People with dementia===
Elderly people, especially those with dementia, can be at risk of abuse.  There were over 6,000 "safeguarding concerns and alerts" at UK care homes from 2013 to 2015. These included alleged inappropriate touching and worse allegations. Offenders were most often other residents but staff also offended. It is suspected some care homes may deliberately overlook these offenses.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37416483 Sex crimes against the elderly - are they being ignored?] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>

Sometimes abuse victims are not believed because they are not seen as credible witnesses due to their dementia. Perpetrators frequently target victims who they know are unlikely to be believed. Spouses and partners sometimes continue to pursue sexual relations, without realising they no longer have this right, because the person with dementia can no longer consent.<ref name=ncall>[http://www.ncall.us/sites/ncall.us/files/H_07%20Sexual%20Assault.pdf CHALLENGES WHEN INVESTIGATING ELDER SEXUAL ABUSE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008054822/http://www.ncall.us/sites/ncall.us/files/H_07%20Sexual%20Assault.pdf |date=2016-10-08 }}</ref>

Sex abuse is one of the most common forms of abuse in nursing homes{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Positions of power==
{{See also|Abusive power and control|Power harassment|Rankism}}
[[Sexual misconduct]] can occur where one person uses a position of authority to compel another person to engage in an otherwise unwanted sexual activity.  For example, [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace might involve an employee being coerced into a sexual situation out of fear of being dismissed.  [[Sexual harassment in education]] might involve a student submitting to the sexual advances of a person in authority in fear of being punished, for example by being given a failing grade.
