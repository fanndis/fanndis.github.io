=== Background and information gathering ===

In September 2015, the ''[[Washington Free Beacon]]'', a conservative publication, retained the services of [[Fusion GPS]], a private Washington D.C. political [[research]] firm, to conduct research on several primary Republican Party candidates including Trump. The research was not primarily related to Russia and was ended once Trump was determined to be the presidential nominee.

The firm was subsequently hired by the [[Hillary Clinton]] campaign and the [[Democratic National Committee]] through their shared attorney at Perkins Coie, [[Marc Elias]].

=== Whistleblower ===

Steele's reaction to the revelations from his sources has been described as that of a [[whistleblower]].

=== Revealed identity ===

On 11 January 2017, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' revealed that Steele was the author of the dossier about Trump, citing "people familiar with the matter".<ref name="WSJ_Hope_2017"/> Although the dossier's existence had been "common knowledge" among journalists for months at that point and had become public knowledge during the previous week, Steele's name had not been revealed. ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' asserted that Steele's anonymity had been "fatally compromised" after [[CNN]] published his nationality.<ref name="tg-terrified" />

''[[The Independent]]'' reported that Steele left his home in England several hours before his name was published as the author of the dossier, as he was fearful of retaliation by Russian authorities.<ref name="tg-terrified" /> In contrast, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that he left after he had been identified earlier in the day by the initial ''The Wall Street Journal'' report.<ref name="WashingtonPost_Dossier1_2017">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/12/this-former-british-spy-was-identified-as-the-trump-dossier-source-now-he-is-in-hiding/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=This former British spy was identified as the Trump dossier source.

Christopher Burrows, director of Orbis Business Intelligence, Ltd., said he would not "confirm or deny" that Orbis had produced the dossier.<ref name="NBC_Memo_2017">{{cite web|last=Nichols |first=Hans |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-british-spy-christopher-steele-prepared-explosive-trump-memo-n705891 |title=Former British Spy Christopher Steele Prepared Explosive Trump Memo |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>

The ending of Steele's relationship with the FBI was variously reported as due to either the public revelation of Steele's identity, or Steele's release of information to the press, or Steele's denial to the FBI of having spoken to the press.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-once-planned-to-pay-former-british-spy-who-authored-controversial-trump-dossier/2017/02/28/896ab470-facc-11e6-9845-576c69081518_story.html|title=FBI once planned to pay former British spy who authored controversial Trump dossier|last=Hamburger|first=Tom|date=28 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2 February 2018|last2=Helderman|first2=Rosalind S.|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/read-the-fisa-memo_us_5a731280e4b0bf6e6e2236d9|title=Read The GOP's Controversial Secret FISA Memo|last=Lavender|first=Paige|date=2 February 2018|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2 February 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> One source dated this event to late October 2016.<ref>Andrew C.

On 7 March 2017, as some members of the United States Congress were expressing interest in meeting with or hearing testimony from Steele, he reemerged after weeks in hiding, appearing publicly on camera and stating, "I'm really pleased to be back here working again at the Orbis's offices in London today".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/donald-trump-russia-dossier-christopher-steele-ex-spy-british-a7616326.html|title=Ex-British spy Christopher Steele breaks silence over Trump Russia dossier|date=7 March 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=11 March 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Disclosure and reactions ===

In early January 2017, a two-page summary of the dossier was presented to President [[Barack Obama]] and incoming President Donald Trump in meetings with Director of National Intelligence [[James Clapper]], FBI Director [[James Comey]], CIA Director [[John O. Brennan|John Brennan]], and NSA Director Admiral [[Michael S.

On 10 January 2017, [[BuzzFeed]] was the first media outlet to publish the full 35-page dossier. In publishing the Trump dossier, BuzzFeed said it had been unable to verify or corroborate the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|first=Masha|last=Gessen|authorlink=Masha Gessen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/lessons-from-russia-verify-everything-dont-publish-rumors.html|title=Lessons From Russia: Verify Everything, Don't Publish Rumors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=14 January 2017}}</ref> The UK issued a DSMA notice on 10 January 2017, requesting that the media not reveal Steele's identity,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Register on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/819281049985257472|website=Twitter|accessdate=26 January 2017|date=11 January 2017|quote=US media names ex-MI6 agent as source of the CNN/BuzzFeed dossier on Trump.

[[Ynet]], an Israeli online news site, reported that US intelligence advised Israeli intelligence officers to be cautious about sharing information with the incoming Trump administration, until the possibility of Russian influence over Trump, suggested by Steele's report, has been fully investigated.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ronen|last=Bergman|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4906642,00.html|title=US intel sources warn Israel against sharing secrets with Trump administration|website=[[Ynet]]|date=12 January 2017}}</ref>

Former British ambassador to Russia, Sir [[Tony Brenton]], read Steele's report. Speaking on [[Sky News]] he said, "I've seen quite a lot of intelligence on Russia, and there are some things in it which look pretty shaky". Brenton expressed some doubts due to discrepancies in how the dossier described aspects of the hacking activities, as well as Steele's ability to penetrate the Kremlin and Russian security agencies, given that he is an outsider.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trump dossier 'shaky'—former British envoy|url=http://news.sky.com/story/trump-dossier-shaky-ex-british-envoy-to-russia-says-10726703|website=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=13 January 2017}}</ref>

On 15 March 2017, former Acting CIA Director [[Michael Morell]] raised questions about the dossier. He was concerned about the accuracy of the information, due to the approach taken by Steele to gather it. Steele gave money to intermediaries and the intermediaries paid the sources. Morell said, "Unless you know the sources, and unless you know how a particular source acquired a particular piece of information, you can't judge the information—you just can't." Morell continued to believe Russia attempted to influence the election.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dilanian|first1=Ken|title=Clinton Ally Michael Morell says no evidence of Trump–Russia collusion|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176|website=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en|date=16 March 2017}}</ref>

==== Role in the origins of the FBI's Russia investigation ====

Although the dossier later became one factor among many in the [[Crossfire Hurricane (FBI investigation)|Russia investigation]], it had no role in the start of the investigation. This fact has been the subject of intense discussion and controversy, largely fuelled by false claims made by Trump and his supporters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18277089/fox-news-steele-dossier-lie-trump-witch-hunt|title=Fox News has normalized a lie about the origins of the Russia investigation|first=Aaron|last=Rupar|date=22 March 2019|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}</ref><ref name="Cassidy_2/2/2018">{{cite web | last=Cassidy | first=John | title=The Nunes Memo Undermines the Right's Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theory | newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] | date=2 February 2018 | url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-nunes-memo-undermines-the-rights-trump-russia-conspiracy-theory | access-date=29 April 2018}}</ref>

Alfa Bank partners Petr Aven, Mikhail Fridman, and German Khan brought a lawsuit for defamation in Britain against Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele's private intelligence firm. In July 2020, Justice Warby from the [[Queen's Bench]] Division of the British [[High Court of Justice]] ordered Steele to pay damages to Aven and Fridman who Steele claimed had delivered "large amounts of illicit cash" to Vladimir Putin when Putin was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Judge Warby said the claim was "demonstrably false" and awarded the damages to compensate "for the loss of autonomy, distress and reputational damage caused by the breaches of duty". The judge stated that Steele's dossier also inaccurately claimed that Aven and Fridman provided foreign policy advice to Putin.<ref name="wsj080720">{{cite news |last1=Kantchev |first1=Alan Cullison and Georgi |title=Christopher Steele's Firm Ordered in U.K. to Pay Damages to Russian Bankers |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/christopher-steeles-firm-ordered-in-u-k-to-pay-damages-to-russian-bankers-11594247095?mod=rsswn |accessdate=9 July 2020 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=8 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="foxnews090720">{{cite news |last1=Re |first1=Greg |title=Ex-spy Christopher Steele ordered to pay damages over 'inaccurate' dossier claims |url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/christopher-steele-ordered-pay-damages-dossier |accessdate=9 July 2020 |publisher=Fox News |date=9 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="msm090720">{{cite news |last1=Re |first1=Greg |title=Ex-spy Christopher Steele ordered to pay damages over 'inaccurate' dossier claims |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/ex-spy-christopher-steele-ordered-to-pay-damages-over-inaccurate-dossier-claims/ar-BB16v4e7 |accessdate=9 July 2020 |work=www.msn.com |publisher=MSM |date=9 July 2020}}</ref><ref name="we080720">{{cite news |last1=Dunleavy |first1=Jerry |title=British judge orders Christopher Steele to pay damages to Russian bankers named in dossier |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/british-judge-orders-christopher-steele-to-pay-damages-to-russian-bankers-named-in-dossier |accessdate=9 July 2020 |work=Washington Examiner |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=8 July 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

On 5 January 2018, [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[Chuck Grassley]], joined by senior Republican member [[Lindsey Graham]], issued a [[criminal referral]] regarding Steele to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] for it to investigate whether Steele had lied to the FBI about his interactions with the media.<ref name="DOJRef">{{cite news |first=Charles E. |last=Grassley |first2=Lindsey O. |last2=Graham |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205174818/https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-02%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf |archive-date=5 February 2018 |url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-02%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf |title=Referral of Christopher Steele for Potential Violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001 |publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]] |date=2 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/grassley-graham-refer-dossier-author-christopher-steele-for-criminal-investigation |publisher=[[Reuters]] |title=Grassley, Graham Refer Dossier Author Christopher Steele for Criminal Investigation |first=Aaron P. |last=Bernstein |quote=In a shocking move Friday afternoon, GOP Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham referred the so-called "Trump dossier" writer Christopher Steele for criminal investigation.

The referral was met with scepticism from legal experts, as well as members of both parties on the Judiciary Committee.<ref name=wapo/> Fusion GPS lawyer Joshua A. Levy said the referral was just another effort to discredit the investigation into Russian interference in the election and that, "after a year of investigations into Donald Trump's ties to Russia, the only person Republicans seek to accuse of wrongdoing is one who reported on these matters to law enforcement in the first place."<ref name=wapo/> Veteran prosecutor [[Peter Zeidenberg]] called the referral "nonsense" because "the FBI doesn't need any prompting from politicians to prosecute people who have lied to them."<ref name=wapo/> Another former federal prosecutor, Justin Dillon, said it was "too early to assume the letter was simply a political attack". The senior Democrat on the Committee, [[Dianne Feinstein]], said the referral was made without consultation of any Democrats on the committee and released a five-page rebuttal.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0/9/09710d10-8885-4c05-9dee-d587fe0b7c0d/4E7F2E9D9626E9A02A76AC28640D0A01.steele-criminal-referral-analysis.pdf |title=Analysis Refutes Criminal Referral of Christopher Steele |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |date=9 February 2018 |archive-date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209191017/https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0/9/09710d10-8885-4c05-9dee-d587fe0b7c0d/4E7F2E9D9626E9A02A76AC28640D0A01.steele-criminal-referral-analysis.pdf}}</ref> A Republican aide said Grassley and Graham were "carrying water for the White House"; that their actions did not reflect the views of the committee as a whole; and that other members were upset with Grassley over the matter.<ref name=wapo/>

In an opinion-editorial for ''Politico'', former CIA official John Sipher said the attacks on Steele, a private citizen who provided information to the FBI that alarmed him, will make future tipsters less likely to approach American law enforcement with information bearing on national security.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/05/christopher-steele-dossier-smearing-216940|title=The Smearing of Christopher Steele|work=[[Politico]]|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>

==== U.S. Inspector General findings ====

On 9 December 2019, [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|U.S. Inspector General]] [[Michael E.

Steele was a paid [[confidential human source]] for the FBI before preparing the Steele dossier, and the FBI found "Steele's information to be valuable and that it warranted compensation", with Steele receiving $95,000 from the FBI between 2014 and 2016 for information on previous matters unrelated to Trump.<ref name=sky-20191210>{{cite news |url=https://news.sky.com/story/trump-hater-ex-mi6-officer-who-helped-compile-russia-dossier-was-a-friend-of-ivanka-11882732 |title='Trump hater' ex-MI6 officer who compiled Russia dossier was a friend of Ivanka |last=Haynes |first=Deborah |work=Sky News |date=10 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref> From information in the report, ''ABC News'' determined that Steele and [[Ivanka Trump]] had had a business and personal relationship from 2007 for a number of years.<ref name=abc-20191209>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dossier-author-chris-steele-met-ivanka-trump-years/story?id=67597270 |title='Dossier' author Chris Steele met Ivanka Trump years before Russia scandal, source says |last=Macfarlane |first=Julia |publisher=ABC News |date=9 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=guardian-20191209>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/christopher-steele-ivanka-trump-personal-relationship |title=Steele had 'personal' relationship with Ivanka Trump, DoJ report reveals |last=Harding |first=Luke |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 December 2019 |access-date=11 December 2019}}</ref>

One of the report's findings related to conflicting accounts of sourced content in the dossier. When one of Steele's sources was later interviewed by the FBI about the allegations sourced to them, they gave accounts which conflicted with Steele's renderings in the dossier. They indicated that Steele "misstated or exaggerated" the source's statements.<ref name="OIG_12/9/2019">{{cite web | author=Office of the Inspector General U.S. Department of Justice | date=9 December 2019 | title=Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation | website= | url=https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf | accessdate=9 December 2019 | author-link=United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General }}</ref><ref name=reuterspecific />

The IG found it difficult to discern the causes for the discrepancies between some dossier allegations and explanations later provided to the FBI by the sources of those allegations. The IG attributed the discrepancies to three possible factors: miscommunication between Steele and the sources, "exaggerations or misrepresentations" by Steele, or misrepresentations by the sources when questioned by the FBI.<ref name="OIG_12/9/2019"/>

Another factor was described by the Supervisory Intel Analyst, who believed someone described as "one of the key sources" for the dossier "may have been attempting to minimise his/her role in the election reporting following its release to the public." That person had been the source for "the alleged meeting between Carter Page and Igor Divyekin" and the "allegations concerning Michael Cohen and events in Prague".<ref name="OIG_12/9/2019"/>

== Personal life ==

Steele's first wife, Laura, with whom he had three children, died in 2009 after a long illness. He remarried in 2012. He and his second wife Katherine had one child and are raising all four children together.<ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018"/> He lives in [[Farnham, Surrey]].<ref name="Mayer_3/12/2018">{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=Jane |title=Christopher Steele, the Man Behind the Trump Dossier |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=12 March 2018 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier |accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>
