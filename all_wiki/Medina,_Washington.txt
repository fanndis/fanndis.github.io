'''Medina''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Medina.ogg|m|ə|ˈ|d|aɪ|n|ə}}) is a mostly residential city in [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]], [[King County, Washington]], United States.<ref name="HL" /> The city is on a peninsula in [[Lake Washington]], on the opposite shore from [[Seattle]], bordered by [[Clyde Hill, Washington|Clyde Hill]] and [[Hunts Point, Washington|Hunts Point]] to the east and water on all other sides. The city's population was 2,969 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Billionaire [[Bill Gates's house|Bill Gates]], along with a number of Microsoft executives, or other associates of Gates, have homes in Medina.<ref name=Ginsberg2017/><ref name=Cornwall2004/>

==History==

The eastern shore of [[Lake Washington]] between [[Meydenbauer Bay]] and Evergreen Point was a sparsely-populated area that was cleared for its timber in the 1870s. Seattle businessman Thomas Dabney established a claim on the south side of modern-day Medina in 1886, becoming the area's first permanent white settler. Dabney built a [[ferry dock]] in 1890, naming it Dabney's Landing, while the surrounding area was turned into berry farms and fruit orchards. Other settlers arrived at Dabney's Landing, which was briefly named Flordeline by its founder until objections were raised by a group of women who proposed the Arabic name "[[Medina]]" in 1891. After a series of debates and sign-switching incidents, Medina won and was adopted as the name of the town.<ref name="Times-Hist02">{{cite news |last=Cornwall |first=Warren |date=December 6, 2002 |title=A history with mansions |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021206&slug=goldcoast06e |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=December 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930232452/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20021206&slug=goldcoast06e |archive-date=September 30, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="HL">{{cite web |last=Dougherty |first=Phil |date=May 20, 2015 |title=Medina — Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/1059 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=December 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216025358/http://www.historylink.org/File/1059 |archive-date=December 16, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="Times-McDonald">{{cite news |last=McDonald |first=Lucile |authorlink=Lucile Saunders McDonald |date=October 30, 1955 |title=Pioneer Times In the 'Points Country' |page=4 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>

The area's farmers, mostly of Japanese descent, were evicted during the [[Japanese American internment|1940s internment]] and their farms were turned over for redevelopment.<ref name="HL"/>

==Surveillance==

In 2009, Medina, with the "wide support of residents", installed cameras at intersections along roads entering the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/medina-enclave-of-wealth-land-of-squabbles/|title=Medina: enclave of wealth, land of squabbles|last=Bach|first=Ashley|date=2008-04-16|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016030220/https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/medina-enclave-of-wealth-land-of-squabbles/|archive-date=October 16, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The cameras are used to capture the [[license plate]] number of every car, and a security system automatically notifies local police if the captured number is recorded in a database.<ref name="cameras">[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009873854_medina16m.html Cameras keep track of all cars entering Medina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310133048/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2009873854_medina16m.html |date=March 10, 2010 }}, a September 16, 2009 article from ''[[The Seattle Times]]''</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-billionaires-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-live-photos-of-medina-washington-2017-12|title=Jeff Bezos has passed Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world — here's the secretive waterfront town where both billionaires live|last=Jacobs|first=Harrison|website=Business Insider|access-date=2018-12-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721133732/http://www.businessinsider.com/where-billionaires-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-live-photos-of-medina-washington-2017-12|archive-date=July 21, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Travelers are notified of the presence of the system with signs that read "You Are Entering a 24 Hour Video Surveillance Area"; according to Medina's police chief, all captured information is stored for 60 days even if nothing negative is found in the database, allowing police to [[data mining|mine data]] if a crime occurs later.<ref name="cameras"/>  One of the city's council members said the system was motivated by the belief that the need for [[crime prevention]] "outweighs concern over privacy".<ref name="cameras"/> The system was inspired by that used in adjacent [[Hunts Point, Washington|Hunts Point]], a town of about 500 residents which has not had a break-in for more than three years after installing their system.<ref name="cameras"/>

==Tree Code==
Designated as a Tree City USA by the [[Arbor Day Foundation]] since 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/treecities.cfm?chosenstate=Washington|title=Tree Cities|access-date=March 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120832/http://www.arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/treecities.cfm?chosenstate=Washington|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Medina has always been a leader in urban tree codes. Since 1972, the City of Medina has codified the value that trees bring to a community, and the Tree Code ordinances have consistently been modified throughout the years. Major revisions in 2000, 2003 and 2006 have improved the code such that it is one of the most extensive in the region. The current code (2006 edition) protects large trees and requires significant mitigation if they are removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://codepublishing.com/WA/medina/?medina20/Medina2052.html#20.52.010|title=Medina Municipal Code|access-date=March 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101816/http://codepublishing.com/WA/medina/?medina20%2FMedina2052.html#20.52.010|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2011, the City Council directed the Planning Commission to update the existing tree code. Dividing the task into two phases, the Planning Commission brought Phase I, which were largely administrative changes, to Council in 2014, where it was passed into law. Phase II changes have been underway since then, with much work and input from the community, an ad hoc tree committee, the Planning Commission and City Council. It is anticipated that the new code will be adopted in mid-2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medina-wa.gov/vertical/Sites/%7B82D584EB-93EE-48B4-B853-6CBC215E08A2%7D/uploads/MEDINA_TREE_CODE_UPDATE_Website_712014_v6.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217090454/http://www.medina-wa.gov/vertical/Sites/%7B82D584EB-93EE-48B4-B853-6CBC215E08A2%7D/uploads/MEDINA_TREE_CODE_UPDATE_Website_712014_v6.pdf |archivedate=December 17, 2014 }}</ref>
