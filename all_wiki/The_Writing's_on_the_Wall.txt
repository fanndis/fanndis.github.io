''The Writing's on the Wall'' received generally favorable reviews from music critics. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] gave the album four out of five stars, stating: <blockquote>"With their second album, ''Writing's on the Wall'', Destiny's Child still suffers from slightly uneven songwriting, but it's nevertheless an assured step forward for the girl group. Not only are they maturing as vocalists, they are fortunate to work with such skilled, talented producers as [[Kevin "She'kspere" Briggs]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[D'Wayne Wiggins]], Chad Elliot, [[Daryl Simmons]], and [[Missy Elliott]], who all give the quartet rich, varied music upon which to work their charm. So, even when the album fails to deliver memorable songs, it always sounds alluring, thanks to the perfect combination of vocalists and producers."<ref name="Erlewine" /></blockquote>Rob Brunner from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album the grade of B, stating: <blockquote>"Judging from ''The Writing's on the Wall'', the second album from Destiny’s Child, it's not Briggs' fault. With his help, the Houston quartet (Beyonce, LaTavia, LeToya, and the unimaginatively monikered Kelly) prove themselves to be more capable of confident, inventive R&B than many of their contemporaries. Though Briggs is joined by a slew of trendy producers (including Elliott and Rodney Jerkins), ''Wall'' still manages to avoid sounding like a mere rehash of other people's hits. With a snaky lead vocal that slithers around staccato harmony parts, the aptly titled album opener "So Good" coolly mixes restrained production and playful melody. "Bills, Bills, Bills", the first single, is a sort of companion piece to "[[No Scrubs (song)|No Scrubs]]", taking on guys who seem perfect but turn into jerks once they get comfortable in a relationship. And "If You Leave", a duet with male vocal trio Next, is an ambitious collaboration that delivers despite its potentially lethal abundance of voices. Wall gets bogged down by too much banal balladry ("Stay", "Sweet Sixteen"), proving Destiny's Child to be capable of sounding exactly like any other group of snooze-inducing slow-jammers. But more often they recognize the difference between extremes of pitch and extremes of passion, a distinction lost on many R&B balladeers ([[Blaque]] frequently fall for this trap, and they’d probably spend even more time screaming and yelling if they were a little better at it). Destiny's Child have learned a thing or two from [[the Supremes]], singers who knew how to use a well-placed pause or a quietly sung harmony to maximum effect. No, they haven't managed to reach that lofty level on Wall, but if you're casting ''Motown '99'', the album's worth a listen. Its best stuff is close enough to the spirit of the Supremes to at least win them a callback."<ref name="ew" /></blockquote>[[Robert Christgau]] gave the album the grade of B+, stating: <blockquote>"I like [[teenpop]] fine, but please, one song at a time. And since teenpop likes this glamorous femme quartet, individual songs are all a reasonable grownup would expect. Uh-uh. Lyrics are the usual problem–if there's a quotable quote here, I haven't noticed it. But that may just be because the multivalent harmonies, suavely irregular beats, and, not incidentally, deep-seated self-respect have been keeping me busy ever since I heard through the visuals."<ref name="Christgau" /> </blockquote>Rob Sheffield from ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', however, gave the album negative review, giving it the grade of two out of five stars, stating:<blockquote>"Destiny's Child blew up last summer with "No, No, No", which wiggled seductively while begging the question, Since there are four ladies in the group, shouldn't that be "No, No, No, No"? Or is one still making up her mind? The [[Houston]] R&B group's new hit, "Bills, Bills, Bills", takes the same three-out-of-four-divas approach to a classic pop sentiment: These gals don't want your love, just your money money money. But unlike [[TLC (group)|TLC]]'s "No Scrubs", "Bills" isn't sexy enough to get you up off your deadbeat ass. The track has too much fussy clutter, and the singers hang out the passenger side of TLC's ride, groveling for spare change like forty-niners who've been on the job since '29. ''The Writing's on the Wall'' has a similar case of the blahs. Despite OK moments like the "[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]] sequel "Sweet Sixteen", the Destiny children never find that one money tune that turns a no-no-no scrub into a yeah-yeah-yeah paying customer."<ref name="Sheffield" /> </blockquote>However, Nathan Brackett and Christian David Hoard from ''[[The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' gave a more positive review and the grade of four out of five stars in 2004, five years after ''The Writing's on the Wall'' was released.<ref name="Brackett, Hoard" />

==Commercial performance==
In the United States the album debuted at number six on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] on August 14, 1999, selling over 132,000 copies in its first week and slipped to number ten the following week with 100,000 copies. It remained in the top forty for most of 1999 and had sold over 1.6&nbsp;million copies by the end of the year according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|2× platinum]] in January 2000. Nine months after its release ''The Writing's on the Wall'', following the huge success of third single "Say My Name", returned to the top ten, peaking at number five on May 6, 2000. During its first year on the chart it spent forty-seven out of fifty-two weeks in the top forty (including eleven weeks in the top ten) or better and was the tenth best-selling album of 2000, selling 3.8&nbsp;million copies during the year. ''The Writing's on the Wall'' enjoyed its best week of sales more than one year after its release when it sold over 163,000 units during the Christmas week of 2000, and by the release of the group's third album ''Survivor'' it had scanned 5.8&nbsp;million in the United States and shipped over seven million copies. ''The Writing's on the Wall'' spent ninety-nine consecutive weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200 (from the summer of 1999 until the spring of 2001) and was certified 8× platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on November 8, 2001. It has sold 6,347,000 copies to date in the United States, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]],<ref name="chartwatch">{{cite news |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-oct-27-2013-albums-katy-perry-151049350.html |title=Katy Perry Knocks Miley Cyrus Down a Couple Pegs | author= Paul Grein |date=October 30, 2013 |work=Chart Watch |publisher=Yahoo }}</ref> and over 700,000 at [[BMG Music Club]].

In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Five months after joining, Franklin left the group.

Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against their manager. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to issues with the record company.

There was also controversy surrounding the rights to use the "Columbia" name and trademark for the album's release in international markets. There were different rules for owning the rights to the "Columbia" brand name, depending on the market. For the album's release in Japan, where [[Columbia Records]]’ parent company [[Sony]] does not use the "Columbia" name or trademark, for example, the label was re-branded as '''SME Records''' (SME is an abbreviation for '''S'''ony '''M'''usic '''E'''ntertainment), which is a [[Record label#sublabel|sublabel]] of [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan]], itself a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Sony Corporation]] and operates independently from the [[Sony Music|American Sony Music Entertainment]], of which [[Columbia Records]] is a part of.<ref name="discogs.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Destinys-Child-The-Writings-On-The-Wall/release/4640176|title=Destiny's Child – The Writings On The Wall (CD, Album) at Discogs|accessdate = March 14, 2018}}</ref> The "Columbia" name and trademark are actually controlled in Japan by [[Nippon Columbia]], which is a direct competitor and neither has direct relations with the American Columbia Records, nor with Sony Music Japan. It should, however, be noted that [[Nippon Columbia]] was, in fact, the former licensee for the American Columbia Records up until 1968, when Sony Music Japan's predecessor, [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|CBS/Sony Inc.]], was established.
