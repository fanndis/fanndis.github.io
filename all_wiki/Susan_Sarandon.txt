Her most controversial film appearance was in [[Tony Scott]]'s ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983), a modern [[vampire]] story in which she had a lesbian sex scene with [[Catherine Deneuve]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/08/business/for-lesbian-magazine-a-question-of-image.html|title=For Lesbian Magazine, a Question of Image | work=The New York Times | first=David W.|last=Dunlap|date=January 8, 1996}}</ref> She appeared in the comedy-fantasy ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'' (1987) alongside [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Cher]], and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]].

[[Janet Maslin]], in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote of her performance in the last film: "Ms. Sarandon takes the kind of risk she took playing a stubbornly obsessed mother in ''Lorenzo's Oil.'' She's commandingly blunt, and she avoids cheapening her performance with the wrong kind of compassion. Her Sister Helen is repelled and alarmed by this man, but she's determined to help him anyway.
