In the mid-19th century, the Methodist Protestant Church, which is now part of the United Methodist Church, became active in educational pursuits in North Carolina.  In 1921, after some years of consideration, the statewide governing body of the Methodist Protestant Church voted to establish a college.<ref>Sizemore, F. J., ed. ''The Buildings and the Builders of a City: High Point, North Carolina''. High Point: Hall Printing Company, 1947. p. 318-319</ref> Shortly afterwards the church accepted an offer from the citizens of High Point to contribute {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of land and $100,000 to the project, placing the new school in the city of High Point.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. ''The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D.'' Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 233</ref> The campus was designed by R. E. Mitchell of Washington, D.C., assisted by Herbert Hunter of High Point, in the English Renaissance style. The school was founded in 1924 as High Point College, a joint venture between the [[Methodist Protestant Church]] and the citizens of High Point, and officially opened its doors on September 14, 1924. When the college opened, the campus consisted of three buildings, attended by nine faculty members, with a student enrollment of 122.

The steadfast growth that characterized the birth of the college ended abruptly with the Great Depression. This period was difficult for the college in 1932–33, as faculty salaries were cut and expenses were sometimes bartered. Despite a $50,000 fund raising campaign, the college declared bankruptcy on June 15, 1934 and reorganization in an effort to reduce its indebtedness.<ref>Robinson, Blackwell P., and Alexander R. Stoesen. "The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. To 1980, A.D." Greensboro: The Guilford County Bicentennial Commission, 1980. p. 235</ref> Subsequent reorganization enabled the college to move forward with business and renewed expansion. '''

On October 9, 1991, under the guidance of President Dr. [[Jacob C. Martinson, Jr.]] and the Board of Trustees, High Point College changed its name to High Point University to reflect post-graduate degree programs.  Coinciding with the offering of graduate studies, every building on the campus was renovated and new ones were constructed with a campus quadrangle added to replace a former city street that bisected the campus,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040928204703/http://www.high-point.net/edc/2002annrpt.pdf%7C High Point Economic Development Corporation Website</ref> and by 2004 the university's endowment increased to $40 million. When [[Jacob C. Martinson, Jr.]] stepped down as president in 2005, he was the longest serving [[United Methodist]] college president in the country.

In 2005, the university was only 92 acres and landlocked with a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,450. The university's operating budget was only $35 million with approximately 100 faculty members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoldsflip.com/i/332339/5 |title=Rhino Times - June 19, 2014 |access-date=August 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129151921/http://www.ifoldsflip.com/i/332339/5 |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Since Dr. [[Nido R.
