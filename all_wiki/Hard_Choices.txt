'''''Hard Choices''''' is a [[memoir]] of former [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary Rodham Clinton]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 2014, giving her account of [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|her tenure in that position]] from 2009 to 2013. It also discusses some personal aspects of her life and career, including her feelings towards President [[Barack Obama]] following [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her 2008 presidential campaign loss to him]]. It is generally supportive of decisions made by the [[Obama administration]].

The book was promoted partly in light of the possibility of a Clinton bid in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] (in which, two years after the release of the book, she would go on to win the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic nomination]] and then lose to [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|general election]]).  Excerpts from the book were released in advance of its publication. Clinton staged an extensive promotional tour for the book, which had the air of a political campaign with groups both for and against her appearing at book-signing events.  ''Hard Choices'' reached #1 on the [[New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]], but sold considerably less than her 2003 memoir, ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]''.  Interpreting what sales of the book meant for her possible political future became a subject for discussion among interested parties.

==Conception and development==
Clinton's last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013.  As she departed from office, she indicated she was unsure of her future plans but that they did include writing another memoir to follow ''[[Living History (book)|Living History]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.today.com/books/hillary-clinton-write-second-memoir-1C8160265 | title=Hillary Clinton to write second memoir | first=Eun Kyung | last=Kim | work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]] | publisher=NBC News | date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>

On April 4, 2013, [[Simon & Schuster]], her previous publisher, announced that Clinton had signed with them for this new work, with a target publication date of June 2014.<ref name="msn-deal">{{cite news | url=http://news.msn.com/us/hillary-clinton-signs-book-deal | title=Hillary Clinton signs book deal | publisher=[[MSN News]] | date=April 4, 2013 | access-date=June 9, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308144520/http://news.msn.com/us/hillary-clinton-signs-book-deal | archive-date=March 8, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Lawyer [[Robert Barnett (lawyer)|Robert Barnett]] handled the negotiations from Clinton's side; the financial terms of any advance or royalties were not publicly disclosed.<ref name="msn-deal"/> The ''[[New York Post]]'' reported "industry speculation" as saying that her advance could be as high as $14 million.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://nypost.com/2013/04/05/14m-set-for-hills-new-book/ | title=$14M set for Hill's new book | first=Geoff | last=Earle | newspaper=[[New York Post]] | date=April 5, 2013 }}</ref> Although not confirmed, that figure has been repeated by some other news sources.<ref name="pol-sales"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.kmbz.com/First-Figures-Out-on-Hillary-s-Second-Book/19242641 | title=First Figures Out on Hillary's Second Book | agency=[[ABC News Radio]] | publisher=[[KMBZ (AM)|KMBZ]] | date=June 18, 2014 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://archive.is/20140621120951/http://www.kmbz.com/First-Figures-Out-on-Hillary-s-Second-Book/19242641 | archive-date=June 21, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/06/15/not_if_hillary_runs_for_president_but_when_--_and_how_122985.html | title=Not 'If' Hillary Runs for President, But When – and How | first=Carl M. | last=Cannon | publisher=[[RealClearPolitics]] | date=June 15, 2014}}</ref>  From the beginning, the book was partly seen in the light of a possible Clinton bid for the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref name="msn-deal"/>

Clinton was assisted in writing the book by three aides credited in the Acknowledgements section as her "book team",<ref>{{citation|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

During April 2014, the official publication date of the book was announced as June 10, 2014,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/clinton-memoir-due-out-june-10-n75886 | title=Clinton Memoir Due Out June 10 | publisher=[[NBC News]] | date=April 9, 2014}}</ref> and the title of the book was revealed as ''Hard Choices'' about a week later.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/04/18/publisher-reveals-title-for-hillary-clintons-memoir/ | title=Publisher reveals title for Hillary Clinton's memoir | first=Philip | last=Rucker | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=April 18, 2014}}</ref>

==Themes of the book==
The book contained 635&nbsp;pages of numbered text, accompanied by three sections of plates containing a total of 100&nbsp;colored photographs.

In the book, Clinton frames the foreign policy situations encountered during her tenure as a series of hard choices, especially those involving the Middle East and the [[Arab Spring]], Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Russia.<ref name="wapo-themes">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ahead-of-2016-hillary-clinton-aims-to-lay-bare-her-hard-choices/2014/06/07/32eccaca-ee81-11e3-b84b-3393a45b80f1_story.html | title=Clinton's book sets foundation for 2016 run |first=Dan | last=Balz | author-link=Dan Balz | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=June 7, 2014}}</ref>  Special attention is given to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] and her relations with Egyptian President and longtime personal friend [[Hosni Mubarak]].<ref name="guard-themes"/>

Clinton sometimes delves into disagreements within the [[Obama administration]] and where she stood, such as her losing the argument to arm moderate elements of the [[Syrian opposition]].<ref name="nyt-themes">{{cite news | title=Mrs. Clinton Emphasizes Her Softer Side in Memoir | first=Amy | last=Chozick | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 7, 2014 | page=A12}}</ref><ref name="slate-rev"/> In many other cases, however, she does not, saying such discussions "will remain private to honor the code of confidentiality that should exist between a president and his Secretary of State, especially while he is still in office."<ref name="wapo-themes"/>

A chapter of the book dealing with the [[2012 Benghazi attack]] – in which the U.S. [[diplomatic mission]] in [[Benghazi, Libya]], was attacked, resulting in the deaths of the [[United States Ambassador to Libya|U.S. ambassador to that country]], [[J. Christopher Stevens]], and three other Americans – was leaked to ''[[Politico]]''.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/>  It reiterates the explanations for what happened that Clinton and her supporters had previously made.<ref name="slate-rev"/>

Clinton also delves into some personal aspects of her life and career, including getting past any hard feelings towards Obama from [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her 2008 presidential campaign]], events in her family including her daughter [[Chelsea Clinton]]'s wedding, and glimpses of personal interaction with citizens of other countries during her travels as secretary.<ref name="nyt-themes"/>  The book also addresses the disappointment of her 2008 loss, and for the first time fully recants her 2002 vote on the [[Iraq War Resolution]] that cost her in that campaign, writing that "I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple."<ref name="guard-themes"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-wrong-article-1.1819012 | title=In new memoir, Hillary Clinton makes stark admission on Iraq War vote: 'I still got it wrong. Plain and simple.' | first= Joel | last=Siegel | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=June 5, 2014}}</ref>

The book concludes with some general thoughts about her visions for America going forward,<ref name="guard-themes"/>  but it shed no light on whether she would run for president in 2016, saying only, "[t]he time for another hard choice will come soon."<ref name="nyt-themes"/>

==Promotional efforts==
Excerpts of the books came out early.  The first was in early May 2014, when ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' published an excerpt in celebration of [[Mother's Day]] that was about and dedicated to Clinton's mother [[Dorothy Rodham]], who had died during Clinton's time as secretary.<ref name="cnn-rollout">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/06/politics/clinton-book-campaign/index.html?c=politics | title='Hard Choices': A book rollout or a campaign tune up? | first=Dan | last=Merica | publisher=CNN | date=June 6, 2014}}</ref>  Simon & Schuster released an Author's Note explaining some of Clinton's perspectives on the book.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/>  A video appeared on the book's [[Facebook]] page the following day.<ref name="bg-passions">{{cite news | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2014/05/29/political-passions-stir-hillary-rodham-clinton-prepares-book-release/qCBCQ07TbfJfZ6Qq6Sl6SJ/story.html | title=Political passions stir as Hillary Clinton prepares book release | first=Matt | last=Visor | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=May 30, 2014}}</ref>  A cover appearance on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine was also made to promote the book.<ref name="nyt-rev"/>

Later, the chapter of the book dealing with the Benghazi attack was leaked to ''[[Politico]]''.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/>  Observers suspected this was done to get news about it out of the way early so it would not dominate later coverage of the book as a whole.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/><ref name="nyt-rev"/> Shortly before the book's publication date, a passage that dealt with the now-repatriated soldier [[Bowe Bergdahl]] was made public as well.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/>  The promotional book roll-out was staffed by veterans of political campaigns and political communications efforts, rather than the publicists who usually conduct such efforts.<ref name="cnn-rollout"/>

There was competition among top news anchors and interviewers to get the first interviews with Clinton about the book.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hillary-clintons-new-book-hard-choices-sets-up-battle-of-network-stars-for-interviews/2014/04/23/80185602-cb13-11e3-93eb-6c0037dde2ad_story.html | title=Hillary Clinton's new book, 'Hard Choices,' sets up battle of network stars for interviews | first=Paul | last=Farhi | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=April 23, 2014}}</ref>  In the end, Clinton sat down with several of them;<ref name="bg-passions"/> the first went to [[ABC News]]' [[Diane Sawyer]] and aired on June 9.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/06/10/hillary-clintons-interview-with-diane-sawyer-annotated-video/ | title=Hillary Clinton's interview with Diane Sawyer, annotated [Video] | first=Julie | last=Percha | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>  The interviews themselves sometimes made news on topics unrelated to those covered by the book, such as Clinton's description to Sawyer of her and Bill's financial state as they left the White House ("dead broke") and an exchange with [[NPR]]'s [[Terry Gross]] on Clinton's evolving views on [[same-sex marriage]].<ref name="cnn-liberated"/><ref name="pol-tour-less"/>  A later, unannounced appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' earned her some positive notices for a comic touch in her mock exchanges with host [[Stephen Colbert]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/hillary-clinton-colbert-report-video-surprise.html | title=Hillary Clinton Was Surprisingly Funny in Her Unannounced ''Colbert Report'' Appearance | first=Margaret | last=Hartmann | magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=August 6, 2014}}</ref>

A promotional book tour in the United States and Canada began on June 10 with a book signing at a [[Barnes & Noble]] store in New York that attracted over a thousand people.<ref name="nyt-hours">{{cite news | title=Fans Wait Hours to See Clinton at Book Signing | first=Amy | last=Chozick | newspaper=The New York Times | date=January 11, 2014 | page=A15}}</ref>  Other events, sometimes multiple per day,<ref name="cnn-liberated"/> included a public discussion forum in Chicago with Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]], a former Clinton administration aide.<ref name="nyt-homecoming">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/us/politics/a-chicago-homecoming-for-clinton-on-her-book-tour.html?_r=0 | title=A Chicago Homecoming for Hillary Clinton on Her Book Tour | first=Amy | last=Chozick | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>  When signing books, she just wrote "Hillary";<ref>{{cite news | url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/06/13/hillary-clinton-in-philadelphia-for-book-signing-at-free-library/ | title=Hillary Clinton In Philadelphia For Book-Signing At Free Library | first=Mike | last=DeNardo | publisher=[[KYW (AM)|KYW]] | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> no signing of personal items or extra messages were allowed.<ref name="wapo-underway">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/06/10/the-clinton-campaign-gets-underway-at-a-union-square-bookstore/ | title=The Clinton campaign gets underway at a Union Square bookstore | first=Philip | last=Bump | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>  Clinton's longtime aide [[Huma Abedin]] was in charge of managing each event.<ref name="pol-tour-less">{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hillary-clinton-book-tour-108571.html | title=What we've learned from Hillary Clinton's book tour | first=Maggie | last=Haberman | newspaper=Politico | date=July 4, 2014}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the [[Republican National Committee]] had an intern go around greeting attendees in a large orange squirrel suit.<ref name="cnn-liberated"/>  It wore a shirt with the message "Another Clinton in the White House is Nuts" and was accompanied by other staffers handing out sheets with anti-Clinton talking points.<ref name="mj-squirrel">{{cite news | url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/06/hillary-clinton-rnc-hrc-squirrel | title=The RNC's Newest Anti-Hillary Weapon Is a Giant Orange Squirrel | first=Patrick | last=Caldwell | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref>  During one promotional appearance in Washington, D.C., Clinton went up to the orange figure and said, "Hello, Mr. Squirrel, how are you?

The copy she gave the squirrel was inscribed, "Squirrel – Please make a hard choice and read my book!

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', longtime book critic [[Michiko Kakutani]] said that the volume is better than Clinton's previous memoir and that ''Hard Choices'' "turns out to be a subtle, finely calibrated work that provides a portrait of the former secretary of state and former first lady as a heavy-duty policy wonk."<ref name="nyt-rev">{{cite news | title=Clinton's Self-Portrait Of a Tested Policy Wonk | first=Michiko | last=Kakutani | author-link=Michiko Kakutani | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 8, 2014 | page=A25}}</ref>  [[David Ignatius]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said the memoir "begins and ends in the empty voice of a campaign speech.

Simon & Schuster viewed international and foreign language sales as key to the book's potential for success.<ref name="nyt-sales2"/>  On its initial release date of June 10, it was published in Canada, Great Britain, Australia, India, Germany, the Netherlands, and France.<ref name="nyt-sales2"/>  A Spanish language translation, ''Decisiones difíciles'', was released on June 24 in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book | title=Decisiones difíciles (Spanish Edition) |isbn = 978-1476759142|last1 = Clinton|first1 = Hillary Rodham|date = 2014-06-24}}</ref>  Altogether, foreign rights to the book were sold in sixteen countries.<ref name=Buzz/>
