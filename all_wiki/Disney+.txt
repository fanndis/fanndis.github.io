'''Disney+''' (pronounced '''Disney Plus''') is an American [[Video on demand#Subscription models|subscription video on-demand]] [[Over-the-top media service|over-the-top]] [[Streaming media|streaming]] service owned and operated by the [[The Walt Disney Company#Media and Entertainment Distribution|Media and Entertainment Distribution]] division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service also advertising content from the company's Disney, [[Pixar]], [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', and [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]] brands in particular. [[List of Disney+ original films|Original films]] and [[List of Disney+ original programming|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms – the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] – Disney+ focuses on Disney's core brands such as Marvel or Star Wars and family friendly entertainment.

Disney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], which was originally established as BAMTech in 2015 when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructuring in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of [[List of Disney+ original films|films]] and [[List of Disney+ original programming|television shows for exclusive release]] on the platform began in late 2017.

Disney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, and expanded to Australia, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico a week later. It became available in select European countries in March 2020 and in India that April through Disney's [[Hotstar]] streaming service, which was rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar. Additional European countries received the service in September 2020, with it expanding to Latin America in November 2020. Upon launch, it was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to films and television shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation. The service had 73.7 million subscribers {{as of|2020|9|30|lc=y|df=US}}.

In late May 2020, the service added the ability to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios for early ''Simpsons'' episodes,<ref name="AspectRatioFeature" /> after the service received backlash for stretching those episodes to 16:9 by default at launch.<ref name="SimpsonsAspectRatio" /> Disney had done this "in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons." To accommodate the feature, [[Disney Streaming Services]] "had to reconfigure its content-delivery engine" while ensuring the new feature would not break any existing features such as continue watching, watchlists, and auto-playing, as they did not want to treat the 4:3 versions as bonus content. The resulting changes allowed Disney to apply the existing audio, subtitle information, episode artwork, and other metadata from the episodes to both aspect ratios regardless of which is chosen by the user. Joe Rice, vice president of media product at Disney Streaming Services, added that these adjustments "opens up a number of exciting opportunities for novel ways of presenting content in the future."<ref name="AspectRatioFeature">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/simpsons-4-by-3-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-1234618818/|title=To Deliver 'The Simpsons' in 4:3 Aspect Ratio, Disney Plus Had to Rearchitect Its Content-Delivery System|last=Spangler|first=Todd|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 28, 2020|accessdate=May 28, 2020|archive-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529014928/https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/simpsons-4-by-3-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-1234618818/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2020, the service added the GroupWatch feature which allows up to seven different Disney+ accounts to link up and co-view programming with one another. Viewers are able to react to content with six different emojis, and control playback for the entire group. It is available on web browser, mobile app, smart TVs, and connected TV devices in the United States, and will expand to Europe later in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix |title=Disney Plus is rolling out GroupWatch feature to all US subscribers |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=September 29, 2020 |website=[[The Verge]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929175828/https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21492148/disney-plus-groupwatch-friends-family-us-subscribers-scener-netflix |archive-date=September 29, 2020 |access-date=September 29, 2020}}</ref> The feature was previously tested in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/9/29/21492307/disney-plus-group-watch-remote-viewing|title=Disney Plus gets a remote group watch feature|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=September 29, 2020|accessdate=September 29, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929184747/https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/9/29/21492307/disney-plus-group-watch-remote-viewing|archivedate=September 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On November 13, 2019, a day after its launch, Disney announced that the streaming service had already signed up more than 10 million subscribers.<ref name="10MSubs">{{Cite magazine |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=November 13, 2019 |title=Disney Says Disney Plus Has Over 10 Million Sign-Ups Already |url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-says-disney-plus-has-over-10-million-signups-1203403515/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113172427/https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-says-disney-plus-has-over-10-million-signups-1203403515/ |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Joan E.

Frank Pallotta of [[CNN]] stated that "the company [Disney] has repackaged its trove of beloved content for the service makes it a worthy companion to the other services in the marketplace.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frank Pallotta |date=12 November 2019 |title=Disney+ review: It's a lot like Netflix, but with a few twists |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/media/disney-plus-review/index.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112160125/https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/media/disney-plus-review/index.html |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |access-date=November 12, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Nick Pino of ''[[TechRadar]]'' stated, "If Disney keeps it updated with new content, Disney+ could rival Netflix sooner rather than later."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nick Pino |date=November 12, 2019 |title=Disney Plus review |url=https://www.techradar.com/reviews/disney-plus-review |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113024303/https://www.techradar.com/reviews/disney-plus-review |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |access-date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[TechRadar]]}}</ref>

Upon launch, Disney+ experienced significant technical difficulties. Users complained about receiving error messages that the service was down and that they were "unable to connect", which were irritating because many of them had paid for the service months in advance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Callie Ahlgrim |date=November 12, 2019 |title=Disney Plus is already crashing on its launch day, and fans are annoyed after they paid months in advance |url=https://www.insider.com/disney-plus-crashing-technical-issues-fan-reactions-2019-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200908005352/https://www.insider.com/disney-plus-crashing-technical-issues-fan-reactions-2019-11 |archive-date=September 8, 2020 |access-date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]]}}</ref> In some instances, passwords needed to be reset to enable access.

One other negative aspect with the launch of the service was the presentation of the non-HD episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Namely, that instead of presenting them in their original aspect ratio, they were either cropped to fit [[16:9]] widescreen televisions or awkwardly stretched out to that aspect ratio.<ref name="SimpsonsAspectRatio">{{Cite web |last=Gennis |first=Sadie |date=November 12, 2019 |title=''The Simpsons'' Fans Are Rightfully Annoyed at Disney Plus Cropping Old Episodes |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-simpsons-disney-plus-widescreen-cropping/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112215200/https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-simpsons-disney-plus-widescreen-cropping/ |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |access-date=November 13, 2019 |website=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref> [[FXX]]'s now-defunct "Simpsons World" streaming service was similarly criticized when it launched.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=November 12, 2019 |title=The Simpsons' aspect ratio is messed up on Disney+ |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113213438/https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961067/simpsons-aspect-ratio-disney-plus-43-169-streaming-fxx |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |access-date=November 14, 2019 |website=The Verge}}</ref> In response, Disney stated they would make the ability to watch the episodes of the first 19 seasons and some from season 20 in either the 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio in early 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=November 16, 2019 |title=Disney Plus Will Make 'The Simpsons' Available in Original Uncropped Format in Early 2020 |url=https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/simpsons-disney-plus-original-aspect-ratio-uncropped-1203407099/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191116152910/https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/simpsons-disney-plus-original-aspect-ratio-uncropped-1203407099/ |archive-date=November 16, 2019 |access-date=November 16, 2019 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> The feature was made available on May 28, 2020.<ref name="AspectRatioFeature" />
