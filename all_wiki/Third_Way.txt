The '''Third Way''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[political position]] akin to [[centrism]] that attempts to reconcile [[right-wing]] and [[left-wing]] politics by advocating a varying synthesis of [[centre-right]] and [[centrist]] economic platforms with some [[centre-left]] social policies.<ref>Bobbio, Norberto; Cameron, Allan (1997).''Left and Right: The Significance of A Political Distinction''.

Third Way social-democratic proponent [[Tony Blair]] claimed that the [[socialism]] he advocated was different from traditional conceptions of socialism and said: "My kind of socialism is a set of values based around notions of [[social justice]]. [...] Socialism as a rigid form of [[economic determinism]] has ended, and rightly".<ref>Hastings, Adrian; Mason, Alistair; Pyper, Hugh (2000). ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought''. Oxford University Press. p. 677.</ref> Blair referred to it as a "social-ism" involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent and advocated social justice, social cohesion, equal worth of each citizen and equal opportunity.<ref>Freeden, Micharl (2004).

Princeton University Press. p. 198.</ref> Third Way social-democratic theorist [[Anthony Giddens]] has said that the Third Way rejects the [[state socialist]] conception of socialism and instead accepts the conception of socialism as conceived of by [[Anthony Crosland]] as an ethical doctrine that views social-democratic governments as having achieved a viable [[ethical socialism]] by removing the unjust elements of capitalism by providing social welfare and other policies and that contemporary socialism has outgrown the [[Marxist]] claim for the need of the abolition of [[capitalism as a mode of production]].<ref>Giddens, Anthony (1998).

The Third Way supports the pursuit of greater [[egalitarianism]] in society through action to increase the distribution of skills, capacities and productive endowments while rejecting [[income redistribution]] as the means to achieve this.<ref>Lewis, Jane; Surender, Rebecca (2004). ''Welfare State Change: Towards a Third Way?'' Oxford University Press. p. 4.</ref> It emphasises commitment to [[balanced budget]]s, providing [[equal opportunity]] which is combined with an emphasis on [[Moral responsibility|personal responsibility]], the [[decentralisation]] of government power to the lowest level possible, encouragement and promotion of [[public–private partnership]]s, improving [[labour supply]], investment in [[Human development (humanity)|human development]], preserving of [[social capital]] and protection of the environment.<ref>Rosenau, Pauline Vaillancourt (2003).

== Overview ==
=== Origins ===
As a term, the ''third way'' has been used to explain a variety of political courses and ideologies in the last few centuries.<ref>Romano, Flavio (2006). ''Clinton and Blair: The Political Economy of the Third Way''. Routledge Frontiers of Political Economy. '''75'''. London: Routledge. p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-415-37858-1}}.</ref> These ideas were implemented by [[progressives]] in the early 20th century. The term was picked up again in the 1950s by German [[ordoliberal]] economists such as [[Wilhelm Röpke]], resulting in the development of the concept of the [[social market economy]]. Röpke later distanced himself from the term and located the social market economy as first way in the sense of an advancement of the [[free-market economy]].<ref>Röpke, Wilhelm (1951). ''Die Lehre von der Wirtschaft, Erlenbach-Zürich'' (in German). pp. 56–59.</ref>

During the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, reform economist [[Ota Šik]] proposed third way economic reform as part of political [[liberalisation]] and [[democratisation]] within the country. In historical context, such proposals were better described as liberalised [[centrally-planned economy]] rather than the socially-sensitive capitalism that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Enrico Berlinguer]], leader of the [[Italian Communist Party]], came to advocate a vision of a socialist society that was more pluralist than the [[real socialism]] which was typically advocated by [[official communist]] parties whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy. This was part of the wider trend of [[Eurocommunism]] in the communist movement and provided a theoretical basis for Berlinguer's pursuit of the [[Historic Compromise]] with the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Sassoon|first=Donald|date=July 1984|title=Berlinguer: architect of Eurocommunism|url=http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/84_07_14.pdf|magazine=Marxism Today|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>

Most significantly, [[Harold Macmillan]], British Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, based his philosophy of government on what he summarised in the 1938 book ''[[The Middle Way (book)|The Middle Way]]''.<ref>Macmillan, Harold (1938). ''[[The Middle Way (book)|The Middle Way: A Study of the Problem of Economic and Social Progress in a Free and Democratic Society]]''. London: Random House.</ref>

=== Modern usage ===
Third Way politics is visible in [[Anthony Giddens]]' works such as ''Consequences of Modernity'' (1990), ''Modernity and Self-Identity'' (1991), ''The Transformation of Intimacy'' (1992), ''Beyond Left and Right'' (1994) and ''The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy'' (1998). In ''Beyond Left and Right'', Giddens criticises [[market socialism]] and constructs a six-point framework for a reconstituted [[Radicalization|radical politics]] that includes the following values:<ref>{{citation|last1=Bryant|first1=Christopher G.

# Repair damaged [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarities]].
# Recognise the centrality of life politics.
# Accept that active trust implies generative politics.
# Embrace dialogic democracy.
# Rethink the [[welfare state]].
# Confront violence.

In ''The Third Way'', Giddens provides the framework within which the Third Way, also termed by Giddens as the ''[[Radical center (politics)|radical centre]]'', is justified. In addition, it supplies a broad range of policy proposals aimed at what Giddens calls the "[[Progressivism|progressive]] [[centre-left]]" in British politics.<ref>Giddens, Anthony (1998). ''The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy''. Polity Press, pp. 44–46. {{ISBN|9780745622668}}</ref>

During his [[Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign|1992 presidential campaign]], [[Bill Clinton]] espoused the ideas of the Third Way.<ref>Kelly, Michael (26 September 1992). [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/26/us/1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-says-he-s-not-leaning-left-but-taking-new-third.html "The 1992 Campaign: The Democrats; Clinton Says He's Not Leaning Left but Taking a New 'Third Way'"]. ''The New York Times''. p. 7. Retrieved 10 July 2020.</ref>

In a 1999 [[BBC]] report, the Third Way has been defined as such: <blockquote>[S]omething different and distinct from liberal capitalism with its unswerving belief in the merits of the free market and democratic socialism with its demand management and obsession with the state. The Third Way is in favour of growth, entrepreneurship, enterprise and wealth creation but it is also in favour of greater social justice and it sees the state playing a major role in bringing this about. So in the words of [...] Anthony Giddens of the LSE the Third Way rejects top down socialism as it rejects traditional neo liberalism.<ref name="BBC"/></blockquote>

=== Within social democracy ===
A social democratic variant of the Third Way which approaches the centre from a social democratic perspective has been advocated by its proponents as an alternative to both capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism, including [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxian]] and [[state socialism]], that Third Way social democrats reject.<ref name="N.D. Arora. 2010">Arora, N. D. (2010). ''Political Science for Civil Services Main Examination''. Tata McGraw-Hill Education. pp. 9, 22.</ref> It advocates [[ethical socialism]], [[reformism]] and [[gradualism]] that includes advocating the humanisation of [[capitalism]], a [[mixed economy]], [[Pluralism (political theory)|political pluralism]] and [[liberal democracy]].<ref name="N.D. Arora. 2010"/>

The Third Way has been advocated by proponents as competition socialism, an ideology in between traditional socialism and capitalism.<ref>Döring, Daniel (2007). ''Is 'Third Way' Social Democracy Still a Form of Social Democracy?''. Norderstedt, Germany: GRIN Verlag. p. 3.</ref> [[Anthony Giddens]], a prominent proponent of the Third Way, has publicly supported a modernised form of socialism within the social democracy movement, but he claims that traditional socialist ideology (referring to state socialism) that involves economic management and planning are flawed and states that as a theory of the managed economy it barely exists any longer.<ref name="Romano"/>

In defining the Third Way, [[Tony Blair]] once wrote: "The Third Way stands for a modernised social democracy, passionate in its commitment to social justice".<ref>Lowe, Rodney (1993). ''The Welfare State in Britain Since 1945''. Palgrave. {{ISBN|978-1403911933}}.</ref>

=== Australia ===
[[File:Bob Hawke 1987 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bob Hawke]], who along with [[Paul Keating]] laid the groundwork to both [[New Democrats]] and [[New Labour]] as well as Third Way politics]]
Under the nominally [[centre-left]] [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) from 1983 to 1996, the [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]] governments pursued many economic policies associated with [[economic rationalism]] such as [[Floating currency|floating]] the [[Australian Dollar]] in 1983, reductions in trade [[tariff]]s, [[Tax reform|taxation reforms]], changing from centralised [[Price controls|wage-fixing]] to [[Enterprise Bargaining Agreement|enterprise bargaining]], heavy restrictions on [[trade union]] activities including on [[strike action]] and [[pattern bargaining]], the [[privatisation]] of government-run services and enterprises such as [[Qantas]] and the [[Commonwealth Bank]] and wholesale [[deregulation]] of the [[banking system]]. Keating also proposed a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) in 1985, but this was scrapped due to its unpopularity amongst both ALP and electorate. The party also desisted from other reforms such as wholesale [[labour market]] deregulation (e.g. [[WorkChoices]]), the eventual GST, the privatisation of [[Telstra]] and [[welfare reform]], including [[Work for the Dole]] which [[John Howard]] and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] were to initiate after winning office in 1996. These governments have been considered by some as laying the groundwork for the later development of both the [[New Democrats]] in the United States and [[New Labour]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Lavelle 2005">{{cite journal|title=Social Democrats and Neo-Liberalism: A Case Study of the Australian Labor Party|last=Lavelle|first=Ashley|journal=Political Studies|date=1 December 2005|volume=53|issue=4|pages=753–771|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00555.x|s2cid=144842245}}</ref><ref name="Humphrys 2018">{{cite book|last=Humphrys|first=Elizabeth|title=How Labour Built Neoliberalism: Australia's Accord, the Labour Movement and the Neoliberal Project|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|date=8 October 2018|isbn=978-90-04-38346-3}}</ref> Some political commentators agree that it led [[centre-left]] parties towards the path to [[neoliberalism]].<ref>Badham, Van (6 April 2017).

Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under [[Gough Whitlam]], resulting in what is now known as the [[Labor Left]], who tend to favour a more [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]] economic policy, more authoritative top-down controls and some [[Social progress|socially progressive]] ideals; and [[Labor Right]], the now dominant faction that is [[pro-business]], more [[economically liberal]] and focuses to a lesser extent on [[social issues]]. The [[Whitlam government]] was first to use the term economic rationalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uq.edu.au/economics/johnquiggin/JournalArticles97/Econrat97.html|title=John Quiggin&nbsp;— Journal Articles 1997 - Economic rationalism|work=uq.edu.au}}</ref> The Whitlam government from 1972 to 1975 changed from a [[democratic socialism]] platform to [[social democracy]], their precursor to the party's Third Way policies. Under the Whitlam government, tariffs across the board were cut by 25 per cent after twenty-three years of Labor being in opposition.<ref>[http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/ "The Whitlam Institute: The Whitlam Collection: Tariff Reduction"<!-- Bot-generated title. -->]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720062736/http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/|date=20 July 2005}}</ref>

Former Labor Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]]'s first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: <blockquote>Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all. We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the "third way". The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation's economic and social imperatives.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kevin|last=Rudd|title=First Speech to Parliament|publisher=Parliament of Australia|date=11 November 1998|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/firstspeech.asp?id=83T|accessdate=9 December 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223222531/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/firstspeech.asp?id=83T|archivedate=23 December 2007}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1998, Blair, then [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party Leader]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], described the Third Way, how it relates to social democracy and its relation with both the [[Old Left]] and the [[New Right]], as follows: {{quote|The Third Way stands for a modernised social democracy, passionate in its commitment to social justice and the goals of the centre-left.

Under New Labour, the demand for "the common ownership of the means of production" has been dumped and the free market warmly embraced.

[[Democratic socialism]] has emerged in opposition to Third Way social democracy<ref name="Whyman 2005"/> on the basis that democratic socialists are committed to systemic transformation of the economy from capitalism to socialism whereas social-democratic supporters of the Third Way were more concerned about challenging the [[New Right]] and win social democracy back to power. This has resulted in analysts and critics alike arguing that in effect it endorsed capitalism, even if it was due to recognising that outspoken [[opposition to capitalism]] in these circumstances was politically nonviable; and that it was anti-social democratic in practice.<ref name="Barrientos&Powell"/><ref name="Romano"/><ref name="Hinnfors"/><ref name="Lafontaine"/><ref name="Corfe"/> Others saw it as theoretically fitting with modern socialism, especially [[liberal socialism]], distinguishing it from both classical socialism and traditional democratic socialism or social democracy.<ref>Adams, Ian (1999).

== Criticism ==
After the dismantling of his country's [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] government, Czechoslovakia's conservative finance minister [[Václav Klaus]] declared in 1990: "We want a market economy without any adjectives. Any compromises with that will only fuzzy up the problems we have. To pursue a so-called 'third way' [between central planning and the market economy] is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a [[socialism with a human face]]. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed. The market is indivisible; it cannot be an instrument in the hands of central planners".<ref>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/34729.html "No Third Way Out: Creating A Capitalist Czechoslovakia"]. ''Reason''. June 1990. Retrieved 22 April 2007.</ref>

[[Left-wing]] opponents of the Third Way argue that it represents social democrats who responded to the [[New Right]] by accepting [[capitalism]]. The Third Way most commonly uses [[Market mechanism|market mechanics]] and [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and in that sense it is fundamentally capitalist.<ref>Romano, Flavio (2006). ''Clinton and Blair: The Political Economy of the Third Way''. Oxon, England, UK; New York City, New York, USA: Routledge. p. 5.</ref> In addition to opponents who have noticed this, other reviews have claimed that Third Way social democrats adjusted to the political climate since the 1980s that favoured capitalism by recognising that outspoken [[opposition to capitalism]] in these circumstances was politically nonviable and that accepting capitalism as the current [[The powers that be (phrase)|powers that be]] and seeking to administer it to challenge ''laissez-faire'' liberals was a more pressing immediate concern.<ref>Romano, Flavio (2006). ''Clinton and Blair: The Political Economy of the Third Way''. Oxon, England, United Kingdom; New York City, New York, United States: Routledge. p. 113.</ref> With the rise of neoliberalism in the late 1970s and early 1980s and the Third Way between the 1990s and 2000s, social democracy became synonymous with it.<ref name="Whyman 2005"/><ref name="Lewis&Surnder 2004">Lewis, Jane; Surender, Rebecca (2004).

[[Democratic socialists|Democratic]] and [[Market socialism|market socialists]] argue that the major reason for the economic shortcomings of [[command economies]] was their authoritarian nature rather than socialism itself, that it was a failure of a specific model and that therefore socialists should support democratic models rather than abandon it. Economists [[Pranab Bardhan]] and [[John Roemer]] argue that [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] and [[Marxist–Leninist state]]s failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of state enterprises in their administrative, command allocation of resources and commodities and the lack of democracy in the political systems that the Soviet-type economies were combined with. According to them, a form of competitive socialism that rejects dictatorship and authoritarian allocation in favor of democracy could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref>

Although close to [[New Labour]] and a key figure in the development of the Third Way, sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the Third Way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics.<ref name="Grice"/> For him, it was not a succumbing to [[neoliberalism]] or the dominance of capitalist [[Market (economics)|markets]].<ref>Giddens, Anthony (2000).

He argued that "the [[Financial regulation|regulation]] of [[financial market]]s is the single most pressing issue in the [[world economy]]" and that "global commitment to [[free trade]] depends upon effective [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] rather than dispenses with the need for it".<ref name="Giddens1998">Giddens, Anthony (1998).
