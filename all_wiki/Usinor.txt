'''Usinor''' was a French steel making group formed in 1948. The group was merged with '''Sacilor''' in 1986, becoming '''Usinor-Sacilor''' and was privatised in 1995, and renamed '''Usinor''' in 1997.

In 2001 it merged with [[Arbed]] (Luxembourg) and [[Aceralia]] (Spain) to form the European company [[Arcelor]], which became part of [[ArcelorMittal]] in 2006.

==History==

===Sacilor and predecessors===
In 1704 [[Jean Martin de Wendel]] bought an [[Ironworks]] in [[Hayange]] in [[Lorraine (region)]], north-eastern France. Over the next one hundred years industrial production grew, and, in 1822 the first coke fired blast furnace in France was constructed. Further growth occurred under [[de Wendel family]] ownership in the next century; in 1850 approximately 20,000 tons of iron and cast iron each were produced, by 1869 this had increased 15 blast furnaces and a production of well over 100,000 tons of cast iron and iron each. Production included rails, bars, sheet, tin and wire.<ref name="fu">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/USINOR-SACILOR-Company-History.html|title=USINOR SACILOR  -- Company History|work=www.fundinguniverse.com}}</ref>

The company was split as a result of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region becoming part of Germany after that countries victory in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. After Germany's defeat in the [[First World War]] the region returned to France, and the factories regained. Production continued to increase, with over 1.5million tons of iron and cast iron each produced in 1929.<ref name="fu"/>

The [[Great Depression in France]] affected the company's ability to invest and in 1948 nine steelmakers formed the ''[[Société Lorraine de Laminage Continu]]'' (Sollac), pooling their resources to modernise. Further consolidation took place in the 1950s and 60s; ''Sidélor'' was formed from the Rombas and Homécourt group of companies in 1950, in 1963 the ''Union des consommateurs de produits métallurgiques et industriels'' (UCPMI) and ''Knutange'' merged to form the ''Société Mosellane de Sidérurgie'' (SMS).<ref name="fu"/>

'''Sacilor''' ('''S'''ociété des '''Aci'''éries et Laminoirs de '''Lor'''raine) was first created in 1964 as a joint venture between the ''de Wendel'' and ''Sidélor'' groups<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rail.lu/sacilor.html|title=SACILOR|at=Historique - Geschichtlicher Überblick|work=www.rail.lu}}</ref> (France for the construction of a modern steel plant in [[Gandrange]], Lorraine. The groups themselves merged with SMS in 1967, forming ''de Wendel-Sidélor''; in 1968 this group produced 40% of French production: 20million tons of Iron.<ref name="fu"/>

The entire group became named '''Sacilor''' in 1973.

===Usinor and predecessors===
'''Usinor''' ('''U'''nion '''Si'''dérurgique du '''Nor'''d) was created in 1948 from the merger of [[Denain-Anzin]] (''Les Hauts Fourneaux, Forges et Aciéries de Denain-Anzin'') founded 1849 and ''Nord-Est'' (''Les Forges et Aciéries du Nord et de l'Est'') founded 1882. Both companies had their origins in ironworks founded in the first half of the 19th century in the modern day ''département'' of [[Nord (French department)|Nord]].<ref name="m">{{cite web|url=http://www.arcelormittal.com/index.php?lang=en&page=552|title=History of Usinor|work=www.arcelormittal.com}}</ref>

The company was formed for the consolidation of the steel works in the region, with a new plant in [[Denain]], opened in 1952. Another factory, dedicated to steel sheet production was opened in [[Dunkirk]] in 1971, receiving materials by sea and from abroad.<ref name="fu"/>

In 1963 merger with ''Lorraine-Escaut'', also formed from the merger of older companies. (''Senelle-Maubeuge'', ''[[Aciéries de Longwy|Longwy]]'' and ''Escaut et Meuse''). The financial crisis of the 1970s affected the company negatively, and state investment grew. In 1979 another merger took place between Usinor and the smaller ''[[Société des forges de Châtillon-Commentry-Neuves-Maison|Chiers-Chatillon-Neuves Maisons]]''. By 1981 90% of Usinor's shares were stated owned.

===Nationalisation and merger of Usinor and Sacilor===
The economic effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]] affected both the steelmaking groups, already in debt from modernisation projects, and heavily reliant on state loans; in 1981 both Usinor and Sacilor was nationalised.<ref name="fu"/>

Following another steel market crash in 1983, and the halt to subsidies to the steel industry brought in by the [[European Commission]] in 1986; Both companies were making heavy losses; in September 1986 the merger of Usinor and Sacilor was announced forming '''Usinor-Sacilor'''.<ref name="fu"/>

===Usinor-Sacilor, Usinor, and merger into Arcelor===
Further companies were absorbed into the group, ''Sollac'' in 1990, ''Ugine'' in 1991. In 1995 the company was privatised, and in 1997 the entire group renamed '''Usinor'''.<ref name="m"/>

In 1998 [[Cockerill-Sambre]], a Belgian steelmaker was acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/1998/12/inbrief/be9812158n.htm|title=Usinor takes over Cockerill-Sambre, under union supervision|work=www.eurofound.europa.eu|author=Philippe Dryon, Estelle Krzeslo|date=28 December 1998|publisher=European industrial relations observatory on-line}}</ref>
