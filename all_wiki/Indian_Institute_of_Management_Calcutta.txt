==History==
After India became [[History of the Republic of India|independent]] in 1947, the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] was entrusted to oversee and direct the development of the nation. India proliferated in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s, the Commission started facing difficulties in finding suitable managers for the large number of [[Public-sector undertaking|public sector enterprises]] that were being established in India as a part of its industrial policy. To solve this problem, the Planning Commission in 1959 invited Professor George Robbins of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]] to help in setting up an all India level institute of management studies. Based on his recommendations, the Indian government decided to set up two elite management institutes, named ''Indian Institutes of Management''.<ref name="IIMReviewCommitteeReport">{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |accessdate=19 March 2010 |publisher=GOVERNMENT OF INDIA: MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006173642/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archive-date=6 October 2010 }}</ref>
