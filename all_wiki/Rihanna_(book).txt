'''''Rihanna''''' (originally titled and alternatively known as '''''Rihanna: The Last Girl on Earth'''''<ref name="uk1"/>) is a [[coffee table book|coffee table]] [[photo-book]] by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] and British artist [[Simon Henwood]]. Henwood envisioned the project as the depiction of a "journey", as it includes professional and candid photos by him, that show the singer's fourth studio album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]''{{'}}s (2009) promotional campaign, alongside pictures from other live appearances. The publication features a preface written by French designer Alexandre Vauthier.

It was first issued in the United States as a [[hardcover]] edition including a [[Compact Disc|CD]], on October 15, 2010; also being released in [[paperback]] formats and a deluxe hardcover edition including a crystal monogrammed clamshell and a signed image print. To promote the book, Rihanna appeared at a [[Barnes & Noble]] store where she signed copies of it. Editors commented on the book positively, favoring Rihanna's looks and Henwood's photography.

In November 2009, Rihanna released her fourth studio album ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' through [[Def Jam Recordings]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rated-r/id340340001|title=Rated R — Rihanna|publisher=[[iTunes Store]].

During an interview with website MuuMuse, the book's photographer and [[British people|British]] artist [[Simon Henwood]], who also served as the creative director during the promotional campaign for ''Rated R'', spoke on the concept and purpose of the publication. He revealed that the book was created in order to show the events of that promotional era, and while he did not envision the project as a "diary", he described it as a "picture book of everything that happens when you're building [something] like this, so things people had not seen of her."<ref name="muumuse"/> Having spent a long period of time with Rihanna on diverse locations, such as "fashion shows, on set, hotel rooms" amongst others, Henwood told MuuMuse that it depicted the "journey from the initial design of the logo and concept of the album to the singer embarking on the Last Girl on Earth Tour.<ref name="muumuse">{{cite web|title=Rated R and Beyond: Interview with Creative Director Simon Henwood|url=http://www.muumuse.com/2010/10/rated-r-and-beyond-interview-with-creative-director-simon-henwood.html/|publisher=MuuMuse|accessdate=February 14, 2014|date=October 2010<!--exact date not provided by source-->|author=Stern, Bradley}}</ref>

As a result, ''Rihanna'' includes photos of the singer taken during the [[Paris Fashion Week]]; during the ''Rated R'' photoshoot done by [[Ellen von Unwerth]] in Berlin; candid pictures and pictures of her [[American Music Awards]] live performance. The last photos of the publication were taken by Henwood during the European leg of the Last Girl on Earth Tour in April 2010.<ref name="rap-up">{{cite web|title=Preview Rihanna's Photography Book|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/10/06/preview-rihannas-photography-book/|accessdate=February 15, 2014|work=[[Rap-Up]]|publisher=Rap-Up, LLC.}}</ref> Aside from the pictures, the book also includes a [[preface]] written by French designer Alexandre Vauthier, in which he praises the singer and describes their encounter.<ref name="e">{{cite web|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=February 15, 2014|date=October 15, 2010|url=http://uk.eonline.com/news/205888/inside-rihanna-s-big-beautiful-world|author=Malkin, Marc|title=Inside Rihanna's Big Beautiful World}}</ref>

The date was then rescheduled from June 2010 to September of that year. Rihanna said to [[MTV]]:
<blockquote>I think it was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, pictures that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get to see all the things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|publisher=[[MTV]].
