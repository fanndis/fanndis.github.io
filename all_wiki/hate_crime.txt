A '''hate crime''' (also known as a '''bias-motivated crime''' or '''bias crime'''<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-crime|website=Dictionary.com|title=Hate crime|quote="Also called '''bias crime'''."}}</ref>) is a [[prejudice]]-motivated crime which occurs when a perpetrator targets a victim because of their membership (or perceived membership) of a certain [[social group]] or [[race (human categorization)|race]].

Examples of such groups can include, and are almost exclusively limited to: [[sex]], [[ethnicity]], [[disability]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[Physical appearance#Physiological differences|physical appearance]], [[religion]], [[gender identity]] or [[sexual orientation]].<ref name="williams">{{cite web|last=Stotzer|first=R.|url=http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Stotzer-Comparison-Hate-Crime-June-2007.pdf|title=Comparison of Hate Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups|work= [[Williams Institute]]|date= June 2007|accessdate=17 March 2012}} "A hate crime or bias motivated crime occurs when the perpetrator of the crime intentionally selects the victim because of their membership in a certain group."</ref><ref name="FBI2013">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2013/resource-pages/methodology/methodology_final|title=Methodology|work=FBI}}</ref><ref name="Streis">Streissguth, Tom (2003).

"Hate crime" generally refers to [[crime|criminal acts]] which are seen to have been motivated by [[bias]] against one or more of the social groups listed above, or by bias against their derivatives. Incidents may involve physical assault, damage to property, [[bullying]], [[harassment]], [[verbal abuse]] or [[insult]]s, [[mate crime]] or offensive [[graffiti]] or letters ([[hate mail]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|title=Home Office {{!}} Hate crime|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126153146/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/hate-crime/|archive-date=26 November 2005}}</ref>

==History==
The term "hate crime" came into common usage in the [[United States]] during the 1980s, but it is often used retrospectively in order to describe events which occurred prior to that era.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/civilrights/hate_crimes|title=Hate Crimes|work=FBI|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> From the [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Roman persecution of Christians]] to the [[Final Solution|Nazi slaughter of Jews]], hate crimes were committed by individuals as well as governments long before the term was commonly used.<ref name="Streis"/> A major part of defining crimes as hate crimes is determining that they have been committed against members of historically oppressed groups.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1540-4560.00257|title = Understanding the Harm of Hate Crime|journal = Journal of Social Issues|volume = 58|issue = 2|pages = 207–225|year = 2002|last1 = Boeckmann|first1 = Robert J.|last2 = Turpin-Petrosino|first2 = Carolyn}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Craig |first1=Kellina M. |last2=Waldo |first2=Craig R. |year=1996 |title="So, what's a hate crime anyway?"

As [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] began to [[colonialism|colonize]] the world from the 16th century onwards, [[indigenous peoples]] in the colonized areas, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], increasingly became the targets of bias-motivated [[intimidation]] and [[violence]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Woolford |first1=Andrew |last2=Benvenuto |first2=Jeff |last3=Hinton |first3=Alexander Laban |title=Colonial Genocide in Indigenous North America |date=2014 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, NC |isbn=9780822376149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xBPqBQAAQBAJ&q=Colonial+genocide+in+indigenous+North+America&pg=PT6 |accessdate=5 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Kiernan |first1=Ben |title=BLOOD AND SOIL: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur |date=25 September 2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=London, UK |url=https://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/blood_and_soil.pdf |accessdate=5 October 2020}}</ref>  During the past two centuries, typical examples of hate crimes in the U.S. include [[lynching]]s of [[African Americans]], largely in the [[Southern United States|South]], and lynchings of [[Mexican Americans|Mexicans]] and [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] in the [[Western United States|West]]; [[cross burning]]s in order to intimidate black activists or drive black families out of predominantly white neighborhoods both during and after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]; assaults on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people; the painting of [[swastika]]s on Jewish [[synagogue]]s; and [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] responses to a variety of [[minorities|minority]] [[ethnic group]]s.<ref name = "tvccce">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/162304.pdf |title=A Policymaker's Guide to Hate Crimes |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>

The verb "''to [[Lynching|lynch]]''" is attributed to the actions of [[Charles Lynch (jurist)|Charles Lynch]], an 18th-century [[Virginia]] [[Quaker]]. Lynch, other militia officers, and justices of the peace rounded up [[Tory]] sympathizers who were given a summary trial at an informal court; sentences which were handed down included whipping, property seizure, coerced pledges of allegiance, and conscription into the military. Originally, the term referred to the extrajudicial organized but unauthorized punishment of criminals. It later evolved to describe executions which were committed outside "ordinary justice." It is highly associated with white suppression of African Americans in the South, and periods of weak or nonexistent [[police authority]], as in certain frontier areas of the [[Old West]].<ref name="Streis"/>

==Psychological effects==
Hate crimes can have significant and wide-ranging [[Psychology|psychological]] consequences, not only for their direct victims but for others as well. A 1999 U.S. study of lesbian and gay victims of violent hate crimes documented that they experienced higher levels of psychological distress, including symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], than lesbian and gay victims of comparable crimes which were not motivated by antigay bias.<ref name="Herek et al. (1999)">{{cite journal |last1= Herek |first1=Gregory M. |last2= Gillis |first2= J.

; Impact on the individual victim: psychological and [[affection|affective]] disturbances; repercussions on the victim's identity and [[self-esteem]]; both reinforced by a specific hate crime's degree of violence, which is usually stronger than that of a common crime.
; Effect on the targeted group: generalized [[fear|terror]] in the group to which the victim belongs, inspiring feelings of vulnerability among its other members, who could be the next hate crime victims.
; Effect on other vulnerable groups: ominous effects on [[minority groups]] or on groups that identify themselves with the targeted group, especially when the referred hate is based on an [[ideology]] or a [[doctrine]] that preaches simultaneously against several groups.
; Effect on the community as a whole: divisions and factionalism arising in response to hate crimes are particularly damaging to [[multiculturalism|multicultural societies]].

Hate crime victims can also develop depression and [[psychological trauma]].<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)">{{cite journal |last1= Cox |first1=William T.

A review of European and American research indicates that terrorist bombings cause [[Islamophobia]] and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorist's most persuasive message is that of fear and fear, a primary and strong emotion, increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly: terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as a window of opportunity for extremist groups and networks.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = When Is the Time to Hate?

==Motivation==

The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a study into the motives for hate crimes and found four motives:<ref name="edition.cnn.com">Burke, Daniel, [https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html ''The four reasons people commit hate crimes''], CNN, 12/06/17, accessed 10/03/19</ref>
* ''Thrill-seeking'' - perpetrators engage in hate crimes for excitement and drama. There is often no greater purpose behind the crimes, with victims being vulnerable because they have an ethnic, religious, sexual or gender background that differs from their attackers. While the actual animosity present in such a crime can be quite low, thrill-seeking crimes were determined to often be dangerous, with 70% of thrill-seeking hate crimes studied involving physical attacks.
* ''Defensive'' - perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a belief they are protecting their communities. These are often triggered by a certain background event. Perpetrators believe society supports their actions but is too afraid to act and thus they believe they have communal assent in their actions. 
* ''Retaliatory'' - perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of a desire for revenge. This can be in response to personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism. The "avengers" target members of a group whom they believe committed the original crime, even if the victims had nothing to do with it. These kinds of hate crimes are a common occurrence after terrorist attacks.
* ''Mission offenders'' - perpetrators engage in hate crimes out of ideological reasons. They consider themselves to be crusaders, often for a religious or racial cause. They will often write complex explanations for their views and target symbolically important sites while trying to maximize damage. They believe that there is no other way to accomplish their goals, which they consider to be justification for excessive violence against innocents. This kind of hate crime often overlaps with terrorism and was considered by the FBI to be both the rarest and deadliest form of hate crime.

The categories of hate crimes can often overlap and it can be unclear which category a particular offence should fit in to.<ref name="edition.cnn.com"/>

==Laws==
Hate crime laws generally fall into one of several categories:
# laws defining specific bias-motivated acts as distinct crimes;
# criminal penalty-enhancement laws;
# laws creating a distinct civil cause of action for hate crimes; and
# laws requiring administrative agencies to collect hate crime statistics.<ref name="human">{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/everyday-fears-080805.pdf |title=Michael McClintock: ''Everyday Fears: A Survey of Violent Hate Crimes in Europe and North America'' |publisher=Humanrightsfirst.org |accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>  Sometimes (as in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), the laws focus on [[war crimes]], [[genocide]], and [[crimes against humanity]] with the prohibition against discriminatory action limited to public officials.

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]]'s Act of 25 February 2003 ("aimed at combating discrimination and modifying the Act of 15 February 1993 which establishes the Centre for Equal Opportunities and the Fight against Racism") establishes a penalty-enhancement for crimes involving discrimination on the basis of gender, supposed race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, civil status, birth, fortune, age, religious or philosophical beliefs, current or future state of health and handicap or physical features.

====Czech Republic====
The Czech legislation finds its constitutional basis in the principles of equality and non-discrimination contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.
The current Czech criminal legislation has implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether to find a defendant guilty or not guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting the extent of the punishment imposed). It has '''three levels''', to wit:
* a '''circumstance determining whether an act is a crime''' – hate motivation is included in the basic constituent elements. If hate motivation is not proven, a conviction for a hate crime is not possible.
* a '''circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty''' – hate motivation is included in the qualified constituent elements for some types of crimes (murder, bodily harm). If hate motivation is not proven, the penalty is imposed according to the scale specified for the basic constituent elements of the crime.
* '''general aggravating circumstance''' – the court is obligated to take the hate motivation into account as a general aggravating circumstance and determines the amount of penalty to impose. Nevertheless, it is not possible to add together a general aggravating circumstance and a circumstance determining the imposition of a higher penalty. (see Annex for details)
Current criminal legislation '''does not provide for special penalties''' for acts that target another by reason of his '''sexual orientation, age or health status'''. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offence of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such a group of people can then, of course, be also defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are victimized by reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are victimized by reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in-ius.cz/dwn/zprava-o-nzn2011/report-web.pdf |title=Zpráva o násilí z nenávisti v České republice za rok 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>

====Denmark====
Although [[Denmark|Danish]] law does not include explicit hate crime provisions, "section 80(1) of the Criminal Code instructs courts to take into account the gravity of the offence and the offender's motive when meting out penalty, and therefore to attach importance to the racist motive of crimes in determining sentence."<ref>ECRI, "Second Report on Denmark," adopted on 16 June 2000, and made public on 3 April 2001, para. 9.</ref> In recent years judges have used this provision to increase sentences on the basis of racist motives.<ref name="human" /><ref>Chahrokh, Klug, and Bilger, Migrants, Minorities, and Legislation.</ref>

Since 1992, the Danish Civil Security Service (PET) has released statistics on crimes with apparent racist motivation.<ref name="human" />

Under section 151 of the Criminal Code of [[Estonia]] of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and as amended by the Law of 8 December 2011, "activities which publicly incite to hatred, violence or discrimination on the basis of nationality, race, colour, sex, language, origin, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, or financial or social status, if this results in danger to the life, health or property of a person, are punishable by a fine of up to 300 fine units or by detention".<ref>[http://www.legislationline.org/documents/action/popup/id/18762 Criminal Code of Estonia of 6 June 2001, entered into force on 1 September 2002, with amendments and supplements and latest amendment by the Law of 8 December 2011, published in RT I, 29.12.2011, 1 and entered into force on 1 January 2012 (excerpts)], accessed 27 August 2017</ref>

====Finland====
[[Finland|Finnish]] [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] 515/2003 (enacted 31 January 2003) makes "committing a crime against a person, because of his national, racial, ethnical or equivalent group" an aggravating circumstance in sentencing.<ref name="human" /><ref>EUMC, "Racism and xenophobia in the E.U.," p. 51.</ref> In addition, ethnic agitation ({{lang-fi|kiihotus kansanryhmää vastaan}}) is criminalized and carries a fine or a prison sentence of not more than two years. The prosecution need not prove that an actual danger to an ethnic group is caused but only that malicious message is conveyed. A more aggravated hate crime, warmongering ({{lang-fi|sotaan yllyttäminen}}), carries a prison sentence of one to ten years. However, in case of warmongering, the prosecution must prove an [[overt act]] that evidently increases the risk that Finland is involved in a war or becomes a target for a military operation. The act in question may consist of
# illegal violence directed against a foreign country or its citizens,
# systematic dissemination of false information on Finnish foreign policy or defense
# public influence on the public opinion towards a pro-war viewpoint or
# public suggestion that a foreign country or Finland should engage in an aggressive act.<ref>[http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039.pdf Penal Code (39/1889)] as of 1006/2004. §§ 6:5.1.4 (ethnic hatred as an aggravating factor), 11:8 (ethnic agitation) and 12:2 (warmongering).

In 2003, France enacted penalty-enhancement hate crime laws for crimes motivated by bias against the victim's actual or perceived ethnicity, nation, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The penalties for murder were raised from 30 years (for non-hate crimes) to life imprisonment (for hate crimes), and the penalties for violent attacks leading to permanent disability were raised from 10 years (for non-hate crimes) to 15 years (for hate crimes).<ref name="human" /><ref>''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000781920 Loi n° 2003–88 du 3 février 2003 visant à aggraver les peines punissant les infractions à caractère raciste, antisémite ou xénophobe]''</ref>

====Georgia====
"There is no general provision in Georgian law for racist motivation to be considered an aggravating circumstance in prosecutions of ordinary offenses. Certain crimes involving racist motivation are, however, defined as specific offenses in the Georgian Criminal Code of 1999, including murder motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 109); infliction of serious
injuries motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 117); and torture motivated by racial, religious, national or ethnic intolerance (article 126). ECRI reported no knowledge of cases in which this law has been enforced. There is no systematic monitoring or data collection on discrimination in Georgia."<ref name="human" />

====Germany====
The [[German Criminal Code]] does not have hate crime legislation, instead, it criminalizes [[hate speech]] under a number of different laws, including [[Volksverhetzung]]. In the German legal framework [[motivation]] is not taken into account while identifying the element of the offence. However, within the sentencing procedure the judge can define certain principles for determining punishment. In section 46 of the German Criminal Code it is stated that "the motives and aims of the perpetrator; the state of mind reflected in the act and the willfulness involved in its commission."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#46 |title=Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) |publisher=Iuscomp.org |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref> can be taken into consideration when determining the [[punishment]]; under this statute, hate and bias have been taken into consideration in sentencing in past cases.<ref name="Marc Coester 2008">Marc Coester (2008): Das Konzept der Hate Crimes aus den USA unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Rechtsextremismus in Deutschland.

Hate crimes are not specifically tracked by German police, but have been studied separately: a recently published EU "Report on Racism" finds that racially motivated attacks are frequent in Germany, identifying 18,142 incidences for 2006, of which 17,597 were motivated by right-wing ideologies, both about a 14% year-by-year increase.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502471,00.html |title=EU Xenophobia Report: Racism On the Rise in Germany  |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=14 November 2011|date=28 August 2007  }}</ref>  Relative to the size of the population, this represents an eightfold higher rate of hate crimes than reported in the US during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2007/november/hatecrime_111907 |title=2006 Hate Crime in the U.S |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref>  Awareness of hate crimes and right-wing extremism in Germany remains low.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,502694,00.html |title= Interview with Racism Expert: 'Awareness of Ethnic Discrimination Is Low in Germany' |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=14 November 2011|date= 29 August 2007 }}</ref>

Perhaps the most high-profile hate crime in modern Britain occurred in [[Eltham]], [[London]], on 24 April 1993, when 18-year-old black student [[Stephen Lawrence]] was stabbed to death in an attack by a gang of white youths. Two white teenagers were later charged with the murder, and at least three other suspects were mentioned in the national media, but the charges against them were dropped within three months after the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. However, a change in the law a decade later allowed a suspect to be charged with a crime twice if new evidence emerged after the original charges were dropped or a "not guilty" verdict was delivered in court. Gary Dobson, who had been charged with the murder in the initial 1993 investigation, was found guilty of Stephen Lawrence's murder in January 2012 and sentenced to life imprisonment, as was David Norris, who had not been charged in 1993. A third suspect, Luke Knight, had been charged in 1993 but was not charged when the case came to court nearly 20 years later.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

====Canada====
"In Canada the legal definition of a hate crime can be found in sections 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code".
<ref name="autogenerated161">{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=161}}</ref>

In 1996 the federal government amended a section of the Criminal Code that pertains to sentencing. Specifically, section 718.2. The section states (with regard to the hate crime):

''A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:

''(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,''

''(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, . . . shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.''''
<ref name="autogenerated161"/>

A vast majority (84 per cent) of hate crime perpetrators were "male, with an average age of just under 30. Less than 10 of those accused had criminal records, and less than 5 per cent had previous hate crime involvement (ibid O’Grady 2010 page 163.)."
<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Grady|first=William|title=Crime In Canadian Context: debates and controversies|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-543378-4|page=163}}</ref> "Only 4 percent of hate crimes were linked to an organized or extremist group (Silver et al., 2004)."

As of 2004, Jewish people were the largest ethnic group targeted by hate crimes, followed by Black people, Muslims, South Asians, and homosexuals (Silver et al., 2004).<ref name="autogenerated162"/>

During the Nazi regime, anti-Semitism was a cause of hate-related violence in Canada. For example, on 16 August 1933 there was a baseball game in Toronto and one team was made up of mostly Jewish players. At the end of the game, a group of Nazi sympathizers unfolded a Swastika flag and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’. That event [[Christie Pits riot|erupted into a brawl]] that had Jews and Italians against Anglo Canadians and the brawl went on for hours.<ref name="autogenerated161"/>

The first time someone was charged with hate speech over the internet occurred on 27 March 1996. "A Winnipeg teenager was arrested by the police for sending an email to a local political activist that contained the message ‘Death to homosexuals’ it's prescribed in the Bible! Better watch out next Gay Pride Week.’ (Nairne, 1996)."<ref name="autogenerated162"/>

====Mexico====
Alejandro Gertz Manero, [[Attorney General of Mexico]], recommended in August [[2020 in Mexico|2020]] that all murders involving women be investigated as [[Violence against women in Mexico|femicides]].

Hate crime laws have a long history in the United States. The first hate crime<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2015|date=Fall 2016|website=ucr.fbi.gov}}</ref> laws were passed after the [[American Civil War]], beginning with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]], in order to combat the growing number of racially motivated crimes which were being committed by the [[Reconstruction era]] [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The modern era of hate-crime legislation began in 1968 with the passage of federal statute, 18 U.S. 245, part of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|Civil Rights Act]] which made it illegal to "by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone who is engaged in six specified protected activities, by reason of their [[race (classification of humans)|race]], [[color]], [[religion]], or [[national origin]]." However, "The prosecution of such crimes must be certified by the U.S. attorney general.".<ref>Streissguth (2003), p. 20.</ref>

The first state hate-crime statute, [[California]]'s Section 190.2, was passed in 1978 and it provided penalty enhancements in cases when murders were motivated by prejudice against four "protected status" categories: race, religion, color, and national origin. Washington included [[ancestry]] in a statute which was passed in 1981. Alaska included [[creed]] and [[sex]] in 1982 and later [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[ethnicity]]. In the 1990s some state laws began to include [[ageing|age]], [[marital status]], membership in the [[armed forces]], and membership in [[civil rights]] organizations.<ref>Streissguth (2003), pp. 20–21.</ref>

Until California state legislation included all crimes as possible hate crimes in 1987, criminal acts which could be considered hate crimes in various states included [[aggravated assault]], [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[vandalism]], [[rape]], [[threat]]s and [[intimidation]], [[arson]], [[trespassing]], [[stalking]], and various "lesser" acts.<ref>Streissguth (2003), p. 21.</ref>

Defined in the 1999 National Crime Victim Survey, "A hate crime is a criminal offence. In the [[United States]], federal prosecution is possible for hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's race, religion, or nation origin when engaging in a federally protected activity." In 2009, capping a broad-based public campaign lasting more than a decade, President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Matthew Shepard Act|Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]. The Act added actual or perceived [[gender]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], and [[disability]] to the federal definition of a hate crime, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

Prosecutions of hate crimes have been difficult in the United States. Recently, state governments have attempted to re-investigate and re-try past hate crimes. One notable example was [[Mississippi]]'s decision to retry [[Byron De La Beckwith]] in 1990 for the 1963 murder of [[Medgar Evers]], a prominent figure in the [[NAACP]] and a leader of the [[Civil rights movement]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Labuda|first=P.|title=Racial Reconciliation in Mississippi: An Evaluation of the Proposal to Establish a Mississippi Truth and Reconciliation Commission.|journal=Harvard Blackletter Law Journal|year=2011|volume=271|pages=1–48}}</ref>  This was the first time in U.S. history that an unresolved civil rights case was re-opened.

=====Victims in the United States=====
One of the largest waves of hate crimes in the [[history of the United States]] took place during the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Both violence and threats of violence were common against [[African Americans]], and hundreds of lives were lost due to such acts. Members of this [[social class]] faced violence from [[hate groups|groups]] such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as well as violence from individuals who were committed to maintaining [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Segregation in America |url=https://eji.org/reports/segregation-in-america/ |website=Equal Justice Initiative |accessdate=26 May 2020 |date=2018}}</ref> At the time, civil rights leaders such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and their supporters fought hard for the right of African Americans to vote as well as for equality in their everyday lives. African Americans have been the target of hate crimes since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]],<ref name="americansperspective.com">{{Cite news|url=http://americansperspective.com/10-of-the-worst-hate-crimes-and-violence-in-domestic-american-history/#|title=10 Of The Worst Hate Crimes and Violence in Domestic American History|date=22 June 2015|newspaper=americansperspective.com|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref> and the humiliation of this [[social class]] was also desired by many Anti-black individuals. Other frequently reported bias motivations were bias against a religion, bias against a particular sexual orientation, and bias against a particular ethnicity/national origin.<ref name="fbi 2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2010/narratives/hate-crime-2010-victims |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|title=Hate Crime Statistics, 2010|accessdate=16 March 2012}}</ref> At times, these bias motivations overlapped, because violence can be both anti-gay and anti-black, for example.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|title=Evaluating the Severity of Hate-motivated Violence: Intersectional Differences among LGBT Hate Crime Victims|journal=Sociology|year=2010|volume=44|issue=5|pages=980–95|doi=10.1177/0038038510375737|s2cid=145147987}}</ref>

Justifications for harsher punishments for hate crimes focus on the notion that hate crimes cause greater individual and societal harm.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} It is said<ref>Marian Duggan and Vicky Heap, ''Administrating Victimization: The Politics of AntiSocial Behaviour and Hate Crime Policy'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.</ref> that, when the core of a person's identity is attacked, the degradation and [[dehumanization]] is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the [[empowerment|disempowerment]] of a group of people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] in [[Los Angeles]], California that followed the beating of [[Rodney King]], a Black motorist, by a group of [[white people|White]] police officers are cited as support for this argument.<ref name = "tvccce"/> The beating of white truck driver [[Reginald Oliver Denny|Reginald Denny]] by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.

In ''[[Wisconsin v. Mitchell]]'', the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] unanimously found that ''penalty-enhancement'' hate crime statutes do not conflict with [[free speech]] rights, because they do not punish an individual for exercising [[freedom of expression]]; rather, they allow courts to consider [[motive (law)|motive]] when sentencing a criminal for conduct which is not protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/wisconsin-v-mitchell|accessdate=12 October 2011|title=Wisconsin v. Mitchell|publisher=Enotes.com}}</ref> Whilst in the case of ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' the court defined "fighting words" as "those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace."<ref>{{citation | last = Sumner | first = L.W. | author-link = L.

The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously found the [[R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul|St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance]] amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination in conflict with rights of free speech, because it selectively criminalized bias-motivated speech or symbolic speech for disfavored topics while permitting such speech for other topics.<ref>''[[R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul]]'', 505 U.S. 377 (1992).</ref> Many critics further assert that it conflicts with an even more fundamental right: free thought. The claim is that hate-crime legislation effectively makes certain ideas or beliefs, including religious ones, illegal, in other words, [[thought crime]]s.<ref>'''Sources''':

Hurd argues that whether or not a disposition is worse than another is case sensitive and thus it is difficult to argue that some motivations are categorically worse than others.<ref>David Brax, Christian Munthe [https://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/projects/assets/PT_11_The_Philosophy_of_Hate_Crime_Anthology_Pt_II_munthe_and_brax.pdf "The Philosophy of Hate Crime Anthology."], ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Hate Crime'' (2013).</ref>

In their book ''Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics'', [[James B. Jacobs]] and Kimberly Potter criticize hate crime legislation for exacerbating conflicts between groups.  They assert that by defining crimes as being committed by one group against another, rather than as being committed by individuals against their society, the labeling of crimes as "hate crimes" causes groups to feel persecuted by one another, and that this impression of persecution can incite a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] and thus lead to an actual increase in crime.<ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998">Jacobs, James B. & Kimberly Potter. (1998). Hate Crimes: Criminal Law and Identity Politics. New York: Oxford University Press,</ref> Jacobs and Potter also argued that hate crime legislation can end up only covering the victimization of some groups rather than all, which is a form of discrimination itself and that attempts to remedy this by making all identifiable groups covered by hate crime protection thus make hate crimes co-terminus with generic criminal law. The authors also suggest that arguments which attempt to portray hate crimes as worse than normal crimes because they spread fear in a community are unsatisfactory, as normal criminal acts can also spread fear yet only hate crimes are singled out.<ref name="Jacobs, James B. 1998"/> Indeed, it has been argued that victims have varied reactions to hate crimes, so it is not necessarily true that hate crimes are regarded as more harmful than other crimes.<ref>Iganski, Paul, and Spiridoula Lagou. "Hate crimes hurt some more than others: Implications for the just sentencing of offenders."

Heidi Hurd argues that hate crime represents an effort by the state to encourage a certain moral character in its citizen and thus represents the view that the instillation of virtue and the elimination of vice are legitimate state goals, which she argues is a contradiction of the principles of liberalism. Hurd also argues that increasing punishment for an offence because the perpetrator was motivated by hate compared to some other motivation means that the justice systems is treating the same crime differently, even though treating like cases alike is a cornerstone of criminal justice.<ref>Hurd, Heidi. "Why Liberals Should Hate'Hate Crime Legislation'." (2001).</ref>

Some have argued hate crime laws bring the law into disrepute and further divide society, as groups apply to have their critics silenced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Troy |first=Daniel E. |url=http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |title=AEI – Short Publications |publisher=Aei.org |date=4 August 1999 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610125417/http://www.aei.org/speech/17122 |archive-date=10 June 2011 }}</ref> American forensic psychologist [[Karen Franklin]] said that the term ''hate crime'' is somewhat misleading since it assumes there is a hateful motivation which is not present in many occasions;<ref name=twsFrontline>Frontline (PBS),[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/interviews/franklin.html Interviews], Accessed 26 July 2014, "...forensic psychologist, Karen Franklin's dual interests in psychology and the law brought her to question the roots of anti-gay hate crimes... badly needed empirical data on the nature and extent of negative reactions to gays..."</ref> in her view, laws to punish people who commit hate crimes may not be the best remedy for preventing them because the threat of future punishment does not usually deter such criminal acts.<ref name="twsAdvocate">{{cite web
