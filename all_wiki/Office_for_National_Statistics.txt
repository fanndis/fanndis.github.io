The '''Office for National Statistics''' ('''ONS'''; {{lang-cy|Swyddfa Ystadegau Gwladol}}) is the executive office of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], a [[non-ministerial department]] which reports directly to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].

== Overview ==
It is charged with the collection and publication of statistics related to the economy, population and society of the UK; responsibility for some areas of statistics in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is devolved to the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved governments]] for those areas.  The ONS functions as the executive office of the [[National Statistician]], who is also the UK Statistics Authority's Chief Executive and principal statistical adviser to the UK's National Statistics Institute,{{NoteTag|'National Statistics Institute' and NSI are a standard expression and its acronym used about statistical services in [[OECD]] & EU terminology.}} and the 'Head Office' of the [[Government Statistical Service]] (GSS). Its main office is in Newport near the [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] and [[Tredegar House]], but another significant office is in [[Titchfield]] in Hampshire, and a small office is in London. ONS co-ordinates data collection with the respective bodies in Northern Ireland and Scotland, namely [[NISRA]] and [[National Records of Scotland|NRS]].

== History ==
The ONS was formed on 1 April 1996 by the merger of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]] (CSO) and the [[Office of Population Censuses and Surveys]] (OPCS).<ref>John Pullinger (1997) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1403373 ''"The Creation of the Office for National Statistics"''], ''International Statistical Review'', Vol. 65, No. 3, pp. 291–308</ref> Following the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]], the United Kingdom Statistics Authority became a [[non-ministerial department]] on 1 April 2008.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/independence/thestatisticsact.asp The Statistics Act: Office for National Statistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421174108/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/data/independence/thestatisticsact.asp |date=21 April 2008 }}</ref>

== Purpose and scope ==
ONS produces and publishes a wide range of the information about the United Kingdom that can be used for social and economic policy-making as well as painting a portrait of the country as its population evolves over time. This is often produced in ways that make comparison with other societies and economies possible. Much of the data on which policy-makers depend is produced by ONS through a combination of a decennial population census, samples and surveys and analysis of data generated by businesses and organisations such as the National Health Service and the register of births, marriages and deaths. Its publications, and analyses by other users based on its published data, are reported and discussed daily in the media as the basis for the public understanding of the country in which they live.

=== Applications of data ===
The reliance on some of these data by government (both local and national) makes ONS material central to debates about the determination of priorities, the allocation of resources and for decisions on interest rates or borrowing. The complexity and degree and speed of change in the society, combined with the challenge of measuring some of these (e.g. in relation to longevity, migration or illness patterns or fine movements in inflation or other aspects of national accounts) give rise to periodic debates about some of its indicators and portrayals. Many of these rely on sources which are outside ONS, while some of its own sources need to be supplemented, for example between censuses, by updated but less rigorously obtained information from other sources. Consequently, unexpected or incomplete data or occasional errors or disputes about its analysis can also attract considerable attention. 

ONS data can also be used in [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] studies such as [[survival analysis]].

== Independence ==
[[Gordon Brown]], then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on 28 November 2005,<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo051128/text/51128w20.htm#51128w20.html_spnew7 Statement to the House of Commons on the review of the Framework for National Statistics], by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 28 November 2005.</ref> that the government intended to publish plans in early 2006 to legislate to render the ONS and the statistics it generates independent of government on a model based on the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm Budget Statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925193953/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm |date=25 September 2006 }} made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 22 March 2006</ref> This was originally a 1997 Labour manifesto commitment<ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab97.htm Labour Party Manifesto, General Election 1997] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816022536/http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/man/lab97.htm |date=16 August 2000 }}, Keele University website.</ref> and was also the policy of the Liberal Democrat<ref>[http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/manifesto2005.pdf Liberal Democrats Manifesto General Election 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630151451/http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/manifesto2005.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}.</ref> and Conservative<ref>[http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=126557 ''"Let Parliament appoint new UK statistics chief"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112095100/https://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=126557 |date=12 January 2006 }}, press release from Conservative Party website.</ref> parties. Such independence was also sought by the [[Royal Statistical Society]]<ref>[http://www.rss.org.uk/pdf/A%20Vision%20for%20National%20Statistics.pdf ''"A Vision for National Statistics"''], Royal Statistical Society.</ref> and the [[Statistics Commission]].<ref>[http://www.statscom.org.uk/uploads/files/reports/LegislationToBuildTrust.pdf ''"Legislation to build trust in statistics"''], a report by the Statistics Commission.</ref> 
The [[National Statistician]] would be directly accountable to Parliament through a more widely constituted independent governing Statistics Board.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/008/en/07008x--.htm ''"Statistics And Registration Service Bill"''], House of Commons Explanatory Note to the Bill, para. 7–8. Retrieved 10 June 2007.</ref> The ONS would be a non-ministerial government department so that the staff, including the Director, would remain as civil servants but without being under direct ministerial control.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmbills/008/en/07008x--.htm ''"Statistics And Registration Service Bill"''], House of Commons Explanatory Note to the Bill, para. 42. Retrieved 10 June 2007.</ref> 
The then National Statistician, [[Karen Dunnell|Dame Karen Dunnell]], stated that legislation would help improve public trust in official statistics<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/nsa1106.pdf ''"National Statistician welcomes Statistics and Registration Service Bill"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630151450/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/nsa1106.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}, news release from ONS website.</ref> although the ONS already acts independently according to its own published guidelines, the National Statistics Code of Practice,<ref>[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/the-national-statistics-standard/code-of-practice/index.html ''"National Statistics Code of Practice"''] ONS website</ref> which sets out the key principles and standards that official statisticians, including those in other parts of the government statistical service, are expected to follow and uphold.

The details of the plans for independence were considered in Parliament during the 2006/2007 session and resulted in the [[Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007]].<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200607/statistics_and_registration_service.htm ''"Statistics and Registration Service Bill"''], progress of the Bill through the UK Parliament from Parliament website.</ref> In July 2007, [[Michael Scholar|Sir Michael Scholar]] was nominated by the government to be the three-day-a-week non-executive chairman of the Statistics Board which, with the intention of re-establishing faith in the integrity of government statistics, was to take on statutory responsibility for oversight of UK statistics in April 2008 and oversee the Office for National Statistics; also having a duty to assess all UK government statistics. Following Gordon Brown's announcement of new constitutional arrangements for public appointments, Sir Michael also became, on 18 July, the first such nominee to appear before the House of Commons Treasury Committee and to have his nomination subject to confirmation by the House.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/75076a4e-34c7-11dc-8c78-0000779fd2ac.html ''"Whitehall veteran in frame for statistics chief post"''], ''Financial Times'', 18 July 2007.</ref> On 7 February 2008, following the first meeting of the shadow board, it was announced that it would be known as the [[UK Statistics Authority]] (UKSA).

In 2012, [[Andrew Dilnot]] replaced [[Michael Scholar]] as chairman of the Authority.

== Heads of the Office and the National Statistician ==
Since its establishment, ONS has had five Directors: Professor [[Tim Holt (statistician)|Tim Holt]]; [[Len Cook]]; [[Karen Dunnell]]; [[Jil Matheson]]; and, from October 2012, [[Glen Watson]]. Len Cook was the first Director to hold the newly created role of National Statistician.  The roles of Director of ONS and National Statistician were combined until 2012 when Jil Matheson continued as National Statistician while Glen Watson became Director of the ONS. [[John Pullinger]] replaced Jil Matheson as National Statistician (and Chief Executive of the UK Statistics Authority) in July 2014. Pullinger retired in June 2019 and in October 2019 Professor Sir [[Ian Diamond]] assumed the role of National Statistician.

== Work ==
The work of the ONS covers the collection of data and the analysis and publication of statistics covering the economy, population, and society of the UK. 

Where data is broken down by geographical area, this is usually done by the areas defined in the [[ONS coding system|ONS geographical coding system]].

=== Data collection ===
The principal areas of data collection include:
* Agriculture and Environment
* Business and Energy
* Children, Education and Skills
* Crime and Justice
* Economy
* Government
* Health and Social Care
* Labour Market
* People and Places
* Population
* Travel and Transport

Statisticians are also employed by many other Government departments and agencies, and these statisticians often collect and publish data. They are members of the [[Government Statistical Service]] and are the professional responsibility of the head of the service, who is also the National Statistician. Each department has a statistical service ''Head of Profession''. For example, data on Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry comes primarily from the [[Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. Along with economic data on which the Treasury and Bank of England rely for decision-making, many of the statistics that receive widespread media attention are issued by the Home Office, the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], and the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]. ONS is also responsible for the maintenance of the ''Inter-Departmental Business Register'' and the ''Business Structure Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file51198.pdf |title=Executive Summary UK Company Statistics Reconciliation Project |access-date=27 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file51198.pdf |archive-date=9 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Former departments ===
Before the establishment of the [[UK Statistics Authority]], the statistical work of ONS, since June 2000, was scrutinised by the [[Statistics Commission]], an independent body with its own chairman and small staff. This ceased to operate from 1 April 2008. The [[General Register Office]] and the post of [[Registrar-General]] for England & Wales ceased to be part of ONS from that date but remains subject to ministerial accountability within the [[Home Office]].

=== The Blue Book ===
{{Main|United Kingdom National Accounts - The Blue Book}}

The annual [[United Kingdom National Accounts - The Blue Book|United Kingdom National Accounts]] are published in an online publication (The Blue Book<ref>{{cite web|title=United Kingdom National Accounts – The Blue Book|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-national-accounts/index.html}}</ref>) by the Office for National Statistics. It records and describes economic activity in the United Kingdom and as such is used by government, banks, academics and industries to formulate the economic and social policies and monitor the economic progress of the United Kingdom. It also allows international comparisons to be made. The Blue Book is published alongside the United Kingdom Balance of Payments – [[Pink Book (journal)|The Pink Book]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The United Kingdom Balance of Payments – The Pink Book.|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/bop/united-kingdom-balance-of-payments/index.html}}</ref>

=== Education of statisticians ===
The Office for National Statistics collaborates with the [[University of Southampton]] in the teaching of an MSc in Official Statistics; the programme has been running since 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/demography/postgraduate/taught_courses/msc_official_statistics.page |title=MSc in Official Statistics, University of Southampton |publisher=Southampton.ac.uk |access-date=27 February 2014}}</ref>

=== Virtual Microdata Laboratory ===
The Virtual Microdata Laboratory (VML) was established in 2004 to allow researchers access to business data.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.scot-ship.ac.uk/sites/default/files/PDFs/richard-welpton-slides.pdf|title = Virtual Microdata Laboratory – Access to Confidential Data|last = Welpton|first = Richard}}</ref> It is a secure facility within the Office for National Statistics where both government officials and academic researchers can analyse sensitive, detailed data for statistical purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/virtual-microdata-laboratory--vml-/index.html|title = Virtual Microdata Laboratory|website = Office for National Statistics}}</ref> The researchers cannot download the data or take any copies out of the laboratory and the results of the analysis is checked for statistical disclosure.

== Office locations ==
The ONS has a head office in the city of [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales, and other offices in [[Pimlico]] in London and [[Titchfield]] in Hampshire.<ref name="autogenerated1">[https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/contactus/officelocations Office for National Statistics: location maps], www.ons.gov.uk. Retrieved 22 December 2017.</ref> The [[Family Records Centre]] in Myddelton Street in [[Islington]], London, moved to the National Archives in Kew in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PageNotFound/PageNotFound.aspx?url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/stories/192.htm|title=Page Not Found – The National Archives|access-date=23 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107154806/http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PageNotFound/PageNotFound.aspx?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalarchives.gov.uk%2Fnews%2Fstories%2F192.htm|archive-date=7 January 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> They also have an Archive Storage site located in [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], Dorset.<ref>[http://governmentbuildings.co.uk/properties/view/287212 UK Government properties database], governmentbuildings.co.uk.

=== Former headquarters ===
The London (Pimlico) office was the head office until April 2006 when the corporate headquarters was moved to Newport<ref>[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.asp?MediaDetailsID=77252 ''"Newport to be ONS headquarters"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153823/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.asp?MediaDetailsID=77252 |date=30 September 2007 }}, National Statistics news release, 20 September 2004.

Since May 2011 the London office has been located on the 2nd floor of the former Drummond Gate headquarters and houses the methodology consultancy service, the virtual microdata laboratory and media briefings.<ref>[http://www.ons.gov.uk/about/newsroom/fact-sheets/ons-moves-to-new-london-office.html ''ONS moves to new London office''], ONS press release, 16 May 2011.</ref>

=== Gradual move of functions to South Wales ===
The ONS asserted that recruitment and training of quality staff in South Wales, where data collection and analysis already took place, would ensure that there was no risk to the quality of its services and that it managed the risks associated with the changes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6653771.stm ''"Stats staff 'quitting' over move"''], news report from the BBC website, 14 May 2007.</ref> However the plan to discontinue statistical activity in London proved controversial amid claims that the shift of functions from London and the closure of the London office would have serious implications for the future of certain sets of statistics. These include health statistics, National Accounts, Retail and Consumer Prices and Labour Market Statistics. These risks were stated to derive from the fact that few of the experienced staff working in these highly technical areas were expected to relocate to Newport, resulting in a substantial loss of expertise and a consequent threat to the continued quality of the statistics.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70424-0007.htm Debate on the Statistics and Registration Service Bill] in the House of Lords, 24 April 2007, Hansard, Column 597.</ref> In a submission to the Parliamentary Treasury Sub Committee, the Bank of England expressed concern over the relocation of the ONS to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], saying, that ''"the relocation programme poses serious risks to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data. If substantial numbers of ONS staff are unwilling to relocate, the loss of skilled individuals could have a severe impact on a range of statistics."''<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/other/monetary/treasurycommittee/onsperformance070509.pdf ''"Bank of England comments on recent ONS performance"''], a submission made by the Bank of England to the Treasury Sub-Committee inquiry into progress on the efficiency programme in the Chancellor's departments, May 2007.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6642897.stm ''"Bank warns on ONS move to Wales"''], news report from the BBC website, 10 May 2007.</ref> The director of ONS at the time vigorously defended the implementation of government policy on civil service relocation and the decision to concentrate staff in the three locations outside London.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d664845a-1237-11dc-b963-000b5df10621.html ''"Statistics officers get the measure of relocation"''], article by Karen Dunnell, ''Financial Times'', 4 June 2007. Retrieved 7 June 2007.</ref>

== Criticism of the ONS ==

The Office for National Statistics won the 2004 [[Big Brother Award]] for the "Most Heinous Government Organisation" from the campaigning organisation [[Privacy International]] for its [[Citizen Information Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/19/politics.idcards|title='Big Brother' scheme axed|first1=Alan|last1=Travis|first2=home affairs|last2=editor|date=18 April 2006|via=The Guardian}}</ref> The project is one of several that lead the [[Information Commissioner's Office|Information Commissioner]] to warn that there is a danger of the country "sleepwalking" into a [[mass surveillance|surveillance society]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article470264.ece ''"Beware rise of Big Brother state, warns data watchdog"''], ''The Times'', 16 August 2004.</ref>

In December 2012 the organisation's new website to provide statistics to the public was described as "a disaster" by members of parliament on the Public Administration Committee.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-20701514|title=ONS website under fire from MPs|last=Lowther|first=Ed|date=2012-12-13|access-date=2019-10-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> The chair of the UK Statistics Authority said that significant improvements to the website were being made, but admitted that its state at the time made it "difficult to use, difficult to navigate and difficult to search".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/mps_ons_website_disaster/ |title=Shiny new UK.gov stats website a 'disaster' – MPs |last=Parnell |first=Brid-Aine |work=The Register |date=13 December 2012 |access-date=21 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216110331/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/13/mps_ons_website_disaster/ |archive-date=16 February 2013 }}</ref>

In 2016, Professor Sir Charles Bean conducted an independent review of UK Economic Statistics. He notes that although there is much criticism of the ONS’s performance, particularly of the size and frequency of revisions, that this criticism is “not entirely justified”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bean|first=Charles|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507081/2904936_Bean_Review_Web_Accessible.pdf|journal=Independent Review of UK Economic Statistics|pages=4}}</ref> Following the review, the then-Chair of the [[Treasury Select Committee]], [[Andrew Tyrie]], criticised the ONS for being “out of touch”.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/08/andrew-tyrie-blasts-out-of-touch-office-for-national-statistics|title=Andrew Tyrie blasts 'out of touch' Office for National Statistics|last=Allen|first=Katie|date=2016-01-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-10-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 2019, the ONS admitted that EU migration to the UK may have been underestimated due to methodology of the Independent Passenger Survey. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49420730|title=EU migration to UK 'underestimated'|date=2019-08-21|access-date=2019-10-05|language=en-GB}}</ref>
