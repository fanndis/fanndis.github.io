==Controversy==
In June 2010 a video was filmed of a vehicle parked outside the TV station monitoring its activities. When the three occupants of the vehicle were asked what they were doing, they hid their faces and refused to answer questions. They then drove off, driving through a red light. TVi general director Mykola Kniazhytsky accused the [[Security Service of Ukraine|SBU]], Ukraine's main security agency, of carrying out this surveillance. [[Reporters Without Borders]] has condemned this as harassment.<ref>http://en.rsf.org/ukraine-tvi-under-surveillance-22-06-2010,37709.html</ref>

In April 2012, TVi accused government officials of trying to disrupt and shut down the station. This was in response to tax officials allegedly probing its businesses relationships with entrepreneurs who fund the station. On April 25, 2012, tax officials delivered letters requesting contractual and other documents at the residences of at least three entrepreneurs that relate to their business dealings with TVi. Director Kniazhytsky accused the tax officials of 'bullying', and 'behaving like thugs'.<ref>Dovgan, Kostya; Mark Rachkevych, [http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/126712/ "Tax collectors target TVi service providers"], ''kyivpost.com'', April 26, 2012.</ref> In August 2012 these charges were dropped. Assessed at that time, one report noted relative to the station's independence that it has an editorial board that includes Poland's [[Adam Michnik]] and, "[c]rucially, says ... Kniazhytsky, TVi's owner has no other business interests in Ukraine."<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2012/08/viktor-yanukovych-and-media "Viktor Yanukovych and the media: Walking the tightrope"], ''[[The Economist]]'' by G.C., August 6, 2012.
