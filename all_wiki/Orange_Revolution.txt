The '''Orange Revolution''' ({{lang-uk|Помаранчева революція, Pomarancheva revolyutsiya}}) was a series of [[protest]]s and political events that took place in [[Ukraine]] from late November 2004 to January 2005, in the immediate aftermath of the run-off vote of the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]], which was claimed to be marred by massive corruption, voter intimidation and [[electoral fraud]]. [[Kyiv]], the Ukrainian capital, was the focal point of the movement's campaign of [[civil resistance]], with thousands of protesters demonstrating daily.<ref>Andrew Wilson, "Ukraine's 'Orange Revolution' of 2004: The Paradoxes of Negotiation", in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 295–316.[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&source=gbs_navlinks_s]</ref> Nationwide,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Karatnycky|first=Adrian|date=2015-09-15|title=Ukraine's Orange Revolution|language=en-US|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2005-03-01/ukraines-orange-revolution|access-date=2020-05-28|issn=0015-7120}}</ref> the revolution was highlighted by a series of acts of [[civil disobedience]], [[sit-in]]s, and [[general strike]]s organized by the opposition movement.

The protests were prompted by reports from several domestic and foreign election monitors as well as the widespread public perception that the results of the run-off vote of 21 November 2004 between leading candidates [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were rigged by the authorities in favour of the latter.<ref name=Time>Paul Quinn-Judge, Yuri Zarakhovich, [http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,832225,00.html The Orange Revolution], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 28 November 2004</ref> The nationwide protests succeeded when the results of the original run-off were annulled, and a revote was ordered by [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukraine's Supreme Court]] for 26 December 2004. Under intense scrutiny by domestic and international observers, the second run-off was declared to be "free and fair". The final results showed a clear victory for Yushchenko, who received about 52% of the vote, compared to Yanukovych's 44%. Yushchenko was declared the official winner and with his inauguration on 23 January 2005 in Kyiv, the Orange Revolution ended.

In the following years, the Orange Revolution had a negative connotation among pro-government circles in [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]].<ref name=MTimes/><ref name="some of our opposition members were in Ukraine"/><ref name="Taras Kuzio:Ukraine is Not Russia">[http://www.taraskuzio.net%2FInternational%2520Relations_files%2FRussiaUkraineYouth.pdf Ukraine is Not Russia:Comparing Youth Political Activism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516205928/http://www.taraskuzio.net/International%20Relations_files/RussiaUkraineYouth.pdf |date=16 May 2014 }} by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2006<br />{{in lang|ru}} [http://vz.ru/politics/2013/1/25/617482.html «В оранжевых и радужных трусах» ''In orange and red shorts''], [[Vzglyad (newspaper)|Vzglyad]] (25 January 2013)</ref><ref name=LGBTNilov/>

Unlike the bloodless Orange Revolution, these protests resulted in more than 100 deaths, occurring mostly between 18 and 20 February 2014.

==Background==

===Gongadze assassination/Kuchmagate crisis===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
[[Georgiy Gongadze]], a Ukrainian journalist and the founder of ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' (an Internet newspaper well known for publicising the corruption or unethical conduct of Ukrainian politicians) was kidnapped and murdered in 2000. Though no-one accused [[Ukrainian President]] [[Kuchma]] of personally murdering him, persistent rumours suggested that the President had ordered the killing. This murder sparked a movement against Kuchma in 2000 that can be seen as the origin of the Orange Revolution in 2004. After two terms of presidency (1994-2005) and the [[Cassette Scandal]] of 2000 that ruined his image irreparably, Kuchma decided not to run for a third term in the 2004 elections and instead supported [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] in the presidential race against [[Viktor Yushchenko]] of the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]].

===Causes of the Orange Revolution===
The state of Ukraine during the 2004 presidential election is considered an "ideal condition" for an outburst from the public. During this time Ukrainians were impatient while waiting for the economic and political transformation.<ref name=ORCauses1>[http://www.ukrainianstudies.uottawa.ca/ukraine_list/ukl346_13.html Ukraine's Orange Revolution: Causes and Consequences] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[University of Ottawa]] (28 April 2005)</ref> The results of the election were thought to be fraudulent and considered "a nail in the coffin" of the preceding events.

=== Factors enabling the Orange Revolution ===
The Ukrainian regime that was in power before the Orange Revolution created a path for a democratic society to emerge. It was based on a "competitive authoritarian regime" that is considered a "[[hybrid regime]]", allowing for a democracy and market economy to come to life. The election fraud emphasised the Ukrainian citizens' desire for a more pluralistic type of government.

The [[Cassette Scandal]] sparked the public's desire to create a social reform movement. It not only undermined the peoples' respect for Kuchma as a president, but also for the elite ruling class in general. Because of Kuchma's scandalous behaviour, he lost many of his supporters with high ranking government positions. Many of the government officials who were on his side went on to fully support the election campaign of Yushchenko and well as his ideas in general.

After a clear lack of faith in the government had been instilled in the Ukrainian population, Yushchenko's role had never been more important to the revolution. Yushchenko was a charismatic candidate who showed no signs of being corrupt. Yuschenko was on the same level as his constituents and presented his ideas in a "non-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]" way. Young Ukrainian voters were extremely important to the outcome of the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 Presidential election.]] This new wave of younger people had different views of the main figures in Ukraine. They were exposed to a lot of negativity from the Kuchmagate and therefore had very skewed visions about Kuchma and his ability to lead their country.

The abundance of younger people who participated showed an increasing sense of [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalism]] that was developing in the country. The Orange Revolution had enough popular impact that it interested people of all ages.<ref>BBC News.

=== Political alliances ===
In late 2002, [[Viktor Yushchenko]] ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]), [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] ([[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]) issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine". The communists left the alliance: Symonenko opposed the idea of a single candidate from the alliance in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election of 2004]]; but the other three parties remained allies<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&pg=PA117&dq=Tymoshenko+Moroz+Presidential+candidate+2004&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Tymoshenko%20Moroz%20Presidential%20candidate%202004&f=false Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], M.E.

On 2 July 2004 Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the ''Force of the People'', a coalition which aimed to stop "the destructive process that has, as a result of the [[incumbent]] authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine" - at the time [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] and [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] were the "incumbent authorities" in Ukraine. The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko won the October 2004 presidential election.<ref name=CarnIP>[https://books.google.com/books?id=X0PAQrsx-6YC&pg=PA34&dq=Force+of+the+people+Tymoshenko&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Force%20of%20the%20people&f=false Revolution in Orange: The Origins of Ukraine's Democratic Breakthrough] by [[Anders Aslund]] and [[Michael A. McFaul]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-87003-221-9}}</ref>

=== Ukraine Presidential Election campaign 2004 ===
The 2004 presidential election in Ukraine eventually featured two main candidates:

* sitting Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, largely supported by Leonid Kuchma (the outgoing President of Ukraine who had already served two terms in office from 1994 and was precluded from running himself due to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|constitutional]] [[term limits]])
* the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] candidate Viktor Yushchenko, leader of the Our Ukraine faction in the [[Ukrainian parliament]] and a former Prime Minister (in office 1999–2001)

The election took place in a highly charged atmosphere, with the Yanukovych team and the outgoing president's administration using their control of the government and state apparatus for intimidation of Yushchenko and his supporters. In September 2004 Yushchenko suffered [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] poisoning under mysterious circumstances. While he survived and returned to the campaign trail, the poisoning undermined his health and altered his appearance dramatically (his face remains disfigured by the consequences {{as of | 2017 | alt = to this day}}).

The two main candidates were neck and neck in the first-round vote held on 31 October 2004, winning 39.32% (Yanukovych) and 39.87% (Yushchenko) of the votes cast. The candidates who came third and fourth collected much less: [[Oleksandr Moroz]] of the [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] and [[Petro Symonenko]] of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] received 5.82% and 4.97%, respectively. Since no candidate had won more than 50% of the cast ballots, Ukrainian law mandated a [[Two-round system|run-off vote]] between two leading candidates. After the announcement of the run-off, [[Oleksandr Moroz]] threw his support behind [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. The Progressive Socialist Party's [[Natalia Vitrenko]], who won 1.53% of the vote, endorsed Yanukovych, who hoped for Petro Simonenko's endorsement but did not receive it.<ref>Ukrainiустафа Найем, "[http://focus.in.ua/Default.aspx?p=article&id=11201 С Президентом на «вы»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312065037/http://focus.in.ua/Default.aspx?p=article&id=11201 |date=12 March 2008 }}", ''Фокус'', 2 April 2007, №13</ref>

In the wake of the first round of the election, many complaints emerged regarding voting irregularities in favour of the government-supported Yanukovych. However, as it was clear that neither nominee was close enough to collecting an outright majority in the first round, challenging the initial result would not have affected the final outcome of the round. So the complaints were not actively pursued and both candidates concentrated on the upcoming run-off, scheduled for 21 November.

[[Pora!]] activists were arrested in October 2004, but the release of many (reportedly on President Kuchma's personal order) gave growing confidence to the opposition.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&pg=PA345&dq=Pinchuk+Akhmetov&hl=nl&ei=Tx-yS-DdHsnb-Qa08dy2Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Pinchuk%20Akhmetov&f=false Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present] edited by Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash, [[Oxford University Press]], 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}} (page 345)
</ref>

Yushchenko's supporters originally adopted [[Orange (colour)|orange]] as the signifying colour of his election campaign. Later, the colour gave its name to an entire series of political labels, such as ''the Oranges'' (''Pomaranchevi'' in Ukrainian) for his political camp and its supporters. At the time when the mass protests grew, and especially when they brought about political change in the country, the term ''Orange Revolution'' came to represent the entire series of events.

In view of the success of using colour as a symbol to mobilise supporters, the Yanukovych camp chose [[blue]] for themselves.

==Protests==
[[File:Militsiya and orange flowers, Kiev.jpg|right|thumb|Protest during the Orange Revolution]]
{{History of Ukraine}}
Protests began on the eve of the second round of voting, as the official count differed markedly from [[exit poll]] results which gave Yushchenko up to an 11% lead, while official results gave the election win to Yanukovych by 3%. While Yanukovych supporters have claimed that Yushchenko's connections to the Ukrainian [[News media|media]] explain this disparity, the Yushchenko team publicised evidence of many incidents of [[electoral fraud]] in favour of the government-backed Yanukovych, witnessed by many local and foreign observers. These accusations were reinforced by similar allegations, though at a lesser scale, during the first presidential run of 31 October. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The Yushchenko campaign publicly called for protest on the dawn of election day, 21 November 2004, when allegations of fraud began to spread in the form of leaflets printed and distributed by the 'Democratic Initiatives' foundation, announcing that Yushchenko had won – on the basis of its exit poll.<ref name=ORRNC/> Beginning on 22 November 2004,<ref name="BBC"/> massive protests{{#tag:ref|On 6 November 2013 [[Pora!]] had organised the first tent camp in [[Kyiv]].<ref name=APOR1609>[https://www.academia.edu/218897/Ukraine_2004_Informal_Networks_Transformation_of_Social_Capital_and_Coloured_Revolutions Ukraine 2004: Informal Networks, Transformation of Social Capital and Coloured Revolutions] by Abel Polese, [[Routledge]] (1 June 2009)</ref>||group=nb}} started in cities across Ukraine:<ref name="BBC"/> the largest, in Kyiv's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] ''(Independence Square)'', attracted an estimated 500,000 participants,<ref name=NYT20041126>Veronica Khokhlova, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482  New Kids On the Bloc], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 26 November 2004</ref> who on 23 November 2004, peacefully marched in front of the headquarters of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Ukrainian parliament, many wearing orange or carrying orange flags, the colour of Yushchenko's campaign coalition. One of the most prominent activists of that time was [[Paraska Korolyuk]], subsequently bestowed with the [[Order of Princess Olga]]. From 22 November [[Pora!]] undertook the management of the protests in Kyiv until the end of the demonstration.<ref name=APOR1609/>

The local councils in [[Kyiv]], [[Lviv]],<ref>Kamil Tchorek, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article395652.ece Protest grows in western city], ''[[The Times]]'', 26 November 2004</ref> and several other cities passed, with the wide popular support of their constituency, a largely symbolic refusal to accept the legitimacy of the official election results, and Yushchenko took a symbolic [[Oath of office|presidential oath]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4198957.stm Yushchenko takes reins in Ukraine].  BBC NEWS. 23 January 2005. URL Retrieved 17 November 2006</ref> This "oath" taken by Yushchenko in half-empty parliament chambers, lacking the [[quorum]] as only the Yushchenko-leaning [[Political faction|factions]] were present, could not have any legal effect. But it was an important symbolic gesture meant to demonstrate the resolve of the Yushchenko campaign not to accept the compromised election results. In response, Yushchenko's opponents denounced him for taking an illegitimate oath, and even some of his moderate supporters were ambivalent about this act, while a more radical side of the Yushchenko camp demanded him to act even more decisively. Some observers argued that this symbolic presidential oath might have been useful to the Yushchenko camp should events have taken a more confrontational route.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In such a scenario, this "presidential oath" Yushchenko took could be used to lend legitimacy to the claim that he, rather than his rival who tried to gain the presidency through alleged fraud, was a true [[commander-in-chief]] authorised to give orders to the military and security agencies.

At the same time, local officials in Eastern and Southern Ukraine, the stronghold of [[Viktor Yanukovych]], started a series of actions alluding to the possibility of the breakup of Ukraine or an extra-constitutional [[federalisation]] of the country, should their candidate's claimed victory not be recognised. Demonstrations of public support for Yanukovych were held throughout Eastern Ukraine and some of his supporters arrived in Kyiv. In Kyiv the pro-Yanukovych demonstrators were far outnumbered by Yushchenko supporters, whose ranks were continuously swelled by new arrivals from many regions of Ukraine. The scale of the demonstrations in Kyiv was unprecedented. By many estimates, on some days they drew up to one million people to the streets, in freezing weather.<ref>USAID Report [http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance/publications/pdfs/democracy_rising.pdf Democracy Rising (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301173926/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance/publications/pdfs/democracy_rising.pdf |date=1 March 2006 }}</ref>

In total 18.4% of Ukrainians have claimed to have taken part in the Orange Revolution (across Ukraine).<ref name=ORRNC/>

==Political developments==
{{Politics of Ukraine}}
Although Yushchenko entered into negotiations with outgoing President [[Leonid Kuchma]] in an effort to peacefully resolve the situation, the negotiations broke up on 24 November 2004. Yanukovych was officially certified as the victor by the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]], which itself was allegedly involved in falsification of electoral results by withholding the information it was receiving from local districts and running a parallel illegal computer server to manipulate the results. The next morning after the certification took place, Yushchenko spoke to supporters in Kyiv, urging them to begin a series of mass protests, general strikes and sit-ins with the intent of crippling the government and forcing it to concede defeat.

In view of the threat of illegitimate government acceding to power, Yushchenko's camp announced the creation of the ''Committee of National Salvation'' which declared a nationwide political strike.

On 1 December 2004, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] passed a resolution that strongly condemned pro-[[separatist]] and [[federalisation]] actions, and passed a [[non-confidence vote]] in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]], a decision Prime Minister Yanukovych refused to recognise. By the [[Constitution of Ukraine]], the non-confidence vote mandated the government's resignation, but the parliament had no means to enforce a resignation without the co-operation of Prime Minister Yanukovych and outgoing President Kuchma.

On 3 December 2004, [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Ukraine's Supreme Court]] finally broke the political deadlock. The court decided that due to the scale of the electoral fraud it became impossible to establish the election results. Therefore, it invalidated the official results that would have given Yanukovych the presidency. As a resolution, the court ordered a revote of the run-off to be held on 26 December 2004.<ref name=Supr>Supreme Court of Ukraine decision regarding the annulment of 21 November vote. [http://www.skubi.net/ukraine/findings.html Full text in Ukrainian] and [http://www.skubi.net/ukraine/findings.html Summary in English]</ref> This decision was seen as a victory for the Yushchenko camp while Yanukovych and his supporters favoured a rerun of the entire election rather than just the run-off, as a second-best option if Yanukovych was not awarded the presidency. On 8 December 2004 the parliament amended laws to provide a legal framework for the new round of elections. The parliament also approved the changes to the [[Constitution of Ukraine|Constitution]], implementing a political reform backed by outgoing President Kuchma as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities and opposition.

In November 2009 Yanukovych stated that although his victory in the elections was "taken away", he gave up this victory in order to avoid bloodshed. "I didn't want mothers to lose their children and wives their husbands. I didn't want dead bodies from [[Kyiv]] to flow down the [[Dnieper River|Dnipro]]. I didn't want to assume power through bloodshed."<ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/26340/ Yanukovych says presidential election scenario of 2004 won't be repeated in 2010], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 November 2009)</ref>

===Re-run election===
The 26 December revote was held under intense scrutiny of local and international observers. The preliminary results, announced by the [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine|Central Election Commission]] on 28 December, gave Yushchenko and Yanukovych 51.99% and 44.20% of the total vote which represented a change in the vote by +5.39% to Yushchenko and −5.27% from Yanukovych respectively when compared to the November poll.<ref>"Results of Voting in Ukraine Presidential Elections 2004", [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vp2004/wp0011e Central Election Commission of Ukraine].

==Role of Ukrainian intelligence and security agencies==
According to one version of events recounted by ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref name=NYTSBU>C. J. Chivers, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0913FF395C0C748DDDA80894DD404482 BACK CHANNELS: A Crackdown Averted; How Top Spies in Ukraine Changed the Nation's Path], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 January 2005.</ref> Ukrainian security agencies played an unusual role in the Orange Revolution, with a [[KGB]] successor agency in the former Soviet state providing qualified support to the political opposition. As per the paper report, on 28 November 2004 over 10,000 [[MVS (Ukraine)|MVS]] (Internal Ministry) troops were mobilised to put down the protests in Independence Square in Kyiv by the order of their commander, Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov.<ref>For question on ultimate source of orders and mobilisation details see Lehrke, Jesse Paul. ''The Transition to National Armies in the Former Soviet Republics, 1988–2005''. Oxfordshire, UK: Routledge (2013), 188–89.</ref>  The SBU ([[Security Service of Ukraine]], a successor to the KGB in Ukraine) warned opposition leaders of the crackdown. Oleksander Galaka, head of GUR (military intelligence) made calls to "prevent bloodshed". Col. Gen. Ihor Smeshko (SBU chief) and Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko (military counter-intelligence chief) both claimed to have warned Popkov to pull back his troops, which he did, preventing bloodshed.

In addition to the desire to avoid bloodshed, the ''New York Times'' article suggests that ''[[silovik]]i'', as the security officers are often called in the countries of the [[former Soviet Union]], were motivated by personal aversion to the possibility of having to serve President Yanukovych, who was in his youth convicted of robbery and assault and had alleged connection with [[political corruption|corrupt]] businessmen, especially if he were to ascend to the presidency by fraud.  The personal feelings of Gen. Smeshko towards Yanukovych may also have played a role. Additional evidence of Yushchenko's popularity and at least partial support among the SBU officers is shown by the fact that several embarrassing proofs of electoral fraud, including incriminating [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] recordings of conversations among the Yanukovych campaign and government officials discussing how to rig the election, were provided to the Yushchenko camp.<ref name=wiretap>{{cite web |url=http://www2.pravda.com.ua/en/archive/2004/november/24/4.shtml |title=How Yanukovych Forged the Elections.

According to Abel Polese, Kuchma was concerned about its reputation in the [[Western world|West]]; because of lack of [[natural resources in Ukraine|natural resources]] to finance his regime he had to show a commitment to democracy in order to be targeted for Western financial assistance.<ref name=APOR291011>[https://www.academia.edu/1068864/Russia_the_US_the_Others_and_the_101_Things_to_Do_to_Win_a_Colour_Revolution_Reflections_on_Georgia_and_Ukraine Russia, the US, “the Others” and the “101 Things to Do to Win a (Colour)Revolution”: Reflections on Georgia and Ukraine] by Abel Polese, [[Routledge]] (26 October 2011)</ref>

==Internet usage==
Throughout the demonstrations, [[Internet in Ukraine|Ukraine's emerging Internet]] usage (facilitated by news sites which began to disseminate the [[Kuchma tapes]]) was an integral part of the orange revolutionary process. It has even been suggested that the Orange Revolution was the first example of an Internet-organised mass protest.<ref>McFaul, Michael. "Transitions from Postcommunism." [[Journal of Democracy]] 16, no. 3 (2005): p. 12.</ref>  Analysts believe that the Internet and mobile phones allowed an alternative media to flourish that was not subject to self-censorship or overt control by President Kuchma and his allies and pro-democracy activists (such as [[Pora!]]) were able to use mobile phones and the Internet to coordinate election monitoring and mass protests.<ref>Goldstein, Joshua.

==2004 Ukrainian constitutional changes==
{{Update section|date=December 2015}}

As part of the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainian constitution was changed to shift powers from the presidency to the parliament. This was [[Oleksandr Moroz]]'s price for his decisive role in winning Yushchenko the presidency. The Communists also supported these measures. These came into effect in 2006 during which Yanukovych's Party of Regions won the parliamentary election, creating a coalition government with the Socialists and the Communists under his leadership. As a result, President Viktor Yushchenko had to deal with a powerful Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych who had control of many important portfolios. His premiership ended in late 2007 after Yushchenko had succeeded in his months-long attempt to dissolve parliament. After the election, Yanukovych's party again was the largest, but Tymoshenko's finished far ahead of Yushchenko's for second place. The Orange parties won a very narrow majority, permitting a new government under Tymoshenko, but Yushchenko's political decline continued to his poor showing in the 2010 presidential election.

On 1 October 2010, the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine]] overturned the 2004 amendments, considering them unconstitutional.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/84619/ Update: Return to 1996 Constitution strengthens president, raises legal questions], [[Kyiv Post]] (1 October 2010)</ref>

==2010 presidential election==
A Circuit administrative court in Kyiv forbade mass actions at [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] from 9 January 2010 to 5 February 2010. The [[Kyiv mayor|Mayor]]'s office had requested this in order to avoid "nonstandard situations" during the aftermath of the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|2010 presidential election]]. Apparently (in particular) the [[Party of Regions]], [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] and [[All-Ukrainian Union "Freedom"|Svoboda]] had applied for a permit to demonstrate there.<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-356613.html Court forbade Maydan after first tour of election], [[UNIAN]] (13 January 2010)</ref> Incumbent President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] got 5,5% of votes during the election.<ref>{{in lang|uk}}[http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vp2010/wp320pt00_t001f01=700pt001f01=700pplace=1.html Central Election Commission Candidate Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121012542/http://www.cvk.gov.ua/vp2010/wp320pt00_t001f01%3D700pt001f01%3D700pplace%3D1.html |date=21 January 2010 }}, [[CEC Ukraine]] (19 January 2010)</ref>

Farewell to the Orange Revolution], EuropaRussia (19 January 2010)</ref> According to him, this is one of the great achievements of the Orange Revolution.

A 2007 research revealed that opinion about the nature of the Orange Revolution had barely shifted since 2004 and that the attitudes about it in the country remained divided along the same largely geographical lines that it had been at the time of the revolution ([[West Ukraine|West]] and [[Central Ukraine]] being more positive about the events and [[South Ukraine|South]] and [[Eastern Ukraine]] more cynical (seniors also)).<ref name=ORRNC/> This research (also) showed that Ukrainians in total had a less positive view on the Orange Revolution in 2007 than they had in 2005.<ref name=ORRNC/> It has been suggested that since the Orange Revolution was impactful enough to interest people of all ages it increased the overall unity of Ukraine.{{Original research inline|date=December 2012}}
