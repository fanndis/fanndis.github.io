[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the [[official language]] of the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]] from the beginning of [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish rule]] in the late 16th century, through the conclusion of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 and remained co-official, along with English, until 1987. It was at first removed in 1973 by a constitutional change, but after a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, with the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] re-designating it instead as an "optional and voluntary language".<ref name="official languages" /><ref name="voluntary and optional" />

It was the language of the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the country's first official language, as proclaimed in the [[Malolos Constitution]] of the [[First Philippine Republic]] in 1899. It was the language of commerce, law, politics and the arts during the colonial period and well into the 20th century. It was the main language of many classical writers and [[Ilustrados]] such as [[Jose Rizal]], [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Antonio Luna]] and [[Marcelo del Pilar]]. It is regulated by the [[Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language|Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española]], the main Spanish-language regulating body in the Philippines, and a member of the [[Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española]], the entity which regulates the Spanish language worldwide.

Spanish remained an official language of government until a new constitution ratified on January 17, 1973 designated English and [[Filipino language|Pilipino]], spelled in that draft of the constitution with a "P" instead of the more modern "F", as official languages. Shortly thereafter, Presidential Proclamation No. 155 dated March 15, 1973 ordered that the Spanish language should continue to be recognized as an official language so long as government documents in that language remained untranslated.

==History==

===Spanish colonial period===

Spanish was the language of government, education and trade throughout the three centuries (333 years) of the Philippines being part of the [[Spanish Empire]] and continued to serve as a [[lingua franca]] until the first half of the 20th century. It was first introduced to the Philippines in 1565, when the conquistador [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] founded the first Spanish settlement on the island of [[Cebu Island|Cebú]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|pp=7–11}}</ref> The Philippines, ruled first from [[Mexico City]] and later from [[Madrid]], was a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish territory]] for 333 years (1565–1898).<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|pp=80, 212}}</ref> Schooling was a priority, however. The [[Augustinians]] opened a school immediately upon arriving in Cebú in 1565. The [[Franciscan]]s followed suit when they arrived in 1577, as did the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] when they arrived in 1587. Besides religious instruction, these schools taught how to read and write and imparted industrial and agricultural techniques.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=50}}</ref>

Initially, the stance of the Roman Catholic Church and its [[missionary|missionaries]] was to preach to the natives in local languages, not in Spanish. The priests learned the native languages and sometimes employed indigenous peoples as [[translator]]s, creating a bilingual class known as Ladinos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |title=Language and Desire in Hiligaynon|work=[http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers.html Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics] |first=Corazón |last=Villareal |date=January 17–20, 2006 |location=Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines |page=9 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111134034/http://www.sil.org/asia/philippines/ical/papers/Villareal-Hiligaynon_lang_desire.pdf |archive-date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2010 |quote=But the real authors were really the Ladinos, natives from the Philippine who were the informants, translators, or even better, consultants of the missionaries.}}</ref> Before the 19th century, few natives were taught Spanish. However, there were notable bilingual individuals such as poet-translator [[Gaspar Aquino de Belén]]. Gaspar produced Christian devotional poetry written in the Roman script in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. ''[[Pasyon]]'' is a narrative of the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ begun by Gaspar Aquino de Belén, which has circulated in many versions. Later, the Spanish-Mexican ballads of chivalry, the [[corrido]], provided a model for secular literature. Verse narratives, or komedya, were performed in the [[Philippine languages|regional languages]] for the illiterate majority.

In the early 17th century, a Tagalog-Chinese printer, Tomás Pinpin, set out to write a book in romanized phonetic script to teach the Tagalogs how to learn [[names given to the Spanish language|Castilian]]. His book, published by the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] press in which he worked, appeared in 1610, the same year as Blancas's ''Arte''. Unlike the missionary's grammar, which Pinpin had set in type, the Tagalog native's book dealt with the language of the dominant, rather than the subordinate, other. Pinpin's book was the first such work ever written and published by a Philippine native. As such, it is richly instructive for what it tells us about the interests that animated Tagalog translation and, by implication, conversion during the early colonial period.

[[Image:La Illustracion Filipina (1892).jpg|thumb|left|[[Juan Luna]] featured on the cover of a Philippine periodical in Spanish]]
By law, each town had to build two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, to teach the Spanish language and the [[catechism|Christian catechism]]. There were never enough trained teachers, however, and several provincial schools were mere sheds open to the rain. That discouraged the attendance at school, and illiteracy was high in the provinces until the 19th century, when public education was introduced. The conditions were better in larger towns. To qualify as an independent civil town, a [[barrio]] or group of barrios had to have a priest's residence, a town hall, boys' and girls' schools; streets had to be straight and at right angles to one another so that the town could grow in size; and the town had to be near a good water source and land for farming and grazing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arcilla|1994|p=48}}</ref>

Better school conditions in towns and cities led to more effective instruction in the Spanish language and in other subjects. Between 1600 and 1865, a number of colleges and universities were established, which graduated many important colonial officials and church prelates, bishops, and archbishops, several of whom served the churches in [[Hispanic America]]. The increased level of education eventually led to the rise of the [[Ilustrados]]. In 1846, French traveler [[Jean Baptiste Mallat]] was surprised at how advanced Philippine schools were.<ref name=Arcilla1994p50 /> In 1865, the government inaugurated the Escuela Normal (''Normal School'', later [[Philippine Normal University]]), an institute to train future primary school teachers. At the same time, primary schooling was made compulsory for all children. In 1869, a new Spanish constitution brought to the Philippines universal suffrage and a free press.<ref>{{cite web | last = Beck | first = Sanderson | title =Summary and Evaluation | url=http://www.san.beck.org/21-Summary.html#a6 | accessdate = June 29, 2010}}</ref> ''El Boletín de Cebú'', the first Spanish newspaper in [[Cebu City]], was published in 1886.<ref>{{cite web | title =Newspaper | url =http://www.ngkhai.com/pointcebu/culture/newspaper.htm | accessdate =June 29, 2010 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100626005846/http://www.ngkhai.com/pointcebu/culture/newspaper.htm | archive-date =June 26, 2010 | url-status =dead }}</ref>

In Manila, the Spanish language had been more or less widespread to the point that it has been estimated at around 50% of the population knew Spanish in the late 19th century.<ref name="Rodríguez-Ponga">{{Harvnb|Rodríguez-Ponga}}</ref> In his 1898 book "Yesterdays in the Philippines", covering a period beginning in 1893, the American [[Joseph Earle Stevens]], an American who resided in Manila from 1893 to 1894, wrote:
{{quote|
Spanish, of course, is the court and commercial language and, except among the uneducated native who have a lingua of their own or among the few members of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] colony, it has a monopoly everywhere.

}}

Long contact between Spanish and the local languages, Chinese dialects, and later Japanese produced a series of pidgins, known as ''Bamboo Spanish'', and the Spanish-based creole [[Chavacano]].  At one point, they were the language of a substantial proportion of the Philippine population.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penny|Penny|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjcrhyQlFa0C&pg=PA29 29–30]}}</ref>  Unsurprisingly, since the Philippines was administrated for centuries from [[New Spain]] in present-day [[Mexico]], Philippine Spanish is broadly similar to [[Spanish language in the United States|American Spanish]] not only in vocabulary but also in pronunciation and grammar.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penny|Penny|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjcrhyQlFa0C&pg=PA30 30]}}</ref>

The Spanish language was the official language used by the civil and judicial administration, and it was spoken by the majority of the population in the main cities and understood by many, especially after the passing of the Education Decree of 1863. By the end of the 19th century, Spanish was either a mother tongue or a strong second language among the educated in Philippine society, having been learned in childhood either directly from parents and grandparents or in school, or through tutoring.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul A.

====Schools====
{{Main|Philippine education during Spanish rule}}

In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the oldest educational institutions in the country were set up by Spanish religious orders. The schools and universities played a crucial role in the development of the Spanish language in the islands. Colegio de Manila in [[Intramuros]] was founded in 1590. The Colegio formally opened in 1595, and was one of the first schools in the Philippines.<ref name="ateneo">{{cite web | title =The First Hundred Years Of The Ateneo de Manila | url =http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=348 | accessdate =June 29, 2010 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20120915093428/http://ateneo.edu/index.php?p=348 | archive-date =September 15, 2012 | url-status =dead}}</ref> In the same year, the [[University of San Carlos]] in Cebú, was established as the Colegio de San Ildefonso by the Jesuits. In 1611, the [[University of Santo Tomás]], considered as the oldest existing university in Asia, was inaugurated in Manila by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. In the 18th century, fluent male Spanish-speakers in the Philippines were generally the graduates of those schools or of the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letrán]], established in 1620. In 1706, a convent school for Philippine women, Beaterios, was established. It admitted both Spanish and native girls, and taught religion, reading, writing and arithmetic with music and embroidery. Female graduates from Beaterios were fluent in Spanish as well. In 1859, [[Ateneo de Manila University]] was established by the [[Jesuits]] as the Escuela Municipal.<ref name="ateneo"/>

In 1863, Queen [[Isabel II of Spain]] decreed the establishment of a [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system, following the requests of the islands' Spanish authorities, who saw the need of teaching Spanish to the wider population. The primary instruction and the teaching of Spanish was compulsory. The Educational Decree provided for the establishment of at least one primary school for boys and girls in each town and governed by the municipal government. A Normal School for male teachers was established and was supervised by the Jesuits.<ref>{{cite web  | title =Historical Perspective of the Philippine Educational System  | url =http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | accessdate =June 29, 2010  | url-status =dead  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160809/http://www.deped.gov.ph/about_deped/history.asp  | archive-date =July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = EDUCATION | url=http://countrystudies.us/philippines/53.htm | accessdate = June 29, 2010}}</ref> In 1866, the total population of the Philippines was only 4,411,261.

That class of writers, poets and intellectuals is often referred to as ''[[Ilustrados]]''. Ironically, it was during the initial years of American occupation in the early 20th century that Spanish literature and press flourished, the result both of a majority of Spanish-speaking population as well as the partial freedom of the press that the American rulers allowed.

Before the 19th century, [[Philippine revolts against Spain|Philippine revolts]] were small-scale. Since they did not extend beyond linguistic boundaries, they were easily neutralized by Spanish forces.<ref name=firstfilipino>{{Harvnb|Guerrero|1987}}</ref> With the small period of the spread of Spanish through a free public school system (1863) and the rise of an educated class, nationalists from different parts of the archipelago were able to communicate in a [[lingua franca|common language]]. José Rizal's novels, [[Graciano López Jaena]]'s satirical articles, [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]]'s anti-clerical manifestos, the bi-weekly ''[[La Solidaridad]]'', which was published in Spain, and other materials in awakening nationalism were written in Spanish. The [[Philippine Revolution]] fought for reforms and later for independence from Spain. However, it opposed neither Spain's [[Spanish influence on Filipino culture|cultural legacy]] in the islands nor the Spanish language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=GVH200900002&query=la%20solidaridad&page=220# |title=La Solidaridad : Our purposes |first=Graciano |last=López Jaena |date=February 15, 1889 |publisher=La Solidaridad |location=Barcelona, Spain |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.filipiniana.net%2FArtifactView.do%3FartifactID%3DGVH200900002%26query%3Dla%2520solidaridad%26page%3D220%23&date=2010-07-13 |archive-date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreeman.com/opinion/index.php?fullstory=1&issue=articles_20040627&id=19361 |title=The teaching of Spanish in the Philippines |first=Marcelo |last=del Pilar |date=February 15, 1889 |publisher=La Solidaridad |location=Barcelona, Spain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820180839/http://www.thefreeman.com/opinion/index.php?fullstory=1&issue=articles_20040627&id=19361 |archive-date=August 20, 2006 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=GVH200900006&query=la%20solidaridad&page=62# |title=The aspirations of the Filipinos|first=Marcelo H.|last=del Pilar|date=April 25, 1889|publisher=La Solidaridad |location=Barcelona, Spain |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.filipiniana.net%2FArtifactView.do%3FartifactID%3DGVH200900006%26query%3Dla%2520solidaridad%26page%3D62&date=2010-07-13 |archive-date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> Even Graciano López Jaena's ''La Solidaridad, an 1889 article that praised the young women of [[Malolos]] who petitioned to [[Governor-General of the Philippines#Spanish Colonial Government (1764–1898)|Governor-General]] [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rubí|Valeriano Weyler]] to open a night school to teach the Spanish language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=GVH201000017&query=La%20Solidaridad&page=234# |title=Congratulations to the young women of Malolos |first=Graciano |last=López Jaena |date=February 15, 1889 |publisher=La Solidaridad |location=Barcelona, Spain|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.filipiniana.net%2FArtifactView.do%3FartifactID%3DGVH201000017%26query%3DLa%2520Solidaridad%26page%3D234%23&date=2010-07-13 |archive-date= July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> In fact, the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] of 1899 chose Spanish as the official language.

[[File:la-solidaridad2.jpg|thumb|[[Propaganda]] in Spanish]]
Spanish was used by the first Filipino patriots like [[José Rizal]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. The 1896 Biak-na-Bato Constitution and the 1898 Malolos Constitution were both written in Spanish. Neither specified a national language, but both recognised the continuing use of Spanish in Philippine life and legislation.<ref name=1897and1899 /><ref name=andrewgonzalez>{{cite journal|url=http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114194404/http://www.multilingual-matters.net/jmmd/019/0487/jmmd0190487.pdf|archive-date=January 14, 2009|last=Gonzalez|first=Andrew|journal=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|title=The Language Planning Situation in the Philippines|year=1998|volume=19|issue=5&6|page=513|doi=10.1080/01434639808666365}}</ref> Aguinaldo was more comfortable speaking Tagalog.<ref>{{harvnb|Gonzalez|1998|p=521}} (Note 7)</ref> Spanish was used to write the [[Constitution of Biak-na-Bato]], [[Malolos Constitution]], the original [[national anthem]], ''Himno Nacional Filipino'', as well as nationalistic propaganda material and literature.

The country's first two constitutions and historic novels were written in Spanish. While widely understood by the majority of the population, Spanish was the unifying language since Tagalog was not as prominent or ubiquitous as it is today, and each region had its own culture and language and would rather speak in their local languages. Before the spread of Filipino nationalism, the natives of each region still thought of themselves as [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]], [[Waray people|Waray]], [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] etc., not as Filipinos.

The term "Filipino" originally referred to the natives of the Philippines themselves. It was Pedro Chirino, a Spanish Jesuit, who first called the natives ''Filipinos'' in his book ''Relación de las Islas Filipinas'' (Rome, 1604). However, during their 333-year rule of the Philippines, the Spanish rulers preferred to call the natives ''Indios''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonroyeca.blogspot.com/2012/11/sino-ang-mga-orihinal-na-pilipino.html|title=Jon E. Royeca|author=Jon E. Royeca|work=jonroyeca.blogspot.com|year=2012}}</ref>

Also during the colonial era, the Spaniards born in the Philippines, who were more known as "insulares", "criollos," or "Creoles," were also called "Filipinos." Spaniards born in Spain or mainland Spaniards residing in the Philippines were referred to as "[[peninsulares]]". Peoples born in Spanish America or in the North American continent of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] who were residing in the Philippines were collectively referred to as "[[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Americanos]]." The Catholic [[Austronesian peoples]] of the Philippines were referred to as "[[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Indios]]" and those who practiced the [[Islamic faith]] were called "[[Moro people|Moros]]". The indigenous [[Aeta peoples|Aetas]] were referred to as "[[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Negritos]]". [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] settlers were called "[[Sangley|Sangleyes]]."  "[[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|Japanese settlers]] were called "Japoneses]]." Those of mixed ancestry were referred to as "[[Filipino mestizo#Colonial caste system|Mestizos]]" or "[[Tornatrás]]." In the 1800s, the term "Filipino" gradually became synonymous to anyone born in the Philippines, regardless of ethnicity, by an effort of the "[[Criollo people|Insulares]]" from whom [[Filipino nationalism]] began.

In 1863, the Spanish language was taught freely when a primary public school system was set up for the entire population. The Spanish-speaking [[Ilustrados]] (Enlightened Ones), which included the Insulares, the Indios, the Mestizos, the Tornatrás etc., were the educated elite who promoted and propagated nationalism and a modern Filipino consciousness. The Ilustrados and later writers formed the basis of [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Philippine Classical Literature]], which developed in the 19th century.

José Rizal propagated Filipino consciousness and identity in Spanish. Highly instrumental in developing nationalism were his novels, ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' which exposed the abuses of the colonial government and clergy, composed of "Peninsulares." The novels' very own notoriety propelled its popularity even more among Filipinos. Reading them was forbidden because they exposed and parodied the Peninsulares.

The revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic|Malolos Republic]] of 1899 designated the Spanish language for official use in its [[Malolos Constitution|constitution]], drawn up during the Constitutional Convention in [[Malolos]], [[Bulacan]].<ref name=1897and1899 /><ref name="statistics"/><ref>{{cite web | title =1899 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines Title XIV Article 93 | url =http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1899-constitution.html | accessdate =January 1, 2012 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20111009012818/http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1899-constitution.html | archive-date =October 9, 2011 | url-status =dead }}</ref> The nascent republic published a number of laws, acts, decrees, and other official issuances.

While the census of 1903 and of 1905 officially reported that the number of Spanish-speakers had never exceeded 10% of the total population during the final decade of the 19th century, it considered only speakers who used Spanish as their first and only language. It disregarded the Catholic [[Chinese Filipino]]s, many of whom spoke Spanish, and the creole-speaking communities.<ref name="statistics"/> Furthermore, those who were academically instructed in the public school system also used Spanish as their second or third language.

In the Eighth Annual Report by the Director of Education, David P.

...as I traveled through the Philippine Islands, using ordinary transportation and mixing with all classes of people under all conditions. Although based on the school statistics it is said that more Filipinos speak English than any other language, no one can be in agreement with this declaration if they base their assessment on what they hear...

Spanish is everywhere the language of business and social intercourse.... In order for anyone to obtain prompt service from anyone, Spanish turns out to be more useful than English.... And outside of Manila it is almost indispensable. The Americans who travel around all the islands customarily use it.

The use of Spanish as an official language has been extended to January 1, 1920. Its general use seems to be spreading. Natives acquiring it learn it as a living speech. Everywhere they hear it spoken by leading people of the community and their ears are trained to its pronunciation. On the other hand, they (the natives) are practically without phonic standards in acquiring English and the result is that they learn it as a book language rather than as a living speech. | Henry Jones Ford}}

In 1962, when Philippine President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] decreed that the Philippines would mark [[Independence Day (Philippines)|independence day]] on June 12, instead of July 4, when the country gained complete [[Republic Day (Philippines)|independence from the United States]], that revealed a tendency to paint Spain as the villain and the United States as savior or the more benevolent colonial power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/june98/05_37_013.html |title=PHILIPPINES: Torn Between Two Colonisers – Spain and America |first=Johanna |last=Son |date=June 9, 1998|location=Manila, Philippines |publisher=oneworld.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991009202835/http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/june98/05_37_013.html |archive-date=October 9, 1999 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}</ref> Spanish language and culture were demonized again.<ref name=forgotten>{{cite web |url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/119 |title=Educadores y sabios adredemente olvidados |first=Guillermo |last=Gómez Rivera |author-link=Guillermo Gómez Rivera |date=March 2001 |trans-title=Forgotten Filipino Sages and Educators |publisher=La Guirnalda Polar (lgpolar.com) |location=Canada |at=Núm. 53 – Especial de Filipinas I |language=en, es |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rn4RHtiX?url=http://lgpolar.com/page/read/119 |archive-date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2014}} In 1973, Spanish briefly lost its status as an official language of the Philippines, was quickly redesignated as an official language, and finally lost its official status by the ratification of a subsequent constitution in 1987.<ref name="official languages" />

On September 11, 2012, saying that there were 318 Spanish-trained basic education teachers in the Philippines, Philippine Secretary of the Department of Education [[Armin Luistro]] announced an agreement with the [[Chile|Chilean]] government to train Filipino school teachers in Spanish.

==Current status==
Since the independence of the Philippines from Spain (1898), the local variety of Spanish has lost most of its speakers, and it might be now close to disappearing.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In the last decades its use has declined.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_es/zonas_es/asia-pacifico/ari27-2009|title=Nuevas perspectivas para la lengua española en Filipinas (ARI)}}</ref> New developments in the Philippines are slowly reversing that trend.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In December 2007, former [[Philippine President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in [[Spain]] for the teaching and learning of the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mecd.gob.es/filipinas/en_PH/estudiar/en-filipinas|title=Spanish in Philippine Public High School}}</ref><!-- ref name=SpanishGMA2 -->

The presidential decision had immediate results. The Under-Secretary of the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]], Vilma L. Labrador, circulated a memorandum (17/XII/2007), on the "Restoration of the Spanish language in Philippine Education." In it, the department mandated secondary schools to offer basic and advanced Spanish.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

{{as of|2010}}, the huge demand for Spanish speakers from [[business process outsourcing]] companies in the Philippines made Filipinos flock to [[Instituto Cervantes]] and other language centers to learn Spanish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/hola-asian-call-centers-lure-back-spanish|title=Hola!

===Media===
Spanish-language media were present in the 2000s with one Spanish newspaper, ''[[E-Dyario]]'', becoming the first Spanish digital newspaper published in the Philippines. Also, ''[[Filipinas, Ahora Mismo]]'' was a nationally syndicated, 60-minute, cultural radio magazine program in the Philippines that was broadcast daily in Spanish for two years in the 2000s.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

On September 15th 2020 a new online magazine [[La Jornada Filipina]] was launched by Arvyn Cerézo.

==Influence on the languages of the Philippines==

{{See also|Old Spanish language|Linguistic history of Spanish}}

There are approximately 4,000 Spanish words in Tagalog (between 20% and 33% of Tagalog words),<ref name="newprospects"/> and around 6,000 Spanish words in Visayan and other Philippine languages. The Spanish counting system, calendar, time, etc. are still in use with slight modifications. Archaic Spanish words have been preserved in Tagalog and the other vernaculars, such as {{wikttgl|pera}} (from {{wikten|perra}}, meaning "coins"), {{wikttgl|sabon}} ("soap", modern Spanish {{wiktspa|jabón}}; at the beginning of Spanish rule, the ''j'' used to be pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] or the "sh" sound), ''[[wikt:relos|relos]]'' ("watch", Spanish {{wiktspa|reloj}} with the ''j'' sound), and {{wikt-lang|ceb|kwarta}} ("money", from Spanish {{wiktspa|cuarta}}).<ref>{{cite web | title =El español en Filipinas | url =http://spanish-differences.com/Spanish/Philippines-Spanish.php | archive-url =https://www.webcitation.org/5rDzFAFMZ?url=http://spanish-differences.com/Spanish/Philippines-Spanish.php | archive-date =July 14, 2010 | accessdate =July 19, 2010 | url-status =dead }}</ref>

===Dialectal Vocabulary===
Differences between dialects of Spanish are numerous; with the Philippine Spanish dialect in many cases not being understandable elsewhere.{{cn|date=November 2020}} These differences include many basic terms such as those for clothing, gastronomy, etc. 

The table below demonstrates how certain Filipino terms compare to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] spoken in [[Spain]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]],  [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] dialects), [[Mexican Spanish|Mexico]], and [[English language|English]] spoken in the United States.
