'''Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʁɪsti̯an ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈvaltɐ vʊlf|lang|De-Christian Wulff.ogg}}; born {{Nowrap|19 June}} 1959) is a German politician and lawyer. He served as [[President of Germany]] from 2010 to 2012.

On 17 February 2012, Wulff resigned as President of Germany, facing the prospect of prosecution for allegations of corruption relating to his prior service as Minister-President of Lower Saxony.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/9088324/Blow-to-Merkel-as-German-president-resigns.html |title=Blow to Merkel as German president resigns |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=17 February 2012 |last=Waterfield |first=Bruno |location=London}}</ref> In 2014, he was acquitted of all corruption charges by the Hanover regional court.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26365262|title=Christian Wulff, ex German president, found not guilty|date=27 February 2014|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Wulff was born in [[Osnabrück]] and is [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Roman Catholic]]. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the post of President of Germany since [[Heinrich Lübke]] (1959–1969)<ref name="common-talk.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.common-talk.com/cms/node/9937 |title=Germany’s new president Christian Wulff embracing his second wife &#124; Language Creates Value |publisher=Common-talk.com |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227143818/http://www.common-talk.com/cms/node/9937 |archivedate=27 February 2012}}</ref> and the first President to have been born in the post-[[World War II]] period. His father left the family, and he grew up with his mother. As a teenager, he took responsibility for the care of his younger sister, after his mother developed [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/aussenpolitik/2366743/christian-wulff-sieht-sich-nicht-alpha-tier.story|title=Christian Wulff im Porträt|work=[[Kleine Zeitung]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}</ref> After completing his [[Abitur]] at the [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]] [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Osnabrück, Wulff studied law with a specialisation in economics at the [[University of Osnabrück]]. He joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/germ_1949a/wulff.php |title=Biography of Wulff, Christian |publisher=Archontology.org |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law, and has since worked as an attorney.

==Political career==
Since 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the ''Schülerunion'', a political high school student organization affiliated with the Christian Democrats. From 1979 to 1983, he was on the executive board of the [[Junge Union]] and became its state chairman in [[Lower Saxony]] in 1983. However, he decided to resign from the board in order to pursue his law degree, which he completed in 1986. The same year, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he sat on the CDU's state party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman from 1994 to 2008.

The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for Minister President of the state in the run-up of the 1994 parliamentary election. However, the popular incumbent [[Gerhard Schröder]] won an absolute majority in the Lower Saxony legislature, while the state CDU under Wulff received one of its worst results, leading some observers to doubt the wisdom of the provincial party nominating a young and neophyte candidate for Premier. After four years in opposition, the [[1998 Lower Saxony state election|1998 legislative assembly election]] brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Minister President. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], pinned their hopes on Wulff – a Wulff victory would have stopped the inevitable rise of Schröder to the Social Democrat nomination for Chancellor. However, supported by a wave of sympathy for his potential candidacy for chancellor in the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], Schröder was returned to power by an enhanced majority – leaving Wulff to serve five more years as state leader of the opposition.

Schröder won the 1998 federal election, leaving the post of Minister President to his anointed successor, Interior minister [[Gerhard Glogowski]]. The latter soon stumbled over a scandal involving free travel paid by [[TUI AG|TUI]] and was succeeded by young parliamentary leader [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. In the wake of the 1999 scandal, as well as rising discontent with Schröder's federal cabinet, the Christian Democrats rose in the opinion polls and became a serious contender for power in the [[2003 Lower Saxony state election|2003 parliamentary election]].

Wulff had been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level after {{Nowrap|7 November}} 1998, and had been a board member of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] after 2003.

===2003 state election===
With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election and essentially campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and clear-cut reforms in the areas of law enforcement and education. Both issues were decisive in the elections that led to a change in fortunes for the two major parties. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since the 1990 Schröder victory, were returned to power with an absolute majority in the parliament, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Minister President on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]).

===Policies===
[[File:CFK y Christian Wulff.jpg|thumb|Meeting with his [[Argentine]] counterpart [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]].]]
As Minister President, Wulff pursued a multitude of reforms, including a restructuring of the primary education system in Lower Saxony, as well as an increase of police officers on the beat. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis, resulting from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration (especially the abolition of certain district authorities). Budgetary problems continued to overshadow Wulff's policies, albeit with somewhat less pressure. Many measures have remained controversial.

Prior to the [[2005 German federal election|2005 Federal Election]], Wulff had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the German chancellorship. Surprisingly, in a spring 2005 poll, 28 percent of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor in the 2006 election.<ref>[http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 n24.de] {{in lang|de}}  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421181559/http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 |date=21 April 2005 }}</ref> As Wulff only began his first term as Minister President in early 2003, he largely dismissed such speculations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftd.de/pw/de/1102146523308.html?nv=cpm|title=In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft|first=Peter|last=Ehrlich|work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]]|date=8 December 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}</ref> Speculation had particularly increased since the December 2004 Christian Democrat federal convention in Düsseldorf, when Wulff was re-elected deputy leader of the federal party with roughly 86 per cent of all delegates supporting him. However, the premature dissolution of the Bundestag in 2005 and the subsequent election of [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] largely put an end to further speculation about Wulff's future at the time.

A Wulff candidacy for the CDU nomination for Chancellor was seen to appeal to northerners and liberals within the Christian Democrats. Outside the mold of a typical conservative, he was able to attract swing voters disillusioned with the slowness of reforms, as well as the then rather high rates of unemployment in Germany. Indeed, he worked on increasing his visibility beyond Lower Saxony's confines, particularly by appearing frequently on TV shows and giving interviews to the national newspapers. Moreover, Wulff was also acquiring a profile on a broad range of issues, including the reform of the German language, Medicare and social security reform, as well as a modernisation of Germany's federal constitution, the ''Grundgesetz''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/s/Rub6EAA9BF249C249FE86A5EFF3F83DC130/Doc~E339323623A95412081F4B5DEC6308A30~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Wie macht das bloß der Wulff?|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}</ref> In fact, he criticised the consensus reached between the Christian Democrat and Social Democrat parties on the modernisation of [[Germany's constitution]], stating that he felt that the states (''Lander'') had not been given sufficient powers to deal with their own affairs. Wulff also took a conservative stand on nuclear energy, advocating an extension of the deadlines for the [[decommissioning of Germany's nuclear reactors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5113864_REF2,00.html|title=Auch Wulff fordert längere Laufzeiten|work=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]|date=6 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

In a speech, Wulff also expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This was seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 state, and more importantly, the 2009 federal election. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] had been severely criticized for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign, leading to a worse-than-expected result for the Christian Democrats.

Wulff announced on 8 January 2006 that Lower Saxony would become the first state to approve a new model according to which the government will temporarily pay part of the salaries for low-salary jobs, if the employers concerned are willing to employ an employee concerned on a long-term basis. This pilot was supposed to make new jobs more affordable in Germany's notoriously high-wages environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article189672/Niedersachsen_fuehrt_Kombilohn_ein.html|title=Niedersachsen führt Kombilohn ein|first=Stefan|last=von Borstel|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=8 July 2010|language=German}}</ref>

===Wulff and the 2005 federal elections===
Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections were to be advanced to [[2005 German federal election|September 2005]], Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor, particularly as he had not completed his first term as Premier of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for CDU party and parliamentary leader [[Angela Merkel]]. Although there was speculation that Wulff would be given a position in the new government, entering federal politics, he remained Minister President of Lower Saxony.

===President of Germany===
Wulff was elected [[President of Germany]] on {{Nowrap|30 June}} 2010 to follow [[Horst Köhler]], who had resigned on 31 May 2010. He won 625 of 1242 votes on the third ballot of the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]].<ref>[http://www.bundespraesident.de/en www.bundespraesident.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629212008/http://www.bundespraesident.de/en/ |date=29 June 2006 }} [[Bundespräsidialamt]], Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. Retrieved 1 July 2010.</ref> He became Germany's youngest president at the age of 51<ref name="common-talk.com"/> and was sworn in on 2 July 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

His main contender in the election was [[Joachim Gauck]], a [[civil rights]] activist from [[East Germany]], and the former [[Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records]]. Not a member of any party himself, Gauck was nominated by the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] as their presidential candidate on {{Nowrap|3 June}}.

Wulff was succeeded as Minister President of Lower Saxony by [[David McAllister (politician)|David McAllister]].<ref>http://www.manager-magazin.de/politik/artikel/0,2828,703986,00.html {{in lang|de}}</ref> Wulff's candidacy for President of Germany in the [[2010 German presidential election|2010 presidential election]] was formally confirmed by [[Angela Merkel]], [[Guido Westerwelle]] and [[Horst Seehofer]], the heads of the governing [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] parties, during the evening of {{Nowrap|3 June}} 2010.

In August 2011, President Wulff opened an economists' conference with a speech on the euro. He criticized the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), which had entered a second round of bond buy-ups from heavily indebted euro-zone nations, calling the plan to stabilize the [[euro]] "legally and politically questionable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/the-world-from-berlin-the-german-president-is-behaving-like-a-populist-a-782375.html|title=The World from Berlin: The German President Is 'Behaving Like a Populist'|date=25 August 2011|via=Spiegel Online}}</ref>

===Scandals, resignation and final acquittal===
{{Further|Causa Wulff}}
In December 2011, German media reported allegations that Wulff had deceived the Parliament of Lower Saxony in February 2010, during an inquiry into his connections as Minister President of Lower Saxony with a number of affluent businessmen. In particular, there were a number of questions concerning the purchase of a house, for which Wulff accepted a loan from an entrepreneur family with whom he was friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/politik/inland/christian-wulff/wirbel-um-privat-kredit-ueber-halbe-million-euro-21531308.bild.html|title=Hat Wulff das Parlament getäuscht?|date=12 December 2011|publisher=Bild.de|language=German|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> In this context, Wulff tried to influence the media coverage in the run-up to the breaking of the scandal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/angry-call-president-accused-of-threatening-tabloid-newspaper-a-806665.html|title=President Accused of Threatening Tabloid Newspaper|date=2 January 2012|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE International|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> Additional investigations were launched into Wulff's political dealing with various entrepreneurs with whom he and his family spent their private vacations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-83180796.html|title=Verführerischer Kredit|date=17 December 2011|publisher=DER SPIEGEL|language=German|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> Since it was not clear who had paid for these holidays, Wulff was subsequently accused of favoritism and unethical behavior.

== Life after politics ==
In 2016 Wulff was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the [[University of Duisburg-Essen|Universität Essen-Duisburg]]'s [[University of Duisburg-Essen#The NRW School of Governance|NRW School of Governance]]. He gave both seminars and lectures at the university.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Der-Norden/Uebersicht/Ex-Bundespraesident-Christian-Wulff-wird-Gastdozent-an-der-Uni-Duisburg-Essen|title=Christian Wulff wird Uni-Dozent|website=HAZ – Hannoversche Allgemeine|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> In August 2017, it was revealed that Wulff works as an advisor for the German branch of Yargici, a Turkish high-street fashion company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why do European companies bother to hire ex-politicians?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21728975-month-gerhard-schr-der-starts-new-job-rosneft-why-do-european-companies-bother|accessdate=15 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

Christian Wulff met his first wife, lawyer Christiane Vogt (born 1961), when they were both law students in Osnabrück in 1983. They married in March 1988, and have a daughter, Annalena (born 1993). In June 2006, Wulff announced that he would divorce his wife. Wulff subsequently married [[Bettina Wulff|Bettina Körner]] (born 1973 in Hannover), on {{Nowrap|21 March}} 2008 at a ceremony in Castle Herrenhausen, near Hannover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,453378,00.html|title=Von Bin Baden bis Bin Nacktbaden|first1=Sebastian|last1=Fischer|first2=Alwin|last2=Schröder|first3=Carsten|last3=Volkery|work=Der Spiegel|date=8 December 2006|accessdate=30 June 2010|language=German}}</ref> She has a son Leander Balthasar (2003) from a previous relationship, and on {{Nowrap|12 May}} 2008, gave birth to their first child together, a boy named Linus.<ref name="Bloomberg"/> Wulff and his wife announced their separation in January 2013, with him moving out of their Hannover home.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/christian-wulff-bettina-split_n_2424157.html|title=Christian Wulff, Bettina Split: German Ex-President Separates From Wife|work=HuffPost|date=7 January 2013|accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref> They started divorce proceedings in March 2015, but only two months later they got together again and stopped the proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ehemaliger Bundespräsident: Christian und Bettina Wulff leben wieder zusammen|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/ex-bundespraesident-christian-und-bettina-wulff-angeblich-wieder-ein-paar-a-1032311.html|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=Spiegel|date=6 May 2015|language=German}}</ref>
