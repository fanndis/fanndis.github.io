==Former features==
==={{visible anchor|Crunchbase}}===
From 2007 to 2015, TechCrunch operated [[Crunchbase]], a [[website]] and [[online encyclopedia]] of information on startups, key people, funds, funding rounds, and events. In 2015, Crunchbase spun out of TechCrunch to become a private entity, and is no longer a part of TechCrunch.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/22/aolverizon-completes-spinout-of-crunchbase-funded-by-emergence-capital/ | title=AOL/Verizon Completes Spinout Of CrunchBase Funded By Emergence Capital | first=Ingrid | last=Lunden | work=TechCrunch | date=September 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://thenextweb.com/media/2015/09/22/crunchbase-spins-out/ | title=Crunchbase leaves AOL with funding by Emergence Capital | last=Hockenson | first=Lauren | work=[[The Next Web]] | date=September 22, 2015}}</ref>

===Crunchies===
From 2007 to 2017, TechCrunch sponsored the annual [[Crunchies]] award ceremony to award startups, internet and technology innovations.<ref>{{cite web | title=Crunchies | url=https://techcrunch.com/tag/crunchies/ | publisher=TechCrunch}}</ref> The ceremonies were compared to those of the [[Academy Awards]]. At the first award ceremony in 2017, [[Facebook]] won the award for best startup. Due to controversy surrounding the awards, TechCrunch announced in 2017 it would end the Crunchies.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/11/09/the-crunchies-where-silicon-valley-went-to-be.html | title=The Crunchies, where Silicon Valley went to be celebrated and skewered, is ending | work=[[American City Business Journals]] |first=Luke | last=Stangel | date=November 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8004101/sexism-and-consequences-at-techcrunch-s-annual-award-show | title=Sexism and consequences at TechCrunch’s annual award show | last=Tiku | first=Nitasha |website=[[The Verge]] |date=February 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Controversies==
The company was criticized for allowing developers to present the [[Titstare]] application, created by participants in a [[hackathon]] at TechCrunch Disrupt 2013. The application allows users to "stare at tits".<ref>{{cite news | last=Gray | first=Amy | title='Titstare' app at Techcrunch: women in tech deserve better | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/09/titstare-app-women-tech-sexism | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/techcrunch-forced-to-apologise-over-sydney-duos-titstare-app-20130909-2tflb.html | title=TechCrunch forced to apologise over Sydney duo's 'Titstare' app | first=Ben | last=Grubb |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date=September 9, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/09/titstare-app-at-techcrunch-disrupt-what-would-a-tech-conference-be-without-the-sexism.html |title=Titstare app at TechCrunch Disrupt: What would a tech conference be without the sexism? | last=Marcotte| first=Amanda | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, the site's editors and writers were criticized for possible ethics violations. These included claims that Arrington's investments in certain firms which the site had covered created a conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/business/media/michael-arringtons-audacious-venture.html | title=Michael Arrington's Audacious Adventure | first=David | last=Carr | author-link=David Carr (journalist) | date=September 5, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] | url-access=subscription}}</ref> The controversy that ensued eventually led to Arrington's departure, and other writers, including [[Paul Carr (writer)|Paul Carr]] and [[Sarah Lacy]], followed suit.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://allthingsd.com/20120116/sarah-lacy-debuts-new-tech-site-pandodaily-and-guess-whos-working-for-her-video/ |title=Sarah Lacy Debuts New Tech Site, PandoDaily — $2M+ in Funding and Guess Who’s Working for Her? | first=Kara | last=Swisher | author-link=Kara Swisher | date=January 16, 2012 | work=[[All Things Digital]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/techcruncher-quits-slams-new-editor-techcrunch-134926/ |title=TechCruncher Quits, Slams New Editor—On TechCrunch | first=Anthony | last=Ha |date=September 16, 2011 | work=[[Adweek]]}}</ref>
