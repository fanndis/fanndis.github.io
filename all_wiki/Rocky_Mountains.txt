The '''Rocky Mountains''', also known as the '''Rockies''', are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch {{convert|3000|mi|-2|abbr=on|sp=us}}<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rocky Mountains {{!}} Location, Map, History, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rocky-Mountains|access-date=July 2, 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> in [[great-circle distance|straight-line distance]] from the northernmost part of [[British Columbia]], in western Canada, to [[New Mexico]] in the Southwestern United States. The northern terminus is located in the [[Liard River]] [[Liard River, British Columbia|area]] east of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]], while the southernmost point is near the [[Albuquerque]] [[Albuquerque metropolitan area|area]] adjacent the [[Rio Grande]] [[Albuquerque Basin|Basin]] and north of the [[Sandia–Manzano Mountains|Sandia–Manzano Mountain Range]]. Located within the [[North American Cordillera]], the Rockies are distinct from the [[Cascade Range]] and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], which all lie farther to the west.

The Rocky Mountains formed 80 million to 55&nbsp;million years ago during the [[Laramide orogeny]], in which a number of plates began sliding underneath the [[North American plate]]. The angle of [[subduction]] was shallow, resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America. Since then, further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers have sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys. At the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], humans began inhabiting the mountain range. After explorations of the range by Europeans, such as [[Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], and Americans, such as the [[Lewis and Clark expedition]], natural resources such as mineral and fur drove the initial economic exploitation of the mountains, although the range itself never experienced a dense population.

Of the [[List of mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|100 highest peaks]] in the Rocky Mountains, 78 (including the 30 highest) are located in [[Colorado]], ten in [[Wyoming]], six in [[New Mexico]], three in [[Montana]], and one in [[Utah]]. Public parks and forest lands protect much of the mountain range, and they are popular tourist destinations, especially for hiking, camping, mountaineering, fishing, hunting, [[mountain biking]], skiing, and snowboarding.

==Etymology==
[[File:Willow Flats area and Teton Range in Grand Teton National Park.jpg|thumb|right|The summits of the [[Teton Range]] in [[Wyoming]]]]
The name of the mountains is a translation of an [[Amerindian]] name that is closely related to [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; the [[Cree]] name ''{{transl|cr|as-sin-wati}}'' is given as, "When seen from across the prairies, they looked like a rocky mass". The first mention of their present name by a European was in the journal of [[Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre]] in 1752, where they were called "''{{lang|fr|Montagnes de Roche}}''".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ak rigg|first1=G.P.V.|last2=Akrigg|first2=Helen B.|title=British Columbia Place Names|date=1997|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver, BC|isbn=978-0-7748-0636-7|page=229|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVQ5RZeAFCkC&pg=229|access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mardon|first1=Ernest G.|last2=Mardon|first2=Austin A.|title=Community Place Names of Alberta|date=2010|publisher=Golden Meteorite Press|location=Edmonton, AB|isbn=978-1-897472-17-0|page=283|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbIYAwAAQBAJ&pg=283|access-date=September 2, 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{see also|List of rivers of the Rocky Mountains}}

The Rocky Mountains are often defined as stretching from the [[Liard River]] in British Columbia<ref name=gadd1/>{{rp|13}} south to the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] in New Mexico. The Rockies vary in width from {{convert|70|to|300|mi|km|order=flip}}. The Rocky Mountains contain the highest peaks in central North America. The range's highest peak is [[Mount Elbert]] located in Colorado at {{convert|14440|ft|m|0|order=flip}} above sea level. [[Mount Robson]] in British Columbia, at {{convert|12972|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, is the highest peak in the [[Canadian Rockies]].
[[File:Mount Robson Twilight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mount Robson]] in British Columbia]]

The eastern edge of the Rockies rises dramatically above the [[Interior Plains]] of central North America, including the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] of [[New Mexico]] and [[Colorado]], the [[Front Range]] of Colorado, the [[Wind River Range]] and [[Big Horn Mountains]] of [[Wyoming]], the [[Absaroka Range|Absaroka]]-[[Beartooth Mountains|Beartooth]] ranges and [[Rocky Mountain Front]] of [[Montana]] and the [[Clark Range (Canada)|Clark Range]] of [[Alberta]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Central ranges of the Rockies include the [[La Sal Mountains|La Sal Range]] along the [[Utah]]-Colorado border, the [[Uinta Mountains|Uinta Range]] of Utah and Wyoming, and the [[Teton Range]] of Wyoming and Idaho.

The western edge of the Rockies includes ranges such as the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch]] near [[Salt Lake City]], the [[San Juan Mountains]] of New Mexico and Colorado, the [[Bitterroot Range|Bitterroots]] along the Idaho-Montana border, and the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooths]] in central Idaho. The [[Great Basin]] and [[Columbia River Plateau]] separate these subranges from distinct ranges further to the west. In Canada, the western edge of the Rockies is formed by the huge [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], which runs the length of British Columbia from its beginnings in the middle [[Flathead River]] valley in western Montana to the south bank of the Liard River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cannings|first=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ig4OMokvt-0C&q=%22Rocky+Mountain+Trench%22+and+%22Columbia+Mountains%22&pg=PA5|title=The Rockies: A Natural History|page=5|publisher=Greystone/David Suzuki Foundation|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55365-285-4}}</ref>

Geographers define three main groups of the [[Canadian Rockies]]: the [[Continental Ranges]], [[Hart Ranges]], and [[Muskwa Ranges]]. The Rockies do not extend into the Yukon or Alaska, or into central British Columbia. Other mountain ranges continue beyond the Liard River, including the [[Selwyn Mountains]] in [[Yukon]], the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]], but those are not part of the Rockies, though they are part of the [[American Cordillera]].

The [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] is located in the Rocky Mountains and designates the line at which waters flow either to the [[Atlantic]] or Pacific Oceans. [[Triple Divide Peak (Montana)|Triple Divide Peak]] ({{cvt|8020|ft|m|order=flip|disp=or}}) in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] is so named because water falling on the mountain reaches not only the Atlantic and Pacific but [[Hudson Bay]] as well. Farther north in Alberta, the [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and other rivers feed the basin of the [[Mackenzie River]], which has its outlet on the [[Beaufort Sea]] of the Arctic Ocean.

Human population is not very dense in the Rocky Mountains, with an average of four people per square kilometer and few cities with over 50,000 people. However, the human population grew rapidly in the Rocky Mountain states between 1950 and 1990. The forty-year statewide increases in population range from 35% in Montana to about 150% in [[Utah]] and Colorado. The populations of several mountain towns and communities have doubled in the forty years 1972–2012. [[Jackson, Wyoming]], increased 260%, from 1,244 to 4,472 residents, in those forty years.<ref name="USGS" />

==Geology==
{{See also|Geology of the Rocky Mountains}}
The rocks in the Rocky Mountains were formed before the mountains were raised by tectonic forces. The oldest rock is [[Precambrian]] [[metamorphic rock]] that forms the core of the North American continent. There is also Precambrian sedimentary [[argillite]], dating back to 1.7&nbsp;billion years ago. During the [[Paleozoic]], western North America lay underneath a shallow sea, which deposited many kilometers of [[limestone]] and [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]].<ref name=gadd1>{{cite book|title=Handbook of the Canadian Rockies|first=Ben|last=Gadd|year=1995|publisher=Corax Press|isbn=9780969263111}}</ref>{{rp|76}}
[[File:Jackson Glacier terminus.jpg|thumb|right|Glaciers, such as [[Jackson Glacier]] in [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]], [[Montana]], as shown here, have dramatically shaped the Rocky Mountains.]]
In the southern Rocky Mountains, near present-day Colorado, these ancestral rocks were disturbed by mountain building approximately 300&nbsp;[[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]], during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]. This mountain-building produced the Ancestral Rocky Mountains. They consisted largely of Precambrian metamorphic rock forced upward through layers of the limestone laid down in the shallow sea.<ref>{{cite book|title=Roadside Geology of Colorado|last=Chronic|first=Halka|year=1980|isbn=978-0-87842-105-3}}</ref> The mountains eroded throughout the late Paleozoic and early [[Mesozoic Era|Mesozoic]], leaving extensive deposits of [[sedimentary rock]].

[[Terranes]] began colliding with the western edge of North America in the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] (approximately 350 million years ago), causing the [[Antler orogeny]].<ref name=Blakely>{{cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/Text_WUS.html|title=Geologic History of Western US|first=Ron|last=Blakely|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013326/http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/Text_WUS.html|archive-date=June 22, 2010}}</ref> For 270 million years, the focus of the effects of plate collisions were near the edge of the North American plate boundary, far to the west of the Rocky Mountain region.<ref name=Blakely/> It was not until 80 Ma these effects began reaching the Rockies.<ref name=English>{{cite journal|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~stj/Assets/PDFs/04%20JE%20&%20STJ%20IGR%20Laramide.pdf|first1=Joseph M.|last1=English|first2=Stephen T.|last2=Johnston|title=The Laramide Orogeny: What Were the Driving Forces?|journal=International Geology Review|volume=46|year=2004|pages=833 838|doi=10.2747/0020-6814.46.9.833|issue=9|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607041857/http://web.uvic.ca/~stj/Assets/PDFs/04%20JE%20%26%20STJ%20IGR%20Laramide.pdf|archive-date=June 7, 2011|bibcode=2004IGRv...46..833E|s2cid=129901811}}</ref>

The current Rocky Mountains arose in the [[Laramide orogeny]] from between 80 and 55 Ma.<ref name=English/> For the Canadian Rockies, the mountain building is analogous to pushing a rug on a hardwood floor:<ref name=gadd2>{{cite book|title=Canadian Rockies Geology Road Tours|first=Ben|last=Gadd|year=2008|publisher=Corax Press|isbn=9780969263128}}</ref>{{rp|78}} the rug bunches up and forms wrinkles (mountains). In Canada, the terranes and subduction are the foot pushing the rug, the ancestral rocks are the rug, and the [[Canadian Shield]] in the middle of the continent is the hardwood floor.<ref name=gadd2/>{{rp|78}}

Further south, an unusual subduction may have caused the growth of the Rocky Mountains in the United States, where the [[Farallon plate]] dove at a shallow angle below the [[North American plate]]. This low angle moved the focus of melting and mountain building much farther inland than the normal {{convert|200|to|300|mi|km|-2|order=flip}}. Scientists hypothesize that the shallow angle of the subducting plate increased the friction and other interactions with the thick continental mass above it. Tremendous [[Thrust fault|thrusts]] piled sheets of crust on top of each other, building the broad, high Rocky Mountain range.<ref name="usgs">{{USGS|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/rockymtn.html|title=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Rocky Mountains|accessdate=December 10, 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Roxborough.jpg|thumb|left|Tilted slabs of sedimentary rock in [[Roxborough State Park]] near [[Denver]]]]
The current southern Rockies were forced upwards through the layers of Pennsylvanian and [[Permian]] sedimentary remnants of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindsey|first=D.A.|year=2010|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1349/pdf/C1349.pdf|title=The geologic story of Colorado's Sangre de Cristo Range|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|id=Circular 1349|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502034033/https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1349/pdf/C1349.pdf|archive-date=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Such sedimentary remnants were often tilted at steep angles along the flanks of the modern range; they are now visible in many places throughout the Rockies, and are shown along the [[Dakota Hogback]], an early Cretaceous sandstone formation running along the eastern flank of the modern Rockies.

Just after the Laramide orogeny, the Rockies were like [[Tibet]]: a high plateau, probably {{Convert|6000|m|ft|-3}} above sea level. In the last sixty million years, [[erosion]] stripped away the high rocks, revealing the ancestral rocks beneath, and forming the current landscape of the Rockies.<ref name=gadd2/>{{rp|80–81}}

Periods of glaciation occurred from the [[Pleistocene]] Epoch (1.8&nbsp;million – 70,000 years ago) to the [[Holocene]] Epoch (fewer than 11,000 years ago). These ice ages left their mark on the Rockies, forming extensive [[Glacier|glacial]] landforms, such as U-shaped valleys and [[cirque]]s. Recent glacial episodes included the [[Bull Lake Glaciation]], which began about 150,000 years ago, and the [[Pinedale Glaciation]], which perhaps remained at full glaciation until 15,000–20,000 years ago.<ref name="Pierce79">{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=K.L.|year=1979|title=History and dynamics of glaciation in the northern Yellowstone National Park area|id=Professional Paper 729-F|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|location=Washington, DC|pages=1 90}}</ref>

All of these geological processes exposed a complex set of rocks at the surface. For example, volcanic rock from the [[Paleogene]] and [[Neogene]] periods (66&nbsp;million – 2.6&nbsp;million years ago) occurs in the San Juan Mountains and in other areas. Millennia of severe erosion in the [[Wyoming Basin]] transformed intermountain basins into a relatively flat terrain. The [[Tetons]] and other north-central ranges contain folded and faulted rocks of Paleozoic and [[Mesozoic]] age draped above cores of [[Proterozoic]] and [[Archean]] igneous and metamorphic rocks ranging in age from 1.2&nbsp;billion (e.g., Tetons) to more than 3.3&nbsp;billion years (Beartooth Mountains).<ref name="USGS">{{USGS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927145110/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/wm146.htm|title=Rocky Mountains|author=T.J.

==Ecology and climate==
{{main|Ecology of the Rocky Mountains}}

There are a wide range of environmental factors in the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies range in latitude between the Liard River in British Columbia (at 59° N) and the Rio Grande in New Mexico (at 35° N). Prairie occurs at or below {{convert|1800|ft|m|order=flip}}, while the highest peak in the range is [[Mount Elbert]] at {{convert|14440|ft|m|order=flip}}. Precipitation ranges from {{convert|10|in|mm|order=flip}} per year in the southern valleys<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Southern Rocky Mountains|encyclopedia=Forest Encyclopedia Network|url=http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p377|access-date=August 22, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007152813/http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p377|archive-date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> to {{convert|60|in|mm|order=flip}} per year locally in the northern peaks.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Northern Rocky Mountains |encyclopedia=Forest Encyclopedia Network |url=http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p378 |access-date=August 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110721043620/http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p378 |archive-date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref> Average January temperatures can range from {{convert|20|F|C|order=flip}} in Prince George, British Columbia, to {{convert|43|F|C|order=flip}} in [[Trinidad, Colorado]].<ref name=Sheridan/> Therefore, there is not a single monolithic ecosystem for the entire Rocky Mountain Range.

<!--[[File:Alpine tundra Copper Mountain Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|Tundra in the mountains of Colorado]]-->
Instead, ecologists divide the Rocky Mountain into a number of [[life zones|biotic zones]]. Each zone is defined by whether it can support trees and the presence of one or more [[indicator species]]. Two zones that do not support trees are the Plains and the [[Alpine tundra]]. The [[Great Plains]] lie to the east of the Rockies and is characterized by prairie grasses (below roughly {{convert|1800|ft|m|order=flip}}). Alpine tundra occurs in regions above the treeline for the Rocky Mountains, which varies from {{convert|12000|ft|m|order=flip}} in New Mexico to {{convert|2500|ft|m|order=flip}} at the northern end of the Rocky Mountains (near the Yukon).<ref name=Sheridan>{{cite web|url=http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/geog17064/17064-14.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901204453/http://sheridan.geog.kent.edu/geog17064/17064-14.pdf |archive-date=September 1, 2006 |title=US & Canada: Rocky Mountains (Chapter 14) |work=Geography of the United States and Canada course notes |last=Sheridan |first=Scott |publisher=Kent State University |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Bighorn lamb Alberta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bighorn sheep]] (such as this lamb in [[Alberta]]) have declined dramatically since European-American settlement of the mountains]]
The USGS defines ten forested zones in the Rocky Mountains. Zones in more southern, warmer, or drier areas are defined by the presence of [[pinyon pine]]s/[[juniper]]s, [[ponderosa pine]]s, or [[oak]]s mixed with [[pine]]s. In more northern, colder, or wetter areas, zones are defined by [[Douglas fir]]s, [[Cascade range|Cascadian]] species (such as [[western hemlock]]), [[lodgepole pine]]s/[[quaking aspen]]s, or [[fir]]s mixed with [[spruce]]. Near treeline, zones can consist of white pines (such as [[whitebark pine]] or [[bristlecone pine]]); or a mixture of white pine, fir, and spruce that appear as shrub-like [[krummholz]]. Finally, rivers and canyons can create a unique forest zone in more arid parts of the mountain range.<ref name=USGS/>

The Rocky Mountains are an important habitat for a great deal of well-known wildlife, such as [[wolf|wolves]], [[Rocky Mountain elk|elk]], [[western moose|moose]], [[mule deer|mule]] and [[white-tailed deer]], [[pronghorn]], [[mountain goat]]s, [[bighorn sheep]], [[American badger|badgers]], [[American black bear|black bears]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[Canada lynx|lynx]]es, [[North American cougar|cougar]]s, and [[wolverine]]s.<ref name=USGS/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rocky-Mountains|title=Rocky Mountains {{!}} mountains, North America|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=August 12, 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812144910/https://www.britannica.com/place/Rocky-Mountains|archive-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref> For example, North America's largest herds of moose are in the [[Alberta–British Columbia foothills forests]].

The status of most species in the Rocky Mountains is unknown, due to incomplete information. European-American settlement of the mountains has adversely impacted native species. Examples of some species that have declined include [[western toad]]s, [[greenback cutthroat trout]], [[white sturgeon]], [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], [[trumpeter swan]], and bighorn sheep. In the United States portion of the mountain range, [[apex predator]]s such as grizzly bears and wolf packs had been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from their original ranges, but have partially recovered due to conservation measures and [[Wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone|reintroduction]]. Other recovering species include the [[bald eagle]] and the [[peregrine falcon]].<ref name=USGS/>

==History==

===Indigenous people===
[[File:MesaVerdeNationalParkCliffPalace.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] ruins in Colorado]]
[[File:Cherokee Pass2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cherokee Trail]] near [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], from a sketch taken June 7, 1859]]
Since the last great ice age, the Rocky Mountains were home first to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] including the [[Apache]], [[Arapaho]], [[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Coeur d'Alene people|Coeur d'Alene]], [[Kalispel]], [[Crow Nation]], [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Shoshone]], [[Lakota people|Sioux]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Ktunaxa Kinbasket Tribal Council|Kutenai]] (Ktunaxa in Canada), [[Sekani]], [[Dunne-za]], and others. Paleo-Indians hunted the now-extinct [[mammoth]] and [[ancient bison]] (an animal 20% larger than modern bison) in the foothills and valleys of the mountains. Like the modern tribes that followed them, Paleo-Indians probably migrated to the plains in fall and winter for bison and to the mountains in spring and summer for fish, deer, elk, roots, and berries. In Colorado, along with the crest of the Continental Divide, rock walls that Native Americans built for driving game date back 5,400–5,800 years. A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that indigenous people had significant effects on mammal populations by hunting and on vegetation patterns through deliberate burning.<ref name="USGS" />

===European exploration===
Recent human history of the Rocky Mountains is one of more rapid change. The Spanish explorer [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]]—with a group of soldiers, missionaries, and African slaves—marched into the Rocky Mountain region from the south in 1540.<ref name="PBS2001">{{cite web | title = Events in the West (1528–1536) | year = 2001 | url = https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1500_1650.htm | access-date = April 15, 2012 | url-status=live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120410221051/http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1500_1650.htm | archive-date = April 10, 2012 }}</ref> In 1610, the Spanish founded the city of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], the oldest continuous seat of government in the United States, at the foot of the Rockies in present-day New Mexico. The introduction of the horse, metal tools, rifles, new diseases, and different cultures profoundly changed the Native American cultures. Native American populations were extirpated from most of their historical ranges by disease, warfare, habitat loss (eradication of the bison), and continued assaults on their culture.<ref name="USGS" />

In 1739, French [[fur trade]]rs Pierre and Paul Mallet, while journeying through the Great Plains, discovered a range of mountains at the headwaters of the [[Platte River]], which local [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes called the "Rockies", becoming the first Europeans to report on this uncharted mountain range.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1650_1800.htm|title=The West: Events from 1650 to 1800|publisher=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110706033001/https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1650_1800.htm|archive-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, the [[Oregon dispute]], was deferred until a later time.

In 1819, Spain ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, though these rights did not include possession and also included obligations to Britain and Russia concerning their claims in the same region.

===Settlement===
[[File:Silver mines, Aspen, Colorado, 1898.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aspen, Colorado]] silver mining in 1898]]
After 1802, American [[fur trader]]s and explorers ushered in the first widespread [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] presence in the Rockies south of the 49th parallel. The more famous of these include Americans [[William Henry Ashley]], [[Jim Bridger]], [[Kit Carson]], [[John Colter]], [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]], [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]], and [[Jedediah Smith]]. On July 24, 1832, [[Benjamin Bonneville]] led the first [[wagon train]] across the Rocky Mountains by using [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in the present State of Wyoming.<ref name="USGS" /> Similarly, in the wake of Mackenzie's 1793 expedition, fur trading posts were established west of the Northern Rockies in a region of the northern Interior Plateau of British Columbia which came to be known as [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]], beginning with [[McLeod Lake|Fort McLeod]] (today's community of McLeod Lake) and [[Fort Fraser, British Columbia|Fort Fraser]], but ultimately focused on Stuart Lake Post (today's [[Fort St. James]]).

Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the United States over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon Dispute]] became important in geopolitical diplomacy between the British Empire and the new American Republic. In 1841, [[James Sinclair (fur trapper)|James Sinclair]], Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, guided some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west to bolster settlement around [[Fort Vancouver]] in an attempt to retain the [[Columbia District]] for Britain. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], a region of the Rocky Mountain Trench near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south. Despite such efforts, in 1846, Britain ceded all claim to Columbia District lands south of the 49th parallel to the United States; as resolution to the Oregon boundary dispute by the [[Oregon Treaty]].<ref name="CSPN">{{cite web|title=Historical Context and American Policy |url=http://content.lib.washington.edu/curriculumpackets/treaties/assimilation2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513112547/http://content.lib.washington.edu/curriculumpackets/treaties/assimilation2.html |archive-date=May 13, 2012 |access-date=April 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Industry and development===
[[File:Rig wind river.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Drilling rig]] for natural gas near the [[Wind River Range]]]]

Economic resources of the Rocky Mountains are varied and abundant. Minerals found in the Rocky Mountains include significant deposits of copper, gold, lead, [[molybdenum]], silver, [[tungsten]], and [[zinc]]. The Wyoming Basin and several smaller areas contain significant reserves of coal, natural gas, [[oil shale]], and petroleum. For example, the [[Climax, Colorado|Climax]] mine, located near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]], Colorado, was the largest producer of molybdenum in the world. Molybdenum is used in heat-resistant steel in such things as cars and planes. The Climax mine employed over 3,000 workers. The [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]] mine of northern Idaho produces silver, lead, and zinc. Canada's largest coal mines are near [[Fernie, British Columbia]] and [[Sparwood, British Columbia]]; additional coal mines exist near [[Hinton, Alberta|Hinton]], Alberta, and in the [[Northern Rocky Mountains|Northern Rockies]] surrounding [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia]].<ref name="USGS" />

Abandoned mines with their wakes of mine tailings and toxic wastes dot the Rocky Mountain landscape. In one major example, eighty years of zinc mining profoundly polluted the river and bank near [[Eagle River (Colorado)|Eagle River]] in north-central Colorado. High concentrations of the metal carried by spring runoff harmed [[algae]], [[moss]], and [[trout]] populations. An economic analysis of mining effects at this site revealed declining property values, degraded water quality, and the loss of recreational opportunities. The analysis also revealed that cleanup of the river could yield $2.3&nbsp;million in additional revenue from recreation. In 1983, the former owner of the zinc mine was sued by the Colorado Attorney General for the $4.8&nbsp;million cleanup costs; five years later, ecological recovery was considerable.<ref name="USGS"/><ref name="Brandt93">{{cite journal|last=Brandt|first=E.|year=1993|title=How much is a gray wolf worth?|journal=National Wildlife|volume=31|page=412}}</ref>

The Rocky Mountains contain several [[sedimentary basin]]s that are rich in [[coalbed methane]]. Coalbed methane is natural gas that arises from coal, either through bacterial action or through exposure to high temperature. Coalbed methane supplies 7 percent of the natural gas used in the United States. The largest coalbed methane sources in the Rocky Mountains are in the [[San Juan Basin]] in New Mexico and Colorado and the [[Powder River Basin]] in Wyoming. These two basins are estimated to contain 38&nbsp;trillion cubic feet of gas. Coalbed methane can be recovered by dewatering the coal bed, and separating the gas from the water; or injecting water to fracture the coal to release the gas (so-called [[hydraulic fracturing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-158-02/fs-158-02.html|title=Coal-Bed Gas Resources of the Rocky Mountain Region|publisher=USGS|id=USGS fact sheet 158-02|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628182640/http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs-158-02/fs-158-02.html|archive-date=June 28, 2012}}</ref>

Agriculture and forestry are major industries. Agriculture includes dryland and irrigated farming and livestock grazing. Livestock are frequently moved between high-elevation summer [[pasture]]s and low-elevation winter pastures, a practice known as [[transhumance]].<ref name="USGS" />
