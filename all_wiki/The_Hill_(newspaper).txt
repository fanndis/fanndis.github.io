'''''The Hill''''' is an American news [[website]], based in [[Washington, D.C.]] which began as a [[newspaper]] publisher in 1994.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/contact/about-us|title=Who we are|last=|first=|date=|work=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref><ref name="nytimes" >{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/25/us/new-paper-to-vie-for-readers-on-capitol-hill.html|title=New paper to vie for readers on Capitol Hill |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> It is owned by Capitol Hill Publishing, which is owned by News Communications, Inc.

Focusing on politics, policy, business and international relations, ''The Hill'' coverage includes the [[United_States_Congress|U.S. Congress]], the presidency, and election campaigns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/new-and-old-political-media-are-battling-dominance-centurys-wildest-election-170151/|title=New and Old Political Media Are Battling for Dominance in the Century's Wildest Election|newspaper=AdWeek|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref> On its website, ''The Hill'' describes its output as "nonpartisan reporting on the inner workings of Congress and the nexus of politics and business".<ref>{{cite web |title=Contact Us |url=https://thehill.com/contact |work={{no selflink|The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill}} |orig-year=First published August 5, 2009 |date=July 18, 2018 |accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>

A significant part of the publication’s appeal is the perception of its non-partisanship. According to a [[Knight Foundation]] study, ''The Hill'' is generally read by a [[moderate]] audience, leaning slightly toward the [[Right-wing politics|right]].<ref>https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/American-Views-2020-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf</ref> The publication, which primarily competes with ''[[Politico]]'', features a wide variety of editorial views across the political spectrum; however, it generally has more conservative columnists and contributors. Non-editorial content generally focuses on strict reporting, unlike ''Politico'', which tends to provide more commentary and analysis.

==History==
===Founding and early years===
[[File:The Hill vending box DC.jpg|thumb|Vending box for ''The Hill'' on K Street.]]
The paper was founded in 1994 by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Power broker (politics)|power broker]] and New York businessman [[Jerry Finkelstein]] and Martin Tolchin, a former correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=":0" /> 

''The Hill'' was founded in 1994 under the company News Communications, Inc.<ref>{{Cite news

New York [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Gary Ackerman|Gary L. Ackerman]] was a major shareholder of News Communications.<ref name=":0" />

''The Hill''{{-'}}s first editor was Martin Tolchin, a former correspondent in the Washington bureau of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name="nytimes" /> In 2003, Hugo Gurdon<ref name="about" /> (previously industrial editor at ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and founding managing editor of the ''[[National Post]]'') became ''The Hill''{{-'}}s [[editor-in-chief]]. Gurdon turned ''The Hill'' from a weekly paper into a daily during congressional sessions.

===Founder's death===
In 2012, founder Jerry Finkelstein died and left the organization to his son, James "Jimmy" A. Finkelstein <ref name="about" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/nyregion/jerry-finkelstein-new-york-power-broker-dies-at-96.html|title=Jerry Finkelstein, New York Power Broker, Dies at 96|last=Mcfadden|first=Robert D.|date=November 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 24, 2016}}</ref> 

In 2014, Gurdon left for the ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' and was replaced by his managing editor, Bob Cusack.<ref name="Cusack" />

Cusack currently serves as the editor-in-chief, with Peter Greenberger as the publisher, and Ian Swanson as managing editor.<ref name="about" />

===John Solomon===
In 2017 owner Jimmy Finkelstein hired political commentator [[John Solomon (political commentator)|John Solomon]] as a journalist. Solomon reported directly to Finkelstein which removed him entirely from normal editorial oversight.<ref name="CNN 2019" /> Solomon regularly inserted material from advertisers into journalistic copy, leading to protests from ''The Hill''{{-'}}s publisher, who subsequently left the paper.<ref name="propublica-2019">{{Cite news

===2019===
In January 2019, [[WarnerMedia]]'s [[CNN]] reported that Finkelstein was interfering in the [[editorial independence]] of the paper in an inappropriate way to minimize criticism of American President [[Donald Trump]]. They reported that staff were "in revolt" over Finkelstein's ownership style.<ref name="CNN 2019">{{cite web |first1=Brian|last1=Stelter |first2=Oliver|last2=Darcy|title=Jimmy Finkelstein, the owner of The Hill, has flown under the radar.

In September John Solomon left The Hill.<ref name="CNN 2019" />

===2020===
As of 2020, the newspaper claims to have more than 24,000 print readers.<ref name="about"/> ''The Hill'' is distributed for free in newspaper boxes around the U.S. Capitol building, and mailed directly to all congressional offices.

The founder's son James "Jimmy" A. Finkelstein serves as its chairman.<ref name="about"/>

In January 2020, ''[[Politico]]'' reported that the owner is looking for potential buyers of ''The Hill''.<ref name="Hill seeks buyers">{{cite web|first1=Daniel|last1=Lippman|first2=Tina|last2=Nguyen|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/03/the-hill-sale-ukraine-finkelstein-093576|title=The Hill’s owner seeks potential buyers, investors|quote=Jimmy Finkelstein, owner of The Hill, is shopping his publication &hellip; to various media owners}}</ref> The same report claimed a senior Hill employee told Politico that Jimmy Finkelstein attended the second 2016 presidential debate as a Trump campaign guest.<ref name="Hill seeks buyers" />

In June 2020, ''Politico'' reported that Jimmy Finkelstein's wife, Pamela Gross, was involved in getting [[Melania Trump]] acclimated to living and working in the White House.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/30/publishers-wife-played-undisclosed-role-for-melania-trump-345053|title=Publisher's wife played undisclosed role for Melania Trump|website=POLITICO}}</ref>  Gross' unpaid arrangement was not disclosed in the several dozen articles ''The Hill'' published about the First Lady while Gross was advising her from August 2017 to February 2018, nor were more than a select few ''Hill'' employees informed that their boss' wife was an East Wing adviser.
