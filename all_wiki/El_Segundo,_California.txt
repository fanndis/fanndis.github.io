'''El Segundo''' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|g|ʌ|n|d|oʊ}} is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States]]. ''El Segundo'', from Spanish, means "The Second".<ref>{{cite web|title=Google Translate|url=https://translate.google.com/#es/en/El%20Segundo|access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> Located on the [[Santa Monica Bay]], it was incorporated on January 18, 1917, and part of the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] Cities Council of Governments. The population was 16,654 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], slightly up from 16,033 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].

==History==
The El Segundo and Los Angeles coastal area was first settled by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] (or Gabrieleños) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes thousands of years ago. The area was once a part of ''[[Rancho Sausal Redondo]]'' ("Round Willow Patch Ranch"). Rancho Sausal Redondo extended from [[Playa del Rey, Los Angeles|Playa Del Rey]] in the north to Redondo Beach in the south. Originally a Mexican land grant owned by Antonio Ygnacio Avila, the rancho was later purchased by a Scottish baronet named Sir Robert Burnett. After his return to Scotland, the property was purchased by then-manager of the rancho, [[Daniel Freeman (Los Angeles County)|Daniel Freeman]]. Daniel Freeman sold portions of the rancho to several persons. [[George H. Peck]] owned the {{convert|840|acre|km2}} of land where the Chevron Refinery now sits. Peck also developed land in neighboring El Porto, where a street still bears his name. The city earned its name ("the second" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) as it was the site of the second [[Standard Oil]] refinery on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] (the first was at [[Chevron Richmond Refinery|Richmond]] in Northern California), when [[Chevron Corporation|Standard Oil of California]] purchased the farm land in 1911. 
[[File:StandardOil1920.jpg|thumb|left|200px|El Segundo and Standard Oil Refinery, c. 1924]]

The city was incorporated in 1917. The Standard Oil Company was renamed [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] in 1984. The El Segundo refinery entered its second century of operation in 2011.<ref>Hunter, Eileen Curry.

The [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] plant in El Segundo was one of the major aircraft manufacturing facilities in California during World War II. It was one of the major producers of [[SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers, which achieved fame in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The facility, now operated by [[Northrop Grumman]], is still an aircraft plant.<ref>Herman, Arthur.

The El Segundo power plant is operated by the American energy company [[NRG Energy|NRG]]. In an effort to combine sustainable and environmentally friendly techniques with fossil power generation, NRG was to create a new [[combined cycle]] power island, providing power for 240,000 households. The new power plant, slated to go online in 2013, was to use two generators: a Siemens [[gas turbine]]<ref name="Siemens gas turbine">{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.siemens.com/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency.html?tab=Power-generations |title=Energy efficiency - Siemens USA |publisher=Usa.siemens.com |date=2013-01-30 |access-date=2013-02-08}}</ref> and an additional steam turbine. Natural gas drives the gas turbine, while the hot exhaust gases generate steam for the steam turbine. The efficiency of the power plant will be increased up to 58%. A huge environmental advantage of this type of power plant is that in combustion, natural gas generates relatively little carbon dioxide compared to other fossil fuels.

The current Boeing factory, the [[Boeing Satellite Development Center]], was originally built by [[Nash Motors]] in 1946 and opened in 1948.
