===Inception===
Weight Watchers was conceived by [[Jean Nidetch]], a housewife and mother living in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], who had been overweight most of her life and had tried [[Anti-obesity medication|pills]], [[hypnosis]], and numerous fad diets, all of which only led to regained weight.<ref name=NYTobit/> When in 1961 at the age of 38 she weighed 214 pounds and an acquaintance mistook her for being pregnant, she entered a free 10-week weight-loss program sponsored by the [[New York City Board of Health]]'s obesity clinic.<ref name=fatcontrollers>Allan, Vicky.
