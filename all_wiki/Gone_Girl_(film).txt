==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. As of May 3, 2020, the word count for this plot summary is 699 words. -->
On their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy missing. Her disappearance receives press coverage, as Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular ''Amazing Amy'' children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle in the house. Suspicion mounts around Nick, whose apathy is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a [[sociopath]] and even sows doubt in his twin sister Margo.

Flashbacks reveal how Amy and Nick first met. Amy later revealed to Nick that ''Amazing Amy'' was a perfected version made up of the real Amy's failures. Their marriage disintegrated over time; both lost their jobs in the [[Great Recession|recession]] and moved from New York City to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, [[Missouri]]. Nick became lazy and distant, and began cheating on Amy with Andie, one of his students, while Amy became increasingly resentful towards Nick for making her move with him to Missouri, having loved her life in New York City.

[[Forensic]] analysis of the house uncovers cleaned bloodstains, indicating a probable murder. Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles, domestic disputes, and Amy's recent willingness to purchase a gun. Medical reports indicate that Amy is pregnant, which Nick denies knowing. Amy and Nick had played [[Scavenger hunt|treasure hunt]] games on every wedding anniversary; this year's clues include profligate items purchased with Nick's card, as well as a diary highlighting Amy's growing isolation and ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.

Amy is revealed to be alive and well, having gone into hiding in a campground in the [[Ozarks]]. Upon discovering Nick's [[Extramarital sex|affair]], she concocted an elaborate plan to punish him by framing him for her murder and making his motive appear to be monetary in nature. She fabricated a long-standing diary that was accurate in its early entries but later evolved into false accounts of [[Intimate partner violence|spousal violence]] and her increasing fear of Nick. She befriended a pregnant neighbor, told her fake stories about Nick's temper, and stole her urine to fake pregnancy results, all while hiding the friendship from Nick. She planted corroborating evidence of Nick's guilt in the clue spots for the "treasure hunt" for the police to find. She also splattered her own blood across the kitchen, and cleaned it haphazardly. She anticipated that Nick would be convicted and [[Capital punishment in Missouri|executed]] for her murder, and contemplated committing [[suicide]] after his conviction.

Nick deduces Amy's plan and convinces Margo of his innocence. He flies to [[New York City|New York]] and meets Tanner Bolt, a lawyer known for representing men accused of killing their wives. Nick also meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Tommy O'Hara, who says that Amy had falsely accused him of rape, planting evidence around his house and forcing him to register as a [[sex offender]] to avoid jail. Nick approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy previously filed a [[restraining order]], but Desi turns him away, refusing to share any details.

When Amy's campground neighbors rob her of her money, she calls Desi for help, convincing him that she fled from Nick's abuse. Desi agrees to hide her in his lake house. After Andie reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show professing his innocence and apologizing for his failures as a husband, in the hope of luring Amy. The show airs shortly before the treasure hunt clues land Nick arrested for murder. However, his performance rekindles Amy's feelings for him and modifies her plans. She uses Desi's surveillance cameras to help make it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She seduces Desi, murders him with a [[Utility knife|box cutter]], and returns home covered in his blood, clearing Nick of suspicion.

When Boney probes into the holes in her story, Amy chastises her as incompetent. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sides with Amy, forcing Boney to back down. Amy tells Nick the truth and admits to Desi's murder, saying that the man she watched pleading for her return on TV is the man she wants him to become again. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but they have no evidence of her guilt.

Nick intends to leave Amy, but she reveals she is pregnant, having [[Artificial insemination|inseminated]] herself with Nick's sperm stored at a fertility clinic. Nick reacts violently to Amy's insistence that they remain married, but feels responsible for the child. Despite Margo's objections, he reluctantly decides to stay with Amy. The "happy" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.

===Development===
[[File:Gone Girl Premiere at the 52nd New York Film Festival P1070636 (15347765806).jpg|thumb|[[David Fincher]] and [[Gillian Flynn]] at the film's premiere at the [[2014 New York Film Festival|52nd New York Film Festival]]]]
''Gone Girl'' is a [[film adaptation]] of Flynn's 2012 [[Gone Girl (novel)|novel of the same name]]. One of the film's executive producers, [[Leslie Dixon]], read the manuscript of the novel in 2011 and brought it to the attention of [[Reese Witherspoon]] (who was originally slated to play Amy) in December of that year. Witherspoon and Dixon then collaborated with [[Bruna Papandrea]] to further develop the manuscript—with Flynn's film agent, Shari Smiley, they met with film studios in early 2012.<ref>{{cite news | last=Cohen | first=Stefanie | url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303933704577533281470058056 | title=A Surprise Hit Spawns a Movie Deal | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=July 19, 2013 | access-date=January 21, 2014 }}</ref>

Following the release of the novel in June 2012, the 20th Century Fox studio [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the book in a deal with Flynn, in which the author negotiated that she would be responsible for the first draft of the screenplay. By around October 2012, Flynn was engaged in the production of the first draft while she was also involved in the promotional tour for her novel. A first-time screenwriter at the time, Flynn later admitted: "I certainly felt at sea a lot of times, kind of finding my way through."<ref name="Gin">{{cite news|author1=Gina McIntyre|title=Thrills, chills for Gillian Flynn in adapting 'Gone Girl'|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-sneaks-gone-girl-20140907-story.html|access-date=November 16, 2014|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

Flynn submitted her first draft screenplay to the Fox studio in December 2012, before Fincher was selected as the director for the project.<ref name="Kan">{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article2244292.html|title=Author Gillian Flynn says filming 'Gone Girl' went much better than expected|work=kansascity|access-date=November 4, 2014}}</ref> Fincher had already expressed interest in the project, and after he finished reading Flynn's first draft, a meeting was scheduled between the director and author within days. Typically, authors are removed from film adaptations following the first draft and an experienced screenwriter takes over; but, on this occasion, Fincher agreed to work with Flynn for the entire project. Flynn later explained: "... he [Fincher] responded to the first draft and we have kind of similar sensibilities. We liked the same things about the book, and we wanted the same thing out of the movie."<ref name="Joe">{{cite web|author1=Joe Berkowitz|title=How Gillian Flynn Adapted Her Biggest Novel, 'Gone Girl,' Into Her First Screenplay|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3036579/how-gillian-flynn-adapted-her-biggest-novel-gone-girl-into-her-first-screenplay|website=Fast CoCreate|publisher=Monsueto Ventures|access-date=November 16, 2014|date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

As further preparation, Flynn studied screenplay books and also met with [[Steve Kloves]], who wrote the scripts for the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]].<ref name="Joe" /> Fincher also provided guidance and advised the author: "We don't have the ability to gift the audience with the characters' thoughts, so tell me how they're behaving."<ref name="Corn">{{cite web|first1=Audie |last1=Cornish|title= David Fincher Talks 'Gone Girl,' Avoids Spoilers (Hooray!)|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=353017242|website=NPR|publisher=NPR|access-date=November 15, 2014|date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> During the production of the final screenplay, Fincher and Flynn engaged in an intensive back-and-forth working relationship: Flynn sent Fincher "big swaths" of writing, which he then reviewed, and Fincher would then discuss the swaths with Flynn by telephone. Eventually, some scenes were rewritten "a dozen times", while other scenes were unaltered.<ref name="Gin" />

Following the release of the film, Flynn spoke of an overwhelming adaptation process, in which she tackled a 500-page book with an intricate plot; she explained that her experience working for a magazine meant that she "wasn't ever precious about cutting." As a consequence of the distillation process, most of the parental storylines were lost, so the mother of the character of Desi Collings does not appear in the film, and it was not possible to include flashbacks of Nick Dunne's dead mother.<ref name="Vine">{{cite web|author1=Jennifer Vineyard|title=Gone Girl's Gillian Flynn on Cool Girls and David Fincher|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/10/gone-girls-gillian-flynn-on-cool-girls.html|website=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=November 16, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

In terms of the film's ending, Flynn revealed that she experimented with a "lot of iterations". One of the aspects that she was certain of was the presence of the media, which she described as the "third player", alongside Nick and Amy. In Flynn's words: "Once we got to the ending, I wanted it to wrap up quickly. I didn't want 8 million more loop-de-loops ... I had no problem tossing stuff out and trying to figure out the best way to get there."<ref name="Joe" />

Flynn enjoyed the experience of making the film, and she expressed appreciation for Fincher's involvement, as he "really liked the book and didn't want to turn it into something other than what it already was", and he also reassured her, even when she second-guessed herself.<ref name="Kan" /> Fincher described Flynn's screenwriting work as "very smart", "crafty", and "extremely articulate".<ref name="Gin" /><ref name="Corn" />

===Filming===
On September 11, 2013, the ''Gone Girl'' film crew began filming [[establishing shot]]s.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Gone Girl'' starts filming in Cape Girardeau|url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/23414551/gone-girl-starts-filming-in-cape-girardeau|access-date=September 13, 2013 |newspaper= KFVS12.com|date=September 12, 2013}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began on September 15 in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], and was scheduled to last about five weeks.<ref>{{cite news|title=''Gone Girl'' movie filming scenes in Cape Girardeau|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2013/09/11/4473370/gone-girl-movie-filming-scenes.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916005139/http://www.kansascity.com/2013/09/11/4473370/gone-girl-movie-filming-scenes.html| archivedate=September 16, 2013| url-status=dead| access-date=October 5, 2014|newspaper=KansasCity.com|date=September 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name="sem">{{cite news|title=Producer: ''Gone Girl'' filming here|url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/2002405.html|access-date=September 13, 2013|newspaper=semissourian.com|date=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Some interior scenes were filmed in Los Angeles,<ref name="sem" /> with a door that could not be replicated being shipped there from Cape Girardeau.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kristine |last=Hansen |url=https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/gone-girl-house-missouri/ |title=Get the 'Gone Girl' House Before It Vanishes From the Market |website=Realtor.com |date=July 7, 2017 }}</ref>

According to producer Ceán Chaffin, Fincher took, on average, as many as 50 takes for each scene,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasvegas.informermg.com/2014/10/01/gone-girl-movie-review/|title=GONE GIRL Movie Review|publisher=Lasvegas.informermg.com|access-date=November 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105604/http://lasvegas.informermg.com/2014/10/01/gone-girl-movie-review/|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> while Flynn has said that, although Fincher is a visual director, he is meticulous about [[wikt:veracity|veracity]]—Fincher changed a scene in which Amy collects her own blood, as he thought it was unbelievable.<ref name="Vine" />

Production was shut down for four days when Affleck, a [[Boston Red Sox]] fan, refused to wear a [[New York Yankees]] cap for a scene. Eventually, Fincher and Affleck reached a compromise and Affleck wore a [[New York Mets]] hat for the scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/ben-affleck-david-fincher-spat/|title=Ben Affleck and David Fincher's Spat in a Hat|first=Cara|last=Buckley|date=October 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/ben-affleck-shut-down-gone-girl-production-over-a-yankees-cap-231373/|title=Ben Affleck Shut Down 'Gone Girl' Filming Over a Yankees Cap|first1=Scott|last1=Rafferty|date=July 10, 2015|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/10/david-fincher-and-ben-affleck-beefed-over-a-new-york-yankees-hat-on-the-set-of-gone-girl-271638/|title=David Fincher And Ben Affleck Beefed Over A New York Yankees Hat On The Set Of 'Gone Girl'|first1=Kevin|last1=Jagernauth|date=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

Fincher later called Affleck "extremely bright" in regard to the manner in which he drew on his own experience with the media for the character of Nick Dunne. Fincher explained that Affleck "has a great sense of humor and great wit about what this situation is and how frustrating it is". Fincher described the behavior of the media in the film as "tragedy vampirism", but clarified that "''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[NPR]] are not in the flowerbeds of the Dunne house".<ref name="Corn" />

==Music==
{{main|Gone Girl (soundtrack)}}
[[File:NIN2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Trent Reznor]] co-wrote the film's score.]]
On January 21, 2014, [[Trent Reznor]] announced that he and [[Atticus Ross]] would provide the [[Film score|score]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/trent_reznor/status/425680863968256001 |title=Twitter / trent_reznor: and yes, Atticus and I are |publisher=Twitter.com |date=January 21, 2014 |access-date=March 3, 2014}}</ref> marking their third collaboration with Fincher, following ''[[The Social Network]]'' and ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]''. Fincher was inspired by music he heard while at an appointment with a chiropractor and tasked Reznor with creating the musical equivalent of an insincere façade. Reznor explained Fincher's request in an interview:

{{quote|David [Fincher] was at the chiropractor and heard this music that was inauthentically trying to make him feel OK, and that became a perfect metaphor for this film ... The challenge was, simply, what is the musical equivalent of the same sort of facade of comfort and a feeling of insincerity that that music represented?

===Critical response===
[[File:RosamundPikeJan2011.jpg|thumb|[[Rosamund Pike]]'s performance garnered widespread critical acclaim and earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].]]

''Gone Girl'' received largely positive reviews<!-- NOTE: Do not add "critical acclaim" without a WP:Reliable source supporting it. --> from critics, with Pike's performance in particular earning widespread acclaim. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 87%, based on 358 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Dark, intelligent, and stylish to a fault, ''Gone Girl'' plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of stars Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike."<ref name="tomatoes" /> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] score of 79 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="metacritic" /> Audiences surveyed by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a B grade.<ref name="mojo-3921">{{cite web |title= Weekend Report: Moviegoers Thrill to 'Gone Girl,' 'Annabelle' This Weekend |first= Ray |last= Subers |date= October 5, 2014 |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3921 | website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-david-finchers-gone-738181 |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |title=Box Office: David Fincher's 'Gone Girl' Tops 'Annabelle' With Career-Best $38M |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 5, 2014 |access-date=October 18, 2014}}</ref>

The ''[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]]''{{'}}s critics praised the direction, screenplay, editing, score, visual style, and acting, particularly from Pike, Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, and Missi Pyle.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kyle Buchanan |author2= Lindsey Weber|title=What Were the Best Parts of Gone Girl?|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/10/what-were-the-best-parts-of-gone-girl.html|website=Vulture|access-date=December 4, 2014|date=October 7, 2014}}</ref> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: "Superbly cast from the two at the top to the smallest speaking parts, impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to within an inch of its life, ''Gone Girl'' shows the remarkable things that can happen when filmmaker and material are this well matched."<ref>{{cite news |title='Gone Girl' finds David Fincher at delightfully twisted best|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-gone-girl-review-20140926-column.html |first=Kenneth |last=Turan |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 25, 2014 |access-date=September 30, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' called the film a "brilliantly glacial adaptation ... This may not be the perfect film—but it is a perfect adaptation".<ref name="TheEcon" />

Joshua Rothman wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that he enjoyed the film "in all its abstract, intellectual, postmodern glory" and that, similar to other post-modern narratives, the film adaptation is "decisively unreal ... [the] heroes and villains in Fincher's ''Gone Girl'' aren't people but stories". Rothman, who draws parallels between ''Gone Girl'' and Fincher's 1999 adaptation ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', decides that the film is ultimately a farce and has resonated with filmgoers because it expresses "a creepy, confused, and troubling part of us".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Joshua Rothman|title=What "Gone Girl" Is Really About|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/gone-girl-really|website=The New Yorker|access-date=November 16, 2014|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

[[Anthony Lane]] of ''The New Yorker'' wrote: "At first blush, ''Gone Girl'' is natural Fincherland ... so why doesn't the movie claw us as ''The Social Network'' did? Who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website?"<ref name="theny" /> ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Ed Gonzalez awarded the film two out of four stars, concluding: "Fincher and Flynn should have gone further and truly grappled with the real horror that, by giving his relationship with Amy another chance, Nick is indulging in one of the great myths of feminism: that it emasculates men. Rather than undermine that noxiousness, Fincher enshrouds it in funereal brushstrokes that cast his ''Gone Girl'' as a fashionable tumbling into an abyss of willful denial."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Ed Gonzalez|title=Film Review: Gone Girl|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/gone-girl|website=Slant Magazine|access-date=November 11, 2014|date=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

In response to some of the criticisms of the film, Flynn said, "The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn't keep it up, so they destroy each other".<ref>[[Maureen Dowd]] (12 October 2014), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-lady-psychopaths-welcome.html Lady psychopaths welcome]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.&nbsp;SR11.</ref>

==Gender themes==
In a 2013 interview with ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine, writer Novid Parsi, who described the ending of the novel as "polarizing", Flynn explained that she wanted the novel to counter the notion that "[["Women are wonderful" effect|women are naturally good]]" and to show that women are "just as violently minded as men are".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Novid Parsi|title=Gillian Flynn on Gone Girl – Interview|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/books/gillian-flynn-on-gone-girl-interview|website=Time Out Chicago|publisher=Time Out Media|access-date=November 11, 2014|date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> In a November 2014 interview, Flynn admitted that the critical gender-related response did affect her: "I had about 24 hours where I hovered under my covers and was like: 'I killed feminism. Why did I do that? Rats. I did not mean to do that.' And then I very quickly kind of felt comfortable with what I had written."<ref>{{cite news|author1=Cara Buckley|title=Gone Girls, Found Talking With the Authors of 'Gone Girl' and 'Wild'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/talking-with-the-authors-of-gone-girl-and-wild.html|access-date=November 20, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2014}}</ref>

In an October 3, 2014, blog post for ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'', Natalie Wilson argues that by not addressing Amy's [[privilege (social inequality)|social privilege]] which affords her the "necessary funds, skills, know-how and spare time" to stage a disappearance—''Gone Girl'' is the "crystallization of a thousand [[Misogyny|misogynist]] myths and fears about female behavior."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Natalie Wilson|title=Blog: What's Missing From the Gone Girl Debate?

In an October 6, 2014, article titled "''Gone Girl''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Biggest Villain Is Marriage Itself", ''Jezebel''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Jessica Coen wrote: "Movie Amy pales in comparison to the vivid character we meet in the book. Strip away Book Amy's complexities and you're left with little more than 'crazy fucking bitch.' That makes her no less captivating, but it does make the film feel a lot more misogynistic than the novel."<ref name="Jez">{{cite web|author1=Jessica Coen|title=Gone Girl's Biggest Villain Is Marriage Itself|url=http://jezebel.com/gone-girl-s-biggest-villain-is-marriage-itself-1642978659|website=Jezebel|publisher=Kinja|access-date=November 11, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Coen concedes that this did not negate her enjoyment of the film, "as we ladies are well accustomed to these injustices."<ref name="Jez" /> ''Time''{{'}}s Eliana Dockterman wrote on the same date that ''Gone Girl'' is both "a sexist portrayal of a crazy woman" and a "feminist manifesto", and that this duality makes the film interesting.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eliana Dockterman|title=Is Gone Girl Feminist or Misogynist?|url=http://time.com/3472314/gone-girl-movie-book-feminist-misogynist/|website=Time|publisher=Time|access-date=November 11, 2014|date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Zoë Heller of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' wrote: "The problem with Amy is not that she acts in vicious and reprehensible ways, or even that her behavior lends credence to certain misogynist fantasies. The problem is that she isn't really a character, but rather an animation of a not very interesting idea about the female capacity for nastiness", concluding that "The film is a piece of silliness, not powerful enough in the end to engender proper 'disapproval': only wonder at its coarseness and perhaps mild dismay at its critical success."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Hard Work of Marriage |first=Zoë |last=Heller|newspaper=[[The New York Review of Books]] |date=December 4, 2014 |access-date=December 21, 2014 |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/dec/04/gone-girl-hard-work-marriage/}}</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on October 6, 2014, Joan Smith criticized what she saw as the film's "recycling of [[rape myth]]s", citing research released in 2013 which stated that false allegations of rape in the UK were extremely rare.<ref name="Joan">{{cite news|author1=Joan Smith|title=Gone Girl's recycling of rape myths is a disgusting distortion|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/06/gone-girl-rape-domestic-violence-ben-affleck#start-of-comments|access-date=November 11, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> She wrote: "The characters live in a parallel universe where the immediate reaction to a woman who says she's been assaulted is one of chivalrous concern.

Tim Kroenert, of the Australian website Eureka Street wrote on October 8, 2014, that the film's predominant focus upon Nick's perspective "serves to obfuscate Amy's motives (though it is possible that she is simply a sociopath), and to amplify her personification of ... anti-women myths"; however, Kroenert concludes that ''Gone Girl'' is "a compelling rumination on the impossibility of knowing the mind of another, even within that ostensibly most intimate of relationships, marriage."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Kroenert|title=Gone Girl promotes conversations about misogyny|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/(S(1hvle1mn0yvj3b45co1tsozp))/article.aspx?aeid=42063|website=EurekaStreet.com.au|publisher=Jesuit Communications Australia|access-date=December 6, 2014|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>
