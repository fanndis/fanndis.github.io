In [[music]], '''sampling''' is the reuse of a portion (or '''sample''') of a [[sound recording]] in another recording. Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds, or entire bars of music, and may be layered, [[Equalization (audio)|equalized]], sped up or slowed down, repitched, [[Loop (music)|looped]], or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware ([[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]]) or software such as [[digital audio workstation]]s.

A process similar to sampling originated in the 1940s with ''[[musique concrète]]'', experimental music created by [[Tape splice|splicing]] and [[Tape loop|looping tape]]. The mid-20th century saw the introduction of keyboard instruments that played back sounds recorded on tape, such as the [[Mellotron]]. The term ''sampling'' was coined in the late 1970s by the creators of the [[Fairlight CMI]], a synthesizer with sampling features. Initially, samplers were unaffordable for most musicians and could only play back short sounds; as technology improved, cheaper samplers with more [[Computer memory|memory]] emerged, such as the [[E-mu Emulator]], [[Akai S900|Akai S950]], and [[Akai MPC]].

Sampling is a foundation of [[hip hop music]], which emerged with 1980s producers sampling [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] records, particularly [[drum break]]s, to be [[Rapping|rapped]] over. Sampling has since influenced all genres of music, particularly [[electronic music]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. Samples such as the [[Amen break]], "[[Funky Drummer]]" drum break, and [[orchestra hit]] have been used in thousands of recordings. The first album created entirely from samples, ''[[Endtroducing.....|Endtroducing]]'' by [[DJ Shadow]], was released in 1996.

Sampling without permission can [[Copyright infringement|infringe copyright]]. The process of acquiring permission for a sample is known as '''clearance''', a potentially complex and costly process. Landmark legal cases, such as ''[[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.|Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc]]'' (1991), changed how samples are used since the court ruled that unlicensed sampling constitutes [[copyright infringement]], samples from well known sources are now often prohibitively expensive.

== Precursors ==
[[File:Phonogene.jpg|thumb|234x234px|The Phonogene, a 1940s instrument which plays back sounds from tape loops]]
In the 1940s, French composer [[Pierre Schaeffer]] developed ''[[musique concrète]]'', an experimental form of music created by [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|recording sounds to tape]], splicing them, and manipulating them to create [[sound collage]]s. He used sounds from sources such as the human body, locomotives, and kitchen utensils.<ref name=":0" /> The method also involved [[tape loop]]s, splicing lengths of tape end to end so a sound could be played indefinitely.<ref name=":0" /> Schaeffer developed the [[Phonogene]], which played loops at 12 different pitches triggered by a keyboard.<ref name=":0" />

Composers including [[John Cage]], [[Edgard Varèse|Edgar Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Karheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Iannis Xenakis]] experimented with ''musique concrète,''<ref name=":0" /> and [[Bebe and Louis Barron]] used it to create the first totally electronic film soundtrack, for the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''. ''Musique concrète'' was brought to a mainstream audience by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], which used these early sampling techniques to produce soundtracks for shows including ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In the 1960s, Jamaican [[Dub music|dub reggae]] producers such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] began using pre-recorded samples of [[reggae]] rhythms to produce [[riddim]] tracks, which were then [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejayed]] over.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goNpkxHhH48C&pg=PA55|title=Reggae Wisdom: Proverbs in Jamaican Music|year=2001|publisher=Univ.

[[File:Fairlight.JPG|thumb|The Fairlight CMI, a sampler and synthesizer released in 1979. The designers coined the term ''sampling'' to describe its features]]
[[The Guardian|The ''Guardian'']] described the [[Chamberlin]] as the first sampler, developed by the English engineer Harry Chamberlin in the 1940s. The Chamberlin used a keyboard to trigger a series of tape decks, each containing eight seconds of recorded sound. Similar technology was popularised in the 60s with the [[Mellotron]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/28/whats-that-sound-sampler|title=Hey, what's that sound: Sampler|last=McNamee|first=David|date=2009-09-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304190836/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/28/whats-that-sound-sampler|archive-date=4 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1969, the English engineer [[Peter Zinovieff]] developed the first digital sampler, the EMS Musys.<ref name=":1" />

He recalled in 2005:

By today's standards it was a pretty awful piano sound, but at the time it was a million times more like a piano than anything any synthesiser had churned out.

== Legal and ethical issues ==
To legally use a sample, an artist must acquire legal permission from the copyright holder, a potentially lengthy and complex process known as clearance.<ref name=":7" /> Sampling without permission can [[Copyright infringement|breach the copyright]] of the original sound recording, of the composition and lyrics, and of the performances, such as a rhythm or guitar riff. The [[moral rights]] of the original artist may also be breached if they are not credited or object to the sampling.<ref name=":7" /> In some cases, sampling is protected under American [[fair use]] laws,<ref name=":7" /> which grant "limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holder".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Siedel|first=George|title=The Three Pillar Model For Business Decisions: Strategy, Law, Ethics|publisher=Van Rye Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9970566-1-7|location=Michigan|pages=135}}</ref>[[File:Biz Markie 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Biz Markie]] in 2016 ]][[Richard Lewis Spencer]], who owns the copyright for the widely sampled [[Amen break]], has never received [[royalties]] for its use and condemned its sampling as [[plagiarism]].<ref name=":9" /> Journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] likened the situation to "the man who goes to the sperm bank and unknowingly sires hundreds of children".<ref name=":9" /> In 1989, the [[The Turtles|Turtles]] sued [[De La Soul]] for using an uncleared sample on their album ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]].'' Turtles singer [[Mark Volman]] told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': "Sampling is just a longer term for theft. Anybody who can honestly say sampling is some sort of creativity has never done anything creative."<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-lists/songs-on-trial-12-landmark-music-copyright-cases-166396/de-la-soul-vs-the-turtles-1991-61686/|title=Songs on Trial: 12 Landmark Music Copyright Cases|last=Runtagh|first=Jordan|date=2016-06-08|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014165007/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-lists/songs-on-trial-12-landmark-music-copyright-cases-166396/de-la-soul-vs-the-turtles-1991-61686/|archive-date=14 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and set a [[legal precedent]] that had a [[chilling effect]] on sampling in hip hop.<ref name=":3" />

In 1991, songwriter [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] sued rapper [[Biz Markie]] after he sampled O'Sullivan's "[[Alone Again (Naturally)]]" on the album ''[[I Need a Haircut]]''. The [[Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.|court ruled]] that sampling without permission infringed copyright. Instead of asking for royalties, O'Sullivan forced Biz Markie's label [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]] to recall the album until the song was removed.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&output=reader&id=7TRApef2zW4C&pg=GBS.PT94.w.5.0.78|title=Hip Hop America|last=George|first=Nelson|date=2005-04-26|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781101007303|language=en|access-date=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323224200/https://play.google.com/books/reader?printsec=frontcover&output=reader&id=7TRApef2zW4C&pg=GBS.PT94.w.5.0.78|archive-date=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Nelson George]] described it as the "most damaging example of anti-hip hop vindictiveness", which "sent a chill through the industry that is still felt".<ref name="auto" /> The ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' wrote in 2018 that "no court decision has changed the sound of pop music as much as this", likening it to banning a musical instrument.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-court-case-that-changed-hip-hop--from-public-enemy-to-kanye--forever/2012/07/06/gJQAVWr0RW_story.html|title=The court case that changed hip-hop — from Public Enemy to Kanye — forever|last=Richards|first=Chris|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012214521/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-court-case-that-changed-hip-hop--from-public-enemy-to-kanye--forever/2012/07/06/gJQAVWr0RW_story.html|archive-date=12 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the O'Sullivan lawsuit, samples on commercial recordings have typically been taken either from obscure recordings or cleared, an often expensive option only available to successful acts.<ref name=":5" /> According to the ''Guardian'', "Sampling became risky business and a rich man's game, with record labels regularly checking if their musical property had been tea-leafed."<ref name=":4" /> For less successful artists, the legal implications of using samples pose obstacles; according to ''Fact'', "For a bedroom producer, clearing a sample can be nearly impossible, both financially and in terms of administration."<ref name=":8" />

The 1989 [[Beastie Boys]] album ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'' is composed almost entirely of samples, most of which were cleared "easily and affordably"; the clearance process would be much more expensive today.<ref name="samples">{{cite journal|last=Tingen|first=Paul|date=May 2005|title=The Dust Brothers: Sampling, Remixing & The Boat Studio|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may05/articles/dust.htm|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=SOS Publications Group|issn=1473-5326|access-date=July 25, 2011|journal=[[Sound on Sound]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529161250/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may05/articles/dust.htm|archive-date=29 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2000, jazz flautist [[James Newton]] filed a claim against the Beastie Boys' 1992 single "[[Pass the Mic]]", which samples his composition "Choir". The judge found that the sample, comprising six seconds and three notes, was ''[[de minimis]]'' and did not require clearance. Newton lost appeals in 2003 and 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Beastie Boys Emerge Victorious In Sampling Suit|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65708/beastie-boys-emerge-victorious-in-sampling-suit|date=2004-11-09|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119031101/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65708/beastie-boys-emerge-victorious-in-sampling-suit|archive-date=19 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ''Washington Post'' described the modern use of well known samples, such as on records by [[Kanye West]], as an act of [[conspicuous consumption]] similar to flaunting cars or jewellery.<ref name=":5" /> West has been sued several times over his use of samples.<ref name=":8" /> Some have accused the law of restricting creativity, while others argue it forces producers to innovate.<ref name=":5" /> Sampling can help popularize the sampled work; for example, the [[Desiigner]] track "[[Panda (Desiigner song)|Panda]]" topped the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Hot]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|100]] after West sampled it on "[[Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 2]]".<ref name=":8" />

According to ''Fact'', early hip hop sampling was governed by "unspoken" rules forbidding the sampling of recent records, reissues, other hip hop records, or from non-[[Phonograph record|vinyl]] sources, among other restrictions.<ref name=":6" /> These rules were relaxed as younger producers took over: "For many producers today it is no longer a case of 'should I sample this?' but of 'can I get away with sampling this?'. Thus the ethics of sampling unravelled as the practice became ever more ubiquitous."<ref name=":6" />

In 2019, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that producers [[Moses Pelham]] and Martin Haas had illegally sampled a drum sequence from the 1977 [[Kraftwerk]] track “[[Metal on Metal (song)|Metal on Metal]]" for the [[Sabrina Setlur]] song "Nur Mir".<ref name=":13">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49162546|title=Kraftwerk win 20-year sampling copyright case|date=2019-07-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-02-01|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305163520/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49162546|archive-date=5 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The court ruled that permission was required for recognizable samples; modified, unrecognizable samples could still be used without authorisation.<ref name=":13" />

To circumvent legal problems, producers may recreate a recording rather than sample it. This requires only the publisher's permission, and gives the artist more freedom to alter constituent components such as separate guitar and drum tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/steve-gibson-dave-walters-recreating-samples|title=Steve Gibson & Dave Walters: Recreating Samples {{!}}|website=www.soundonsound.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181014165401/https://www.soundonsound.com/people/steve-gibson-dave-walters-recreating-samples|archive-date=14 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
