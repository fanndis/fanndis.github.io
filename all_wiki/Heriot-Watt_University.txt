'''Heriot-Watt University''' ({{lang-gd|Oilthigh Heriot-Watt}}) is a [[Public university|public]] [[research university]] based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. It was established in 1821 as the [[Edinburgh College of Art|School of Arts of Edinburgh]], the world's first [[mechanics' institute]], and subsequently granted university status by [[royal charter]] in 1966. It is the eighth oldest higher education institute in UK. The name Heriot-Watt was taken from Scottish inventor [[James Watt]] and Scottish philanthropist and goldsmith [[George Heriot]].

Known for its focus on science and engineering, it is one of the 39 old universities in the UK comprising the second cluster of elite universities after [[Oxbridge]].<ref name="tandfonline.com">{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03054985.2015.1082905 | volume=41 | title=Are there distinctive clusters of higher and lower status universities in the UK? | journal=Oxford Review of Education | pages=608–627| url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/14978/1/14978.pdf|issue=5| year=2015 | last1=Boliver | first1=Vikki | s2cid=143154842 }}</ref><ref name="timeshighereducation.com"/>

== History ==
[[File:Jameswatt.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=statue of James Watt|This statue of [[James Watt]] commissioned for the School of Arts today sits at Heriot-Watt's Edinburgh Campus.]]

===School of Arts of Edinburgh===

Heriot-Watt was established as the School of Arts of Edinburgh by Scottish businessman [[Leonard Horner]] on 16 October 1821. Having been inspired by [[Royal College of Science and Technology|Anderson's College]] in [[Glasgow]], Horner established the School to provide practical knowledge of science and technology to Edinburgh's working men.<ref name="EPJ">{{Citation| last=Jameson|first=R|title=Some Account of the School of Arts of Edinburgh.|journal=The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal|volume=11|pages=203–205|year=1824|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzowAAAAYAAJ&q=%22school+of+arts+of+edinburgh%22&pg=PA203}}</ref><ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|64–66}} The institution was initially of modest size, giving lectures two nights a week in rented rooms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gashe.ac.uk:443/isaar/C1239.html|title=GASHE: School of Arts, Edinburgh.|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> and boasting a small library of around 500 technical works.<ref name="EPJ" /><ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|100}} It was also oversubscribed, with admissions soon closing despite the cost of 15 shillings for a year's access to lectures and the library.<ref name="EPJ" />

The School was managed by a board of eighteen directors<ref name="EPJ" /> and primarily funded by sponsors from the middle and upper classes including [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]] and [[Walter Scott]]. It first became associated with the inventor and engineer [[James Watt]] in 1824, as a means of raising funds to secure permanent accommodation. Justifying the association, School Director [[Lord Cockburn]] said:

<blockquote>"[The building] shall be employed for the accommodation of the Edinburgh School of Arts; whereby the memory of Watt may forever be connected with the promotion, among a class of men to which he himself originally belonged, of those mechanical arts from which his own usefulness and glory arose.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|103}} "</blockquote>

In 1837, the School of Arts moved to leased accommodation on Adam Square, which it was able to purchase in 1851 thanks to funds raised in Watt's name. In honour of the purchase, the School changed its name to the Watt Institution and School of Arts in 1852.

===Watt Institution and School of Arts===

Heriot-Watt's time as the Watt Institution marked a transitional period for the organisation, as its curriculum broadened to include several subjects beyond mathematics and the physical sciences. While the School of Arts had catered almost exclusively to working-class artisans and technical workers, the Watt Institution admitted a large number of middle-class students, whom it attracted with new subjects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By 1885, the skilled working class were no longer the majority in an institution that had been created explicitly for them.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|133–135}}

A shifting class make-up was not the only demographic change to affect the student body, as in 1869 women were permitted to attend lectures for the first time. This move put the Watt Institution some way ahead of Scottish universities, who were only permitted to allow women to graduate 20 years later following the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889.<ref name="Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition)">Barnett, H. (2011). Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition). Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415578813}}</ref>{{rp|163}} The decision to admit women was made in large part owing to pressure from local campaigner [[Mary Burton]], who later became the Institution's first female director in 1874.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|133–135}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3796.html|title=Gazetteer for Scotland: Mary Burton.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>

In 1870, the Watt Institution was forced to move following the demolition of Adam Square.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|148–153}} After a brief period on Roxburgh Place, it relocated to the newly constructed [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]] near where its former site had stood. The move caused the Institution severe financial difficulties, which were compounded by a combination of declining funds from subscribers and increased costs from its growing student body. In 1873, the Directors turned to [[George Heriot]]'s Trust for support, and agreed to a merger of the Trust's endowment with the Institution's own. The proposed merger was provisional to changes in the structure of the Watt Institution, which would see the organisation become a technical college with representatives of the Trust in management positions. Accepting these changes, the Watt Institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt College''' in 1885, and was subsequently on far firmer financial ground.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|160–161}}

====The Watt Club====

{{See also|The Watt Club}}

The Watt Club was founded at the Watt Institution on 12 May 1854, and is today the oldest alumni organisation in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.hw.ac.uk/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=449|title=Heriot-Watt University: A Short History of the Watt Club.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> Following the unveiling of a statue of James Watt outside the Institution, local jeweller J.E Vernon proposed that

<blockquote>"[a club should be formed] whose object would be to sup together on the anniversary of the birth of James Watt…and also to promote the interests of the School, by raising a fund each year to provide prizes.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|144–145}}"</blockquote>

Watt Club Medals are still awarded by the organisation each year to Heriot-Watt's most highly achieving students, while the Watt Club Prize is awarded by The Watt Club Council to recognise student initiative and enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hw.ac.uk/students/studies/student-record.htm|title=Heriot-Watt Academic Registry: Prizes and Awards.|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>

===Heriot-Watt College===

[[File:Chambers Street, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 1419940.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The former site of the Watt School|The former site of Heriot-Watt College on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]], today occupied by the Edinburgh [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office]].]]

After the establishment of Heriot-Watt as a technical college, the new management committee set about extending the institution's buildings and strengthening its academic reputation.<ref name="nahste two">{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020906072325/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2002|publisher=NAHSTE|title=Records of Heriot-Watt College|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> In its new form the college was one of only three non-university institutions in the UK with the power to appoint professors, and the first of these was appointed in 1887. In 1902 the College became a [[central institution]], while in 1904 it introduced awards for graduating students which were similar to university degrees.<ref name="nahste two" />

Expansion meant that the college made increasing demands on George Heriot's Trust throughout the first part of the 20th century, which ultimately led to the independence of the two bodies in 1927. While the Trust continued to pay Heriot-Watt a fixed sum each year, from then on the college was responsible for managing its own financial affairs.<ref name="nahste two" /> Heriot-Watt continued to expand after becoming independent, opening a new extension in 1935.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|243}}

Both World Wars impacted on the speed of the college's expansion. During [[World War I]], student numbers dropped as young men joined the army, while teaching in engineering stalled as the department was used for the manufacture of shells and munitions.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|213–215}} During [[World War II]], student numbers dropped again and the electrical engineering department became involved in training the armed services in the use of [[radar]].

After the College introduced a postgraduate award in 1951, it offered awards equivalent to university degrees and doctorates in all practical respects.  Recognising this, in 1963 the [[Robbins Report]] recommended that it should be awarded university status. On 1 February 1966 the recommendation was enacted, as the institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt University'''.<ref name="nahste two" />

===Heriot-Watt University===
[[File:Heriot-Watt Reception.jpg|thumb]]
The first personal chair was appointed in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=huc9AAAAIBAJ&pg=1874%2C5720115 |title=Heriot Watt's new professor |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=29 June 1974 |page=11 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>

While Heriot-Watt continued to expand in the centre of Edinburgh after attaining university status, the institution had grown big enough that relocation was felt to be desirable.<ref name="nahste two" /> In 1966 Midlothian County Council gifted the Riccarton estate north of [[Currie]] to the University and in 1969 work began on transforming the site into a future campus.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|252}} The process of relocation to Riccarton continued until 1992, with teaching and facilities divided between the new campus and the city centre until this time.<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|379–381}}

The University has continued to grow after completing its move to Riccarton, constructing additional student halls, a sports centre and a postgraduate centre on the site. The institution also expanded beyond Edinburgh, merging with the Scottish College of Textiles to create a campus in the [[Scottish Borders]] in 1998, opening a campus in [[Dubai]] in 2006<ref name="Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|436–441}} and a campus in [[Putrajaya]], [[Malaysia]], in 2012.<ref name="Malaysia">{{cite web|url=https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/news/archive/official-opening-heriot-watt-university-malaysia.htm|accessdate=3 December 2012|title=Heriot-Watt University: Official Opening of Heriot-Watt University Malaysia.}}</ref>

In recent years, the University's campus in Edinburgh has benefited from major infrastructural projects worth £60 million, with another £68 million worth investment announced. These include the UK's first purpose-built graduate centre (£6 million),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rias.org.uk/directory/practices/hypostyle-architects-edinburgh/post-graduate-centre-heriot-watt-university/|title=Post Graduate Centre, Heriot-Watt University : RIAS|last=RIAS|website=www.rias.org.uk}}</ref> Scotland's elite Oriam Sports Performance Centre facility (£33 million),<ref name="architectsjournal.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/competitions/heriot-watt-university-seeks-architect-for-19m-innovation-centre/10014815.article|title=Heriot-Watt University seeks architect for £19m innovation centre}}</ref> and the UK's first FlexBIO flexible downstream bioprocessing centre (£2 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.scot/business/14866353.__1_7m_new_centre_at_Heriot_Watt_University_will_let_biotechnology_firms_scale_up_in_Scotland/|title=£1.7m new centre at Heriot-Watt University will let biotechnology firms scale up in Scotland|website=The National}}</ref> It is also constructing a 5,000m² Watt Innovation Building supporting Global Research, Innovation and Discovery [GRID]<ref name="architectsjournal.co.uk"/> to boost 'creativity and ideas generation' on the University's growing Edinburgh campus.

Heriot-Watt's Scottish Borders Campus in [[Galashiels]] is home to the University's School of Textile and Design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/scottish-borders.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University: Scottish Borders Campus.|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> The School began life in 1883 when the Galashiels Manufacturer's Corporation began running classes in practical courses for its workers. The institution gradually grew both in terms of student numbers and the number of courses it offered, and it ultimately became known as the '''Scottish College of Textiles''' in 1968. In 1998 the College merged with Heriot-Watt, leading to the creation of the School of Textiles and Design in its modern form.<ref name = "Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History" />{{rp|436–444}}

The School is one of the few fashion schools in the world which offers a menswear course at bachelor's degree level, and the only school in Scotland to offer a fashion communication course. It was ranked 11th place in the UK for art and design in the 2013 Complete University Guide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Art+%26+Design&y=2013|title=Complete University Guide 2013: Art and Design.|accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> produced a winner and five other finalists for the [[Scottish Fashion Awards]] Graduate of the Year in June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/fashion/scottish-fashion-awards-the-winners-in-full-1-2350300|newspaper=The Scotsman|title=The Scotsman: Scottish Fashion Awards: The winners in full| accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>
