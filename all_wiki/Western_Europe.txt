'''Western Europe''' is the region comprising the western part of [[Europe]]. Though the term ''Western Europe'' is commonly used, there is no consensus on which countries comprise it.{{cn|date=May 2020}} 

Only after the beginning of the foreign conquests of the [[Age of Discovery]], the autonomous discourse of "Europe" as "the West" began to protractedly detach itself from the unifying narrative of "[[Christendom]]", the hitherto dominant identity system in the area, in which was until then subsumed.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=The Westemisation of Europe|page=30|year=1995|title=Inventing Europe Idea, Identity, Reality|first=Gerard|last=Delanty|isbn=978-0-333-62203-2|doi=10.1057/9780230379657|quote="Until the late fifteenth century the idea of Europe was principally a geographical expression and subordinated to Christendom which was the dominant identity system in the West.

Prior to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest, a large part of Western Europe had adopted the newly developed [[La Tène culture]]. As the Roman domain expanded, a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly [[Koine Greek|Greek]]-speaking eastern provinces, which had formed the highly urbanized [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic civilization]], and the western territories, which in contrast largely adopted the [[Latin]] language. This cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east–west division of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Western Roman Empire]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] controlled the two divergent regions between the 3rd and the 5th centuries.

The division between these two was enhanced during [[Late antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] by a number of events. The [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire collapsed]], starting the [[Early Middle Ages]]. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire, mostly known as the Greek or [[Byzantine Empire]], survived and even thrived for another 1000 years. The rise of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the west, and in particular the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] between [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], enhanced the cultural and religious distinctiveness between Eastern and Western Europe.

After the [[Decline of the Byzantine Empire|conquest of the Byzantine Empire]], center of the Eastern Orthodox Church, by the [[Muslim]] [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, and the gradual fragmentation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (which had replaced the [[Carolingian Empire]]), the division between Roman Catholic and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] became more important in Europe than that with Eastern Orthodoxy.

In [[East Asia]], Western Europe was historically known as ''taixi'' in China and ''taisei'' in Japan, which literally translates as the "[[Far West (Taixi)|Far West]]". The term Far West became synonymous with Western Europe in China during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The Italian Jesuit priest [[Matteo Ricci]] was one of the first writers in China to use the Far West as an Asian counterpart to the European concept of the [[Far East]]. In Ricci's writings, Ricci referred to himself as "Matteo of the Far West".<ref>{{cite book|first=Matteo|last=Ricci|others=Translated by Timothy Billings|title=On Friendship: One Hundred Maxims for a Chinese Prince|year=1610|origyear=2009|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231149242|pages=19, 71, 87}}</ref> The term was still in use in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Religion===
[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Religious division in 1054<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartileonline.eu/carte/1025738/dragan-brujia-vodia-kroz-svet-vizantijeDragan |title=Vodič kroz svet Vizantije (Guide to the Byzantine World) |accessdate= |author=Dragan Brujić |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Beograd |page=51 |language= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>]]
[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in Western Europe, according to a 2018 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], 71.0% of the Western [[Europe]]an population identified themselves as [[Christians]].<ref>{{citation|title=Being Christian in Western Europe|work=[[Pew Research Center]] |year=2018|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2018/05/29/being-christian-in-western-europe/ |accessdate=29 May 2018 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}</ref>

The [[East–West Schism]], which has lasted since the 11th century, divided [[Christianity]] in Europe, and consequently the world, into [[Western Christianity]] and [[Eastern Christianity]].

With certain simplifications, Western Europe is thus Catholic or Protestant and uses the [[Latin alphabet]]. [[Eastern Europe]] is Orthodox and uses the [[Greek alphabet]] or [[Cyrillic script]].

According to this definition, Western Europe is formed by countries with dominant Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, including countries which are considered part of [[Central Europe]] now: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom.

Eastern Europe, meanwhile is formed by countries with dominant Eastern Orthodox churches, including [[Greece]], [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]] for instance.

The schism is the break of communion and theology between what are now the Eastern (Orthodox) and Western (Roman Catholic from the 11th century, as well as from the 16th-century, also Protestant) churches.

This division dominated Europe for centuries, in opposition to the rather short-lived [[Cold War]] division of four decades.

Since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of 1054, Europe has been divided between [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in the West and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] (many times incorrectly labeled "[[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]]") churches in the east. Due to this religious cleavage, Eastern Orthodox countries are often associated with Eastern Europe. A cleavage of this sort is, however, often problematic; for example, [[Greece]] is overwhelmingly Orthodox, but is very rarely included in "Eastern Europe", for a variety of reasons.<ref>Peter John, Local Governance in Western Europe, University of Manchester, 2001, {{ISBN|9780761956372}}</ref>

===Cold War===
[[File:Europe-blocs-49-89x4.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political spheres of influence in Europe during the [[Cold War]]]]

During the four decades of the [[Cold War]], the definition of East and West was rather simplified by the existence of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Historians and social scientists generally view the Cold War definition of Western and Eastern Europe as outdated or relegating.<ref>"The geopolitical conditions (...) are now a thing of the past, and some specialists today think that Eastern Europe has outlived its usefulness as a phrase."{{Cite journal |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11016/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Future-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions, Regionalism, Eastern Europe by Steven Cassedy |publisher=New Dictionary of the History of Ideas, Charles Scribner's Sons |year=2005 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="cotf.edu">"One very common, but now outdated, definition of Eastern Europe was the Soviet-dominated communist countries of Europe."http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/balkans/BKdef.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210020555/http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/balkans/BKdef.html |date=10 December 2017 }}</ref><ref name="review">"Too much writing on the region has – consciously or unconsciously – clung to an outdated image of 'Eastern Europe', desperately trying to patch together political and social developments from Budapest to Bukhara or Tallinn to Tashkent without acknowledging that this Cold War frame of reference is coming apart at the seams.

During the final stages of [[World War II]], the future of Europe was decided between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the 1945 [[Yalta Conference]], between the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and the [[Premier of the Soviet Union]], [[Joseph Stalin]].

Post-war Europe would be divided into two major spheres: the [[Western Bloc]], influenced by the [[United States]], and the [[Eastern Bloc]], influenced by the [[Soviet Union]]. With the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. This term had been used during [[World War II]] by German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] and, later, Count [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk]] in the last days of the war; however, its use was hugely popularized by Winston Churchill, who used it in his famous "Sinews of Peace" address on 5 March 1946 at [[Westminster College (Missouri)|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]]:

{{quote|From [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] an ''iron curtain'' has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]. [[Warsaw]], [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Sofia]]; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.}}

Although some countries were officially [[Neutral country|neutral]], they were classified according to the nature of their political and economic systems. This division largely defines the popular perception and understanding of Western Europe and its borders with [[Eastern Europe]].
[[File:KarteWEUStaaten.png|thumb|Former [[Western European Union]] – its members and associates]]

The world changed dramatically with the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989. [[West Germany]] peacefully absorbed [[East Germany]], in the [[German reunification]]. [[Comecon]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] were dissolved, and in 1991, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] ceased to exist. Several countries which had been part of the Soviet Union regained full independence.

===Western European Union===
In 1948 the [[Treaty of Brussels]] was signed between [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was further revisited in 1954 at the [[London and Paris Conferences#Paris|Paris Conference]], when the [[Western European Union]] was established. It was declared defunct in 2011 after the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], and the Treaty of Brussels was terminated. When the Western European Union was dissolved, it had 10 member countries, six associate member countries, five observer countries and seven associate partner countries.

===Western European and Others Group===
The [[Western European and Others Group]] is one of several unofficial [[United Nations Regional Groups|Regional Groups]] in the [[United Nations]] that act as [[voting bloc]]s and negotiation forums. Regional voting blocs were formed in 1961 to encourage voting to various UN bodies from different regional groups. The European members of the group are:<ref>[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2009/jc1682_governancehandbook_lr_en.pdf ''UNAIDS, The Governance Handbook'', January 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109143548/http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2009/jc1682_governancehandbook_lr_en.pdf |date=9 January 2011 }} (p. 29).</ref>

==Climate==
The climate of Western Europe varies from [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] in the coasts of [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] to [[alpine climate|alpine]] in the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]]. The [[Mediterranean climate]] of the south is dry and warm. The western and northwestern parts have a mild, generally humid climate, influenced by the [[North Atlantic Current]].

==Languages==

Western European languages mostly fall within two [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] families: the [[Romance languages]], descended from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; and the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language ([[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]]) came from southern [[Scandinavia]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055|title=Europe|year=2007|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=10 June 2008}}</ref>
Romance languages are spoken primarily in the southern and central part of Western Europe, Germanic languages in the northern part (the [[British Isles]] and the [[Low Countries]]), as well as a large part of [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Central Europe]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />

Other Western European languages include the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" />) and [[Basque language|Basque]], the only currently living European [[language isolate]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Basque language|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Basque-language|access-date=2020-06-16|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognized political goals in Western Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Economy==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
Western Europe is one of the richest regions of the world. [[Germany]] has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|highest GDP]] in Europe and the largest financial surplus of any country, [[Luxembourg]] has the world's highest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]], and [[Germany]] has the highest [[List of countries by total wealth|net national wealth]] of any European state.

[[Switzerland]] and Luxembourg have the highest [[List of countries by average wage|average wage]] in the world, in nominal and [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]], respectively. [[Norway]] ranks highest in the world on the [[Social Progress Index]].
