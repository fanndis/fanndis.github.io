The '''withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan''' describes the draw down of [[United States Armed Forces]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan war]] and the plans after its post-2014 presence when most combat troops had left [[Afghanistan]] at the end of 2014.

NATO had planned on maintaining 13,000 troops including 9,800 Americans in an advisory and counter-terrorism capacity in Afghanistan during the [[War in Afghanistan (2015–present)|2015 phase of the War in Afghanistan]] and they were expected to maintain a presence inside Afghanistan until well after the end of 2016. In July 2016, in light of the deteriorating security conditions, the US postponed the withdrawal until December 2016 and decided to maintain a force of 8,400 troops in 4 garrisons (Kabul, Kandahar, Bagram and Jalalabad) indefinitely due to Taliban resurgence attempt after the [[Battle of Kunduz (2016)|Battle of Kunduz]]. The withdrawal was completed in December 2016 leaving behind 8,400 troops.

===2009 U.S. troops increase under the Obama Administration===

"There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum," Obama said with respect to the 2009 situation in Afghanistan.

In some cases we had evidence against them, in others we were simply suspicious," Defence Ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi told reporters in Kabul.<ref name="ReutersHP20120905">{{cite news|title=Afghanistan: Hundreds Of Soldiers Detained, Fired For Insurgent Links (VIDEO)|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/05/afghan-soldiers-detained-fired_n_1856855.html?ref=topbar|agency=Reuters|work=HuffPost|accessdate=6 September 2012|author=Mirwais Harooni|date=5 September 2012}}</ref> "Using an army uniform against foreign forces is a serious point of concern not only for the Defence Ministry but for the whole Afghan government," Azimi said, adding that Karzai had ordered Afghan forces to devise ways to stop insider attacks.<ref name="ReutersHP20120905" /> Azimi declined to say whether the detained and fired soldiers were from Taliban strongholds in the south and east, saying they were from all over the country.

On 18 September 2012 General John Allen suspended all joint combat operations between Afghanistan and American ground units in Afghanistan.
Under orders from the General interaction between coalition and Afghan forces would take place only at the battalion level.

The agreement does not spell out the number of U.S. forces who will remain, but Karzai said on 21 November 2013 that he envisions up to 15,000 NATO troops being based in the country. According to several estimates, the United States plans to maintain a force of no more than 10,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014.

In a preamble, the draft specifies that "the United States does not seek permanent military facilities in Afghanistan, or a presence that is a threat to Afghanistan's neighbors, and has pledged not to use Afghan territory or facilities as a launching point for attacks on other countries."<ref name="WPBSA120131120" /> It says that "unless otherwise mutually agreed, United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan" and makes no promise of U.S. military support in the event of an attack or other security threat to Afghanistan.

# A drawdown from 68,000 to 58,000 troops by the end of 2012, with a further drawdown to between 38,000 and 48,000 by June 2013.

==Post-2014 presence plans==
===Plans by the administration of Barack Obama===
During the [[2012 Chicago Summit]] NATO and its partners agreed to withdraw its combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.<ref name="Reuters 20120521"/> A new and different NATO mission will then advise, train and assist the Afghan security forces including the Afghan Special Operations Forces.<ref name="Chicago Declaration" /><ref name="Elise Labott and Mike Mount"/> Final decisions on the size of the American and NATO presence after 2014 and its precise configuration have not been made by the United States or its NATO allies as of 26 November 2012, but one option calls for about 10,000 American and several thousand non-American NATO troops according to the United States.<ref name="NYT20121126"/> The presence shall include a small American counterterrorism force consisting of fewer than 1,000 American troops, while in a parallel effort, NATO forces would advise Afghan forces at major regional military and police headquarters. According to the New York Times, NATO forces would most likely have a minimal battlefield role, with the exception of some special operations advisers.<ref name="NYT20121126" />

An important question for the NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail more risk than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed it would make the Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.<ref name="NYT20121126" />

A major challenge was that Afghanistan would not have an effective air force before 2017, if then.  As a consequence American officials said that NATO airpower would remain in Afghanistan after 2014 but will likely only be used on behalf of NATO and American troops and perhaps Afghan units that are accompanied by NATO advisers. NATO forces relied heavily on airpower for airstrikes, supply and medical evacuation since Afghanistan's roads are in poor condition and often seeded with bombs. To compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower, the United States was working on a number of fixes, including providing Afghan forces with armored vehicles that would be equipped with mortars and assault guns. The United States was looking into expanding the purchase of turboprop planes for the Afghans. In addition the U.S. was also trying to help Afghan pilots learn to fly at night.<ref name="NYT20121126" /> Equally troubling was according to the New York Times the problem of medical evacuations. Because after 2014 the Afghans would almost certainly need to rely on a system that depended more on ground transportation than helicopters the United States wanted to help Afghanistan forces develop more field hospitals.<ref name="NYT20121126" />

Plans for the follow-on military presence are being formulated in the Pentagon, where the largest of several preliminary options calls for about 10,000 troops, with several other NATO governments penciled in for several hundred each. According to these preliminary plans, ISAF's successor would be based in Kabul, with most U.S. training and counterterrorism troops probably stationed in Kandahar and at the air base at Bagram. Both locations are to be converted to Afghan ownership. Smaller counterterrorism units of the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] would be positioned primarily in the eastern part of the country, where most of their activities take place. Italy, in charge of the ISAF mission in Herat in western Afghanistan, would remain there to train Afghans. Germany would do the same in Mazar-e Sharif in the north. It is unclear what would happen at Camp Bastion, the British headquarters in Helmand province.<ref name="WP20121205">{{cite news|last=DeYoung|first=Karen|title=U.S. reducing plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-reducing-plans-for-large-civilian-force-in-post-2014-afghanistan/2012/12/05/67c7d9a8-380f-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_story.html|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 December 2012}}</ref>

The size of the American military presence after 2014 will help determine the size of the American civilian footprint. As of December 2012 the United States are reducing its plans for large civilian force in post-2014 Afghanistan, because the U.S. military is certain to curtail or stop the security and other services it provides U.S. government civilians in Afghanistan.<ref name="WP20121205" /> Firm decisions on civilian numbers and locations cannot be made "until we resolve exactly what the military follow-on numbers are going to be," one unnamed U.S. official said. "That will determine . . . where we locate, what kind of security, medical and other support we might be able to get."<ref name="WP20121205" /> According to the New York Times the U.S. military wants to retain 9,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while the Obama administration wants a force of 3,000 to 9,000 troops in Afghanistan after 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Michael R.|title=U.S. Weighs Fewer Troops After 2014 in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/world/asia/us-weighs-fewer-troops-after-2014-in-afghanistan.html?ref=world&_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 January 2013}}</ref>

During his [[2013 State of the Union Address]] Barack Obama announced that 34,000 US troops will leave Afghanistan by February 2014, but did not specify what the post-2014 troop levels would be. "Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change," Obama said.<ref name="BBC20130213" /> "We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions – training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al-Qaeda and their affiliates," he added.<ref name="BBC20130213">{{cite news|title=Obama announces 34,000 troops to leave Afghanistan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21431423|publisher=BBC News US & Canada|accessdate=14 February 2013|date=13 February 2013}}</ref> As of 12 February 2013, Barack Obama has not made a decision on the post-2014 U.S. force.<ref name="NYT20130212" /> The Obama Administration intends to keep some troops in the country in 2015 and beyond, but the number is still being debated at the White House and must be approved by the Afghan government.<ref name="WP20130212" /> Unnamed U.S. officials said there was a reluctance to go public with a final number of troops and a description of their missions while still in the early stage of negotiating a security agreement with the Afghans over retaining a U.S. military presence after 2014.<ref name="NYT20130212" /> The New York Times reported that the post-2014 force is likely to number no more than 9,000 or so troops and then get progressively smaller.<ref name="NYT20130212" /> The Washington Post reported that the Pentagon is pushing a plan that would keep about 8,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2015, but significantly shrink the contingent over the following two years, perhaps to fewer than 1,000 by 2017, according to senior U.S. government officials and military officers.<ref name="WP20130212" /> As the result of the suspension of the bilateral security agreement discussions and increasingly frustrated by his dealings with Karzai, Obama was giving in early July 2013 serious consideration to speeding up the withdrawal of United States forces from Afghanistan and to a "zero option" that would leave no American troops there after 2014.<ref name="NYT20130708" /> At the end of 2013 the United States backed away from its threat to initiate a complete American withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, if Karzai refuses to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement by the end of 2013. However the United States stood by its warning that a total military withdrawal is still possible if delays continue.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Matthew|title=U.S. Softens Deadline for Deal to Keep Troops in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/24/world/asia/us-softens-deadline-for-deal-to-keep-troops-in-afghanistan.html|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 December 2013}}</ref><ref name="NYT20140121">{{cite news|title=U.S. Military Eyes Afghan Force of 10,000, or a Pullout|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/world/asia/military-eyes-afghan-force-of-10000-or-a-pullout.html|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 January 2014|author1=Jackie Calmes  |author2=Eric Schmitt |name-list-style=amp }}</ref> The U.S. Department of Defense proposed to Obama to leave behind 10,000 US troops when their combat mission and that of their allies end there at the end of 2014, or none at all.<ref name="NYT20140121" /> Caitlin M.

In November 2014 U.S. President Obama expanded the original role of U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan for 2015. Originally they were supposed to advise, train and assist the Afghan Forces and to hunt the remnants of Al Qaeda. Under the president's order U.S. forces can carry out missions against the Taliban and other militant groups threatening American troops or the Afghan government while American jets, bombers and drones can support Afghan troops on combat missions. By the end of 2015, half of the 9,800 American troops would leave Afghanistan. The rest would be consolidated in Kabul and Bagram, and then leave by the end of 2016, allowing Obama to say he ended the Afghan war before leaving office. The United States could still have military advisers in Kabul after 2016 who would work out of an office of security cooperation at the United States Embassy. But the Obama administration has not said how large that contingent might be and what its exact mission would be.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt|title=In a Shift, Obama Extends U.S. Role in Afghan Combat|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/us/politics/in-secret-obama-extends-us-role-in-afghan-combat.html|accessdate=14 February 2015|work=The New York Times|date=21 November 2014}}</ref>

During his last trip to Afghanistan U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced on 6 December 2014 the end of the U.S. original plan to withdraw its troops form Afghanistan. Under a plan announced in May 2014 the number of American troops was supposed to fall to 9,800 by 1 January 2015. Instead the U.S. will keep up to 10,800 troops for the first few months of 2015 and then restart the drawdown, which is scheduled to reach 5,500 troops by the end of 2015.

By the time U.S. President Obama leaves office in 2017 only a small force attached to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul is to remain in Afghanistan. The reason for the United States to keep additional forces in the country temporarily was that planned troop commitments by US allies for the NATO train-and-assist mission starting in January 2015 have been slow to materialize. President Barack Obama "has provided US military commanders the flexibility to manage any temporary force shortfall that we might experience for a few months as we allow for coalition troops to arrive in theater," Hagel said in a news conference with President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul. "But the president's authorization will not change our troops' missions, or the long-term timeline for our drawdown," he added.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chuck Hagel: more US troops will remain in Afghanistan|accessdate=7 February 2015|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Guardian|date=6 December 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/06/chuck-hagel-more-us-troops-will-remain-in-afghanistan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=More US Troops Than Planned to Stay in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/06/world/asia/ap-as-united-states-afghanistan.html|accessdate=7 February 2015|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Missy|title=Hagel says U.S. to leave up to 1,000 extra troops in Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hagel-pays-final-visit-to-afghanistan-as-pentagon-chief/2014/12/06/e6cf5c2c-7d17-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html|accessdate=7 February 2015|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=6 December 2014}}</ref>

At the end of March 2015 U.S. President Obama announced to slow the pace of the U.S. troop withdrawal by maintaining the current force levels of 9,800 troops through at least the end of 2015. This announcement came after a request by the Afghan government under its new president Ashraf Ghani. Obama  and Ghani stated the troops were needed to train and advise Afghan forces. According to U.S. official keeping the current force in place would allow American special operations troops and the Central Intelligence Agency to operate in southern and eastern Afghanistan, where the insurgents are strongest and where Al Qaeda's presence is concentrated. Obama also stated to close the remaining U.S. bases in Afghanistan, to withdraw all but about 1,000 troops by the time he leaves office at the beginning of 2017 consolidate the remaining U.S. forces in Kabul. Those forces would operate largely in Kabul and protect embassy personnel and other American officials there.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lederman |first=Josh |date=24 March 2015 |title=White House: US to slow troop withdrawal from Afghanistan |url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20150324/us--united_states-afghanistan-bae7252c6c.html |agency=Associated Press |access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Greg Jaffe and David Nakamura|title=Obama agrees to slow U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-agrees-to-slow-us-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/2015/03/24/6acd4834-d247-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html?tid=sm_tw|accessdate=27 March 2015|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Michael D.

On 29 February 2020, the U.S. signed an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw troops in 14 months if the Taliban uphold the terms of the agreement. As of February 2020 about 13,000 American troops were still in the country. The two sides agreed a gradual, conditions-based withdrawal over 14 months and the withdrawal agreement encompasses "all military forces of the United States, its allies, and Coalition partners, including all non-diplomatic civilian personnel, private security contractors, trainers, advisors, and supporting services personnel.". In the first phase the U.S. will initially reduce its forces in Afghanistan by about 5,000 troops to 8,600 within 135 days of the U.S.-Taliban agreement. During the gradual withdrawal, the Taliban and the Afghan government would have to work out a more concrete power-sharing settlement. That time frame would give the government the cover of American military protection while negotiating. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the remaining U.S. troops will serve as leverage to ensure the Taliban lives up to its promises. If the Taliban fulfills its commitments to renounce al Qaeda and begin [[Afghan peace process|intra-Afghan peace talks]], the U.S. agreed to a complete withdrawal of all remaining American forces from Afghanistan within 10 months.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Hamid Shalizi |author2=Charlotte Greenfield |title=U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 14 months if Taliban conditions met |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-to-withdraw-troops-from-afghanistan-in-14-months-if-taliban-conditions-met/ar-BB10yxIL?li=BBnb7Kz |publisher=MSN |agency=Reuters |accessdate=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229233816/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/us-to-withdraw-troops-from-afghanistan-in-14-months-if-taliban-conditions-met/ar-BB10yxIL?li=BBnb7Kz |archivedate=29 February 2020 |date=29 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Mujib Mashal |title=Taliban and U.S. Strike Deal to Withdraw American Troops From Afghanistan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html |accessdate=29 February 2020 |date=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229235609/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html |archivedate=29 February 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Mujib Mashal and Russell Goldman |title=4 Takeaways From the U.S. Deal With the Taliban |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-afghanistan.html |accessdate=1 March 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301000422/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-afghanistan.html |archivedate=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Tom Vanden Brook and Deirdre Shesgreen |title=Historic peace deal in Afghanistan reached with Taliban, allowing withdrawal of US troops |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/29/u-s-taliban-sign-deal-peace-talks-begin-u-s-troops-withdraw/4738736002/ |accessdate=1 March 2020 |work=USA Today |date=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301001435/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/02/29/u-s-taliban-sign-deal-peace-talks-begin-u-s-troops-withdraw/4738736002/ |archivedate=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Afghan conflict: US and Taliban sign deal to end 18-year war |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51689443 |accessdate=1 March 2020 |work=BBC News |date=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301002219/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51689443 |archivedate=1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Jennifer Hansler |title=US and Taliban sign historic agreement |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/us-taliban-deal-signing/index.html |accessdate=1 March 2020 |publisher=CNN |date=29 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200301004545/https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/us-taliban-deal-signing/ |archivedate=1 March 2020}}</ref> The United States and its NATO allies have agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal.<ref name=bbcreject />

The former Deputy Defense Secretary of the Middle East [[Mick Mulroy]] said that 2,500 was not enough to preserve what we have fought for, warned against a precipitous withdrawal, and also advocated for leaving a "residual force" in the country. "We should not rely on any assurances of the Taliban, we should rely on the U.S. military and the CIA," Mulroy said.<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/trump-order-troop-reductions-afghanistan-195927768.html</ref> <ref>https://www.mei.edu/blog/special-briefing-trump-administrations-potential-last-minute-middle-east-policy-moves</ref>
