'''Bisexuality''' is [[Romance (love)|romantic]] attraction, [[sexual attraction]], or [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] toward both males and females,<!-- SOURCING: As discussed on the talk page, there are two definitions of bisexuality, but the one used by authoritative sources and dictionary/other encyclopedic sources only mentions two sexes/two genders (male/female and man/woman), not "all sexes/genders," "more than one gender" or "irrespective of gender."

== Definitions ==

=== Sexual orientation, identity, and behavior ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation|Sexual identity|Human sexual activity}}

Bisexuality is romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females. The [[American Psychological Association]] states that "sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime–different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual."<ref name="Rosario"/><ref name=apa2009>{{cite journal|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |pages=63, 86|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2011|quote=Sexual orientation identity—not sexual orientation—appears to change via psychotherapy, support groups, and life events.}}</ref>

Sexual attraction, behavior, and identity may also be incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual.<ref name=apa2009/> Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual.<ref name=apa2009/> The terms ''[[queer]]'',<ref name="Firestein">{{cite book| first = Beth A. | last = Firestein | title = Becoming Visible: Counseling Bisexuals Across the Lifespan|publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | pages = 9–12 | year = 2007| accessdate = 3 October 2012 |isbn =978-0231137249|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1pCKkZmBU1EC&q=Bisexuality&pg=PA9}}</ref> ''[[Polysexuality|polysexual]]'',<ref name="Firestein"/> ''[[heteroflexible]]'', ''homoflexible,'' ''[[men who have sex with men]]'' and ''[[women who have sex with women]]'' may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Michael T.|last2=Lykins|first2=Amy D.|last3=Bhullar|first3=Navjot|date=2016-06-08|title=Beyond Heterosexual, Bisexual, and Homosexual: A Diversity in Sexual Identity Expression|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1591–1597|doi=10.1007/s10508-016-0778-3|pmid=27278966|s2cid=11264795|issn=0004-0002}}</ref>

Some sources state that bisexuality encompasses romantic or sexual attraction to all [[gender identity|gender identities]] or that it is romantic or sexual attraction to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender, equating it to or rendering it interchangeable with [[pansexuality]].<ref name="Soble"/><ref name="Sex and society"/> The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the [[gender binary]], the "notion of two genders and indeed of specific sexual orientations",<ref name="Sex and society"/> as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.<ref name="Soble"/><ref name="Sex and society"/> Sometimes the phrase "[[bisexual umbrella]]" is used to describe any nonmonosexual behaviors, attractions, and identities, usually for purposes of [[collective action]] and challenging monosexist cultural assumptions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flanders|first=Corey E.|date=2017-01-02|title=Under the Bisexual Umbrella: Diversity of Identity and Experience|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1080/15299716.2017.1297145|issn=1529-9716|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]] defines bisexuality as "the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."<ref>{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Shiri|title=Bi: Notes for a Bi Revolution|year=2013|publisher=Seal Press|isbn=978-1-58005-474-4}}</ref>

According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):{{quote|...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.<ref name="Rosario"/>}}

Bisexuality as a transitional identity has also been examined. In a [[longitudinal study]] about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60 to 70 percent continued to thus identify, while approximately 30 to 40 percent assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity."<ref name="Rosario"/>

By contrast, a longitudinal study by [[Lisa M. Diamond]], which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities," over a ten-year period. The study also found that "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|issue=1|pages=5–14|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.44.1.5|pmid=18194000|title=Female bisexuality from adolescence to adulthood: results from a 10-year longitudinal study}}<!--|accessdate=19 October 2013--></ref> Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found "almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Scientific Quest to Prove Bisexuality Exists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/magazine/the-scientific-quest-to-prove-bisexuality-exists.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 March 2014|first=Benoit|last=Denizet-Lewis|date=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Sexuality Preconference|url=http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|work=Fifteenth Annual Meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology - Preconferences|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate=21 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321072854/http://www.sexatspsp.com/schedule/|archivedate=21 March 2014}}</ref>

=== Kinsey scale ===
{{Main|Kinsey scale}}

In the 1940s, the zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] created a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from heterosexuality to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero- or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.<ref name="Young-Bruehl">{{cite journal  |last=Young-Bruehl  |first=Elisabeth  |title=Are Human Beings "By Nature" Bisexual?  |journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality  |volume=3  |issue=2  |pages=179–213  |year=2001  |doi=10.1080/15240650209349175|s2cid=145118033 }}</ref> The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time.

The psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].<ref>McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.</ref>

== Demographics and prevalence==
{{Main|Demographics of sexual orientation}}

Scientific estimates as to the prevalence of bisexuality have varied from 0.7% to 8%. ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'', published in 1993, concluded that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual, while 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual.<ref name="Kinsey FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html|title=Frequently Asked Sexuality Questions to the Kinsey Institute |accessdate=16 February 2007 |publisher=The Kinsey Institute}}</ref>

A 2002 survey in the United States by [[National Center for Health Statistics]] found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as "something else". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as "something else".<ref>[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1a75/2cc15ea3d5267e6e3cf3b45a1c4a17bb11b2.pdf?_ga=2.38506723.1917463606.1565744829-1468356713.1565744829 "Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15-44 Years of Age, United States, 2002."] Mosher et al.

[[Magnus Hirschfeld]] argued that adult sexual orientation can be explained in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed that in every embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for attraction to the opposite sex developed while the center for attraction to the same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. [[Simon LeVay]] has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of attraction to the same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.<ref>{{cite book |author=LeVay, Simon |authorlink=Simon LeVay |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-262-12199-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/queerscienceusea00leva/page/18 18–20] |url=https://archive.org/details/queerscienceusea00leva/page/18 }}</ref>

Hirschfeld created a ten-point scale to measure the strength of sexual desire, with the direction of desire being represented by the letters A (for heterosexuality), B (for homosexuality), and A + B (for bisexuality). On this scale, someone who was A3, B9 would be weakly attracted to the opposite sex and very strongly attracted to the same sex, an A0, B0 would be asexual, and an A10, B10 would be very attracted to both sexes.

[[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], believed that every human being is bisexual in the sense of incorporating general attributes of both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being an aspect of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side of this bisexual disposition would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that all adults still have desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders. Freud's belief in innate bisexuality was rejected by [[Sandor Rado|Sándor Radó]] in 1940 and, following Radó, by many later psychoanalysts. Radó argued that there is no biological bisexuality in humans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ruse, Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |title=Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1988 |isbn=0-631-15275-X |pages=22, 25, 45, 46}}</ref> The psychoanalyst [[Edmund Bergler]] argued in ''[[Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life?]]'' (1956) that bisexuality does not exist and that all supposed bisexuals are homosexuals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bergler, Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Bergler |title=Homosexuality: Disease or Way of Life? |publisher=Hill and Wang, Inc |location=New York |year=1957 |page=8}}</ref>

[[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith reported in ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) that sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that bisexuality is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bell, Alan P. |author2=Weinberg, Martin S. |author3=Hammersmith, Sue Kiefer |title=Sexual Preference: Its Development in Men and Women |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-253-16673-9 |pages=200–201}}</ref> Letitia Anne Peplau et al. wrote that while Bell et al.'s view that biological factors may be more influential on homosexuality than on bisexuality might seem plausible, it has not been directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |title=The Development of Sexual Orientation in Women |accessdate=11 July 2017 |author1=Peplau, Letitia Anne |author2=Spalding, Leah R. |author3=Conley, Terri D. |author4=Veniegas, Rosemary C. |journal=Annual Review of Sex Research |date=1999 |volume=10 |pages=70–99 |pmid=10895248 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305191912/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Peplau%20et%20al.%2099_1.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.<ref name=VanWyk>{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Wyk PH, Geist CS |title=Biology of Bisexuality: Critique and Observations |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=28 |issue=3–4 |pages=357–373 |year=1995 |doi=10.1300/J082v28n03_11 |pmid=7560936 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4qrrAgAAQBAJ&q=biology+of+bisexuality+van+wyk&pg=PA357|isbn=9781317764519 }}</ref>

In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation, biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported, with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.<ref name=Veniegas>{{cite journal  |last=Veniegas  |first=Rosemary c.  |author2=Terri D.

The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has promoted bisexuality as an ideal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paglia, Camille |authorlink=Camille Paglia |title=Vamps and Tramps: New Essays |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-14-024828-9 |page=94}}</ref> Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.<ref>{{cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-92661-4 |page=249}}</ref>

=== Brain structure and chromosomes ===

LeVay's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the [[INAH 3]] nucleus of the anterior [[hypothalamus]] of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.<ref name=VanWyk/>

Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to Money (1988), genetic males with an extra [[Y chromosome]] are more likely to be bisexual, [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] and impulsive.<ref name=VanWyk/>

=== Evolutionary theory ===

Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.<ref name=Muscarella/>

Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12465295|title=The evolution of homosexuality: Gender bending - The Economist|work=The Economist|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>

Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them" and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Zietsch | first1 = B. | last2 = Morley | first2 = K. | last3 = Shekar | first3 = S. | last4 = Verweij | first4 = K. | last5 = Keller | first5 = M. | last6 = Macgregor | first6 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Genetic factors predisposing to homosexuality may increase mating success in heterosexuals | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 424–433 | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2008.07.002 | display-authors = 6 | last7 = Wright | first7 = M | last8 = Bailey | first8 = J | last9 = Martin | first9 = N}}</ref>

In ''[[Scientific American Mind]]'', the scientist Emily V. Driscoll stated that homosexual and bisexual behavior is quite common in several species and that it fosters bonding: "The more homosexuality, the more peaceful the species". The article also stated: "Unlike most humans, however, individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight: an animal that engages in a same-sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters. Rather, many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society. That is, there are probably no strictly gay critters, just bisexual ones. Animals don't do sexual identity. They just do sex."<ref name="Unorthodox">{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |title=Bisexual Species: Unorthodox Sex in the Animal Kingdom |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125201624/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2850 |archivedate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

=== Masculinization ===

[[Masculinization]] of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.<ref name=VanWyk/>

In a research comparison, published in the ''Journal of the Association for Research in [[Otolaryngology]]'', women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential in a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.<ref>{{cite journal| last =  McFadden| first =  D.| author2 = Champlin, CA| title = Comparison of auditory evoked potentials in heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual males and females| journal = JARO&nbsp;– Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 89–99| date = March 2000| doi = 10.1007/s101620010008| pmid = 11548240| pmc = 2504562}}</ref>

=== Prenatal hormones ===

The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) and exposure to [[diethylstilbestrol]] (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]]s are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.<ref name=Veniegas/>

There is research evidence that the digit [[ratio]] of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.<ref name=pmid11053694>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00052-0 |pmid=11053694 |title=The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length and male homosexuality |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=333–345 |year=2000 |last1=Robinson |first1=S |last2=Manning |first2=J. T }}</ref>

The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore, the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.<ref name=Muscarella/>

=== Sex drive ===
Van Wyk and Geist summarized several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals that have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy, or erotic interest. These studies found that male and female bisexuals had more heterosexual fantasy than heterosexuals or homosexuals; that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men, and that they masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals; that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women; and that bisexual women became heterosexually active earlier, masturbated and enjoyed masturbation more, and were more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.<ref name=VanWyk/>

Research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R.

==Community==
{{main|Bisexual community}}

===General social impacts===

The bisexual community (also known as the bisexual/pansexual, bi/pan/fluid, or non-monosexual community) includes members of the [[LGBT community]] who identify as bisexual, pansexual or fluid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://binetusa.blogspot.com/2009/04/we-are-all-somewhere-between-straight.html|title=We are all somewhere between straight and gay|last=Estraven|date=20 April 2009|publisher=[[BiNet USA]] News and Opinions|accessdate=24 March 2011}}</ref> Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the gay or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14681994.2017.1419566|doi = 10.1080/14681994.2017.1419566|title = Mapping the bisexual experience of a Keralite woman: Glimpses into India|year = 2018|last1 = Chithrangathan|first1 = Chinchu|journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume = 33|issue = 1–2|pages = 135–145|s2cid = 148780872}}</ref> Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners<ref name="newgen">{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/generation.html |title=A new generation of issues for LGBT clients |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=DeAngelis, Tori |date=February 2002  |work=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association}}</ref> and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy.<ref name="newgen"/> These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.<ref name="newgen"/>

Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same-sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual.

Male bisexuality is particularly presumed to be non-existent,<ref name="Eisner"/> with [[sexual fluidity]] studies adding to the debate. In 2005, researchers Gerulf Rieger, [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]], and [[J. Michael Bailey]] used [[penile plethysmography]] to measure the arousal of self-identified bisexual men to [[pornography]] involving only men and pornography involving only women. Participants were recruited via advertisements in gay-oriented magazines and an alternative paper. They found that the self-identified bisexual men in their sample had genital arousal patterns similar to either homosexual or heterosexual men.

[[File:Bisexual Pride Flag.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[bisexual pride flag]].]]
A common symbol of the [[bisexual community]] is the [[bisexual pride flag]], which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one – blending the pink and blue – in the middle to represent bisexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=Bi Pride Flag |accessdate=16 February 2007 |author=Page, Michael |quote=The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only, homosexuality, the blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only, heterosexuality, and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080614/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007}}</ref>

=== In BDSM ===
In Steve Lenius' original 2001 paper, he explored the acceptance of bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual [[BDSM]] community. The reasoning behind this is that "coming-out" had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looked back on his study and considered if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69–78 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06| s2cid = 142599575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on "Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community"—Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420–425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466| s2cid = 143156292 }}</ref>

Brandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B.

=== In feminism ===
Feminist positions on bisexuality range greatly, from acceptance of bisexuality as a feminist issue to rejection of bisexuality as reactionary and anti-feminist [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to [[lesbian feminism]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Sue |editor1-first=Lynne |editor1-last=Harne |others=Elaine Miller |title=All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism |year= 1996|publisher= [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teacher's College Press]]|location= New York City|isbn= 978-0-807-76285-1 |oclc= 35202923|pages=75–89 |chapter=Bisexuality as Backlash }}</ref> A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict in feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism.

Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." Tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted in the feminist community,<ref>{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|pages= 82–3|accessdate=3 October 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&pg=PA82}}</ref> but some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality.

[[Donna Haraway]] was the inspiration and genesis for [[cyberfeminism]] with her 1985 essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991).

Ancient Greeks and Romans did not associate sexual relations with well-defined labels, as modern Western society does. Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual, and may have had wives or other female lovers.

[[Ancient Greek]] religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.<ref name="livius">{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ho-hz/homosexuality/homosexuality.html|title=Greek Homosexuality |accessdate=17 February 2007 |last=van Dolen |first=Hein}}</ref> [[Sparta]]ns thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and [[unit cohesion]], and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood.<ref name="livius"/> For example, [[Aristophanes]] calls them ''euryprôktoi'', meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.<ref name="livius"/>

Similarly, in [[ancient Rome]], gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another's man integrity. It was socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.<ref>Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225.</ref> The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender ''per se''. Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]''. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.<ref>Catharine Edwards, "Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome," in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67–68.</ref>

[[Alfred Kinsey]] conducted the first large surveys of homosexual behavior in the United States during the 1940s. The results shocked the readers of his day because they made same-sex behavior and attractions seem so common.<ref name=Bailey/> His 1948 work ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' stated that among men "nearly half (46%) of the population engages in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or reacts to persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives" and that "37% of the total male population has at least some overt homosexual experience to the point of orgasm since the onset of adolescence."<ref name=Kinsey>{{cite book|author1=Kinsey, Alfred C. |author2=Pomeroy, Wardell B. |author3=Martin, Clyde E. |title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male |url=https://archive.org/details/sexualbehaviorin00kins |url-access=registration |publisher=W. B. Saunders Company |location=Philadelphia and London |year=1948 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexualbehaviorin00kins/page/650 650], 656, 657}}</ref> Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]], stating, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."<ref name="Stange"/><ref name=Kinsey/> Although more recent researchers believe that Kinsey overestimated the rate of same-sex attraction,<ref name=Bailey/><ref name=Balthazart/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=Lehmiller>{{cite book |last=Lehmiller |first=Justin |date=2018 |title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality |edition=Second |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXJGDwAAQBAJ |publisher=John Wiley & Sons Ltd |isbn=9781119164739 }}</ref>{{rp|147}} his work is considered pioneering and some of the most well known sex research of all time.<ref name=Lehmiller/>{{rp|29}}

{{Main|Media portrayals of bisexuality}}

Bisexuality tends to be associated with negative media portrayals; references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders. In an article regarding the 2005 film ''Brokeback Mountain'', sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are often depicted negatively:<ref name="Andre">{{cite web|url=http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|title=Opinion: Bisexual Cowboys in Love|last=Andre|first=Amy|date=2005-12-16|publisher=[[National Sexuality Resource Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210122058/http://nsrc.sfsu.edu/article/opinion_bisexual_cowboys_love|archivedate=10 February 2009}}</ref>

{{Quote|I like movies where bisexuals come out to each other together and fall in love, because these tend to be so few and far between; the most recent example would be 2002's lovely romantic comedy, ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. Most movies with bi characters paint a stereotypical picture.... The bi love interest is usually deceptive (''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''), over-sexed (''[[The Sex Monster|Sex Monster]]''), unfaithful (''[[High Art]]''), and fickle (''[[Three of Hearts (1993 film)|Three of Hearts]]''), and might even be a serial killer, like Sharon Stone in ''[[Basic Instinct]]''. In other words, the bisexual is always the cause of the conflict in the film.|Amy Andre|''American Sexuality Magazine''}}

Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, [[sociology|sociologist]] Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men's behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men's similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual man is often described as a ''duplicitous heterosexual'' man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the white bisexual man is often described in pitying language as a ''[[victimized]] homosexual'' man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.<ref name=Pitt>{{cite journal | last1 = Pitt Jr. | first1 = Richard N. | year = 2006 | title = Downlow Mountain?

In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'', by [[Sidney Drew]].<ref name="glbtq_a">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |title=>> arts >> Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015093725/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film.html |archivedate=15 October 2012}}</ref> However, under the censorship required by the [[Hays Code]], the word ''bisexual'' could not be mentioned, and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968.<ref name="glbtq_a" />

Notable and varying portrayals of bisexuality can be found in mainstream movies such as ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[Frida]]'' (2002), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'' (1996), ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), ''[[Henry & June]]'' (1990), ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (1997), ''[[Velvet Goldmine]]'' (1998), ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'' (2001), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1993), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), ''[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (film)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]'' (1971), ''[[Something for Everyone (1970 film)|Something for Everyone]]'' (1970), ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'' (2002), ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005), and ''[[Call Me by Your Name (film)|Call Me by Your Name]]'' (2017).

=== Literature ===
[[Virginia Woolf]]'s ''[[Orlando: A Biography]]'' (1928) is an early example of bisexuality in literature. The story, of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's lover [[Vita Sackville-West]]. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels.<ref name="livia">Livia, Anna (2000). ''Pronoun Envy: Literary Uses of Linguistic Gender.'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780195138535}}</ref> Her 1925 book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son [[Nigel Nicolson]] published ''[[Portrait of a Marriage]]'', one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to [[Harold Nicolson]]. Other early examples include works of [[D.H. Lawrence]], such as ''[[Women in Love]]'' (1920), and [[Colette]]'s ''[[Claudine à l'école|Claudine]]'' (1900–1903) series.

The main character in [[Patrick White]]'s novel, ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' (1979), is bisexual. Contemporary novelist [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' novels, such as ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Rules of Attraction]]'' (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters; this "casual approach" to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis' work.<ref name="badboy">{{cite journal|url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/music-and-books/201006/author-bret-easton-ellis-less-than-zero-sequel-imperial-bedrooms|title=Bret Easton Ellis: Eternal Bad Boy|journal=[[Details (magazine)|Details]]|last=Gordinier|first=Jeff|date=June 2010|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref>

In 1995, [[Jill Sobule]] sang about [[bi-curious|bi-curiosity]] in her song "I Kissed a Girl", with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend along with images of her with a girlfriend. Another [[I Kissed a Girl (Katy Perry song)|song with the same name]] by [[Katy Perry]] also hints at the same theme. Some activists suggest the song merely reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals experimenting and of bisexuality not being a real sexual preference. [[Lady Gaga]] has also stated that she is bisexual,<ref name="RollStone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/27/the-new-issue-of-rolling-stone-the-rise-of-lady-gaga |title=Lady Gaga Rolling Stone Interview}}</ref> and has acknowledged that her song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" is about fantasizing about a woman while being with a man.<ref name="Walters">{{cite web|url=http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|title=Lady Gaga admits bisexuality and explains "Poker Face" to Barbra Walters|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217041020/http://www.iviewtube.com/videos/111677/lady-gaga-admits-bisexuality-interview-on-barbara-walters|archivedate=17 February 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|Animal sexual behaviour}}
{{See also|Homosexual behavior in animals}}

Many non-human animal species exhibit bisexual behavior.<ref name="Bio"/><ref name="Evol"/><ref name="Bi Species"/> Examples of mammals that display such behavior include the [[bonobo]] (formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee), [[orca]], and the [[bottlenose dolphin]].<ref name="Bio"/><ref name="Evol"/><ref name="Bi Species"/><ref name="Milton"/> Examples of birds include some species of [[gulls]] and [[Humboldt penguin]]s. Other examples of bisexual behavior occur among fish and [[flatworm]]s.<ref name="Milton">{{cite web |url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |title=Bisexuality: A Biological Perspective |accessdate=17 February 2007 |author=Diamond, Milton |author-link= Milton Diamond |year=1998 |work=Bisexualities&nbsp;– The Ideology and Practice of Sexual Contact with both Men and Women |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101000138/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/bisdia.htm |archivedate=1 January 2007}}</ref>

Many species of animals are involved in the acts of forming sexual and non-sexual relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they pick the same sex. Some of these species are [[gazelle]]s, [[antelope]], [[bison]], and [[sage grouse]].<ref name=Bidstrup>{{cite web|url=http://www.bidstrup.com/sodomy.htm |title=The Natural Crime Against Nature |accessdate=26 June 2007 |author=Scott Bidstrup |year=2000}}</ref>

In some cases, animals will choose to engage in sexual activity with different sexes at different times in their lives, and will sometimes engage in sexual activity with different sexes at random. Same-sex sexual activity can also be seasonal in some animals, like male walruses who often engage in same-sex sexual activity with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual sexual activity during breeding season.<ref name=Bidstrup/>
