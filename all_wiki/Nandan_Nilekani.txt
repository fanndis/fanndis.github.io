==Career==

===Information technology===
In 1978 he started his career at the Mumbai-based [[Patni Computer Systems]], where he met and was interviewed by [[N.R. Narayana Murthy]]. In 1981, Nilekani, Murthy, and five others left Patni to start their own company, [[Infosys]].

Before assuming leadership as CEO in 2002, Nilekani held various posts, including managing director, president, and chief operating officer. He served as its CEO from March 2002 to April 2007.<ref name=GT-DEX-2009-MP-X/><ref name=GT-DEX-2009-MP-XI/><ref name="About UIDAI">[http://uidai.gov.in/about-uidai.html Background]. uidai.gov.in</ref> During his five-year tenure as CEO, Infosys' topline grew sixfold to $3 billion.

In 2017 he returned to [[Infosys]] after the exit of CEO [[Vishal Sikka]] to become a chairman. Upon his return he changed  power centre from [[California]] back to its [[Bengaluru]] headquarters.<ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nandan-nilekani-may-announce-fresh-strategy-for-infosys/articleshow/61196163.cms|title= Nandan Nilekani may announce a fresh strategy for Infosys]</ref>
Also, such people as R. Seshasayee (a chairman and board director), Ravi Venkatesan (a co-chairman),  Sikka (executive vice chairman and director), and Jeffrey Lehman and John Etchemendy (directors) resigned from their posts.<ref>[http://www.livemint.com/Industry/uOcWn6iXAiZ4hZbRHvt2vO/How-Nandan-Nilekani-returned-to-Infosys.html|title= How Nandan Nilekani returned to Infosys]</ref>
