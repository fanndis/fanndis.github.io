'''John Robert Isner''' (born April 26, 1985) is an American professional [[tennis]] player who has been ranked as high as No. 8<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/rankings/singles|title=Rankings {{!}} Singles {{!}} ATP World Tour {{!}} Tennis|work=ATP World Tour|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}</ref> in men's singles by the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]] (ATP). Considered one of the best servers ever to play on the [[ATP Tour]], Isner achieved his career-high singles ranking in July 2018 by virtue of his maiden [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|Masters 1000]] crown at the [[2018 Miami Open]] and a semifinals appearance at the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships]]. He has also twice reached the quarterfinals at the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in [[2011 US Open – Men's Singles|2011]] and [[2018 US Open – Men's Singles|2018]], the latter of which helped qualify him for his first [[ATP Finals]] appearance later that year.

==Professional career==

===2007–2008: Turning pro, first final, top 100===
[[File:John Isner 2007 US Open.JPG|thumb|Isner at the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]]]]
Isner began his professional career in earnest in the summer of 2007. With a world ranking of no. 839, he needed a [[Wild card (sports)|wildcard]] entry into the main draws of every single tournament, even at [[ITF Men's Circuit|Futures level]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steveghelper.com/MatchResults.php?players=John+Isner&weektype=from&from_date=8%2F27%2F2007&weeks_back=9|title=Isner Wild Card Entries in Summer of 2007|publisher=Steveghelper.com|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref>

He won his first tournament of the summer, the USA F14 Futures,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1100015500|title=John Isner wins singles at the 14th USA Futures event|publisher=International Tennis Federation}}</ref> beating the top three seeds along the way. Then, after first-round losses at [[ATP Challenger Tour|Challenger level]] as well as a tournament at ATP level, he beat five top-300 players and three seeds to win the Lexington Challenger in July and improve his ranking to no. 416 after just one month.

At the following week's tournament at the [[Legg Mason Tennis Classic]] in Washington, D.C., a late withdrawal freed up a wildcard spot, which was given to Isner at the last minute.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roddick to face amazing Isner in ATP Washington final|url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=188263|accessdate=June 25, 2010|newspaper=Turkish Press|date=August 4, 2007|agency=AFP}}</ref> Isner took full advantage of his good fortune, recording his first wins over top-100 players. He won third-set tiebreakers on five consecutive days, beating no. 73 [[Tim Henman]], no. 47 [[Benjamin Becker]], no. 189 qualifier [[Wayne Odesnik]], no. 12 [[Tommy Haas]], and no. 54 [[Gaël Monfils]], to reach the final, where he fell to fellow American [[Andy Roddick]]. His week raised his ranking to no. 193 in the world after six weeks on the pro tour.

Isner's success in Washington, D.C. earned him wildcard entries into three more ATP tournaments—the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati a week later, New Haven and the US Open. He lost in the first round in Cincinnati to quarterfinalist no. 15 [[David Ferrer]]. The following week in New Haven, he beat no. 49 Becker a second time, before falling to Ferrer for the second week in a row.

In his US Open début, he defeated the 26th-seeded player, former quarterfinalist [[Jarkko Nieminen]], firing 34 aces along the way. He proceeded to win his second-round match against [[Rik de Voest]], before losing in the third round to top seed and eventual champion [[Roger Federer]]. Isner was one of only two players to take a set from Federer in the championship. His US Open performance improved his ranking to no. 144.

After the US Open, Isner continued to play exclusively in North America and finished the year ranked no. 107. That year, Isner was added to the [[United States Davis Cup team]] as a practice partner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/122907/news_20071229033.shtml|title=News &#124; Sports: John Isner 12/29/07|publisher=OnlineAthens.com|date=December 28, 2007}}</ref>

Isner's no. 106 ranking in November 2007 was just good enough to get him direct entry into his first [[Australian Open]] after several players ranked above him dropped out.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Bonnie D.|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/notebook?page=notebook/tennis1211 |title=Isner on outside looking in at Australian Open ... for now|publisher=ESPN|date=December 11, 2007|accessdate=September 9, 2020}}</ref> He was defeated in the first round of the [[2008 Australian Open]] by veteran [[Fabrice Santoro]] of France. Teamed with Croat [[Ivo Karlović]], who stands half an inch taller (Karlović is currently the joint tallest player on the ATP World Tour alongside Reily Opelka), Isner also lost in the first round of doubles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Open results |url=http://stevegtennis.com/results/2008/a-ausopen.txt |work=SteveGTennis |accessdate=June 25, 2010 |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210154408/http://stevegtennis.com/results/2008/a-ausopen.txt |archive-date=February 10, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Isner broke into the top 100 at no. 93 in February with a quarterfinal appearance at an ATP event in San Jose, beating no. 90 [[Florent Serra]] and no. 26 Tommy Haas. He maintained a top-100 ranking in the first three months of the year, beating six players in the top 100, while playing exclusively in events at ATP level. Isner played at his first [[French Open]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], losing in the first round of each. He also played at the US Open, where he lost in the first round. He ended the year ranked no. 144 in the world.

===2009: Top 40, first top-10 wins===
Isner qualified for the singles draw of the [[2009 Heineken Open]] in Auckland, after winning three consecutive three-set matches in qualifying. His final match saw him bounce back from a 0–3 deficit in the third set to eventually beat Brazilian [[Thomaz Bellucci]] in a tiebreaker. In the main draw, Isner beat [[Albert Montañés]] and countryman [[Robby Ginepri]], before ultimately exiting with a loss in the quarterfinals.

Isner received a wildcard into the [[2009 Australian Open]], after winning the [[United States Tennis Association]]'s wildcard tournament, beating [[Donald Young (tennis)|Donald Young]] and [[Jesse Levine]] along the way.<ref>[https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=3790022 John Isner, Christina McHale Win USTA Wildcard Spots for Australian Open] SI.com, December 23, 2008.</ref> Despite serving 39 aces against his first-round opponent, Slovakia's [[Dominik Hrbatý]], he lost in four sets. Isner began working with a new coach, Craig Boynton, who had coached former world no. 1 [[Jim Courier]] in the 1990s, in March 2009.<ref name=maturingisner>{{cite news|last=Robson|first=Douglas|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2010-01-19-john-isner-rises_N.htm|title=Maturing Isner, the USA's No. 2, finds his comfort zone|work=USA Today|date=January 20, 2010}}</ref>

At the 2009 [[Indian Wells Masters]], Isner pulled off a major upset by defeating ninth seed Gaël Monfils. This was Isner's first win over a top-10 player, after four previous defeats. He then went on to defeat former world no. 1 [[Marat Safin]], before losing to world no. 6 [[Juan Martín del Potro]] in the fourth round.

In April 2009 at the [[U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]] in Houston, Texas, at [[River Oaks Country Club]], Isner made it as far as the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by fellow American Wayne Odesnik.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensclaycourt.com/|title=Mens Clay Court website|publisher=Mensclaycourt.com|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}</ref> Isner qualified for the French Open, but had to withdraw after being diagnosed with [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], which caused him to miss Wimbledon as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Isner Interview |url=http://www.ubitennis.com/2009/08/31/225035-john_isner.shtml |work=UbiTennis |accessdate=June 25, 2010 |date=August 31, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717133810/http://www.ubitennis.com/2009/08/31/225035-john_isner.shtml |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In August 2009, he defeated world no. 7 [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]] and world no. 18 [[Tomáš Berdych]] en route to the semifinals of the [[ATP Tour 500|ATP World Tour 500]] event in Washington, before losing to world no. 5 Andy Roddick. This performance brought him to a career-high ranking of no. 55 and a special exemption into the Masters 1000 Series event in Montreal, where he defeated Jesse Levine, before losing to [[Mikhail Youzhny]]. He earned a wildcard into the Masters 1000 Series event in Cincinnati, where he defeated world no. 21 Tommy Haas, before losing to world no. 35 [[Jérémy Chardy]] in the second round.
[[File:John Isner 2009 US Open.jpg|thumb|left|Isner's forehand return to [[Fernando Verdasco]] at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]]]]
Unseeded and ranked no. 55 in the world entering the US Open, Isner defeated world no. 29 [[Victor Hănescu]] in the first round, which was his first win in a Grand Slam tournament since the 2007 US Open, ending a streak of six consecutive defeats. He then advanced to the third round, where he defeated world no. 5 and fellow American Andy Roddick in five sets for his first victory over Roddick, his first victory in a five-set match, and the first time he advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament. He was then defeated in the fourth round by world no. 10 Fernando Verdasco in four sets. His US Open performance brought his ranking to a career-high no. 39.

After playing in Vienna, Basel and at the Paris Masters, Isner finished the year at a career-high no. 34 in the world. He has credited his work with Boynton for helping him get back on track following his disappointing 2008 season.<ref name=maturingisner/>

His progress was acknowledged by his peers, as he was voted the [[ATP World Tour Awards|ATP Most Improved Player]] for 2009,<ref name="ATPimproved">[http://www.atpworldtour.com/Fans/Fan-Favorite/Fan-Favourite.aspx ATP World Tour Awards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204095322/http://www.atpworldtour.com/Fans/Fan-Favorite/Fan-Favourite.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}.

===2010: First title, longest match in history===
[[File:J isner.jpg|thumb|left|Isner hits a forehand]]
Isner began the year at the [[2010 Heineken Open – Singles|2010 Heineken Open]] in Auckland. Unseeded, he reached his second career ATP final and first since Washington in 2007. In the final, he saved a championship point to defeat 2001 Australian Open finalist [[Arnaud Clément]].<ref>{{cite web|author=atp |url=http://www.heinekenopen.co.nz/1/news/newsarticle_4086.asp |title=International Series – Auckland |publisher=Heinekenopen.co.nz |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114215222/http://www.heinekenopen.co.nz/1/news/newsarticle_4086.asp |archive-date=January 14, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="1sttitle">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/01/2nd-Week/Auckland-Saturday-Isner-Takes-First-Title.aspx|title=Isner wins first ATP Tour Title|publisher=Atpworldtour.com|date=January 16, 2010}}</ref> The victory in Auckland was Isner's first ATP tour title; after the victory he donated $5,000 of his winnings to aid rescue action for the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].<ref name="spotlight">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/01/2nd-Week/Spotlight-John-Isner.aspx|title=First Time ATP Tour Winner Spotlight: John Isner|publisher=Atpworldtour.com|date=January 16, 2010}}</ref>

The victory catapulted Isner into the top 30 for the first time and also allowed him to surpass [[Sam Querrey]] to become the second-highest-ranked American for the first time, behind only Andy Roddick.<ref name= maturingisner/> Isner said he intended to finish the year in the top 20,<ref name="spotlight"/> and given his ascendency in the world rankings combined with the absence of Roddick and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]] for the [[2010 Davis Cup]] season, it became increasingly likely that Isner would qualify to play singles for the [[United States Davis Cup team]] for the first time in his career.<ref name= maturingisner/>

After [[Gilles Simon]] withdrew, Isner became the final seed for the [[2010 Australian Open – Men's Singles|2010 Australian Open]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4831093|title=American John Isner wins in Auckland – ESPN|publisher=ESPN|date=January 16, 2010}}</ref> In the first round, he defeated world no. 49 [[Andreas Seppi]] for his first victory at the Australian Open and his first victory at a Grand Slam other than the US Open. He then advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 4 and eventual finalist [[Andy Murray]].

After the Australian Open, Davis Cup captain [[Patrick McEnroe]] announced that Isner and Querrey would be first and second singles selections on the United States Davis Cup team's first-round [[2010 Davis Cup World Group|World Group]] tie in Serbia on indoor clay in March 2010; Isner described the selection as "a dream come true".<ref name="daviscup2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/archives/1657 |title=Are Isner and Querrey Ready for Davis Cup on Clay? |publisher=Worldtennismagazine.com |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref>

Isner next entered the [[2010 Regions Morgan Keegan Championships]] in Memphis. Seeded sixth, he made it to the finals, before losing to Sam Querrey. In the doubles event, Isner teamed up with Querrey to win the tournament, defeating the British-Australian pair of [[Ross Hutchins]] and [[Jordan Kerr]].

Prior to the Davis Cup tie, Isner competed at the [[2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel – Men's Singles|2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel Championships]], an [[ATP World Tour 500 series|ATP World Tour 500]] event on clay, where he was the fifth seed. He lost in the first round to [[Simon Greul]]. Despite the loss, Isner following the tournament moved into the top 20 for the first time.

Isner appeared in the first round of the 2010 Davis Cup, where the United States was up against Serbia. In his two singles matches, he faced Serbia's team of world no. 2 [[Novak Djokovic]] and world no. 35 [[Viktor Troicki]]. He lost the first singles match against Troicki, but bounced back by winning the doubles match with [[Bob Bryan]], as a replacement for food-poisoned [[Mike Bryan]]. In his second singles match, he lost to Djokovic, which enabled Serbia to defeat the United States.

At the [[2010 BNP Paribas Open]] in Indian Wells, he was seeded 15th and advanced to the fourth round, before losing to world no. 2 and defending champion [[Rafael Nadal]].

Afterwards, he appeared as the 17th seed at the second Masters 1000 Series event of the season—the [[2010 Sony Ericsson Open]] in Miami. He advanced to the third round, before losing to 12th seed [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]].

Isner began the clay-court season with an opening-round loss to world no. 89 [[Xavier Malisse]] at the U.S. Men's Claycourt Championship, followed by a round of 32 showing at his first-ever [[Internazionali BNL d'Italia]], where he defeated [[Horacio Zeballos]], before losing to Thomaz Bellucci. However, he teamed with Querrey to reach the doubles final in Rome, before losing to Bob and Mike Bryan; his doubles performance raised his doubles ranking to the top 30 for the first time.

His next tournament was the [[2010 Serbia Open – Singles|2010 Serbian Open]], where he was the second seed behind defending champion, tournament host and world no. 2 Djokovic. Isner advanced to the first clay-court final of his career, third final of the year, and fourth final of his career. In the final, he lost to Querrey, despite having a match point; this was the second consecutive final Isner lost to Querrey after serving for the championship. However, Isner's finals performance improved his ranking to a career-high no. 19.

Isner's next tournament was his debut appearance at the [[2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open – Men's Singles|Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open]]. Seeded thirteenth, he advanced to the round of 16, before losing to world no. 3 and eventual champion Nadal.

Isner then played at the [[2010 French Open – Men's Singles|2010 French Open]]; his ranking assured his first direct seed into a Grand Slam event. Seeded 17th, he defeated [[Andrey Golubev]] in the first round for his first singles victory at the French Open. He advanced to the third round, before losing to the no. 15 seed and eventual semifinalist [[Tomáš Berdych]]. In doubles, he and Querrey were the 12th seeds, but withdrew prior to the start of the tournament after Querrey's first-round loss in singles.

Despite being ranked no. 19 in the world entering Wimbledon, Isner was seeded 24th by the tournament committee due to his lack of experience on grass, but was moved up to 23rd following the withdrawal of [[Radek Štěpánek]]. In the first round, Isner played [[Nicolas Mahut]] in the [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|longest match in tennis history]], prevailing 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.<ref>https://www.atptour.com/en/news/watch-isner-mahut-wimbledon-2010-epic</ref> However, fatigued and having little time to recover his energy, Isner was beaten by [[Thiemo de Bakker]] in the second round, 0–6, 3–6, 2–6, having served no aces. He also pulled out of the doubles, where he and Querrey had been 12th seeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marathon man Isner slips to weary defeat|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/tennis/06/25/tennis.isner.de.bakker.djokovic/|website=CNN|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> Despite having been eliminated in the second round, Isner's total of 113 aces<ref name='MahutIsnerMatchStats'>{{cite web|url=http://2010.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day11/1160ms.html |title=Official Wimbledon match statistics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207111944/http://2010.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day11/1160ms.html |archive-date=December 7, 2010 }}</ref> were more than any other player throughout the championship.

Isner's next tournament was the [[2010 Atlanta Tennis Championships – Singles|2010 Atlanta Tennis Championships]], where he played doubles with James Blake and reached the semifinals. In singles, Isner was second seed and made it to his fourth final of the year, before losing to [[Mardy Fish]], which dropped his career record in finals to 1–4 (0–4 against Americans).

Isner next competed at the [[2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic – Singles|2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic]], the ATP World Tour 500 series event in Washington, D.C. and site of his breakthrough performance in 2007. Isner was to also compete in the [[2010 Legg Mason Tennis Classic – Doubles|doubles]] with Sam Querrey, but withdrew due to shoulder concerns. Seeded fifth in singles, Isner made it to the round of 16, before losing to Xavier Malisse.

Isner next played at the [[2010 Western & Southern Financial Group Masters – Singles|2010 Cincinnati Masters]], where he was unseeded. After defeating [[Łukasz Kubot]] in the first round, he faced 2002 Wimbledon finalist and 2005 Tennis Masters Cup champion [[David Nalbandian]], but was forced to retire up a break at 5–4 in the first set after injuring his right ankle. Although Isner was found to have suffered ligament damage to the ankle, he chose not to withdraw from the US Open singles tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2010/8/20/1633418/john-isner-injury-ankle-ligament-damage |title=Despite Injuries, John Isner Will Play in US Open |publisher=Sbnation.com |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref>

At the [[2010 US Open – Men's Singles|2010 US Open]], Isner was 18th seed and defeated [[Frederico Gil]] in the first round.

This match lasted 6 hours and 36 minutes with a final score of 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4, 26–24, which was the fourth-longest match in history and the second-longest at a Grand Slam tournament behind Isner's first round defeat of Nicolas Mahut in 2010, also at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite news|date=July 14, 2018|title=Kevin Anderson wins five-set epic with John Isner to reach Wimbledon final|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/13/kevin-anderson-wins-five-set-epic-with-john-isner-to-reach-wimbledon-final|access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref> Isner adopting and working on an aggressive return style and a strong serve-and-volley game have been cited as reasons for his success in 2018 at Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite news | title = Pure Elation: Isner's Grand Slam Breakthrough | url = https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/isner-raonic-wimbledon-2018-qf | publisher = ATP | date = July 12, 2018 | accessdate = July 12, 2018 }}</ref>

Isner then won the [[2018 BB&T Atlanta Open|2018 Atlanta Open]], defeating Ryan Harrison 5–7, 6–3, 6–4. This was Isner's fifth title at Atlanta. At the [[2018 US Open – Men's Singles|US Open]], Isner reached his second quarterfinal at a Slam in 2018, before losing to Juan Martin del Potro. Owing to the birth of his first child, Isner skipped the Asian swing. He reached the semifinal at [[2018 Stockholm Open – Singles|Stockholm]] and lost to qualifier Ernest Gulbis. At [[2018 Erste Bank Open – Singles|Vienna]], he lost to Gaël Monfils in the second round.

===2019: Fifth Masters final===
John Isner reached the final of the [[2019 Miami Open|Miami Open]], where he lost to Roger Federer.<ref>{{cite web| title=Federer In Full Flight: Roger Soars To Fourth Miami Crown | url=https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-isner-2019-miami-final | website = atpworldtour.com | publisher = ATP | date = 31 March 2019 | accessdate = 5 April 2019}}</ref>

==Longest matches in Grand Slam history (2010, 2018)==
Isner has also earned a reputation for competing in extremely even, long duration matches and holds the unique distinction of having been a competitor in the longest and second-longest matches in a major tournament in history. The first was the now-legendary opening-round match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships when Isner defeated Nicolas Mahut in 11 hours and 5 minutes in a match played over three separate days. The second-longest match in major tournament history was Isner's loss to South African Kevin Anderson in the first men's semifinal at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.

'''The longest match in history: Isner v Mahut, June 22–24, 2010'''
{{Main|Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships}}
At the 2010 Wimbledon Championships, Isner faced [[Glossary of tennis#Qualifier|qualifier]] Nicolas Mahut in the first round. Isner won the match 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 7–6, 70–68.

The final set alone was longer than the previous longest match.

In the match, Isner set the record for the most aces served in a match, breaking Ivo Karlović's record of 78; Mahut passed the old mark as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day10/1160ms.html |title=Isner-Mahut Match Sheet |publisher=Wimbledon.org |date=September 21, 1998 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626172731/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day10/1160ms.html |archive-date=June 26, 2010 }}</ref> Isner set a new record of 113 aces, ahead of the 103 aces served by Mahut.

The first four sets were played on June 22. At 21:13 [[British Summer Time|BST]] on June 23 the match was suspended due to darkness for a second day at 59–59 in the fifth set. The match resumed on June 24, at 15:30 BST,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/schedule/index.html |title=2010 Wimbledon Championships Website – Official Site by IBM |publisher=Wimbledon.org |date=September 21, 1998 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619000945/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/schedule/index.html |archive-date=June 19, 2010 }}</ref> starting the third day of the match. Overall, the match lasted eleven hours and five minutes. Isner also set the record for the most games won in a Wimbledon match with 92.

The match brought Isner a measure of fame, particularly in the United Kingdom and his native United States. He had guest appearances on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', and threw the ceremonial first pitch at a [[New York Yankees]] game in [[Yankee Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/06/Wimbledon/Isner-On-Letterman.aspx|title=Isner on Letterman|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=June 29, 2010|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/06/Other/Isner-Media-Tour.aspx|title=Isner Media Tour|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> He and Mahut also won the 2010 [[ESPY Award]] for Best Record-Breaking Performance in sport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2010/07/Other/ESPY-Awards-Isner-Mahut-Win.aspx|title=Isner & Mahut Win ESPY Award For Best Record-Breaking Performance|publisher=atpworldtour.com|date=July 14, 2010|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref>

'''The second-longest match: Isner v Anderson, July 13, 2018'''

This match saw Isner face similarly big-serving Kevin Anderson of South Africa.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2018/07/13/kevin-anderson-vs-john-isner-wimbledon-2018-live-score-latest/</ref> The match is the longest tennis match ever in the second week of a Grand Slam tournament, both by time and number of games played. It is also the longest-ever match on [[Centre Court]], and the fourth-longest tennis match of all time.

The first three sets were all decided by tiebreakers, the first going to Anderson 7–6 and both the second and third going to Isner. In the fourth set Anderson exploited an opening and broke Isner's serve to make the score 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4 going into a fifth set in which Anderson seemed to have gained significant momentum from his service break. The fifth quickly became a battle of services as both players began to tire. At 16–17 it began to rain, leading to speculation of a delay to close the Centre Court roof, but the rain stopped during the crossover break. Isner endured a shaky mistake which permitted Anderson to get back in the game to 40–30 from 40–0 down, but Isner forced Anderson to miss the next backhand return and held serve. At 24–24, Anderson built up a 0–40 lead and while Isner got back two of those points to bring the score to 30–40, Anderson broke Isner on his third break point of the game, and served out to win the match in 6 hours and 36 minutes, with the line score reading 7–6, 6–7, 6–7, 6–4, 26–24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/scores/match_related/1601.html|title=Kevin Anderson vs. John Isner linescore|website=Wimbledon.com}}</ref><ref>Wimbledon 2018: Kevin Anderson beats John Isner in record-breaking semi-final https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/44823525</ref>

==Playing style and equipment==
Isner has an extremely powerful and consistent serve, thanks in part to his 6-foot-10½-inch height which makes him the third-tallest player on tour behind Ivo Karlović and Reilly Opelka. Commentators{{Who|date=June 2010}} have also praised his composure; in five consecutive third-set tiebreaker wins in Washington, D.C., he delivered huge serves when it mattered most.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisserver.com/lines/lines_07_08_05.html|title=Tennis Server - Between The Lines - Legg Mason 07: John Isner, Roddick, and the Doubles}}</ref> Isner also has a very powerful forehand, which he uses in tandem with his serve. Isner will often go for one-two points: a big serve followed up by a big forehand. He is also known to back up his serves with approaches to the net, though he does not strictly [[serve-and-volley]]. Isner's movement around the court is hampered by his body and he is hurt by players that move him around the court. Isner's fitness has improved considerably throughout the years, as he displayed during his win in the longest tennis match ever at Wimbledon against Nicolas Mahut.

Because of his style of play, that consists of a big, consistent serve, he often ends up winning a great majority of his service games. But at the same time, due to poor movement around the court, he often finds it difficult to break the opponent's serve, especially those players that move him around the court. This often finds him involved in long matches where each player continues holding serve until the set reaches the tiebreak. At Grand Slams where there are no fifth-set tiebreaks (since 2019 only Roland Garros, but before also Wimbledon and the Australian Open), his matches can extend very long, as evidenced by the fact that he was a player in the two longest-ever Grand Slam matches, both at Wimbledon in 2010 and 2018, respectively.

As of January 2012, Isner was sponsored by [[Lacoste]] and [[Prince Sports|Prince]] for his attire and rackets, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=Elmore|first=Charles|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/sports/content/shared-blogs/palmbeach/elmore/entries/2007/09/05/sponsors_flock.html|title=Sponsors flock to Isner|publisher=Palmbeachpost.com|date=September 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/20585904|title=John Isner Is A 'Prince' Of An Endorser|publisher=Cnbc.com|date=September 4, 2007}}</ref> His attire carried through most of 2015. He switched his attire to [[Fila (company)|FILA]] in 2016 at the Australian Open.

==Coaches==
Isner's first coach was Craig Boynton, who worked with him from 2009 to 2012 and helped develop his style of play.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Isner Drops Coach |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/sports/tennis/john-isner-parts-ways-with-coach-craig-boynton.html |accessdate=7 February 2019 |agency=New York Times}}</ref> Isner and Boynton split over reportedly mutual agreement. Isner then hired Mike Sell, who helped him to significant success, such as defeating Roger Federer, David Nalbandian and Novak Djokovic. During his time with Sell, Isner's ranking stayed around no. 10 in the world. After parting from Sell in 2014, Isner teamed with Justin Gimelstob and worked with him until April 2016. With Gimelstob, Isner's ranking stayed around 10, until 2016, where he dropped to 17. As of 2018, he is currently working with coaches Rene Moller and David Macpherson.

==Personal life==
Isner has two older brothers. He started playing tennis seriously at age 11. He is a graduate of [[Walter Hines Page Senior High School]], in Greensboro,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sirera|first1=Joe|title=Page tennis team reminds assistant coach of the John Isner days|url=http://www.greensboro.com/sports/hsxtra/page-tennis-team-reminds-assistant-coach-of-the-john-isner/article_00a3c5b6-cf21-11e3-9a96-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=December 15, 2016|work=Greensboro News & Record|date=April 28, 2014}}</ref> and the [[University of Georgia]], where he majored in [[speech communication]]. He resided in [[Tampa, Florida]], where he trained at the [[Saddlebrook Academies|Saddlebrook Academy]] alongside other American tennis pros such as James Blake and Mardy Fish. Currently, he resides in [[Dallas]], Texas.<ref name=papercity>{{cite web |author1=Lisa Collins Shaddock |title=John Isner and His Wife, Madison McKinley, Bring Dallas to the Wimbledon Semis |url=https://www.papercitymag.com/culture/sporting-life/john-isner-wife-madison-mckinley-bring-dallas-wimbledon-semis-baby-girl-watch/ |website=PaperCity Magazine |publisher=Urban Publishers, Inc |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |date=July 12, 2018 |quote=The future is looking beyond bright for Dallas’ resident tennis darling John Isner.}}</ref>
