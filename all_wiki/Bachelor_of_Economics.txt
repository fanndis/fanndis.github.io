The '''Bachelor of Economics''' (BEc or BEcon) <ref name="University of Sydney course information">{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-economics|title=BACHELOR OF ECONOMICS|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]}}</ref><ref name="HK"/> is a four-year [[undergraduate degree]] in [[economics|economic theory]], [[econometrics]] and [[applied economics]].
Specialized  <ref name="Toronto"/><ref name="BIU"/><ref name = "THE"/><ref name="UFS"/> economics degrees are also offered as a 
BA (Econ),<ref name ="SOAS"/><ref name="BIU">[https://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=7466&pt=1&pid=7305&level=0&cPath=7466 "Economics as an expanded subject"], [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref> 
BSc (Econ),<ref name="LSE">[http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Undergraduate/Degree-programmes-2021/BSc-Economics BSc Economics], [[London School of Economics]]</ref><ref name="Tilburg">[https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/bachelors-programs/economics BSc Economics], [[Tilburg University]]</ref>  
BCom (Econ), BSocSc (Econ);
other titles are
Bachelor in Economic Sciences (B.Econ.Sc.)<ref name = "Wits2">[https://www.wits.ac.za/course-finder/undergraduate/clm/economic-science/and Bachelor of Economic Science], [[University of the Witwatersrand]]</ref> and '''Bachelor of Applied Economics'''.
These degrees may span three years. 
The curriculum is (substantially) more theoretical and mathematical than the [[academic major|major]] in economics available generally (BBA, general BCom or BA).<ref name="Toronto">[https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/undergraduate/load/overview "Economics Specialist"], [[University of Toronto]]</ref><ref name="BIU"/><ref name="Tilburg"/><ref>[https://education.seattlepi.com/difference-between-bba-economics-bachelor-arts-economics-1668.html The Difference Between a BBA in Economics & Bachelor of the Arts in Economics], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''</ref><ref name="UNSW">[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ihTLKhTAQi4 Bachelor of Commerce or Bachelor of Economics?], [[UNSW Business School]]</ref><ref name="Rhodes">[https://www.ru.ac.za/facultyofcommerce/studying/links/bachelorofeconomics/ Bachelor of Economics], [[Rhodes University]]</ref>

==Structure==
The BEcon and the specialized degrees <ref name="Toronto"/><ref name="BIU"/><ref name = "THE"/> each have their own structure, differing by university. 
Generally, though, the curriculum is built around a core of theory, to which is added courses in the various branches, and areas of application; <ref name ="UCLA"/> see next section.
In the US, a structured "program" 
is often offered within the [[College of Arts and Sciences]].

<ref name="UWA">[https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/economics ECONOMICS], [[University of Western Australia]]</ref>
The program is often available as a [[social science]] degree.

Several universities offer a separate 1 year [[Honours degree]], <ref name="ANU">[https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/hecon Bachelor of Economics (Honours)], [[Australian National University]]</ref> and the program then comprises "3 years [[Bachelor of Commerce#Honours Bachelor of Commerce|plus 1]]"; often Honours (or Honors in the US) is included in the four year structure. <ref name="Harvard">[https://economics.harvard.edu/concentration-requirements Concentration Requirements], [[Harvard]]</ref> An Honours research-thesis will be required.

Under both specialized and general programs, economics is often combined with a second major in [[Finance]] or [[Management]],

or with other social sciences; 
<ref name="OU"/><ref name ="UCT">[https://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/Economics/Pages/Bachelor-of-Social-Science-Degree-Majoring-in-Economics Bachelor of Social Science Degree Majoring in Economics], [[University of Cape Town]]</ref>
in the US, economics is often combined with a quantitative subject such as math or computer science.<ref>Wendy A. Stock (2017). [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20171067 Trends in Economics and Other Undergraduate Majors]. ''[[American Economic Review]]'', vol. 107, no. 5, May 2017 (pp. 644-49)</ref>
The interdisciplinary [[Philosophy, politics and economics|"PPE"]] integrates [[Philosophy]] and [[Politics]] with Economics.
Some [[business schools]] offer a joint program with the economics department;
<ref>[https://undergrad.wharton.upenn.edu/academics/bs-in-economics/ BS in Economics], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]]</ref>
<ref>[https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/bahons-economics-and-management BA(Hons) in Economics and Management], [[Sa√Ød Business School]]</ref>
similarly, joint-majors are commonly offered with the mathematics department.

<ref>[https://economics.harvard.edu/applied-matheconomics Applied Math/Economics], [[Harvard]]</ref>

Some [[university|universities]] allow that the degree as a whole may be further specialized; 
either in one of the applied areas, 
or, more common, in one of the major branches, often development economics,<ref>[https://www.soas.ac.uk/economics/programmes/bscdevecon/ BSc Development Economics], [[SOAS]]</ref>

or agricultural economics.<ref>[https://www.uidaho.edu/cals/agricultural-economics-and-rural-sociology/bs-applied-econ B.S. Agricultural Economics: Applied Economics], [[University of Idaho]]</ref>
Others allow this specialization at the [[Honours degree]] level.
Some universities offer a "Bachelor of Applied Economics"

integrate finance into the economics program, as opposed to via a second major.

==Curriculum==
:''See: [[Economics education #Curriculum]]; [[Outline of economics]].''
Typically,
<ref name ="UCLA"/>
<ref name="Pittsburgh">[https://www.asundergrad.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/ECON.pdf "Economics Major and Minor"], [[University of Pittsburgh]]</ref> 
<ref name ="Stanford">[https://economics.stanford.edu/undergraduate/major Economics Major], [[Stanford University]]</ref>
<ref>[https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/bec_becon.html#df-acc-degree_structure_parent Bachelor of Economics - Degree Structure], [[University of Adelaide]]</ref>
the core-degree comprises [[microeconomics]], [[macroeconomics]] and [[econometrics]]; 
while [[mathematical economics]] is sometimes required.<ref name="Wits"/><ref name="UFS">[https://apps.ufs.ac.za/dl/yearbooks/346_yearbook_eng.pdf BCom with specialisation in Economics], [[University of the Free State]]</ref>
Micro- and macroeconomics are taught through the "intermediate" level, preparing the student for the "advanced" postgraduate courses.
Macroeconomics extends to a discussion of the [[History of macroeconomic thought|more advanced models of the economy]], differences here between [[Schools of economic thought|schools]], and the related [[Macroeconomics#Macroeconomic policy|policy analysis]];
microeconomics extends to [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]], to an analytic approach to demand, with curves derived from [[utility function]]s, and to [[Game_theory#Economics_and_business|game theory]] as [[Oligopoly#Characteristics|applied to competition]].
Some programs then specify a course in [[microfoundations]], where the macroeconomic models are derived by aggregating microeconomic models.
[[Econometrics]] is intended to give empirical content to these economic relationships, and here focuses on the [[Single-equation methods (econometrics)|single-equation methods]] largely [[linear regression]], and [[time series]].

Building on this core, are courses in the major [[Economics#Branches of economics|branches of economics]]:  
[[monetary economics]], [[international economics]], [[development economics]], [[labor economics]], and [[welfare economics]].
Social science oriented degrees may emphasize [[economic statistics]] and [[political economy]]; and often do not require econometrics or mathematical economics.
[[History of economic thought]] and [[economic history]] may be included in either variant.

Electives <ref name ="Stanford"/><ref name="Pittsburgh"/> may be offered in the above branches, or in various areas of [[applied economics]], 
such as [[agricultural economics]], [[environmental economics]], [[resource economics]], [[managerial economics]], and [[financial economics]]. 
Mathematical economics is often an elective; it is generally recommended for those intending graduate training in Economics. In the US, these students will often also study selected math-courses in [[multivariable calculus]], [[differential equations]], [[linear algebra]], [[mathematical optimization|optimization]], and sometimes [[mathematical analysis|analysis]].<ref name="Hamilton">[https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/departments/Courses-and-Requirements?dept=Economics Courses and Requirements: Economics], [[Hamilton College]]</ref>

Co-requisite courses from outside of economics are invariably a program requirement.
Common to all business programs are introductory or [[business statistics]], and "quantitative techniques" (comprising basic calculus, interest calculations, and sometimes matrix operations); 
the social science programs often include these, and may also require [[sociology]] and [[psychology]].  
Some knowledge of [[accountancy]] or management may be assumed in the "applied courses"; credits in these are usually inherent in the  business degree.

Most specialized programs require further "Mathematics for Economists", which additionally includes a (detailed) review of the topics mentioned above re US students;

See for example these sequences. 
[[University of Queensland|UQ]]: [https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ECON1050 i], [https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ECON2050 ii], [https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ECON8000 iii];
[[University of Cape Town|UCT]]: [https://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/Economics/CourseInfo/ECO3021S i], [https://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/Economics/CourseInfo/ECO4112F ii], [https://www.commerce.uct.ac.za/Economics/CourseInfo/ECO5011F iii]. The final in both cases is at masters level and includes analysis.
Some universities - [[University of Johannesburg|UJ]], [https://www.uj.ac.za/faculties/fefs/economics/Pages/BCom-Economics-and-Econometrics.aspx for example] - title the sequence "Quantitative Economics".

see [[Business mathematics #Undergraduate]]. 
Statistics is similarly extended,<ref name ="SOAS">[https://www.soas.ac.uk/economics/programmes/baecon/ BA Economics], [[SOAS]]</ref><ref name="Stellenbosch"/> often within the math course, as underpin to the econometrics coursework.
The specialized BSc programs are often more math intensive than the BA programs.<ref name = "THE">[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/subjects/what-can-you-do-economics-degree What can you do with an economics degree?], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''</ref>
Similarly, the Honors track will have additional math requirements.<ref name="Harvard"/>
<!-- ==By country==
In Australia, a '''Bachelor of Economics with Honours''' degree is a four-year degree and is taken subsequently as an extension to the three-year Bachelor of Economics. The degree consists of a single-year full-time program. The degree requires more academic courses with a researched [[thesis]] component.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-economics-honours.html |title=Bachelor of Economics (Honours) |website=University of Sydney |access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>

In Hong Kong, the [[University of Hong Kong]] offers a four-year Bachelor of Economics degree,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbe.hku.hk/academic-programmes/undergraduate/becon |title=Bachelor of Economics [BEcon] |website=University of Hong Kong |access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref> with an option to take a double major in Economics and Finance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbe.hku.hk/academic-programmes/undergraduate/becon-fin |title=Bachelor of Economics and Finance [BEcon&Fin] |website=University of Hong Kong |access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>
