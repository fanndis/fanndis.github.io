'''Juiz de Fora''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʒwiʒ dʒi ˈfɔɾɐ}}, ''[[juiz de fora (office)|Outsider Judge]]''), also known as '''J.F.''', is a city in the southeastern Brazilian state of [[Minas Gerais]], approximately {{convert|40|km}} from the state border with [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].  According to 2017 estimates the current population is about 563,769 inhabitants.  The geographical area of the municipality is {{convert|1437|km2|abbr=on}}.

The city's location was a key factor in its economic and demographic development since it is situated between the three most important financial and economic metropolises of [[Southeast Region, Brazil|southeast Brazil]] (and also the three largest [[urban sprawl]]s of the country):  Rio de Janeiro ({{convert|189|km|abbr=on}}), Belo Horizonte ({{convert|260|km|abbr=on}}) and São Paulo ({{convert|486|km|abbr=on}}). Major highways connect Juiz de Fora with these three metropolitan areas, the most important being the BR 040 which connects [[Brasília]] with [[Rio de Janeiro]] via [[Belo Horizonte]]. The city is built on the [[Paraibuna River (Minas Gerais)|Paraibuna]], a major tributary of the [[Paraíba do Sul]] river.

==History==
[[Image:Juiz de fora (1893).jpg|thumb|Juiz de Fora in 1893.]]

The origins of Juiz de Fora can be traced back to the beginnings of the 18th century, when the [[Caminho Novo]] (''New Way'') road was opened linking [[Rio de Janeiro]] to the gold rush area of [[Minas Gerais]] around Vila Rica (now [[Ouro Preto]]). The region was covered with dense forest (hence its name; "Zona da Mata", ''Forest Zone''). Despite the opening of the new route the area remained largely uninhabited and most of its scarce settlement was centered on the road itself. The first permanent inhabitants of the municipality were merchants and farmers who supplied the travelers' needs on the long road between the coast and the gold region.

Further development would only take place after the decline of gold mining in the central zone of [[Minas Gerais]]. The capital previously invested in the mines was now invested in coffee plantations, and the region of [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] became a fertile ground to invest in. The position of the village then called Santo Antônio do [[Paraibuna River (Minas Gerais)|Paraibuna]] was favourable due to the road connection with the capital of the country and its harbour.

In 1850 the small village was officially elevated to city status. Progress continued in 1861 with the completion of the first [[macadamized]] road in Latin America, the [[Estrada União e Indústria]] (Union and Industry), replacing the Caminho Novo. Its name reflected the new found wealth of the city, for industry replaced coffee-related agriculture as its economic heart.  Five years later a new railway, the [[Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil|Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II]], reached the city and in 1889 the first hydroelectric powerplant of Latin America ([[Marmelos Zero Power Plant|Marmelos Zero]]) was built on the Paraibuna river on the outskirts of the city along the Estrada União e Indústria.

As both foreign and domestic capital fueled the industrial boom the city became a major centre (becoming the largest urban area of the state). By first decade of the 20th century Juiz de Fora was among the main textile and industrial producers in South America and in [[Brazil]] particularly. The city's wealth was second only to major cities such as [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. But as the coffee rush frontier moved southwestwards it reached the [[state of São Paulo]] and its immensely fertile plateaus which became the richest in the federation and industry flourished there as it had in Juiz de Fora itself. The city of Juiz de Fora became the major industrial centre in a state that was being much surpassed by [[São Paulo]] in industrial output, and worse still much of the wealth generated by the state (a large bulk by Juiz de Fora itself) was being used in the building of the new state capital [[Belo Horizonte]] (replacing [[Ouro Preto]] at the centre of the gold region), founded at the end of the 19th century and which, in the Brazilian and Latin-American tradition of centralization, was intended to be the largest city of the state. The [[Great Depression]] of the 30s worsened the city's decay which would only be overcome five decades later. By the 1940s the city had lost its nationwide influence due to the continued growth of Belo Horizonte and the loss of industry.

The city's decay can be seen in the figures for its population which remained stagnant from the early 1930s to the late 1960s. By the mid-1970s, the city started to experience new growth, which continues to this day. This new era began with the establishment of a federal university ([[UFJF]]) in the city and the decision by the Brazilian military junta (1964–1985) to promote the city as a major military centre. This sparked a phenomenon rarely experienced by post-industrial towns: the industrial rebirth of the city, this time following Brazilian industrialization itself, based on heavy-industry such as steel and engineering.

Recently, the city seems to be experiencing a new era in its history, again following a boom in Brazilian economy, and is reinventing itself as a major centre for services (such as telecommunications, with an important call centre) and education (following the federal university, private colleges have been established in the city).

Today Juiz de Fora is an important commercial centre for the surrounding region and is the core of an unofficial metropolitan area of more than 1 million inhabitants.

==Economy==

Juiz de Fora is the third most important industrial center in the state of [[Minas Gerais]], despite being the fourth largest in terms of population{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. It was once the state's largest city, a position which was held up until the beginning of the 20th century (it held the second position until the 1980s). There are important steel mills and automotive factories ([[Mercedes-Benz]] being the most famous) in the city, along with several textile factories.

The city is also an important trade center with a considerable area of influence, being considered the capital of the [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] region of the state. It has four big shopping malls, several hyper-marts and many smaller shops.

==Transport==

==Culture==
The massive presence of immigrants – especially from [[Portugal]], Italy, Germany, [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] and more recently China  – throughout its history has given the city a cosmopolitan spirit and diverse cuisine. Walking down Rio Branco Avenue, (the city's several kilometers long main avenue) one can find typical German, Italian, Arabic, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese restaurants, as well as traditional Brazilian and vegetarian cuisine.

Juiz de Fora is an important regional cultural center, one of the few towns in south-east Minas Gerais to have permanently functional cinemas, theatres, music venues and light entertainment. There is a nationally important museum ([[Museu Mariano Procópio]]) and a Philharmonic Orchestra (Orquestra Filarmônica Pró-Musica). The city also hosts a yearly classical music festival, the Festival Internacional de Música Brasileira Colonial e Música Antiga (International Festival of Brazilian Colonial Music and Early Music).

==Sport==
===Football===
Juiz de Fora is the home of [[Tupi Football Club|Tupi]] and [[Tupynambás Futebol Clube|Tupynambás]]. Tupi was the 1932 runner-up of [[Campeonato Mineiro]],<ref name="globoesporte.globo.com">[http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/brasileirao-serie-d/noticia/2011/11/tupi-vence-estraga-festa-do-santa-cruz-e-conquista-o-titulo-da-serie-d.html Tupi vence, estraga festa do Santa Cruz e conquista o título da Série D | globoesporte.com].

Tupi won the [[Campeonato Mineiro (lower levels)|Minas Gerais Second Division]] in 2001, was 3rd place in [[2008 Campeonato Mineiro]] and won [[Taça Minas Gerais]] in 2008. It is widely regarded as one of the most important teams of the state, despite lacking national prestige.

However, they finished 18th in the [[2016 Campeonato Brasileiro Série B]] and was relegated back to Série C. After missing promotion in the final stage in 2017, the next year saw Tupi relegated to Série D due to goal difference.

Meanwhile, after the 60s, Tupynambás had sporadically played at [[Campeonato Mineiro (lower levels)|Campeonato Mineiro lower levels]] with their football department closed most of the years.

In 2019, with both teams together in Minas Gerais first division since [[:pt:Campeonato Mineiro de Futebol de 1970|1970]], Tupi had a disappointing campaign after failing to win a single match and being relegated after finishing in the last place; meanwhile Tupynambás won their first match by 5-1 against [[Villa Nova Atlético Clube|Villa Nova]],<ref>https://www.mg.superesportes.com.br/app/noticias/futebol/interior/2019/01/20/noticia_interior,562450/em-volta-a-elite-do-mineiro-tupynambas-surpreende-e-massacra-villa-no.shtml [[Diários Associados]]</ref> defeated their city rivals in the second match by 1-0<ref>https://globoesporte.globo.com/mg/zona-da-mata-centro-oeste/futebol/campeonato-mineiro/jogo/23-01-2019/tupynambas-tupi-mg.ghtml</ref> and finished in the 8th place, being beaten by [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] in the quarter-finals.<ref>https://globoesporte.globo.com/mg/futebol/campeonato-mineiro/</ref>
