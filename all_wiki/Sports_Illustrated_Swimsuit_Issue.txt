==History==
The swimsuit issue was invented by ''Sports Illustrated'' editor [[Andre Laguerre]] to fill the winter months, a typically slow point in the sporting calendar.<ref name=Slate/> He asked fashion reporter Jule Campbell to go on a shoot to fill space, including the cover, with a beautiful model. The first issue, released in 1964, entailed a cover featuring [[Babette March]] and a five-page layout. Campbell soon became a powerful figure in modeling and molded the issue into a media phenomenon by featuring "bigger and healthier" California women and printing the names of the models with their photos, beginning a new supermodel era.<ref name=Slate/>  In the 1950s, a few women appeared on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', but the 1964 issue is considered to be the beginning of the current format known as the Swimsuit Issue. The issue that got the most letters was the 1978 edition.<ref name="SI50">''Sports Illustrated 50: The Anniversary Book'', Rob Fleder, 2005, p. 286, {{ISBN|1-932273-49-2}}.</ref>  In 1997, [[Tyra Banks]] was the first black woman on the cover.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:SPTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB52D63C3163F0C&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420 |title=Under the right cover, "SI' can be hot collectible|accessdate=August 10, 2009|date=April 2, 1995|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|author=Layberger, Tom}}</ref> Since 1997, the swimsuit issue has been a stand-alone edition, separate from the regular weekly magazine.<ref>{{cite web|last=Isidore|first=Chris|title=Bikini empire: Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue has spawned spin-off products worth $10 million a year|publisher=CNNMoney|date=February 16, 2005|url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/02/15/news/fortune500/swimsuit/|accessdate=June 25, 2016}}</ref> Its best selling issue was the 25th Anniversary Issue with [[Kathy Ireland]] on the cover in 1989.<ref name="SI50" />

Through the years, many models, such as [[Cheryl Tiegs]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Paulina Porizkova]], [[Elle Macpherson]], [[Rachel Hunter]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Petra Nemcova]], [[Valeria Mazza]], [[Heidi Klum]], [[Tyra Banks]], [[Marisa Miller]], [[Irina Shayk]], and [[Camille Kostek]] have been featured on the cover. Other models within its pages, but not on its cover, include [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Stephanie Seymour]], [[Niki Taylor]], [[Angie Everhart]], and [[Naomi Campbell]]. The eight models featured on the cover of the 2006 issue were featured in a coffee-table book called ''[[Sports Illustrated: Exposure]]''. Photographed by [[Raphael Mazzucco]] and produced by Diane Smith, the unprecedented "reunion shoot" featured 139 pages of previously-unpublished images. In 2006, the issue expanded publishing to [[handheld device]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/13/business/media/13sports.html|title=So Many Models in Bikinis, So Many Ways to See Them|author=Miller, Lia|date=February 13, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 10, 2007}}</ref> In 2007, the swimsuit issue first became available in China.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/weekinreview/04barboza.html|title=The People's Republic of Sex Kittens and Metrosexuals|author=Barboza, David|date=March 4, 2007|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 11, 2007}}</ref>

[[Valentina Sampaio]] became the swimsuit issue’s first openly transgender model in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ali |first1=Rasha |title=Valentina Sampaio makes history as first openly transgender Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/07/10/valentina-sampaio-first-trans-model-sports-illustrated/5412980002/ |accessdate=10 July 2020 |work=USA TODAY}}</ref>

==Non-models in the magazine==
Female athletes have appeared in swimsuit shoots. [[Steffi Graf]] appeared in 1997. In the 2003 issue, tennis player [[Serena Williams]] and figure skater [[Ekaterina Gordeeva]] were featured inside the magazine. In 2016, UFC fighter [[Ronda Rousey]] became the first female athlete to appear on the cover. However, [[Anna Kournikova]] appeared in an inset on the 2004 cover, and had a photo spread within its pages.

In 2005, Olympic gold medalists [[Amanda Beard]] and [[Jennie Finch]], along with [[Lauren Jackson]] and [[Venus Williams]], were featured. [[Maria Sharapova]] appeared in an inset on the 2006 cover and had a spread inside. In spring 2006, ''Sports Illustrated'' chose music as the theme for the 2007 issue. Swimsuit editor Diane Smith<ref>"Masthead". ''Sports Illustrated''. September 5, 2011: 14. Print.</ref> wanted [[Grammy]]-winner [[Beyoncé Knowles]] to pose.<ref>''Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue'', Winter 2007, p. 15, Diane Smith, senior editor</ref> In 2006, Beyoncé launched a swimsuit line under her [[House of Deréon]] clothing label. Beyoncé Knowles became the first singer, and first non-model non-athlete, to appear on the cover in 2007.

In 2008, [[National Football League cheerleading|NFL cheerleaders]] appeared for the first time. Teams include the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[San Diego Chargers]], [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Miami Dolphins]], [[Philadelphia Eagles]], [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[New England Patriots]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Houston Texans]].<ref name="foxbusiness.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/article/supermodel-marisa-miller-adorns-cover-2008-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue_475383_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217150055/http://www.foxbusiness.com/article/supermodel-marisa-miller-adorns-cover-2008-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue_475383_1.html|url-status=dead|title=Supermodel Marisa Miller Adorns the Cover of the 2008 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue on Newsstands Today!<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=February 17, 2008}}</ref>

Race car driver [[Danica Patrick]] appeared in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, she was featured in a four-page spread set in [[Singer Island, Florida]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.si.com/swim-daily/photos/2015/04/27/si-swimsuit-2008-danica-patrick |title=SI Swimsuit 2008 & 2009: Danica Patrick|accessdate=April 3, 2019|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref>

For the 2010 issue, four female Winter Olympians appeared in swimsuits: [[Clair Bidez]], [[Lacy Schnoor]], [[Hannah Teter]], and [[Lindsey Vonn]]. They were joined by tennis player [[Ana Ivanovic]]. Criticism of Ivanovic's appearance in the magazine shortly surfaced, as the Serb was suffering a decline in form and confidence and subsequently dropped out of the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]]'s Top 50 a month after appearing in the magazine. However, since November 2010, Ivanovic has re-entered the World's Top 20 and regained her old form and confidence.

Australian hurdler [[Michelle Jenneke]] appeared in the 2013 issue after having gained notoriety for her warm-up dance routine, which went viral on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/sport/story/2013-02-13/michelle-jenneke-dance-video-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-si-2013|title=Michelle Jenneke's viral dance paves the way for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue|date=February 13, 2013|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}</ref>

Danish tennis player [[Caroline Wozniacki]] appeared in the 2015 issue. She is an active player, formerly world number one, and was photographed at [[Captiva Island]] in the Gulf of Mexico by Walter Iooss, Jr.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/09/caroline-wozniackis-latest-success-si-swimsuit-model/|title=Caroline Wozniacki's latest success: SI Swimsuit model|last=DeMarzo|first=John|date=February 9, 2015|work=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}</ref>

Top ranked Canadian tennis player [[Eugenie Bouchard]] appeared for the first time in the 2017 issue. She is an active player who has achieved a top five rank in tennis in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/02/16/eugenie-bouchard-sports-illustrated-swimsuit_n_14797248.html|title=Eugenie Bouchard Makes Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition Debut|date=February 16, 2017|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}</ref>

==Reception==
To some people, the magazine is an acceptable exhibition of female sexuality not out of place on a [[coffee table book|coffee table]].<ref name=Slate/> The swimsuit edition is controversial both with moralists who subscribe for sports news content as well as with those who feel that the focus on fashion and swimsuit modeling is inappropriate for a sports magazine. Feminists have expressed that "the Swimsuit Issue promotes the harmful and dehumanizing concept that women are a product for male consumption".<ref name='now_si'>''[http://www.now.org/issues/media/roundup/20020222.html Feminist Media Round-Up: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719181507/http://www.now.org/issues/media/roundup/20020222.html |date=July 19, 2008 }}.'' Lisa Bennett, Communications Director, [[National Organization for Women]]. February 22, 2002.</ref>

At times, subscriptions have been cancelled by subscribers. The 1978 edition, remembered for its fishnet bathing suit made famous by [[Cheryl Tiegs]], resulted in 340 cancellations.<ref name=Slate/> ''Sports Illustrated'' makes the controversy a form of entertainment with the issue two weeks after the swimsuit edition packed with complainants such as shocked parents and troubled librarians.<ref name=Slate/> As of 2005, the number of cancellations has reportedly declined.<ref name=Slate/> Nonetheless, to avoid controversy, ''Sports Illustrated'' has, since 2007, offered its subscribers the option of skipping the swimsuit edition for a one issue credit to extend their subscription.<ref name=TSWSbtMWI>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/business/media/12mag.html |title=The Swimsuits Were Skimpy, but the Magazine Was Invisible |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Aspan, Maria|date=March 12, 2007}}</ref>

In 2019, the issue has leaned towards [[Diversity index|diversity]] and [[Inclusivism|inclusivity]] with models representing different body types.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/business-news/media/is-the-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-tyra-banks-alex-morganstill-relevant-1203125840/|title=Is the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Still Relevant?|last1=Hays|first1=Kali|last2=Hays|first2=Kali|date=May 8, 2019|website=WWD|language=en|access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> It has also tackled [[ageism]], [[body image]] and the [[Me Too movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/swim-daily/2019/03/25/paulina-porizkova-battles-ageism-si-swimsuit-issue|title=Paulina Porizkova on ageism and the SI Swimsuit issue|website=SI.com|language=en|access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/sports-illustrated-swimsuit-issue-goes-metoo-not-everyone-happy-n847566|title=Sports Illustrated Swimsuit goes #MeToo.
