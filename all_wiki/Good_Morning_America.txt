'''''Good Morning America''''' ('''''GMA''''') is an American [[breakfast television|morning television]] program that is broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It debuted on November 3, 1975, and first expanded to weekends with the debut of a Sunday edition on January 3, 1993. The Sunday edition was canceled in 1999; weekend editions returned on both Saturdays and Sundays on September 4, 2004. The weekday program airs from 7:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. in all [[time in the United States]] (live in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and on [[broadcast delay]] elsewhere across the country). The Saturday and Sunday editions are an hour long and are transmitted to ABC's stations live at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time, although stations in some [[media market]] air them at different times. Viewers in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] receive an updated feed with a specialized opening and updated live reports. A third hour of the weekday broadcast aired from 2007 to 2008, exclusively on [[ABC News Now]].

The program features news, interviews, weather forecasts, special-interest stories, and feature segments such as "Pop News" (featuring [[popular culture]] and entertainment news, and [[viral video]]), the "GMA Heat Index" (featuring a mix of entertainment, lifestyle and human-interest stories) and "Play of the Day" (featuring a selected viral video or television program clip). It is produced by [[ABC News]] and broadcasts from the [[Times Square Studios]] in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district. The primary anchors are [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]], [[George Stephanopoulos]] and former [[New York Giants]] defensive end [[Michael Strahan]] with breaking news anchor [[Amy Robach]],<ref name = "AR" /> entertainment anchor [[Lara Spencer]] and weather anchor [[Ginger Zee]].<ref>[http://abc.go.com/good-morning-america/episode-guide/2019-01 Good Morning America – ABC.com]{{Dead link|date=August 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

''Good Morning America'' won the first three [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Morning Program", sharing the inaugural 2007 award with ''Today'' and winning the 2008 and 2009 awards outright.

==History==
===1975: The inaugural year===
On January 6, 1975, ABC launched ''[[AM America]]'' in an attempt to compete with NBC's ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]''. The program was hosted by [[Bill Beutel]] and [[Stephanie Edwards (TV personality)|Stephanie Edwards]],<ref name="crobertsonnyt">{{cite news|title=Bill Beutel, 75, Dies; Longtime Anchor of 'Eyewitness News' in New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/business/media/20beut.html?ex=1300510800&en=276edb869b5c1043&ei=5088|author=Campbell Robertson|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 20, 2006}}</ref> with [[Peter Jennings]] reading the news (Jennings had been a replacement for Bob Kennedy; who had been scheduled to be the program's newsreader, but died two months before the premiere from [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]]).<ref>[https://people.com/archive/her-husbands-big-break-then-he-died-and-bev-kennedy-carries-on-vol-3-no-20/ Witt, Linda. "Her Husband's Big Break—Then He Died and Bev Kennedy Carries On," ''People'' (magazine), May 26, 1975.] Retrieved August 14, 2018</ref> Because the show could not find an audience against ''Today'' (and its anchor team of [[Jim Hartz]] and [[Barbara Walters]]), ABC sought a new approach. The network found that one of its affiliates, [[WEWS-TV|WEWS]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], had been pre-empting ''AM America'' in favor of airing a locally produced show called ''[[The Morning Exchange]]''.

Unlike ''AM America'' and ''Today'', ''The Morning Exchange'' featured an easygoing and less dramatic approach by offering news and weather updates only at the [[wikt:top of the hour|top and bottom of every hour]] and used the rest of the time to discuss general-interest/entertainment topics. ''The Morning Exchange'' also established a group of regular guests who were experts in certain fields, including health, entertainment, consumer affairs and travel. Also unlike both the NBC and ABC shows, ''The Morning Exchange'' was not broadcast from a newsroom set but instead one that resembled a [[suburb|suburban]] [[living room]].

In the process of screening the Cleveland morning program as a creative source, ABC also began looking at another local show, ''[[Good Day! (TV program)|Good Morning!]]'', which was produced by [[Boston]] ABC affiliate [[WCVB-TV]]. ''Good Morning!'' was very similar in format to ''The Morning Exchange'', but with a lesser emphasis on news and weather. In fact, once the revamped ABC morning show took to the air late in 1975 under the title ''Good Morning America'', WCVB station manager Bob Bennett accused ABC entertainment president [[Fred Silverman]] of deliberately stealing the title of ''Good Morning!''; no legal [[cease and desist]] action was finalized against ABC in the matter, however. The launch of ''Good Morning America'' did result in the Boston morning show changing its name—to ''Good Day!''. Currently, WCVB's morning news program is titled ''EyeOpener''.

ABC took an episode of ''The Morning Exchange'' and used it as a [[television pilot]]. The format replaced ''AM America'' on Monday, {{nowrap|November 3,}}<!-- 1975--> as ''Good Morning America''. The first cohosts<!-- of the new program--> were actor [[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]]<ref name=amatgmabb>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OW5YAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3fcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5830%2C2656289 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon)|agency=Associated Press |title=ABC to replace 'AM America' with new show |date=October 18, 1975 |page=6, ''Entertainment Week''}}</ref> and actress [[Nancy Dussault]]. <ref name=nnsastl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_nkzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4241%2C1086083 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=''(New York Times)'' |last=O'Connor |first=John J. |title=New 'news' show a silly total loss |date=November 4, 1975 |page=7C}}</ref> Dussault was replaced in April 1977 by {{nowrap|[[Sandy Hill (television personality)|Sandy Hill]],}} previously at [[KABC-TV]] {{nowrap|in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=evnws77>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R1gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FW4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=4137%2C1501739 |work=The Evening News |location=(Newburgh, New York) |title=ABC's choice of Sandy Hill for morning show aimed at news |agency=Associated Press |last=Sharbutt |first=Jay |date=April 8, 1977 |page=8A}}</ref>}}  The show's title is the same as the beginning of the chorus of [[Steve Goodman]]'s song ''City of New Orleans''.

For the first seven years, weather forecasts were presented by [[John Coleman (meteorologist)|John Coleman]], former chief meteorologist for ABC [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago]], who left ''GMA'' in 1982 to start [[The Weather Channel]] with [[Landmark Media Enterprises|Landmark Communications]] CEO [[Frank Batten]]. Dave Murray (now chief meteorologist at [[KTVI]] in [[St. Louis]]) provided the forecasts for both ''Good Morning America'' and ABC's early morning news program ''[[America This Morning|ABC News This Morning]]'' from 1983 to 1986. In August 1986, he was replaced by [[Spencer Christian]], who worked at [[WABC-TV]] in [[New York City]] and served as fill-in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===1976–89: Growth and change===
The program's [[Nielsen ratings]] climbed slowly, but steadily throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s while ''Today'' experienced a slight slump in viewership, especially with Walters' decision to leave NBC for a job at [[ABC News]]. On August 30, 1976, [[Tom Brokaw]] began anchoring ''Today'' while the program began a search for a female co-host. Within a year, ''Today'' managed to beat back the ''Good Morning America'' ratings threat with Brokaw and new co-host [[Jane Pauley]], featuring art and entertainment contributor [[Gene Shalit]]. ''Good Morning America'' continued to threaten ''Today''{{'}}s ratings dominance into the 1980s, especially after Brokaw left the latter program to become co-anchor of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' with [[Roger Mudd]] for 17 months before being named sole anchor of that program. For the first time, ''Good Morning America'' became the highest-rated morning news program in the United States as ''Today'' fell to second place.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

At the outset, ''Good Morning America'' was a talk program with a main host, Hartman, who was joined by a sidekick co-host; Dussault and Hill were scripted as less-than-equal hosts. In 1980, an exasperated Hill left ''Good Morning America'' after run-ins with Hartman, who was said to have "had a problem with strong women." <ref name="people.com">{{Cite web|title = David Hartman's Silent Partner No More, Joan Lunden Wins New Status on Good Morning America : People.com|url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20094320,00.html|website = www.people.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}</ref> She was replaced by [[Joan Lunden]], then a reporter at ABC's New York City [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] [[WABC-TV]]. Hartman and Lunden led the show through several years of success. Lunden's popularity led to her promotion to co-anchor in 1986, and to more equal footing with Hartman than any woman before her.<ref name="people.com"/> The partnership ended on February 20, 1987, when Hartman retired after 3,189 broadcasts.

After Hartman's departure, Lunden was paired with ABC News correspondent [[Charles Gibson]] on February 23, 1987, which ultimately resulted in ratings for the program skyrocketing. The team of Lunden and Gibson became the most popular news partnership on television in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for the first time ''Good Morning America'' regularly won the ratings against ''Today''. At one point prior to Spencer Christian's arrival in 1986, forecasts on the program were provided by [[WXYZ-TV]] chief meteorologist [[Jerry Hodak]] via a split screen between the WXYZ studios in [[Detroit]] and the ''Good Morning America'' set in New York City.

===1990–98: Rise and decline===
''Good Morning America'' entered the 1990s with continued overwhelming ratings success. Gibson and Lunden became a hard team to beat; however, the program stumbled from its top spot in late 1995, falling to second place behind ''Today'' (in what would begin a 16-year streak as the top-rated morning news program for that show, which began the week of December 11, 1995<ref>{{cite news|title=NBC's 'Today' show streak hits 15 years|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/tv/ci_16849638?source=rss&nclick_check=1|author=David Bauder|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=December 19, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref>). Lunden began to discuss working less and mentioned to network executives that the morning schedule is the hardest in the business. ABC executives promised Lunden that a [[prime time]] program; ''[[Behind Closed Doors (1996 TV series)|Behind Closed Doors]]'' would premiere on the network in 1996.

On September 5, 1997, Lunden decided to step down as host of ''Good Morning America'' after 17 years and was replaced by ABC News correspondent [[Lisa McRee]]. The pairing of Gibson and McRee fared well in the ratings. However, ratings sharply declined when Gibson also left the show to make way for [[Kevin Newman (journalist)|Kevin Newman]] on May 1, 1998. With McRee and Newman as anchors, longtime viewers of ''Good Morning America'' switched to ''Today'', whose ratings skyrocketed.

===January 1999 – May 2005: Gibson–Sawyer===
To improve ''Good Morning America''{{'}}s ratings performance, which briefly fell to third place among the morning shows in January 1999, ABC News management selected Shelley Ross from the field of [[executive producer]] candidates. As part of Rossʼs proposed changes, Ross ousted the McRee-Newman team and lobbied to bring in [[Diane Sawyer]] and team her with Charles Gibson, who had been reluctant to return. On January 18, 1999, the Gibson-Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on-air, which during the first full season resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network news franchises saw losses.

[[File:Times_Square_Studios_-_GMA_(48105884053).jpg|thumb|175px|right|Current Home of GMA – [[Times Square Studios]] (2019)]]
The show moved from the ABC News headquarters in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lincoln Square, Manhattan|Lincoln Square]] district to its present home at the Times Square Studios on September 13, 1999. The new location made it possible for the program to feature a live audience inside the studio, similar to the "Window on the World" set used by ''Today''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Under Ross, ''Good Morning America'' became a competitive 24/7 news operation with more exclusive bookings, news and live [[stock market]] updates for West Coast viewers and new on-screen graphics that included a [[news ticker]]. ''Good Morning America'' began originating entire shows from unique locations, which, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]], resulted in more people watching the program and for longer periods of time. ''GMA'' became the first to originate a live show from an [[aircraft carrier]] during wartime (the [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS Enterprise]]), from [[White House]] (after the [[Columbine High School massacre]]), from [[The Pentagon]] (for the reopening of the wing damaged during the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001), from [[Vatican City|The Vatican]] (for the 25th anniversary of [[Pope John Paul II]]'s election as Pope), and from the [[Tower of London]] (on the 50th anniversary of [[Elizabeth II]]ʼs accession to the throne). Viewership during this time increased by nearly 1 million households, and revenue soared.

Although ''Today'' remained the top-rated morning news show, the Sawyer, Gibson and Ross team inched close, creating a viable rival. According to Linda McLoof, executive director of news research at ABC News from 2001 to 2009, "When Shelley left, her viewing momentum was initially sustained, but a season later, the audience began to decline. It is like passing the baton in a relay race." [[Antonio Mora]] served as newsreader for the program until March 18, 2002, when he left to become an anchor at [[CBS]] owned-and-operated station [[WBBM-TV]] in Chicago. He was replaced by former [[ESPN]] anchor and correspondent [[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]].

===May 2005 – June 2006: Gibson–Sawyer–Roberts===
On May 23, 2005, ABC News announced that Robin Roberts would be promoted from newsreader to co-anchor of ''Good Morning America'', joining Gibson and Sawyer. Roberts had previously served as a regular substitute for Gibson and Sawyer when either of them were on vacation or on assignment. On November 3, 2005, ''Good Morning America'' celebrated its 30th anniversary with retrospectives on and clips from the show's history and by decorating [[Times Square]]. Former co-hosts Hartman and Lunden, along with former meteorologist [[Spencer Christian]], were among the guests of honor. Hartman signed off the show that day with his trademark close: "From all of us, make it a good day." That same day, ''Good Morning America'' became the first network morning news program to begin broadcasting in [[high-definition television]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On December 2, 2005, weather anchor [[Tony Perkins (news anchor)|Tony Perkins]] left the program after six years. The last ten minutes of that day's edition were dedicated to Perkins, during which he gave thanks to one of the show's producers and a heartfelt goodbye to anchors Gibson, Roberts and Sawyer. Perkins left the program to return to his family in [[Washington, D.C.]] and join [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WTTG]], where he previously served as a weather anchor. He affectionately said to his young son on-air, "Connor, if you're watching, daddy's comin' home." Perkins was replaced by [[Mike Barz]], former [[WGN Morning News]] sports anchor at [[WGN-TV]] in Chicago.

Gibson left ''Good Morning America'' for the second time on June 28, 2006. That day's edition was dedicated to his 19 years as anchor of the program and celebrated his new role as anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''. Gibson ended his tenure at ''GMA'' by stating, "For nineteen years, my mornings have been not just good—they've been great."<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie's Goodbye – An Emotional Tribute to Friends and Co-Workers|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2128555&page=1|author=[[Charles Gibson]]|work=[[ABC News]]|date=June 28, 2006|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref>

===June 2006 – December 2009: Sawyer–Roberts===
There had been speculation that Sawyer would leave ''Good Morning America'' when her contract expired in 2007 to assume the anchor position at ''ABC World News'' that was given to Gibson. In August 2006, [[Chris Cuomo]] was named news anchor while continuing his anchoring duties on the newsmagazine ''[[Primetime (American TV program)|Primetime]]'' and serving as ABC News's senior legal correspondent. Meanwhile, [[Sam Champion]], longtime evening meteorologist at WABC-TV, was named as the new weather anchor for the program and as weather editor for ABC News. Both Cuomo and Champion began their respective duties on the program on September 5, 2006, when ''Good Morning America'' instituted a new graphics package and new news area for Cuomo to report headlines. The following week, on September 13, 2006, the program introduced a new [[logo]]—this time with gold Avant Garde font on a blue background, which bears a resemblance to the original ''Good Morning America'' logo that was used up to early 1987.

On June 29, 2007, the program's longtime film critic [[Joel Siegel]] died of complications from [[colorectal cancer]] at age 63. The July 9 edition of ''GMA'' was dedicated to Siegel, with former hosts Hartman, Hill, Lunden, Newman, Christian, Perkins and Gibson all appearing to share their memories. One month later, on July 31, 2007, Robin Roberts announced that she had been diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] after discovering a lump in her breast during a self-examination while preparing the Siegel tribute episode. Roberts remained as anchor while undergoing [[chemotherapy]] and completed radiation treatments on March 28, 2008.

On October 22, 2007, ''Good Morning America'' introduced a new on-air graphics package. Using much of the design features of its former graphics, it went from a basic blue background to a more orangish-gold setting. The program's opening changed from the camera's zooming in on the hosts while introducing the host to an opening with new music (by the New York City-based music production company DreamArtists Studios) and a background with the ''Good Morning America'' logo descending onto the frame. It also changed its news ticker and time-and-temperature bug for the first time in years. The ticker featured an orange background with a modified ABC News logo as a breakpoint for each headline. The bug still featured the time and current local temperature to the left, but with an orange backdrop with an alternate "GMA" logo and the ABCNews.com logo to the right.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

On January 15, 2008, during an interview with Diane Sawyer on the program, actress [[Diane Keaton]] commented on Sawyer's physical attractiveness, stating that if she had lips like Sawyer's, "then I wouldn't have worked on my ''[expletive]'' personality!" Keaton quickly apologized for the remark and Sawyer jokingly threatened to have her mother "work on your personality with soap in your mouth." Officials with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] declined to take action for the fleeting expletive.<ref>{{cite news|title=Diane Keaton Swears on TV, FCC Stammers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1656552120080116|author=Brooks Boliek|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 16, 2008|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref> Following the death of [[Michael Jackson]], Charles Gibson returned to the ''Good Morning America'' anchor desk with Roberts on June 26, 2009, while Sawyer was away.

In September 2008, ''Good Morning America''{{'}}s anchors rode an [[Amtrak]] [[train]] to tour the United States as part of ABC News{{'}}s "50 States in 50 Days" event, for which the program was broadcast from different locations around the U.S. each day throughout that month. The tour's first telecast stop was in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]].

===December 2009 – April 2014: Roberts–Stephanopoulos===
On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that Sawyer would replace Gibson as anchor of ''ABC World News'' at the end of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC News: Gibson Retiring, Sawyer Will Be Anchor |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090902/ap_on_en_tv/us_abc_gibson |work=[[Yahoo!

Representatives for ABC News stated that it wanted to return the show to the original male-female anchor format. On December 10, 2009, Stephanopoulos was announced as Sawyer's replacement, with [[Juju Chang]] replacing Cuomo as newsreader; the changes took effect four days later on December 14.<ref>[[Staff writer]] (December 10, 2009).</ref>

In April 2010, the anchor desk in the studio was relocated back in front of the window overlooking Times Square, where it had been when ''Good Morning America'' moved to the Times Square Studios facility in 1999; the news desk was also moved in front of a window. On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new "light blue and sunny" graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios. An entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the monitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00&nbsp;a.m. hour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in the same place. This was the first major set change since the show upgraded to high definition in November 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Appoints Chris Cuomo To Be ''GMA'' Host|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iFPa2l_TasErMgcNhMfDS7aK7sBwD9CGMBQ00|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Google News]]|accessdate=December 14, 2009}}</ref>

In the summer of 2011, ''Good Morning America'' decided to vacate the second floor of the Times Square studios, which overlooked Times Square, due to cost issues. On September 6, 2011, the program began broadcasting from an entirely new studio set located on the first floor (ground level) of the Times Square studios. The main "window" behind the presenters in the new set, which also shows a view overlooking Times Square from an above-ground level, is actually a back-projection, although there are several real windows used in other parts of the set.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Director, Upgrades to Times Square Studio for 'Good Morning America'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-director-upgrades-to-times-square-studio-for-good-morning-america_b81905|author=Chris Ariens|work=TVNewser|publisher=Mediabistro.com|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Musical chairs at 'Good Morning America'|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/blog/2011/09/06/musical-chairs-at-good-morning-america/|publisher=NewscastStudio|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

Amid declining ratings at ''Today'' in the aftermath of reports of [[Matt Lauer]]'s alleged role in [[Ann Curry]]'s departure as co-host (though ratings had been in a steady decline for that program during Curry's co-hosting tenure), viewership for ''Good Morning America'' increased starting in 2012. The program beat ''Today'' for the first time in 16 years during the week of April 9, 2012, ending that program's streak of 852 consecutive weeks as the most-watched network morning news program, by a margin of 31,000 more viewers than the NBC program.<ref>{{cite web|title='GMA' Weeklong Win Over 'Today' Confirmed; First Win in 16 Years|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/emailstory/sns-rt-gma-good-morning-americamt1thewrap37130-20120419,0,3523646.story|work=[[The Wrap]]|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420063850/http://www.chicagotribune.com/emailstory/sns-rt-gma-good-morning-americamt1thewrap37130-20120419,0,3523646.story|archive-date=April 20, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''Good Morning America'' beat ''Today'' once again during the week of April 16, 2012, by a much larger margin of 166,000 viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title='GMA' is #1 for Week of April 23rd by 166,000 Total Viewers–Takes 2 of Last 3 Weeks|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/30/gma-is-1-for-week-of-april-23rd-by-166000-total-viewers-takes-2-of-last-3-weeks/131506|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507131532/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/30/gma-is-1-for-week-of-april-23rd-by-166000-total-viewers-takes-2-of-last-3-weeks/131506/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 7, 2012|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|publisher=[[Zap2It]]/[[Tribune Media]]|date=April 30, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

During the week of April 1, 2012, ABC News special correspondent [[Katie Couric]], who had recently joined the network as part of a deal to host a [[Katie (talk show)|syndicated talk show]] distributed by corporate sister [[Disney–ABC Domestic Television]], filled for Robin Roberts on ''Good Morning America''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Katie Couric Makes 'Good Morning America' Guest-Hosting Debut, Visits 'Dancing With the Stars' Set (Video)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/katie-couric-good-morning-america-abc-dancing-with-the-stars-306824|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 2, 2012}}</ref> Couric had hosted the rival NBC morning program ''Today'' from 1991 to 2006; her ''Good Morning America'' stint marked her return to morning news after six years.

On August 30, 2012, Roberts went on medical leave after undergoing a [[bone marrow]] transplant (donated by her sister and fellow news anchor SallyAnn Roberts) following her diagnosis with [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Good Morning America's' Robin Roberts to take medical leave for bone marrow transplant|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/07/27/good-morning-america-robin-roberts-to-take-medical-leave-for-bone-marrow/|work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 27, 2012}}</ref> ''GMA'' correspondent [[Amy Robach]] and ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]'' anchor [[Elizabeth Vargas]] served as the primary substitutes, typically alternating every other week. Others, including some celebrities, also served as special guest anchors during this time such as [[Kelly Ripa]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]]. On January 14, 2013, Roberts announced that she hoped to return to the program sometime that February; Roberts performed dry run rehearsals during the week of January 21 in preparation for her return; she and her doctors evaluated her body's reaction to the makeup, the lighting, her hair, and the number of people she comes in contact with to avoid compromising her then-gradually-improving health.

On March 30, 2014, news anchor Josh Elliott left ABC News after three years as news anchor of ''GMA'' to become a correspondent for [[NBC Sports]], amid reports that contract negotiations to increase his annual salary (from $1.2 million to $8 million) broke down; Elliott was replaced as news anchor by [[Amy Robach]] later that week.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC's Josh Elliott leaving 'Good Morning America' for NBC Sports|url=https://money.cnn.com/2014/03/30/news/josh-elliott-abc-nbc/index.html?iid=HP_LN|work=CNNMoney.com|date=March 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Good Morning America' shake-up: Amy Robach succeeds Josh Elliott|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/30/good-morning-america-shake-up-amy-robach-replaces-josh-elliott|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 30, 2014}}</ref> The program continued to dominate over the competition, even with the loss of two major co-hosts in Champion and Elliott.

In early April 2014, several media reports speculated that [[Michael Strahan]] would be joining ''GMA'' as a contributing anchor, while maintaining his co-host duties on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'' (which is also syndicated by Disney–ABC Domestic Television). Strahan's new position was confirmed on April 15, 2014, when he was introduced to the audience as the new contributing anchor on the program.

===April 2014 – September 2016: Roberts–Stephanopoulos–Spencer===
On April 18, 2014, Lara Spencer was promoted to co-anchor effective immediately, receiving top billing on the program alongside Roberts and Stephanopoulos.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lara Spencer Named Co-Host of 'Good Morning America' | url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/lara-spencer-named-co-host-of-good-morning-america_b222039 | first=Jordan | last=Charlton | work=[[AdWeek|TVNewser]] | date=April 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 5, 2014}}</ref>

On November 19, 2015, the program celebrated its 40th anniversary, with all the main anchors and most of the news and weather anchors returning to join the celebration and share their stories. Clips from all 40 years were shown.

On April 19, 2016, Strahan announced that he would be leaving ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live! with Kelly and Michael]]'' to join ''Good Morning America'' full-time.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/michael-strahan-joins-good-morning-america-full-time/story?id=38509323 | title=Michael Strahan Joins 'Good Morning America' Full-Time, Leaving 'Live' | first=Michael | last=Rothman | date=April 19, 2016 | publisher=ABC News | accessdate=April 20, 2016}}</ref>

===September 2016–present: Roberts–Stephanopoulos–Strahan===
On September 6, 2016, [[Michael Strahan]] began his run as official full-time co-anchor of the program along with Roberts, Stephanopoulos, and Spencer.  A new title sequence was debuted not including Spencer's name. The first hour focuses on the news of the morning anchored by Roberts, Stephanopulos, and Strahan. Zee does segments of the weather and Robach reads the morning headlines. The second hour is in the second floor studio and is taped in front of a live studio audience. It focuses on "soft news" and entertainment. It is anchored by the three main co-anchors (including Spencer) and features guests and talk show panel discussion.

In April 2018, it was announced that Spencer would cut back on her hours on ''GMA'' from five days a week to three to focus on her own projects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/lara-spencer-good-morning-america-1202754768/|title=Lara Spencer Pares Back Duties at ‘Good Morning America’|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2018-04-16|work=Variety|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref>

''Good Night America'' was a late night talk show / news magazine hosted by [[Geraldo Rivera]] in the 1970s as part of ABC's late night line up also ABC's "Wide World Special".

After ''Good Night America'' went off the air, Rivera still worked for ABC eventually working for ''Good Morning America'' when it premiered in November 1975, while still working for ABC News and its other shows such as ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[20/20 (American TV program)|20/20]]''.

The first weekend edition of ''Good Morning America'' premiered on January 3, 1993, airing only on Sundays; it was hosted at various points by [[Willow Bay]], [[Aaron Brown (journalist)|Aaron Brown]], [[John Hockenberry]], [[Dana King]], [[Lisa McRee]], [[Antonio Mora]], [[Kevin Newman (journalist)|Kevin Newman]] and [[Bill Ritter (news anchor)|Bill Ritter]]. The program was cancelled on February 28, 1999.

In August 2010, Bill Weir left the weekend edition to become co-anchor of ''[[Nightline]]''; Marysol Castro left the show the following month. While [[Dan Harris (journalist)|Dan Harris]] officially took over as Weir's replacement that October, meteorologists from various ABC affiliates across the country filled in to provide the national weather segments for over a year after Castro's departure; eventually in November 2011, Ginger Zee, who previously served as a meteorologist at NBC O&O [[WMAQ-TV]] in Chicago, was appointed as weather anchor for the weekend editions.<ref>{{cite web |title=ABC News Hires Two Anchors from NBC Station in Chicago|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/abc-news-hires-two-anchors-from-nbc-station-in-chicago_b94904

Most weeks, the ''GMA Weekend'' shows originate from the main ABC News set at the ABC Television Center in Manhattan's [[Lincoln Square, Manhattan|Lincoln Square]] neighborhood rather than Times Square Studios; the set's large rear-projection screen is used to project the Times Square background seen in the background of the weekday ''GMA'' to provide continuity.  Previously the weekend edition of "GMA" was also aired from the Times Square Studio but was moved to the ABC News set to cut costs.

On September 10, 2016, Sara Haines left the program as lifestyle anchor to take a full-time position as co-host of ABC's ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'' and was later replaced by Adrienne Bankert.

In July 2018, Paula Faris announced that she was leaving the program, as well as ''The View'', to accept a new role within ABC News.

In September 2018, Ron Claiborne left the program after being there since its inception in 2004 and ABC News after 32 years.

As of October 5, 2019, the Saturday edition of ''GMA'' will expand to two hours and meet the runtimes of ''Weekend Today'' and ''CBS This Morning Saturday'', with around 100 affiliates to carry the full program in some form (either all two hours at once, or a split) by the end of the year. The expansion comes as the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s reforms of [[Regulations on children's television programming in the United States#2019 changes|regulations of children's television programming]] will allow stations to carry ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'' in the 6 a.m. local timeslot, opening up the time period once the college football season ends.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/good-morning-america-saturday-abc-news-1203351986/|title=ABC Will Expand ‘Good Morning America’ on Saturday|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=27 September 2019|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>

==International broadcasts==
In Australia, [[Nine Network]] broadcast ''Good Morning America'' on its stations in metropolitan areas, Northern NSW and regional affiliate [[Nine (Southern Cross Austereo)|Nine]] on a one-day delay (by way of Australia and the United States being on different ends of the [[International Date Line]]) each Tuesday through Friday from 3.30 to 5:00, Saturdays from 5.30 to 7:00, Sundays from 6:00 to 7:00 and Monday mornings from 4:00 to 5:00&nbsp;a.m. The Nine broadcasts feature a map providing forecasts for Australia in place of the national U.S. weather map (which itself is also, in a separate feature within the main weather segment, used as a cutaway to weather updates provided by local ABC affiliates). However, as of 3 July 2018, Nine no longer airs the show. Although it aired at the same time as [[Seven Network]] and [[Network 10]]'s broadcasts of NBC's ''Today'' and ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', ''Good Morning America''{{'}}s broadcasts by Nine were unchallenged ratings-wise in some regions where other affiliates preempt their networks' U.S. breakfast programs with paid and religious programming.

[[OSN]] airs ''Good Morning America'' on '''OSN First HD''' live each weekday at 5:00 [[Time in the United Arab Emirates]] / 4:00 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] Countries.<ref>http://www.osn.com/en/find-watch/osn-schedules.aspx</ref>

==Accolades==
In 1992 and 1993, ''Good Morning America'' won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Talk/Service Show. In [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]], the program was nominated for a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for "Outstanding TV Journalism Segment" for the segment "Total Transformation: Why [[Chaz Bono]] Decided to Change".<ref>{{cite web|title=21st Annual GLAAD Media Awards – English Language Nominees|publisher=[[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]]|year=2010|url=http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees|accessdate=February 21, 2010|archive-date=January 22, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vv4xyV9H?url=http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/21/nominees|url-status=live}}</ref>
