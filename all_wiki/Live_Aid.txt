'''Live Aid''' was a [[benefit concert]] held on Saturday 13 July 1985, as well as an ongoing music-based fundraising initiative. The original event was organised by [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Midge Ure]] to raise funds for relief of the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian famine]]. Billed as the "global jukebox", the event was held simultaneously at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in London, UK, attended by about 72,000 people, and [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], US, attended by 89,484 people.<ref>[http://www.bobgeldof.info/Charity/liveaid.html Live Aid on Bob Geldof's official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205101201/http://www.bobgeldof.info/Charity/liveaid.html |date=5 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CMEAAAAMBAJ&q=top+concert+grosses+&pg=PT2 |title=Billboard Boxscore |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=27 July 1985|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref>

On the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative were held in other countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]], Canada, Japan, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], Austria, [[Oz for Africa|Australia]] and West Germany. It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time; an estimated audience of 1.9&nbsp;billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast,<ref name="CNN"/> nearly 40% of the world population at the time.<ref>[https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ World Population Prospects: The 2017 Revision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919061238/https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ |date=19 September 2016 }}.

The impact of Live Aid on famine relief has been debated for years. One aid relief worker stated that following the publicity generated by the concert, "humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy" for western governments.<ref name="Guardian"/> Geldof has said, "We took an issue that was nowhere on the political agenda and, through the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the planet – which is not English but rock 'n' roll – we were able to address the intellectual absurdity and the moral repulsion of people dying of want in a world of surplus."<ref>{{cite news |title=Live Aid index: Bob Geldof |url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/pictures/0,,1328579,00.html |accessdate=14 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> In another interview he stated that Live Aid "created something permanent and self-sustaining", but also asked why Africa is getting poorer.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |title=Cruel to be kind? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/24/g8.debtrelief |accessdate=31 March 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> The organisers of Live Aid tried, without much success, to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to [[NGOs]] in Ethiopia.

== Background ==

The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" which was also the brainchild of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|people starving to death in Ethiopia]] were shown in the UK in [[Michael Buerk]]'s [[BBC News]] reports on the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|1984 famine]].<ref name="BBCLiveAid">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/702700.stm "Live Aid: The show that rocked the world"]. BBC. Retrieved 15 September 2011</ref> The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as "a biblical famine in the 20th century" and "the closest thing to hell on Earth".<ref>{{cite news|title=Higgins marvels at change in Ethiopia's Tigray province|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/higgins-marvels-at-change-in-ethiopia-s-tigray-province-1.1992467|newspaper=The Irish Times |date=7 January 2018}}</ref> The reports featured a young nurse, [[Claire Bertschinger]], who, surrounded by 85,000 starving people, told of her sorrow of having to decide which children would be allowed access to the limited food supplies in the feeding station and which were too sick to be saved.<ref name="Bertschinger">{{cite news |title=The nurse who inspired Live Aid |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4640255.stm |accessdate=28 September 2020 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> She would put a little mark on the children who got chosen, with Geldof stating of her at the time, "In her was vested the power of life and death. She had become God-like and that is unbearable for anyone."<ref name="Bertschinger"/> Traumatised by what she experienced she didn’t speak about it for two decades, recalling in 2005, "I felt like a Nazi sending people to the death camps. Why was I in this situation? Why was it possible in this time of plenty that some have food and some do not? It is not right".<ref name="Bertschinger"/>

Shocked by the report, the British public inundated relief agencies, such as [[Save the Children]], with donations, with the report also bringing the world's attention to the crisis in Ethiopia.<ref name="BBCLiveAid"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Live Aid: Against All Odds: Episode 1|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078x3n|publisher=BBC|date=7 January 2018}}</ref> Such was the magnitude of Buerk's report it was also broadcast on a major US news channel—almost unheard of at the time.<ref name="Buerk Report">{{cite news |title=Ethiopian famine: how landmark BBC report influenced modern coverage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/22/ethiopian-famine-report-influence-modern-coverage |accessdate=28 September 2020 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> From his home in London Geldof also saw the report, and called Ure from Ultravox (Geldof and Ure had previously worked together for charity when they appeared at the 1981 benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' in London) and together they quickly co-wrote the song, "Do They Know It's Christmas?" in the hope of raising money for famine relief.<ref name="BBCLiveAid"/> Geldof then contacted colleagues in the music industry and persuaded them to record the single under the title '[[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]' for free.<ref name="BBCLiveAid"/> On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]], London, and was released four days later.<ref name="BBC">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/r2music/documentaries/bandaid/ The 20th anniversary of Band Aid] BBC.

The idea to stage a charity concert to raise more funds for Ethiopia originally came from [[Boy George]], the lead singer of [[Culture Club]]. George and Culture Club drummer [[Jon Moss]] had taken part in the recording of "Do They Know It's Christmas?" and in the same month, the band were undertaking a tour of the UK, which culminated in six nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. On the final night at Wembley, 22 December 1984, an impromptu gathering of some of the other artists from Band Aid joined Culture Club on stage at the end of the concert for an encore of "Do They Know It's Christmas?". George was so overcome by the occasion he told Geldof that they should consider organising a benefit concert. Speaking to the UK music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' at the beginning of January 1985, Geldof revealed his enthusiasm for George's idea, saying, "If George is organising it, you can tell him he can call me at any time and I'll do it. It's a logical progression from the record, but the point is you don't just talk about it, you go ahead and do it!"<ref name="MM19850112">{{cite magazine |title=Band Aid ... On Stage |periodical=[[Melody Maker]] |location=London, England |page=3 |date=12 January 1985}}</ref>

It was clear from the interview that Geldof had already had the idea to hold a dual venue concert and how the concerts should be structured:

{{quote|The show should be as big as is humanly possible. There's no point just 5,000 fans turning up at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]; we need to have Wembley linked with [[Madison Square Garden]]s, and the whole show to be televised worldwide. It would be great for [[Duran Duran|Duran]] to play three or four numbers at Wembley, and then flick to Madison Square where [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] would be playing. While he's on, the Wembley stage could be made ready for the next British act like [[Thompson Twins|the Thompsons]] or whoever. In that way, lots of acts could be featured and the television rights, tickets and so on could raise a phenomenal amount of money. It's not an impossible idea, and certainly one worth exploiting.<ref name="MM19850112" />}}

On how Geldof got artists to agree to play, Live Aid production manager Andy Zweck states, "Bob had to play some tricks to get artists involved. He had to call Elton and say Queen are in and Bowie's in, and of course they weren't. Then he'd call Bowie and say Elton and Queen are in. It was a game of bluff."<ref name="Geldof artists"/>

[[File:Bob Geldof Rock am Ring 1987.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bob Geldof]] successfully pitched the idea of the concert to promoter [[Harvey Goldsmith]]]]
Among those involved in organising<!-- Not a typo: this article is written in British English spelling --> Live Aid were [[Harvey Goldsmith]], who was responsible for the Wembley Stadium concert, and [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who put together the American leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Geldof, Harvey Goldsmith – and the truth about Live Aid|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/neil-mccormick/8217877/Bob-Geldof-Harvey-Goldsmith-and-the-truth-about-Live-Aid.html|work=The Telegraph|date=5 May 2018}}</ref> On promoting the event, Goldsmith states, "I didn't really get a chance to say no. Bob [Geldof] arrived in my office and basically said, 'We're doing this.' It started from there."<ref name="Geldof artists">{{cite news |title=Live aid in their own words |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/oct/17/popandrock5 |accessdate=6 June 2020 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

The concert grew in scope, as more acts were added on both sides of the Atlantic. [[Tony Verna]], inventor of [[instant replay]], was able to secure [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] through his friendship with Philadelphia [[Wilson Goode|Mayor Goode]] and was able to procure, through his connections with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s prime time chief, John Hamlin, a three-hour prime time slot on the ABC Network and, in addition, was able to supplement the lengthy program through meetings that resulted in the addition of an ad-hoc network within the US, which covered 85 per cent of TVs there. Verna designed the needed satellite schematic and became the Executive Director as well as the Co-Executive Producer along with [[Hal Uplinger]]. Uplinger came up with the idea to produce a four-hour video edit of Live Aid to distribute to those countries without the necessary satellite equipment to rebroadcast the live feed.

== Collaborative effort ==
The concert began at 12:00 British Summer Time (BST) (7:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the United Kingdom. It continued at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] (JFK) in the United States, starting at 13:51 BST (8:51 EDT). The UK's Wembley performances ended at 22:00 BST (17:00 EDT). The JFK performances and whole concert in the US ended at 04:05 BST 14 July (23:05 EDT). Thus, the concert continued for just over 16 hours, but since many artists' performances were conducted simultaneously in Wembley and JFK, the total concert's length was much longer.

[[Mick Jagger]] and [[David Bowie]] intended to perform an intercontinental duet, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia. Problems of synchronisation meant the only practical solution was to have one artist, likely Bowie at Wembley, mime along to prerecorded vocals broadcast as part of the live sound mix for Jagger's performance from Philadelphia. Veteran music engineer David Richards ([[Pink Floyd]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) was brought in to create footage and sound mixes Jagger and Bowie could perform to in their respective venues. The BBC would then have had to ensure those footage and sound mixes were in sync while also performing a live vision mix of the footage from both venues. The combined footage would then have had to be bounced back by satellite to the various broadcasters around the world. Due to the time lag (the signal would take several seconds to be broadcast twice across the Atlantic Ocean), Richards concluded there was no way for Jagger to hear or see Bowie's performance, meaning there could be no interaction between the artists, essentially defeating the whole point of the exercise. On top of this, both artists objected to the idea of miming at what was perceived as a historic event. Instead, Jagger and Bowie worked with Richards to create a video clip of the song they would have performed, a cover of "[[Dancing in the Street]]", which was shown on the screens of both stadiums and broadcast as part of many TV networks' coverage.

Each of the two main parts of the concert ended with their particular continental all-star anti-hunger anthems, with [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" closing the UK concert, and [[USA for Africa]]'s "[[We Are the World]]" closing the US concert (and thus the entire event itself).<ref>[http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/liveaidtimesdetaileduk.html "Detailed list of all the artist having performed at the Live Aid concert"]. Live Aid. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref>

Concert organisers have subsequently said they were particularly keen to ensure at least one surviving member of [[the Beatles]], ideally [[Paul McCartney]], took part in the concert as they felt that having an 'elder statesman' from British music would give it greater legitimacy in the eyes of the political leaders whose opinions the performers were trying to shape. McCartney agreed to perform and has said it was "the management" – his children – who persuaded him to take part. In the event, he was the last performer (aside from the Band Aid finale) to take to the stage and one of the few to be beset by technical difficulties; his microphone failed for the first two minutes of his piano performance of "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]", making it difficult for television viewers and impossible for those in the stadium to hear him.<ref name="CNN"/> He later joked by saying he had thought about changing the lyrics to "There will be some feedback, let it be".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Beatles – Let It Be Lyrics |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/04/beatles-let-it-be-lyrics/ |accessdate=9 June 2020 |work=Spin}}</ref>

[[Phil Collins]] performed at both Wembley Stadium and JFK, travelling by helicopter (piloted by UK TV personality [[Noel Edmonds]]) to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]], then by [[Concorde]] to New York City, and by another helicopter to Philadelphia. As well as his own set at both venues, he also played the drums for [[Eric Clapton]], and played with the reuniting surviving members of [[Led Zeppelin]] at JFK. On the Concorde flight, Collins encountered actress and singer [[Cher]], who was unaware of the concerts. Upon reaching the US, she attended the Philadelphia concert and can be seen performing as part of the concert's "[[We Are the World]]" finale.<ref name="Geldof artists"/> In a 1985 interview, singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]] stated that he had considered performing at the event, but ultimately chose not to because he had difficulties getting his band together and didn't want to perform by himself.<ref>{{Citation|title=Billy Joel 1985 Interview part 2 of 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pCIrypwQIs|language=en|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>

== Broadcasts ==
Broadcaster [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] opened the Live Aid concert with the words:

{{quote|It's twelve noon in London, seven AM in Philadelphia, and around the world it's time for Live Aid.<ref>{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Aaron J. |title=Sting and The Police: Walking in Their Footsteps |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=92}}</ref>}}

The concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the [[BBC]], whose broadcast was presented by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], [[Andy Kershaw]], [[Mark Ellen]], [[David Hepworth]], [[Andy Batten-Foster]], Steve Blacknell, [[Paul Gambaccini]], [[Janice Long]] and [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ellen |first1=Mark |title=Rock Stars Stole my Life!: A Big Bad Love Affair with Music |date=2014 |publisher=Hachette UK}}</ref> The [[BBC Television|BBC's television]] sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before [[NICAM]] was introduced, but the [[BBC Radio 1]] feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers omitted the reunion of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] from their broadcast. The BBC, however, did supply a [[Backhaul (broadcasting)|'clean feed']] to various television channels in Europe.

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was largely responsible for the US broadcast (although ABC themselves only telecast the final three hours of the concert from Philadelphia, hosted by [[Dick Clark]], with the rest shown in syndication through [[Orbis Communications]], acting on behalf of ABC). An entirely separate and simultaneous US feed was provided for cable viewers by [[MTV]], whose broadcast was presented in stereo, and accessible as such for those with stereo televisions. At the time, before [[Multichannel television sound]] was enacted nationwide, very few televisions reproduced stereo signals and few television stations were able to broadcast in stereo. While the telecast was run commercial-free by the BBC, both the MTV and syndicated/ABC broadcasts included advertisements and interviews. As a result, many songs were omitted due to the commercial breaks, as these songs were played during these slots.

The biggest issue of the syndicated/ABC coverage is that the network had wanted to reserve some of the biggest acts that had played earlier in the day for certain points in the entire broadcast, particularly in the final three hours in prime time; thus, Orbis Communications had some sequences replaced by others, especially those portions of the concert that had acts from London and Philadelphia playing simultaneously. For example, while the London/Wembley finale was taking place at 22:00 (10:00&nbsp;pm) London time, syndicated viewers saw segments that had been recorded earlier, so that ABC could show the UK finale during its prime-time portion. In 1995, VH1 and [[MuchMusic]] aired a re-edited ten-hour re-broadcast of the concert for its 10th anniversary.

The Live Aid concert in London was also the first time that the BBC [[outside broadcast]] sound equipment had been used for an event of such scale. In stark contrast to the mirrored sound systems commonly used by the rock band touring engineers, with two 40–48-channel mixing consoles at the [[front of house]] and another pair for monitors, the BBC sound engineers had to use multiple 12-channel desks. Some credit this as the point where the mainstream entertainment industry realised that the rock concert industry had overtaken them in technical expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/information/internet-publishing-broadcasting/850869-1.html |title=Lessons learned since Live Aid: the challenge of bringing high quality audio to live television audiences continues to change.

While performing "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]" near the end of the Wembley show, the microphone mounted to [[Paul McCartney]]’s piano failed for the first two minutes of the song, making it difficult for television viewers and the stadium audience to hear him.<ref name="CNN"/> During this performance, the TV audience were better off, audio-wise, than the stadium audience, as the TV sound was picked up from other microphones near McCartney. The stadium audience, who could obviously not hear the electronic sound feed from these mics, unless they had portable TV sets and radios, drowned out what little sound from McCartney could be heard during this part of his performance. As a result, organiser and performer Bob Geldof, accompanied by earlier performers David Bowie, Alison Moyet and Pete Townshend returned to the stage to sing with him and back him up (as did the stadium audience despite not being able to hear much), by which time McCartney's microphone had been repaired.<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/pictures/0,,1328579,00.html Live Aid Galleries] ''The Guardian'' (London).

When [[Bob Dylan]] broke a guitar string, while playing with the Rolling Stones members [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ronnie Wood]], Wood took off his own guitar and gave it to Dylan.

== Fundraising ==
Throughout the concerts, viewers were urged to donate money to the Live Aid cause. Three hundred phone lines were manned by the BBC, so that members of the public could make donations using their credit cards. The phone number and an address that viewers could send cheques to were repeated every twenty minutes.

Nearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised so far; he was told about £1.2&nbsp;million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen which he later called "absolutely amazing", Geldof gave an interview in which BBC presenter [[David Hepworth]] had attempted to provide a postal address to which potential donations could be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted "Fuck the address, let's get the numbers". Although the phrase "give us your fucking money" has passed into folklore, Geldof has stated that it was never uttered.<ref>Geldof, Bob. ''Live Aid'' DVD.</ref> ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine made great humorous capital out of this outburst, emphasising Geldof's Irish accent which meant the profanities were heard as "fock" or "focking". After the outburst, donations increased to £300 per second.<ref>Fred Krüger (2015). "Cultures and Disasters: Understanding Cultural Framings in Disaster Risk Reduction". p. 190. Routledge</ref>

Later in the evening, following David Bowie's set, a video shot by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] was shown to the audiences in London and Philadelphia, as well as on televisions around the world (though neither US feed showed the film), showing starving and diseased Ethiopian children set to "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]" by [[The Cars]]. (This would also be shown at the London Live 8 concert in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alexis |last=Petridis |date=4 July 2005 |title=Berated by Madonna, rocked by Robbie, stunned into silence by images of famine |website=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jul/04/live8.popandrock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305112952/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/jul/04/live8.popandrock |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref>) The rate of donations became faster in the immediate aftermath of the video. Geldof had previously refused to allow the video to be shown, due to time constraints, and had only relented when Bowie offered to drop the song "[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]" from his set as a trade-off.<ref>{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Sharp |date=2014 |title=Music Express: The Rise, Fall & Resurrection of Canada's Music Magazine |publisher=[[Dundurn Press]] |isbn=978-1459721951 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CTiSAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA131}}</ref>

Geldof mentioned during the concert that the Republic of Ireland gave the most donations per capita, despite being in the midst of a serious economic recession at the time. The single largest donation came from [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], who was part of the ruling family of Dubai, who donated £1m in a phone conversation with Geldof. The next day, news reports stated that between £40 and £50&nbsp;million had been raised. It is now estimated that around £150&nbsp;million in total has been raised for famine relief as a direct result of the concerts.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
[[Bob Dylan]]'s performance generated controversy after he said: "I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it, say, to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks".<ref name="CNN"/> He is often misquoted, as on the [[Farm Aid]] website,<ref>{{cite web|title=28 Years of Amazing Concerts|url=http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|publisher=Farm Aid website|accessdate=31 August 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153719/http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|archive-date=2 November 2013}}</ref> as saying: "Wouldn't it be great if we did something for our own farmers right here in America?". In his autobiography, ''Is That It?'' (published in 1986), Geldof was critical of the remark, saying "He displayed a complete lack of understanding of the issues raised by Live Aid. ... Live Aid was about people losing their lives. There is a radical difference between losing your livelihood and losing your life. It did instigate Farm Aid, which was a good thing in itself, but it was a crass, stupid, and nationalistic thing to say."<ref>Geldof, Bob (1986) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wHLiNOvP__IC&pg=PA390&dq=He+displayed+a+complete+lack+of+understanding+of+the+issues+raised+by+Live+Aid%E2%80%A6.&hl=en&ei=NFfZTaXkMMiy8QOx_pmEBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=He%20displayed%20a%20complete%20lack%20of%20understanding%20of%20the%20issues%20raised%20by%20Live%20Aid%E2%80%A6.&f=false Is That It?] p.390.

Geldof was not happy about [[the Hooters]] being added as the opening band in Philadelphia. He felt pressured into it by Graham and local promoter Larry Magid. Magid, promoting the concert through [[Electric Factory Concerts]], argued that the band was popular in Philadelphia; their first major label album ''[[Nervous Night]]'' had been released almost three months earlier and had been a hit. In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Geldof asked: "Who the fuck are the Hooters?"<ref name="Eric Bazilian interview">{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Will |url=http://popdose.com/popdose-interview-eric-bazilian-of-the-hooters/ |title=Eric Bazilian interview |publisher=Popdose.com |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> Ironically, in December 2004, Geldof appeared on the bill with the Hooters in Germany as ''their'' opening act.<ref name="Eric Bazilian interview"/>

[[Adam Ant]] subsequently criticised the event and expressed regrets about playing it, saying, "I was asked by Sir Bob [sic] to promote this concert. They had no idea they could sell it out. Then in Bob's book he said, 'Adam was over the hill so I let him have one number.' ... Doing that show was the biggest fucking mistake in the world. [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|Knighthoods]] were made, [[Bono]] got it made, and it was a waste of fucking time. It was the end of rock 'n' roll."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://louderthanwar.com/adam-ant-brands-live-aid-a-mistake-and-a-waste-of-time-and-the-end-of-rock-n-roll/ | title= Adam Ant brands Live Aid a "mistake" and a "waste of time" and the end of 'rock n roll' | work=Louder Than War | date=26 August 2011 | accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> Geldof stated in his autobiography that [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]], manager of Adam Ant and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], asked Geldof if he'd thought of asking Ant after Geldof contacted him to get Sting to appear: "I hadn't. I thought he was a bit passé. But then so were the Boomtown Rats, and each represented a certain piece of pop history, so I agreed. I also thought that might entice him to encourage Sting, or perhaps all three of [[the Police]]."<ref>{{cite book |last=Geldof |first=Bob |date=1986 |title=Is That It? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHLiNOvP__IC&q=philadelphia&pg=PA340 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=333 |isbn=9780330442923 }}</ref>

BBC coverage co-host [[Andy Kershaw]] was heavily critical of the event in his autobiography ''No Off Switch'', stating, "Musically, Live Aid was to be entirely predictable and boring. As they were wheeled out – or rather bullied by Geldof into playing – it became clear that this was another parade of the same old rock aristocracy in a concert for Africa, organised by someone who, while advertising his concern for, and sympathy with, the continent didn't see fit to celebrate or dignify the place by including on the Live Aid bill a single African performer." Kershaw also described the event as "irritating, shallow, sanctimonious and self-satisfied" for failing to confront the fundamental causes of the famine and being "smug in its assumption that a bunch of largely lamentable rock and pop floozies was capable of making a difference, without tackling simultaneously underlying problems".<ref>{{cite book |first=Andy|last=Kershaw |title=No Off Switch |year=2014|page=192-193|publisher=Buster Press|isbn=978-0992769604}}</ref>

Page later criticised Collins' performance, saying: "Robert told me Phil Collins wanted to play with us. I told him that was all right if he knows the numbers. But at the end of the day, he didn't know anything. We played '[[Whole Lotta Love]]', and he was just there bashing away cluelessly and grinning.

=== Fund use in Ethiopia ===
In 1986 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' published an exposé on the realities of Live Aid's actions in Ethiopia. They claimed that Geldof deliberately ignored warnings from [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], who had complained directly to Geldof even before Live Aid, about the role of the Ethiopian Government under [[Derg]] leader [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] in causing the famine and that by working with Mengistu directly, much of the relief funds intended for victims were in fact siphoned off to purchase arms from the [[Soviet Union]], thereby exacerbating the situation even more. Geldof responded by deriding both the articles and Médecins Sans Frontières, who had been expelled from the country, and reportedly saying, "I'll shake hands with the Devil on my left and on my right to get to the people we are meant to help".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/featured/live-aid-the-terrible-truth-ethiopia-bob-geldof-feature/|title=Live Aid: The Terrible Truth|work=Spin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/07/live-aid-bob-geldof-response-spin-1986-feature/|title=Live Aid: Bob Geldof's Original Response to SPIN's 1986 Exposé|work=Spin}}</ref>

According to the [[BBC World Service]], a certain proportion of the funds were siphoned off to buy arms for the [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/theeditors/2010/03/ethiopia.html|title=Use of funds generated by Live Aid|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> This coalition [[Ethiopian Civil War|battled]] at the time against [[Derg]]. The Band Aid Trust complained to the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit regarding the specific allegations in the BBC World Service documentary, and their complaint was upheld.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2010/03/ethiopia.html#bottom|title=Use of funds generated by Live Aid Band Aid Complaint|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref> In 2010 the BBC issued an apology to the Trust and stated there was no evidence money had been diverted,<ref name="BBC 2010"/> while the former [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Ethiopia|British Ambassador to Ethiopia]], [[Brian Barder]], states, "the diversion of aid related only to the tiny proportion that was supplied by some NGOs to rebel-held areas."<ref name="Barder"/>

Although a professed admirer of Geldof's generosity and concern, American television commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] was critical of the Live Aid's oversight of the use of the funds raised. O'Reilly believed that charity organizations, operating in aid-receiving countries, should control donations, rather than "chaotic nations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/neighborhood/bellaire/news/article/Bill-O-Reilly-9816413.php |title=Sharing the Wealth |first=Bill|last=O'Reilly |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=14 June 2005 |accessdate=7 August 2020}}</ref> Arguing that Live Aid accomplished good ends while inadvertently causing harm at the same time, [[David Rieff]] gave a presentation of similar concerns in ''[[The Guardian]]'' at the time of [[Live 8]].<ref>{{cite news |first=David|last=Rieff |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jun/24/g8.debtrelief/ |title=Did Live Aid do more harm than good? |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 June 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Tim Russert]], in an interview on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' shortly after O'Reilly's comments, addressed these concerns to [[Bono]]. Bono responded that corruption, not disease or famine, was the greatest threat to Africa, agreeing with the belief that foreign relief organisations should decide how the money is spent. On the other hand, Bono said that it was better to spill some funds into nefarious quarters for the sake of those who needed it than to stifle aid because of possible theft.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8332675 |title=Transcript for June 26 – Meet the Press |publisher=NBC News |date=26 June 2005 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Bruce Springsteen]] decided not to appear at Live Aid despite his huge global popularity in 1985. Geldof had originally scheduled the event for the 6th of July, but moved the date to the 13th especially to accommodate Springsteen. Springsteen later expressed regret at turning down Geldof's invitation, stating that he "simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be"<ref>{{cite book |first=Dylan |last=Jones |date=6 June 2013 |title=The Eighties: One Day, One Decade |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=978-1-4090-5225-8 |page=150-151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ywvmz2h9rxIC&pg=PT150 }}</ref> and regretted not performing an acoustic set.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lucinda |last=Kent |date=13 July 2015 |title=Live Aid 30th anniversary: Seven things you may not know about Bob Geldof's charity concert |website=[[ABC Online]] |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/live-aid-30th-anniversary-seven-things-need-to-know/6615328 |access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref>

[[Michael Jackson]] declined to appear. His press agent, Norman Winter, released a statement at the time saying that Jackson was "working around the clock in the studio on a project that he's made a major commitment to," and consequently could not free up sufficient time to rehearse and perform at Live Aid. Winter added, "Michael is just about living in the studio, rehearsing and recording. I know, what could be more major than Live Aid, but Michael couldn't turn his back on his responsibility to the people he's working with. This affected employment for a lot of people."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/17/arts/michael-jackson-project-kept-him-from-concert.html|title=Michael Jackson Project Kept Him from Concert |date=17 July 1985|work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=22 September 2017}}</ref>

[[Prince (musician)|Prince]] also declined to appear in person, but sent a pre-taped video of an acoustic version of "4 the Tears in Your Eyes", which was played during the concert in Philadelphia.

[[Billy Joel]], [[Boy George]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Tears for Fears]], and [[Paul Simon]] were all included in initial promotional material for the Philadelphia concert, but did not appear.

[[Huey Lewis and the News]] were scheduled to play the Philadelphia leg, and were in some of the promotional material, but decided on 28 June to pull out over concerns that the money raised by relief efforts thus far had not been reaching those it was intended to help. "It was a very tough decision," Lewis told ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''. "We felt, having done the [[USA for Africa]] thing, that we should wait and watch that ... The prudent thing to do is to see how that money translates into food for the people before we do another one." [[Harry Belafonte]], who had organised USA for Africa, responded harshly, calling Lewis's scepticism "disruptive and divisive". He had himself recently returned from a trip to Africa to see how the money had so far been spent, and suggested that Lewis do the same. "For him to sit back here and send out information based on hearsay is unfair to his colleagues and very unfair to the victims."<ref name="Rolling Stone story">{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Michael|title=Live Aid 1985: The Day the World Rocked |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/live-aid-1985-the-day-the-world-rocked-180152/ |newspaper=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=16 August 1985|accessdate=13 July 2019}}</ref>

[[Cliff Richard]] later stated he was unable to perform as he was committed to a gospel charity concert in [[Birmingham]],<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.digitalspy.com/music/a658048/30-fun-facts-for-the-30th-birthday-of-live-aid/ | title= 30 fun facts for the 30th birthday of Live Aid | work=[[Digital Spy]] | first=Briony | last=McKee | date=13 July 2015 | accessdate=10 August 2020}}</ref> although Geldof indicated he had no recollection of having asked Richard to appear.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

[[Roland Orzabal]] of [[Tears for Fears]] remarked that Bob Geldof "gave us so much gip for not turning up at Live Aid. He made us feel very guilty; all those millions of people dying, it was all our fault. I felt terrible. I tell you, I know how Hitler must have felt."{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The group donated the proceeds from several shows of their world tour that year, and also contributed a re-recording of "[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]" (entitled "[[Everybody Wants to Run the World]]") for Geldof's [[Sport Aid]] charity event in 1986. The single reached the Top 5 in the UK, even though the band's original version had been a hit only a year earlier.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

British rock band [[Marillion]], riding high in the UK charts that summer with their ''[[Misplaced Childhood]]'' album and "[[Kayleigh]]" single, missed out on an invitation to perform at Wembley because their manager had deemed it not worthwhile for singer [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] to participate in the "Do They Know It's Christmas?" single. Fish was quoted: "When it came to the bill for the concert we were passed over."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fish-thecompany.com/email/stes5.htm |title=Early Stages sleeve notes 5 |publisher=Fish—TheCompany.Com Official Site |date=September 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref>

[[UB40]] lead singer [[Ali Campbell]] admitted that his band was also ignored by Geldof while planning the list of musical acts of the British leg of the event: "We weren't asked to do Live Aid because Uncle Bob didn't like our music much. It was a great gig, but I thought it was a bit dodgy not having any black acts on the bill when it was raising money for Africa."<ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Chalmers |title=Interview: Ali's battle for heart and soul of UB40 |publisher=The North Yorkshire News |url=http://www.northyorkshirenews.com/whats-on/music/interview-ali-s-battle-for-heart-and-soul-of-ub40-1-6617183 |date=15 May 2014 |accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>

[[Thin Lizzy]] keyboard player Darren Wharton expressed regrets about the band not being asked to perform: "That was a tragic, tragic decision. It could've been and it should've been the turning point for Phil ([[Phil Lynott|Lynott]]). And I think that really did Phil in quite a lot, that we were never asked to play. I mean Phil, he had a few problems at the time, but at the end of the day, if he would've been asked to play Live Aid, that would've been a goal for him to clean himself up to do that gig. We were all very upset of the fact that we weren't asked to do it because Phil knew Geldof and Midge Ure very well indeed. I was surprised that we weren't asked to do that. I don't think Phil ever forgave Bob."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.69facesofrock.com/thin_lizzy_interview.html|title=Thin Lizzy|first=Mark|last=Kadzielawa|publisher=69 Faces of Rock|accessdate=16 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203183350/http://69facesofrock.com/thin_lizzy_interview.html|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref> Lynott died less than five months after the concert, from complications associated with his drug and alcohol addictions.

[[Neil Peart]], drummer of Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] said: "[[Geddy Lee|Geddy]] was involved with the ''[[Tears Are Not Enough|Northern Lights]]'' charity record here in Canada, although Rush weren't invited to participate in the Live Aid event—mainly because if you look at the guest list, it was very much an 'in-crowd' situation. We were 'out' by then. We didn't refuse to take part because of any principles. Mind you, I wouldn't have been happy being part of this scenario. Those stars should have shut up and just given over their money if they were genuine. I recall that Tears for Fears, who made a musical and artistic decision to pull out of the concert, were subsequently accused by Geldof of killing children in Africa—what a shockingly irresponsible and stupid attitude to take. But I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about Bob Geldof; he sacrificed his health, his career, everything for something he believed in. But others around him got involved for their own reasons. Some of those involved in ''Northern Lights'' were actually quoted as saying that their managers told them to get down to the recording sessions because it would be a good career move!"<ref name="Metal Hammer">{{cite interview | first=Neil | last=Peart | interviewer=Malcolm Dome | title=All Fired Up | magazine=Metal Hammer | url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/interviews/neil.htm | date=25 April 1988 | accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>

"I tried to pitch into Live Aid," recalled [[Roger Waters]], "They asked me to put [[Pink Floyd]] back together for it and I said no, but I'd bring my new band to play. They didn't want that. But that's alright. I went along on my own."<ref>[[Steve Turner (writer)|Turner, Steve]]: "Roger Waters: The Wall in Berlin"; ''[[Radio Times]]'', 25 May 1990; reprinted in ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' No. 148, August 2010, p. 81</ref>

== Live Aid recordings ==
When organiser Bob Geldof was persuading artists to take part in the concert, he promised them that it would be a one-off event, never to be seen again. That was the reason why the concert was never recorded in its complete original form, and only secondary television broadcasts were recorded. Following Geldof's request, ABC erased its own broadcast tapes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Live Aid 30th anniversary: 30 things you never knew about the 1985 concert |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/live-aid-30th-anniversary-30-6058365 |accessdate=11 July 2020 |work=Daily Mirror}}</ref> However, before the syndicated/ABC footage was erased, copies of it were donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and have now been presumed lost. The ABC feed of the USA for Africa/"We Are The World" finale does exist in its entirety, complete with the network end credits, and can be found as a supplemental feature on the ''We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song'' DVD.

Meanwhile, MTV decided to keep recordings of its broadcast and eventually located more than 100 tapes of Live Aid in its archives, but many songs in these tapes were cut short by MTV's ad breaks and presenters (according to the BBC).<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3604680.stm |title=How Live Aid was saved for history |work=BBC News |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> Many performances from the US were not shown on the BBC, and recordings of these performances are missing. There were four separate Audio Trucks in Philadelphia provided by David Hewitt of Remote Recording Services. ABC had taken the decision that no multi track tape recordings would be allowed, so no remixing of the Philadelphia show was possible.

=== Official Live Aid DVD ===
An official four-disc DVD set of the Live Aid concerts was released on 8 November 2004. A [[film premiere|premiere]] to launch the new DVD was held on 7 November and shown in [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] surround sound featuring a short compilation of the four-disc set. The screening was held at the [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon Cinema]] in [[Kensington]], London and included guests such as [[Brian May]], [[Anita Dobson]], [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Bob Geldof and partner Jean Marie, Annie Lennox, Midge Ure, [[Michael Buerk]], [[Gary Kemp]] and [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://brianmay.com/queen/queennews/queennewsnov04a.html|title=Live Aid DVD Launch|work=Brianmay.com|date=8 November 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> Other theatrical premieres were held in [[Zurich]], Milan, [[Rome]], Vienna, Hamburg and [[Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041112005099/en/Live-Aid-DVD-Premiere-European-Cinemas-DTS Live Aid DVD] – Premiere at European Cinemas in DTS Surround Sound; Exclusive Cinema Screenings of the Landmark 1985 Concert Recording Played in 5.1 DTS Digital Surround, 12 November 2004</ref> A 52-minute compilation was later released as a limited edition DVD in July 2005 titled ''20 Years Ago Today: Live Aid''.<ref>[http://www.dvdmg.com/20yearsagotodayliveaid.shtml 20 Years Ago Today] – July 2005</ref> The box set contains 10-hour partial footage of the 16-hour length concert. The DVD was produced by Geldof's company, Woodcharm Ltd., and distributed by [[Warner Music Vision]]. The DVD has since been [[out of print]] and no longer available in stores. The decision to finally release it was taken by Bob Geldof nearly 20 years after the original concerts, after he found a number of unlicensed copies of the concert on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3530269.stm |title=Geldof thwarts 'Live Aid pirate' |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>

The most complete footage that exists is used from the [[BBC]] source, and this was the main source of the DVD. During production on the official DVD, [[MTV]] lent Woodcharm Ltd. their B-roll and alternate camera footage where MTV provided extra footage of the Philadelphia concert (where ABC had erased the tapes from the command of Bob Geldof). Songs that were not originally littered with ads were also used on the official DVD.

Working from the BBC and MTV footage, several degrees of dramatic licence were taken, to release the concert on DVD. Many songs had their soundtracks altered for the DVD release, mainly in sequences where there were originally microphone problems. In one of those instances, Paul McCartney had re-recorded his failed vocals for "Let It Be" in a studio the day after the concert (14 July 1985) but it was never used until the release of the DVD. Also, in the US finale, the original USA for Africa studio track for "We Are the World" was overlaid in places where the microphone was absent (consequently, it includes the vocals of [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[James Ingram]], two artists who did not even take part in Live Aid).

Some artists did not want their performances to be featured on the DVD. At their own request, [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]] were omitted. The former defended their decision not to be included on the grounds that their performance was 'sub-standard', but to lend their support, [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] pledged to donate proceeds from the DVD release of ''Page & Plant: No Quarter'' to the campaign, and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] pledged proceeds from his American tour with [[Mutual Admiration Society (collaboration)|Mutual Admiration Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm |title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out |website=BBC News |date=4 August 2004 |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref>

Judicious decisions were also made on which acts would be included and which ones would not, due to either technical difficulties in the original performances, the absence of original footage, or for music rights reasons. [[Rick Springfield]], [[the Four Tops]], [[the Hooters]], [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], [[Billy Ocean]] and [[Kool and the Gang]] were among those acts that were left off the DVD. Several artists who did feature on the DVD also had songs that were performed omitted. [[Madonna]] performed three solo songs in the concert, but only two were included on the DVD ("Love Makes the World Go Round" was omitted). Phil Collins played "Against All Odds" and "In the Air Tonight" at both Wembley and JFK, but only the London performance of the former and the Philadelphia performance of the latter were included on the DVD. The JFK performance of "Against All Odds" was later included on Collins' ''Finally ... The First Farewell Tour'' DVD. [[Tom Petty]] performed four songs, and only two were included on DVD. Patti LaBelle played six songs but only two songs were included.

In 2007, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] released a special edition of ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD formats containing their 1981 concert from [[Montreal Forum|The Forum]] in Montreal, Canada, and their complete Live Aid performance, along with Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing "[[Is This the World We Created...?]]" from the UK Live Aid finale, all re-mixed in DTS 5.1 sound by Justin Shirley-Smith. Also included is their Live Aid rehearsal, and an interview with the band, from earlier in the week.

On its release, the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], decided the [[VAT]] collected on sales of the Live Aid DVD would be given back to the charity, which would raise an extra £5 for every DVD sold.

On 14 November 2004, the DVD entered the UK Official [[UK Music Charts|Music Video Chart]] at number one and stayed in the top position for twelve consecutive weeks.<ref name="Official Music Video Chart Top 50">[https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/music-video-chart/20041114/13/ Official Music Video Chart Top 50] – 14 November 2004 – 20 November 2004</ref>

===Official Live Aid audio===
An audio copy of Live Aid was officially released by the [[Band Aid Trust]] label on 7 September 2018 on digital download. When first released in 2018, the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] performance was excluded. The band's set was, however, later included as a part of the digital download in May 2019. It has a total of ninety-three audio tracks.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-Aid-13th-July-1985/dp/B07H36TFQ5/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?keywords=live+aid&qid=1560558375&s=gateway&sr=8-5 Live Aid] (Live, 13 July 1985) | Various artists | 7 September 2018</ref>

===Live Aid channel===
On 12 September 2018, YouTube launched the Official Live Aid channel with a total of 87 videos from the Live Aid 1985 concert. According to the channel, all earnings from viewings go to the Band Aid Trust.<ref>[https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCUAVzSGkkTa-IoMx_x1XK4Q/about Official Live Aid channel] – YouTube</ref> As with the digital download release, a few notable performances are not included for unknown reasons, although Queen's set was uploaded to the channel with its inclusion on the digital download.

=== Unofficial recordings ===
Because the Live Aid broadcast was watched by 1.5&nbsp;billion people,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/stages-set-for-live-8/2005/07/02/1119724837990.html |title=Stages set for Live 8 |agency=Reuters |date=2 July 2005 |accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref> most of the footage was recorded on home consumer video recorders all around the world, in various qualities. Many of these recordings were in mono, because in the mid-1980s most home video machines could only record mono sound, and also because the European [[BBC TV]] broadcast was in mono. The US MTV broadcast, the [[ABC Radio Network]] and [[BBC Radio 1]] simulcasts were stereo. These recordings circulated among collectors, and in recent years, have also appeared on the Internet in [[file sharing networks]].

Since the official DVD release of Live Aid includes only partial footage of this event, unofficial distribution sources continue to be the only source of the most complete recordings of this event. The official DVD is the only authorised video release in which proceeds go directly to famine relief, the cause that the concert was originally intended to help.

Live Aid eventually raised $127&nbsp;million in famine relief for African nations, and the publicity it generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/live-aid-concert|title=Live Aid concert – Jul 13, 1985 |publisher=History.com|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> According to one aid worker, a larger impact than the money raised for the Ethiopian famine is that "humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy" for the west.<ref name="Guardian"/>

Regarding Buerk’s landmark [[BBC News]] report as a watershed moment in crisis reporting that influenced modern coverage—one that was broadcast in its entirety with Buerk’s narration on a major US channel—Suzanne Franks in ''[[The Guardian]]'' states, "the nexus of politics, media and aid are influenced by the coverage of a famine 30 years ago."<ref name="Buerk Report"/>

Many artists and performers at Live Aid gained prominence and positive commercial influence. For all the cultural, charitable, and technological significance of 1985's Live Aid, its most immediate impact was on the charts. In the UK, for example, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' by Phil Collins and Madonna's ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' leapt back into the top ten. Queen's three-year old ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' rose fifty-five places into the top twenty, followed by Freddie Mercury's ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]''. Every U2 album available at the time also returned to the chart.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Six Degrees of Rock Connections: The Complete Road Map of Rock 'N' Roll|last=Macdonald|first=Bruno|publisher=Sweet Water Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1532-510373|pages=214}}</ref> In 1986, Geldof received an honorary knighthood from Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for his efforts.<ref name=":0" /> [[Claire Bertschinger]], the nurse who featured in Buerk’s news reports that sparked the aid relief movement, received the [[Florence Nightingale Medal]] in 1991 for her work in nursing, and was made a [[Dame]] by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for "services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=59282|date=31 December 2009|page=6|supp=y}}</ref>
