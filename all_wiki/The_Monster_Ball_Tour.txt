'''The Monster Ball Tour''' was the second worldwide [[concert tour]] by American singer [[Lady Gaga]]. Staged in support of her extended play ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011. Described as "the first-ever pop electro opera" by Gaga, the tour was announced in October 2009 after [[Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga|an intended joint concert tour]] with rapper [[Kanye West]] was suddenly canceled. The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of ''The Fame Monster'' in November 2009.

A revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances, due to Gaga's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time. The stage of the original show looked like a frame, comparable to that of a hollowed-out television set. Since ''The Fame Monster'' dealt with the [[paranoia]]s Gaga had faced, the main theme of the original shows became human evolution, while elements of the canceled tour with West were still included in some parts. From 2010 onwards, the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city, where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to "the Monster Ball". Both versions of the show were divided into five segments, with the last being the encore. Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits, singing songs related to the concept of the segment, as they were followed by a video interlude.

The tour received positive reviews, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities and the theatricality of the show. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with extra demand for tickets prompting organizers to add multiple dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4 million from 200 reported shows, attended by an audience of 2.5 million. At the 2010 [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award. [[HBO]] filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, ''[[Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden]]'', aired in May and was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on November 21, 2011.

After assuring the public that she would be embarking on her own tour, Gaga officially announced The Monster Ball Tour on October 15, 2009.

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gaga explained that she wanted to put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans.<ref name="rollingstone3"/> She asserted that the tour was a "pop-electro opera" because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an [[opera]]. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage."<ref name="rollingstone3"/> The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured in such a way that the box fit any stage. "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.<ref name="rollingstone3"/>

The show revolved around themes of evolution, as well as her paranoias represented on ''The Fame Monster''. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about [[original sin]] and demons inside human beings;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/453125/lady-gagas-monster-ball-tour-the-concept.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's Monster Ball Tour: The Concept|date=November 4, 2009|publisher=MTV|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108064345/http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/453125/lady-gagas-monster-ball-tour-the-concept.jhtml|archivedate=November 8, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another."<ref name="rollingstone3"/> This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was "another level from where we were with the [[The Fame Ball Tour|Fame Ball]]. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.<ref name="rollingstone3"/>

In an interview with MTV News, Gaga further described the tour:
<blockquote>
"I begin as a cell and I grow and change throughout the show. And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation—so all of those things are present... It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from ''The Fame'', all the music from ''The Fame Monster''. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [of Gaga] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen. It forces you to look at the center of the TV. It's my way of saying, 'My music is art.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625651/20091105/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Plans To Battle Her 'Monsters' During Monster Ball Tour|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=November 6, 2009|publisher=MTV|accessdate=November 11, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111115806/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625651/20091105/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=November 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

For the performance of "Paparazzi", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew "Matty Dada" Williams. She had a different vision for it in the beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of [[Rapunzel]], the fairy-tale character. He felt that "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [to Gaga] it's not going to look like Rapunzel.'"<ref name="franktalk">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-lady-gaga13-2009dec13,0,632518,full.story|title=Frank talk with Lady Gaga|last=Powers|first=Ann|date=December 13, 2009|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=December 15, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213123424/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/music/la-ca-lady-gaga13-2009dec13%2C0%2C632518%2Cfull.story|archivedate=December 13, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In December 2009, Gaga revealed that she planned to cancel the concept of the original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh.<ref name="revamp">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1628689/lady-gaga-reveals-details-revamped-monster-ball-tour-2010.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Reveals Details Of Revamped Monster Ball Tour For 2010|last=Montogomery|first=James|date=December 23, 2009|publisher=MTV|accessdate=February 18, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107084922/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1628689/lady-gaga-reveals-details-revamped-monster-ball-tour-2010.jhtml|archivedate=November 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote ''The Fame Monster''. Hence she was able to put together "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time".<ref name="revamp"/> The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four times the size of the one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga.<ref name="revamp"/> According to James Montgomery of [[MTV]], the show recalled the film musicals ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), the science-fiction film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), and the television mini-series ''[[Angels in America (TV miniseries)|Angels in America]]'' (2003).<ref name=MTVreview/>

During an interview with London's [[95.8 Capital FM]] radio station, Gaga further elaborated on the changes in the show. She said that the show was constructed like a piece of [[musical theater]]. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old [[musical compositions|musical pieces]], some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself.<ref name="revamp2">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632101/20100217/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Dishes On Revamped Monster Ball Tour|last=Dinh|first=James|date=February 18, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2010|publisher=MTV|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220044647/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632101/20100217/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=February 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, "We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', which is what I was playing on the stage. She's a hybrid from all these other instruments."<ref name="revamp2"/> During an interview on [[WKSE|KISS-FM]] with [[Ryan Seacrest]], on his show ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'', Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball, but it had become more of a musical and less of a concert. It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.<ref name="revamp2"/>

She started performing "[[LoveGame]]", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin.<ref name="toronto"/><ref name="gazette"/> Flames appeared on the video screens,<ref name="herald"/> as she got out of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed "[[Alejandro (song)|Alejandro]]", and was carried by her  crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.<ref name="toronto"/>

The section was followed by a video interlude featuring snarling dogs and brooding ravens.<ref name="mtvref"/> The performance of "[[Monster (Lady Gaga song)|Monster]]" began with Gaga emerging in a black feathered jacket and performing dance moves reminiscent of [[Michael Jackson]] as the backdrops featured a black bird's wings.<ref name="rs"/> She continued with two songs from ''The Fame Monster'' titled "[[So Happy I Could Die]]" and "[[Teeth (Lady Gaga song)|Teeth]]", after which she removed the feathered dress.

Gaga crawled atop her piano during the follow-up songs "The Fame" and "Money Honey",<ref name="gazette"/> after which she returned to the stage, dressed in black vinyl and nearly nude in a red patent leather bikini, to perform "Boys Boys Boys", backed by a squadron of skinny and shirtless leather boys.<ref name="lvs"/> During "Poker Face", she wore a bondage inspired black leather dress with guns hanging from it and a hat made of muzzles,<ref name="guardian"/> and pumped her hands in the air while performing the song.<ref name="gazette"/> This was followed by Gaga sitting on a dentist's chair and spreading her legs during "Paper Gangsta".<ref name="toronto"/> Another video interlude followed, displaying arty poses of Gaga in gothic looks.<ref name="rs"/>

A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance.<ref name="franktalk"/> The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death. This was followed by "[[Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)]]" as she descended from the top—which signified her rebirth—amidst white lights and mechanical fog.<ref name="mtvref"/> She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to "The Orbit" by Haus of Gaga.<ref name="guardian"/> The last song of the show was "[[Bad Romance]]" which she performed in an '80s-inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high-waisted pants.<ref name="toronto"/> The show ended with a video of Gaga getting a heart-shaped tattoo on her shoulder, with the word "Dad" in the center of it.<ref name="rs"/>

After revisions, the show was divided into four sections: ''City'', ''Subway'', ''Forest'', ''Monster Ball'' and concluded with an encore. It began with a projected video onto a curtain—which contained images of Gaga smoking a cigarette—while a club remix of "Dance in the Dark" played.<ref name="postman"/> Surrounded by violet light, her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed "Dance in the Dark". Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached, the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed.<ref name="wor"/> Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a "futuristic, angular, glitter ball suit".<ref name=BBCMreview>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8520915.stm|title=Lady Gaga: The Monster Ball meets Manchester|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=May 30, 2011|last=Savage|first=Mark|publisher=[[BBC]] ([[BBC Online]])|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8520915.stm|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After descending from her fire escape, she poked around in the [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] of a dilapidated green Rolls Royce<ref name=BBCMreview/> while performing "Glitter and Grease".

"LoveGame" saw the beginning of the ''Subway'' section, with Gaga wearing a translucent nun's [[religious habit|habit]], and a skeletal hand.<ref name="wor"/> The song was performed with the aid of a gilded subway car<ref name=BBCMreview/> and a "disco stick"<ref name=MTVreview/> while her next number "Boys Boys Boys" featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts.<ref name=MTVreview/> After a costume change, Gaga burst into "Money Honey" with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her.<ref name=MTVreview/> As she walked towards the Glitter way, Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] bailed her out, thus performing the song "[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]".<ref name=MTVreview/> A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song "Brown Eyes", after which she performs "Speechless" while the piano starts spitting fire.<ref name=BBCMreview/><ref name="projo"/> This segment also saw the performance of "[[You and I (Lady Gaga song)|You and I]]" in some of the shows; the song was later added to Gaga's second studio album, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''.<ref name="nydaily"/> During this song, she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York, and how she became who she is today. Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way, and soon they run into an angel, who plays an angelic tune that summons a twister, taking them closer to the Monster Ball, but landing them in a strange place that they did not know.<ref name="wor"/> Gaga sings "[[So Happy I Could Die]]", decked in a white dress, that moves on its own accord.<ref name="nydaily"/>

The third segment begins with Gaga returning on the stage and singing "Monster", inside a forest with black, thorn-like trees.<ref name=MTVreview/><ref name="nydaily"/> Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood.

She starts singing "Alejandro" while jumping into the fountain and singing, as blood pours over her.<ref name=MTVreview/> Gaga then returns and sings "Poker Face" on the cat-walk. After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant angler fish.<ref name=MTVreview/> Gaga starts singing "Paparazzi" and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear.<ref name="wor"/><ref name=BBCMreview/> She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is not over yet, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and  performs the song, "Bad Romance" while standing inside a giant gyroscope. After the song, she says that she can do one more song for an encore to the audience. Born This Way is performed with Gaga singing with a hand microphone and wearing a plastic two-piece ensemble and during the bridge, she performs an organ solo of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s [[Toccata and Fugue in D minor]]. After the end of the song, she creates a monster paw with her dancers and finally the show is over as the curtain goes down.<ref name=BBCMreview/>

The revamped concerts were also met with critical acclaim. Mark Savage from [[BBC Online]] reviewed the first of the revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, "spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party." He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks.<ref name=BBCMreview/> [[MTV]]'s James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
