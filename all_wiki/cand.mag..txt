'''Candidatus magisterii''' (male), or '''candidata magisterii''' (female), abbreviated as '''cand.mag.''', is an [[academic degree]] currently awarded in Denmark. The degree is officially translated into English as [[Master of Arts]] and currently requires 5 years of studies. The degree was historically also awarded in Norway and Iceland, based on the Danish degree.

==History==

The degree was originally introduced in Denmark in 1883. Today, the degree is awarded only in humanities and requires five years of studies. The degree is officially translated into English as [[Master of Arts]].<ref>https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=160853#Kap5</ref>

The degree was also awarded in Norway from 1920 to 2003, based on the Danish degree. For most of its history, the degree usually required between 4 and 5 years of studies.<ref>Kjell Raaheim og Edmund Utne (1985). ''Hvilket fag skal jeg velge, hvilken grad kan jeg ta?'' (p. 105). Bergen: Sigma. {{ISBN|8290373082}}, {{ISBN|9788290373080}}</ref> In its later years, the formal minimum requirement was 3.5 years for the faculties of [[mathematics]] and [[natural sciences]], and 4–4.5 for the faculties of [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]].

It is not to be confused with the [[Magister (degree)|magister's degree]] (''magister artium'' or ''magister scientiarum''), a degree requiring 7–8 years of studies with strong emphasis on the scientific thesis, and which is the approximate equivalent of a [[PhD]] degree.<ref>{{cite book

| quote         = In recent years, the Anglo-Saxon style degree of PhD has been introduced, and is now replacing the degree of mag. art. At present, both mag. art. and PhD degrees are around. They are not identical, but their position in the educational system as the degree you take at the end of postgraduate studies is the same.
