In 1998, Viktor Khristenko was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister for Economy and Finance in [[Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet]]. Described as a "little-known reformist", his appointment drew quite some attention as it was seen as a sign towards economic reform under the [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin Presidency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/03/98/russian_crisis/85669.stm|title=Viktor Khristenko: the third reformer|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 April 1998|accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref> He however didn't survive the government reshuffling under the following Prime Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet|Primakov]]. From 1999 until early 2000, he was however appointed to [[Vladimir Putin's First Cabinet]] serving as [[First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|First Deputy Prime Minister]].

Khristenko was described as a "broadly reformist technocrat," who had shown "loyalty mixed with extreme caution," unlike the outgoing prime minister who had "openly disagreed with Mr Putin several times, criticizing the criminal investigations into the owners of [[Yukos]].<ref>Financial Times, 25 February 2004, cited via Ian Jeffries: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1fisAgAAQBAJ Political Developments in Contemporary Russia]''</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Kasyanov "the most powerful ally of big business remaining in the Russian government." Khristenko, 46 at the time, was promoted from deputy prime minister to acting prime minister.<ref name=SURPRISE/> Putin commented that Kasyanov's ousting was not related to the results of the government's activities, which he characterized as positive, but rather was caused by a necessity to once again confirm his position, which would guide the development of the country after 14 March 2004.<ref name=Regnum>"[http://lenta.ru/russia/2004/02/24/start1/ Виктор Христенко приступил к исполнению обязанностей главы правительства] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216155718/http://lenta.ru/russia/2004/02/24/start1/ |date=16 February 2005 }}" (''Viktor Khristenko Becomes Acting Prime-Minister''), Lenta, 24 February  2004</ref>
