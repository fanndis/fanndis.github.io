==Controversy==
In January 2009 Gulf News ran a column by Mohammad Abdullah Al Mutawa that claimed the holocaust was a lie. ''"Today, the whole world stands as a witness to the fact that the Nazi holocaust was a mere lie, which was devised by the Zionists to blackmail humanity. The same Zionist entity swindled the world out of billions of dollars over the years to compensate the wrong and unjust which they claim to have been inflicted on their people. It is evident that the holocaust was a conspiracy hatched by the Zionists and Nazis, and many innocent people gave their lives as a result of this inhuman plot.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2009/jan/06/dubai-middleeast|title=Roy Greenslade: Dubai paper publishes holocaust denial column|author=Roy Greenslade|work=the Guardian}}</ref> The article has since been removed from Gulf News' website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinion/columns/region/10272422.html|title=Denying the Holocaust|author=Mohammad Abdullah Al Mutawa|work=Gulf News}}</ref>

On 15 December 2013, ''Gulf News'' in its editorial claimed without mentioning any source that [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] did not vote for Dubai in its bid for [[Expo 2020]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Expo 2020 vote: UAE deserves answers from Pakistan and Afghanistan|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/editorials/expo-2020-vote-uae-deserves-answers-from-pakistan-and-afghanistan-1.1266977|access-date=22 December 2013|newspaper=Gulf News}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign Office of Pakistan]] quickly brushed aside the allegations as baseless mentioning the facts that Pakistan was committed to bid for Turkey Izmir since Turkey approached Pakistan for its support in 2011 long before Dubai even expressed its interest to host Expo 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gulf News' Expo 2020 allegations baseless: FO|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/islamabad/17-Dec-2013/gulf-news-expo-2020-allegations-baseless-fo|access-date=22 December 2013|newspaper=The Nation}}</ref> Javed Jalil Khattak, [[Consulate General of Pakistan in Dubai]], in an open letter to ''Gulf News'' termed the editorial as "an orchestrated attempt to damage and defame the historic fraternal relations between Pakistan and the UAE",<ref>{{cite news|title=Gulf News stands by editorial on Expo 2020 vote|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/letters/gulf-news-stands-by-editorial-on-expo-2020-vote-1.1268070|access-date=22 December 2013|newspaper=Gulf News}}</ref> while the editorial drew an angry reaction from the [[Pakistanis in the United Arab Emirates|Pakistani expat community]] in the UAE.<ref>{{cite web|last=Parasie|first=Nicolas|title=Dubai Newspaper Editorial Evokes Sharp Pakistani Reaction|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2013/12/17/dubai-newspaper-editorial-evokes-sharp-pakistani-reaction/|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=22 December 2013}}</ref>

On July 10th 2017, Francis Matthew, former Editor and then Editor-at-Large at Gulf News, was charged with the murder of his wife, Jane,<ref>{{Cite news|date=2017-07-10|title=UK journalist charged with Dubai murder|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-40561373|access-date=2020-09-13}}</ref> allegedly with a hammer blow to her head, over a row about finances. According to the charge, he killed her in the early morning of 4th July 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|title=10 years in jail for British journalist who killed his wife with a hammer in Dubai|url=https://gulfnews.com/uae/crime/10-years-in-jail-for-british-journalist-who-killed-his-wife-with-a-hammer-in-dubai-1.2193878|access-date=2020-09-13|website=gulfnews.com|language=en}}</ref> then went to work and held meetings as normal, after which he then returned in the evening to their villa and reported to police that thieves had broken in and assaulted her. After questioning he admitted he killed her, claiming she harangued him when a huge argument erupted over finances and debts totalling some 1 million dirhams (£200,000). Subsequently, controversy surrounding his sentencing and re-sentencing has led to media reports. In October 2018 his sentence was increased from 10 years to 15 years, with pleas from Jane Matthew's family to change the charge from physical assault to premeditated murder.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jail sentence increased for former Gulf News editor who killed his wife|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/courts/jail-sentence-increased-for-former-gulf-news-editor-who-killed-his-wife-1.777958|access-date=2020-09-13|website=The National|language=en}}</ref> But then, due to the death of Jane's father, his lawyers were allowed to appeal again, as UAE newspaper The National reported: "Jane's only surviving legal heir, her son, had previously signed a waiver dropping criminal charges against his father. This meant all private charges against him had been dropped but that public law – the right of government law against an accused – was still applicable. In UAE law, if the legal successors of a victim drop charges and waive their private rights, the court is still obliged to impose a penalty against the accused under public law – but it will be a shorter term."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Former Dubai editor who killed wife to serve seven years in jail|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/courts/former-dubai-editor-who-killed-wife-to-serve-seven-years-in-jail-1.943411|access-date=2020-09-13|website=The National|language=en}}</ref>. While the minimum sentence for murder in the UAE is 10 years, Matthew's defence expects a reduction to two years based on public law. The case is ongoing.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Briton who killed his wife in Dubai may only serve two years in jail|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/briton-who-killed-his-wife-in-dubai-may-only-serve-two-years-in-jail-1.873742|access-date=2020-09-13|website=The National|language=en}}</ref>
