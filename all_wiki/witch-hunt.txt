==Anthropological causes==
{{further|Anthropology of religion|Human sacrifice|Witch trials in the early modern period#Causes and interpretations}}
The wide distribution of the practice of witch-hunts in geographically and culturally separated societies (Europe, Africa, New Guinea) since the 1960s has triggered interest in the [[anthropological]] background of this behaviour. The belief in [[magical thinking|magic]] and [[divination]], and attempts to use magic to influence personal well-being (to increase life, win love, etc.) are universal across [[human cultures]].

Belief in witchcraft has been shown to have similarities in societies throughout the world. It presents a framework to explain the occurrence of otherwise random misfortunes such as sickness or death, and the witch sorcerer provides an image of evil.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jean Sybil |last=La Fontaine |title=Speak of the Devil: Tales of satanic abuse in contemporary England |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-62934-8 |page=34–37}}</ref> Reports on indigenous practices in the Americas, Asia and Africa collected during the early modern [[age of exploration]] have been taken to suggest that not just the belief in witchcraft but also the periodic outbreak of witch-hunts are a human cultural universal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Witches and Witch-Hunts: A global history |first=Wolfgang |last=Behringer |year=2004 |page=50 |isbn=9780745627175}}</ref>

In 451&nbsp;BC, the [[Twelve Tables#TABVLA VIII (Torts)|Twelve Tables]] of [[Roman law]] had provisions against evil incantations and spells intended to damage cereal crops. In 331&nbsp;BC, 170&nbsp;women were executed as witches in the context of an [[Epidemic|epidemic illness]]. [[Livy]] emphasizes that this was a scale of persecution without precedent in Rome.

In 186&nbsp;BC, the Roman senate issued a decree severely restricting the [[Bacchanalia]], ecstatic rites celebrated in honor of Dionysus. Livy records that this persecution was because "there was nothing wicked, nothing flagitious, that had not been practiced among them".<ref name=Livy>{{cite book |author=Livy |title=History of Rome, Book XXXIX |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.asp |access-date=24 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702233020/http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.asp |archive-date=2 July 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Consequent to the ban, in 184&nbsp;BC, about 2,000&nbsp;members of the Bacchus cult were executed, and in 182–180&nbsp;BCE another 3,000&nbsp;executions took place.<ref name=Durrant&Bailey>{{cite book |last1=Durrant |first1=Jonathan Bryan |last2=Bailey |first2=Michael David |title=Historical Dictionary of Witchcraft |location=Plymouth, UK |publisher=Scarecrow Press |edition=2 |year=2012 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historicaldi_durr_2012_000_11071528/page/n144 121]–122 |isbn=978-0-8108-7245-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/historicaldi_durr_2012_000_11071528 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Persecution of witches continued in the [[Roman Empire]] until the late 4th&nbsp;century AD and abated only after the introduction of [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Christianity]] as the Roman state religion in the 390s.<ref name=Behringer>{{cite book |last=Behringer |first=Wolfgang |title=Witches and Witch-Hunts: A Global History |location=Cambridge |publisher=Polity Press |year=2004 |pages=48–50 |isbn=978-0745627175}}</ref>

The ''Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficiis'' promulgated by [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 81&nbsp;BC became an important source of late medieval and early modern European law on witchcraft. This law banned the trading and possession of harmful drugs and poisons, possession of magical books and other occult paraphernalia. [[Strabo]], [[Gaius Maecenas]] and [[Cassius Dio]] all reiterate the traditional Roman opposition against sorcery and divination, and [[Tacitus]] used the term ''religio-superstitio'' to class these outlawed observances. Emperor [[Augustus]] strengthened legislation aimed at curbing these practices, for instance in 31&nbsp;BC, by burning over 2,000&nbsp;magical books in Rome, except for certain portions of the hallowed [[Sibylline Books]].<ref name=Suetonius>{{cite book |author=Suetonius |title=The Life of Augustus}}</ref><ref name=Garnsey>{{cite book |last1=Garnsey |first1=Peter |last2=Saller |first2=Richard P. |title=The Roman Empire: Economy, Society, and Culture |url=https://archive.org/details/romanempireecono00garn |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|year=1987 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/romanempireecono00garn/page/168 168]–174 |isbn=978-0-520-06067-8 }}</ref> While Tiberius Claudius was emperor, 45&nbsp;men and 85&nbsp;women, who were all suspected of sorcery, were executed.<ref name=Ogden>{{cite book |last=Ogden |first=Daniel |title=Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |pages=283 |isbn=978-0-19-513575-6}}</ref>

The [[Hebrew Bible]] condemns sorcery. [[Deuteronomy]]&nbsp;18:10–12 states: "No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an [[augur]], or a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]], or one that casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead. For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord"; and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]&nbsp;22:18 prescribes: "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live".<ref>"witch" here translates the Hebrew {{lang|he|מכשפה}}, and is rendered {{lang|grc|φαρμακός}} in the [[Septuagint]].</ref> Tales like that of [[1 Samuel|1&nbsp;Samuel]] 28, reporting how [[Saul]] "hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land",<ref>"those that have familiar spirits": Hebrew {{lang|he|אוב}}, or {{lang|grc|ἐγγαστρίμυθος}} "ventriloquist, soothsayer" in the Septuagint; "wizards": Hebrew {{lang|he|ידעני}} or {{lang|grc|γνώστης}} "diviner" in the Septuagint.</ref> suggest that in practice sorcery could at least lead to exile.

In the Judaean [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple period]], Rabbi [[Simeon ben Shetach]] in the 1st century BCE is reported to have sentenced to death eighty women who had been charged with witchcraft on a single day in [[Ashkelon]]. Later the women's relatives took revenge by bringing (reportedly) false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn.<ref>''Yerushalmi [[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'', 6:6.</ref>

===Late antiquity===

The 6th&nbsp;century AD ''[[Getica]]'' of [[Jordanes]] records a persecution and expulsion of witches among the [[Goths]] in a mythical account of the origin of the [[Huns]]. The ancient fabled King [[Filimer]] is said to have

{{quote|found among his people certain witches, whom he called in his native tongue ''Haliurunnae''. Suspecting these women, he expelled them from the midst of his race and compelled them to wander in solitary exile afar from his army. There the unclean spirits, who beheld them as they wandered through the wilderness, bestowed their embraces upon them and begat this savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human, and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech.<ref name="JordanesOrigins">{{cite book |last=Jordanes |author-link=Jordanes |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths |translator=[[Charles C.

===Middle Ages===
{{further|European witchcraft#History}}

====Christianisation in the Early Middle Ages====
The Councils of [[Synod of Elvira|Elvira]] (306&nbsp;AD), [[Synod of Ancyra|Ancyra]] (314&nbsp;AD), and [[Quinisext Council|Trullo]] (692&nbsp;AD) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship. This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries. The general desire of the [[Catholic Church]]'s clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and [[necromancy]] is shown in the decrees of the [[Council of Paderborn]], which, in 785&nbsp;AD, explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch. The Lombard code of 643&nbsp;AD states:

<blockquote>Let nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch, for it is not possible, nor ought to be believed by Christian minds.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hutton |first=Ronald |author-link=Ronald Hutton |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy |title-link=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |page=257 |chapter=The Clash of Faiths (AD c.300–c.1000) |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0-631-18946-7 |date=1993 |edition=pbk. |orig-year=1991}}</ref></blockquote>

This conforms to the teachings of the [[Canon Episcopi]] of circa 900&nbsp;AD (alleged to date from 314&nbsp;AD), which, stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was, itself, false and heterodox teaching. Other examples include an Irish synod in 800&nbsp;AD,<ref>{{cite book |quote=Likewise, an Irish synod at around 800&nbsp;AD condemned the belief in witches, and in particular those who slandered people for being ''lamias'' ('''que interpretatur striga'''). |last=Behringer |title=Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=30–31}}</ref> and a sermon by [[Agobard|Agobard of Lyons]] (810&nbsp;AD).{{efn|A crown witness of 'Carolingian skepticism', Archbishop Agobard of Lyon (769–840&nbsp;AD), reports witch panics during the reign of Charlemagne. In his sermon on hailstorms he reports frequent lynchings of supposed weather magicians (''tempestarii''), as well as of sorcerers, who were made responsible for a terrible livestock mortality in 810&nbsp;AD. According to Agobard, the common people in their fury over crop failure had developed the extravagant idea that foreigners were secretly coming with airships to strip their fields of crops, and transmit it to Magonia. These anxieties resulted in severe aggression, and on one occasion around 816&nbsp;AD, Agobard could hardly prevent a crowd from killing three foreign men and women, perceived as Magonian people. As their supposed homeland's name suggests, the crop failure was associated with magic. The bishop emphasized that thunderstorms were caused exclusively by natural or divine agencies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Behringer |year=2004 |title=Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=54–55}}</ref>}}

[[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Kálmán (Coloman) of Hungary]], in Decree 57 of his First Legislative Book (published in 1100), banned witch-hunting because he said, "witches do not exist".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bibleapologetics.wordpress.com/tag/witch-hunts-2/#_ftnref17 |title=witch hunts |website=Bible Apologetics}}</ref><ref>
"A decree of King Coloman of Hungary (c. 1074–1116, r. 1095–1116) against the belief in the existence of ''strigae'' (''De strigis vero que non sunt, ne ulla questio fiat'') suggests that they were thought to be human beings with demonic affiliation: witches.", Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 32 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> The "Decretum" of [[Burchard, Bishop of Worms]] (about 1020), and especially its 19th book, often known separately as the "Corrector", is another work of great importance. Burchard was writing against the superstitious belief in magical [[potion]]s, for instance, that may produce impotence or abortion. These were also condemned by several Church Fathers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/abortion-contraception-and-the-church-fathers |title=Abortion, Contraception and the Church Fathers |work=National Catholic Register}}</ref> But he altogether rejected the possibility of many of the alleged powers with which witches were popularly credited. Such, for example, were nocturnal riding through the air, the changing of a person's disposition from love to hate, the control of thunder, rain, and sunshine, the transformation of a man into an animal, the intercourse of [[incubi]] and [[succubi]] with human beings and other such superstitions. Not only the attempt to practice such things, but the very belief in their possibility, is treated by Burchard as false and superstitious.

[[Pope Gregory VII]], in 1080, wrote to King [[Harald III of Denmark]] forbidding witches to be put to death upon presumption of their having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence. Neither were these the only examples of an effort to prevent unjust suspicion to which such poor creatures might be exposed.{{efn|See, for example, the ''Weihenstephan'' case discussed by Weiland in the ''Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte'', IX, 592.
"In 1080 Harold of Denmark (r. 1076–80) was admonished not to hold old women and Christian priests responsible for storms and diseases, or to slaughter them in the cruelest manner. Like Agobard before him, Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073–85) declared in his letter to the Danish king that these catastrophes were caused by God alone, that they were God's punishment for human sins, and that the killing of the innocent would only increase His fury." <ref>Behringer, "Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History", p. 55 (2004).

Early secular laws against witchcraft include those promulgated by King [[Athelstan]] (924–939):

<blockquote>And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and ''lybacs'' ''[read ''lyblac'' "sorcery"]'', and ''morthdaeds ["murder, mortal sin"]'': if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120&nbsp;days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120&nbsp;shillings, and pay the [[weregild|wer]] to his kindred, and enter into [[Frankpledge|borh]] for him, that he evermore desist from the like.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/560-975dooms.html |title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project |website=www.fordham.edu}}</ref></blockquote>

In some prosecutions for witchcraft, torture (permitted by the [[Roman civil law]]) apparently took place. However, [[Pope Nicholas I]] (866&nbsp;AD), prohibited the use of torture altogether, and a similar decree may be found in the [[Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals]].<ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia: Witchcraft"/>

Condemnations of witchcraft are nevertheless found in the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustin]]<nowiki/>e and early theologians, who made little distinction between witchcraft and the practices of pagan religions.<ref name=":3" /> Many believed witchcraft did not exist in a philosophical sense: Witchcraft was based on illusions and powers of evil, which Augustine likened to darkness, a non-entity representing the absence of light.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=Morrow2019>{{cite book |title=Gods of the Flesh: A Skeptic's Journey Through Sex, Politics, and Religion |last=Morrow |first=Israel |year=2019 |isbn=9780578438290 }}</ref> Augustine and his adherents like [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]] nevertheless promulgated elaborate demonologies, including the belief that humans could enter pacts with demons, which became the basis of future witch hunts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Oxford illustrated history of witchcraft and magic |others=Davies, Owen, 1969- |isbn=9780199608447 |edition=First |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |oclc=972537073|year = 2017}}</ref> Ironically, many clerics of the Middle Ages openly or covertly practiced goetia, believing that as Christ granted his disciples power to command demons, to summon and control demons was not, therefore, a sin.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |title=Magic in the Middle Ages |last=Kieckhefer, Richard |isbn=9781139923484 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge |oclc=889521066}}</ref>

Whatever the position of individual clerics, witch-hunting seems to have persisted as a cultural phenomenon. Arguably the first famous witch-hunt was the mob abduction, torture and execution of [[Hypatia]], a female philosopher and mathematician who threatened the influence of [[Cyril of Alexandria|Saint Cyril]] of Alexandria in 415 AD.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ih8FNa3JoT4C |title=History of the Witchcraft Trials |last=Soldan |first=Wilhelm Gottlieb |year=1843 }}</ref><ref name=Morrow2019/> Throughout the early medieval period, notable rulers prohibited both witchcraft and pagan religions, often on pain of death. Under Charlemagne, for example, Christians who practiced witchcraft were enslaved by the Church, while those who worshiped the Devil (Germanic gods) were killed outright.<ref name=":3" /> Witch-hunting also appears in period literature. According to [[Snorri Sturluson]], King [[Olaf Tryggvason|Olaf Trygvasson]] furthered the Christian conversion of Norway by luring pagan magicians to his hall under false pretenses, barring the doors and burning them alive. Some who escaped were later captured and drowned.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/07olaftr.htm |title=Heimskringla: King Olaf Trygvason's Saga |website=Sacred Texts }}</ref><ref name=Morrow2019/>

====Later Middle Ages====
[[File:Willisau 1447.JPG|thumb|200px|The burning of a woman in [[Willisau]], [[Switzerland]], 1447]]
The manuals of the Roman Catholic [[Inquisition]] remained highly skeptical of witch accusations,{{cn|date=October 2019}} although there was sometimes an overlap between accusations of heresy and of witchcraft, particularly when, in the 13th century, the newly formed [[Inquisition]] was commissioned to deal with the [[Cathars]] of Southern France, whose teachings were charged with containing an admixture of witchcraft and magic. Although it has been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe from the early 14th&nbsp;century, after the Cathars and the [[Knights Templar]] were suppressed, this hypothesis has been rejected independently by virtually all academic historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976).

In 1258, [[Pope Alexander IV]] declared that Inquisition would not deal with cases of witchcraft unless they were related to heresy.{{efn|"There would be no witch persecutions of the sort he envisaged. The Gregorian Inquisition had been established to deal with the religious matter of heresy, not the secular issue of witchcraft. Pope Alexander&nbsp;IV spelled this out clearly in a 1258 canon which forbade inquisitions into sorcery unless there was also manifest heresy. And this view was even confirmed and acknowledged by the infamous inquisitor Bernard Gui (immortalised by Umberto Eco in ''The Name of the Rose''), who wrote in his influential inquisitors' manual that, by itself, sorcery did not come within the Inquisition's jurisdiction. In sum, the Church did not want the Inquisition sucked into witch trials, which were for the secular courts."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/dominicselwood/100269271/how-protestantism-fuelled-europes-deadly-witch-craze/ |title=How Protestantism fuelled Europe's deadly witch craze |first=Dominic |last=Selwood |author-link=Dominic Selwood |newspaper=[[The Telegraph (website)|The Telegraph]] |date=2016-03-16 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ |title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |last=Cross |first=Livingstone |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192802903 |page=1769}}</ref> Although [[Pope John XXII]] had later authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerers in 1320,<ref>[[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], ''A History of Medieval Christianity'' (173).</ref> inquisitorial courts rarely dealt with witchcraft save incidentally when investigating heterodoxy.

In the case of the [[Madonna Oriente]], the Inquisition of [[Milan]] was not sure what to do with two women who in 1384 confessed to have participated the society around Signora Oriente or [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Through their confessions, both of them conveyed the traditional folk beliefs of white magic. The women were accused again in 1390, and condemned by the inquisitor. They were eventually executed by the secular arm.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |year=2000 |orig-year=1993 |title=Europe's Inner Demons: The Demonization of Christians in Medieval Christendom |edition=Revised |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/europesinnerdemo00cohn_0/page/173 173]–174 |title-link=Europe's Inner Demons }}</ref>

In a notorious case in 1425, [[Hermann II, Count of Celje]] accused his daughter-in-law [[Veronika of Desenice]] of witchcraft – and, though she was acquitted by the court, he had her drowned. The accusations of witchcraft are, in this case, considered to have been a pretext for Hermann to get rid of an "unsuitable match," Veronika being born into the lower nobility and thus "unworthy" of his son.

A Catholic figure who preached against witchcraft was popular Franciscan preacher [[Bernardino of Siena]] (1380–1444). Bernardino's sermons reveal both a phenomenon of superstitious practices and an over-reaction against them by the common people.<ref>See Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1999, Chapter 2.</ref>  However, it is clear that Bernardino had in mind not merely the use of spells and enchantments and such like fooleries but much more serious crimes, chiefly murder and infanticide. This is clear from his much-quoted sermon of 1427, in which he says:
<blockquote>One of them told and confessed, without any pressure, that she had killed thirty children by bleeding them ... [and] she confessed more, saying she had killed her own son ...

Perhaps the most notorious witch trial in history was the [[trial of Joan of Arc]]. Although the trial was politically motivated, and the verdict later overturned, the position of Joan as a woman and an accused witch became significant factors in her execution.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |title=Joan of Arc : a life transfigured |last=Harrison, Kathryn |isbn=9780385531207 |edition=First |location=New York |oclc=876833154}}</ref> Joan's punishment of being burned alive (victims were usually strangled before burning) was reserved solely for witches and heretics, the implication being that a burned body could not be resurrected on [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]].<ref name=Morrow2019/><ref name=":2" />

====Transition to the early modern witch-hunts====
[[File:12.Garden-Brutal Myths.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (the 'Hammer against the Witches'), published in 1487, accused women of destroying men by planting bitter herbs throughout the field.]]
The resurgence of witch-hunts at the end of the medieval period, taking place with at least partial support or at least tolerance on the part of the Church, was accompanied with a number of developments in Christian doctrine, for example the recognition of the existence of witchcraft as a form of Satanic influence and its classification as a heresy. As [[Renaissance magic|Renaissance occultism]] gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the [[folk religion]] of the uneducated rural population at best, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all ''maleficium''.{{efn|Early Christian theologians attributed to the Devil responsibility for persecution, heresy, witchcraft, sin, natural disasters, human calamities, and whatever else went wrong. One tragic consequence of this was a tendency to demonize people accused of wrongs. At the instance of ecclesiastical leaders, the state burned heretics and witches, burning symbolizing the fate deserved by the demonic. Popular fears, stirred to fever pitch in the 14th and 15th&nbsp;centuries, sustained frenzied efforts to wipe out heretics, witches, and unbelievers, especially Jews.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hinson |title=Historical and Theological Perspectives on Satan |magazine=[[Review & Expositor]] |volume=89 |issue=4 |page=475 |date=Fall 1992}}</ref>}}{{efn|Trevor-Roper has said that it was necessary for belief in the Kingdom of Satan to die before the witch theory could be discredited. <ref>{{cite book |last=Larner |article=Crime of witchcraft in early modern Europe |editor=Oldridge |title=The Witchcraft Reader |page=211 |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge}}</ref>}} These doctrinal shifts were completed in the mid-15th century, specifically in the wake of the [[Council of Basel]] and centered on the [[Duchy of Savoy]] in the western Alps,{{efn|We are reasonably confident today that the 'classical' doctrine of witchcraft crystallized during the middle third of the 15th century, shortly after the Council of Basel, primarily within a western Alpine zone centred around the duchy of Savoy (Ostorero et al. 1999).<ref>{{cite book |last=Behringer |title=Witches and Witch-hunts: A global history |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=18–19}}</ref>}} leading to an early series of witch trials by both secular and ecclesiastical courts in the second half of the 15th century.{{efn|By the end of the 15th century, scattered trials for witchcraft by both secular and ecclesiastical courts occurred in many places from the Pyrenees, where the Spanish Inquisition had become involved, to the North Sea.<ref>{{cite book |last=Behringer |title=Witches and Witch-hunts: A global history |year=2004 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=18–19}}</ref>}}

In 1484, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] issued ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[Papal bull]] authorizing the "correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising" of devil-worshippers who have "slain infants", among other crimes. He did so at the request of inquisitor [[Heinrich Kramer]], who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate.<ref>Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', (49)</ref> However, historians such as [[Ludwig von Pastor]] insist that the bull neither allowed anything new nor was necessarily binding on Catholic consciences.{{efn|"The Bull contains no dogmatic decision of any sort on witchcraft. It assumes the possibility of demoniacal influences on human beings which the Church has always maintained, but claims no dogmatic authority for its pronouncement on the particular cases with which it was dealing at the moment. The form of the document, which refers only to certain occurrences which had been brought to the knowledge of the Pope, sh[o]ws that it was not intended to bind any one to believe in the things mentioned in it. The question whether the Pope himself believed in them has nothing to do with the subject. His judgment on this point has no greater importance than attaches to a Papal decree in any other undogmatic question, e.g., on a dispute about a benefice. The Bull introduced no new element into the current beliefs about witchcraft. It is absurd to accuse it of being the cause of the cruel treatment of witches, when we see in the ''Sachsenspiegel'' that burning alive was already the legal punishment for a witch. All that Innocent VIII. did was to confirm the jurisdiction of the inquisitors over these cases. The Bull simply empowered them to try all matters concerning witchcraft, without exception, before their own tribunals, by Canon-law; a process which was totally different from that of the later trials. Possibly the Bull, in so far as it admonished the inquisitors to be on the alert in regard to witchcraft may have given an impetus to the prosecution of such cases; but it affords no justification for the accusation that it introduced a new crime, or was in any way responsible for the iniquitous horrors of the witch-harrying of later times."<ref>{{cite book |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |author-link=Ludwig von Pastor |title=The History of the Popes, from the Close of the Middle Ages |volume=5 |pages=349–350}}</ref>}} Three years later in 1487, Kramer published the notorious ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (lit., 'Hammer against the Evildoers') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership. The book was soon banned by the Church in 1490, and Kramer was [[censure]]d. In 1538, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] cautioned its members not to believe what the ''Malleus'' said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence. It was nevertheless reprinted in 14 editions by 1520 and became unduly influential in the secular courts.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Jolly |editor2=Raudvere |editor3=Peters |title=Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages |page=241 |year=2002}}</ref>


===Early Modern Europe===
{{Main|Witch trials in Early Modern Europe}}

[[File:Wickiana4.jpg|thumb|The torture used against accused witches, 1577]]
The witch trials in [[Early Modern Europe]] came in waves and then subsided. There were trials in the 15th and early 16th&nbsp;centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a major issue again and peaking in the 17th&nbsp;century; particularly during the [[Thirty Years War]]. What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which were sometimes used to protect the people) now became a sign of a pact between the people with supernatural abilities and the devil. To justify the killings, Protestant Christianity and its proxy secular institutions deemed witchcraft as being associated to wild [[Satanism|Satanic]] ritual parties in which there was much naked dancing and [[Blood libel|cannibalistic infanticide]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Side of Christian History |first=Helen |last=Ellerbe}}</ref> It was also seen as [[heresy]] for going against the first of the [[ten commandments]] ("You shall have no other gods before me") or as [[Lèse majesté|violating majesty]], in this case referring to the divine majesty, not the worldly.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meewis |first=Wim |year=1992 |title=De Vierschaar |publisher=Uitgevering Pelckmans |page=115}}</ref> Further scripture was also frequently cited, especially the Exodus decree that "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exodus&nbsp;22:18), which many supported.

Witch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be central and southern Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=12341&amid=12341 |title=The History Today Archive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112102609/http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=12341&amid=12341 |archive-date=12 November 2007}}</ref> Germany was a late starter in terms of the numbers of trials, compared to other regions of Europe. Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670.<ref>{{cite book |first=H.C.

In Denmark, the burning of witches increased following the [[Protestant Reformation|reformation]] of 1536. [[Christian IV of Denmark]], in particular, encouraged this practice, and hundreds of people were convicted of [[witchcraft]] and burnt. In the district of Finnmark, northern Norway, severe witchcraft trials took place during the period 1600–1692.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Witchcraft Trials in Finnmark, northern Norway |last=Willumsen |first=Liv Helene |publisher=Skald |year=2010 |isbn=978-82-7959-152-8 |location=Bergen |page=13}}</ref> A memorial of international format, ''Steilneset Memorial'', has been built to commemorate the victims of the Finnmark witchcraft trials.<ref>{{cite book |chapter='Introduction' |title=Steilneset Memorial.

In the [[North Berwick witch trials]] in Scotland, over 70&nbsp;people were accused of witchcraft on account of bad weather when [[James I of England|James&nbsp;VI of Scotland]], who shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials, sailed to Denmark in 1590 to meet his betrothed [[Anne of Denmark]]. According to a widely circulated pamphlet, "Newes from Scotland," James&nbsp;VI personally presided over the torture and execution of Doctor Fian.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/kjd/index.htm |title=Daemonlologie by King James the First and Newes from Scotland |website=Sacred Texts }}</ref> Indeed, James published a witch-hunting manual, [[Daemonologie]], which contains the famous dictum: "Experience daily proves how loath they are to confess without torture." Later, the [[Pendle witch trials]] of 1612 joined the ranks of the most famous witch trials in English history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/lancashire/hi/things_to_do/newsid_8316000/8316766.stm |title=BBC – Lancashire – Follow the Pendle Witches trail}}</ref>

[[File:Bamberger Malefizhaus 1627 Staatsbiblithek Bamberg.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Malefizhaus'' of [[Bamberg, Germany]], where suspected witches were held and interrogated. 1627 engraving.]]In England, witch-hunting would reach its apex in 1644 to 1647 due to the efforts of Puritan [[Matthew Hopkins]]. Although operating without an official Parliament commission, Hopkins (calling himself Witchfinder General) and his accomplices charged hefty fees to towns during the [[English Civil War]]. Hopkins' witch-hunting spree was brief but significant: 300&nbsp;convictions and deaths are attributed to his work.<ref name="sharpe">{{cite book |last=Sharpe |first=James |year=2002 |article=The Lancaster witches in historical context |editor=Poole, Robert |title=The Lancashire Witches: Histories and Stories |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-6204-9 |pages=1–18}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2017}} Hopkins wrote a book on his methods, describing his fortuitous beginnings as a witch-hunter, the methods used to extract confessions, and the tests he employed to test the accused: stripping them naked to find the [[Witches' mark]], [[Dunking|the "swimming" test]], and [[Pricking|pricking the skin]]. The swimming test, which included throwing a witch, who was strapped to a chair, into a bucket of water to see if she floated, was discontinued in 1645 due to a legal challenge. The 1647 book, ''The Discovery of Witches'', soon became an influential legal text. The book was used in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] as early as May 1647, when [[Margaret Jones (Puritan midwife)|Margaret Jones]] was executed for witchcraft in [[Massachusetts]],<ref name="Jewett">{{cite book |author=Jewett, Clarence F. |title=The Memorial History of Boston: Including Suffolk County, Massachusetts. 1630–1880 |url=https://archive.org/details/memorialhistory04wins |publisher=Ticknor and Company |year=1881 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/memorialhistory04wins/page/133 133]–137}}</ref> the first of 17&nbsp;people executed for witchcraft in the Colonies from 1647 to 1663.<ref name="Fraden" />

Witch-hunts began to occur in North America while Hopkins was hunting witches in England. In 1645, forty-six years before the notorious [[Salem witch trials]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] experienced America's first accusations of [[witchcraft]] when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. In America's first witch trial, Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but she was still sentenced to be hanged as punishment for the death of her child. She died in prison.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |work=masslive.com |date=10 May 2011}}</ref> About eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft; thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that occurred throughout [[New England Colonies|New England]] and lasted from 1645–1663.<ref name="Fraden">{{cite book |last1=Fraden |first1=Judith Bloom |first2=Dennis Brindell |last2=Fraden |title=The Salem Witch Trials |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year=2008 |page=15}}</ref> The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–1693.

Once a case was brought to trial, the prosecutors hunted for accomplices. The use of magic was considered wrong, not because it failed, but because it worked effectively for the wrong reasons. Witchcraft was a normal part of everyday life. Witches were often called for, along with religious ministers, to help the ill or deliver a baby. They held positions of spiritual power in their communities. When something went wrong, no one questioned either the ministers or the power of the witchcraft. Instead, they questioned whether the witch intended to inflict harm or not.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Peter G. |title=The Long European Reformation |url=https://archive.org/details/longeuropeanrefo00pete |url-access=limited |year=2004 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-333-64451-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/longeuropeanrefo00pete/page/n222 210]–215}}</ref>

Current scholarly estimates of the number of people who were executed for witchcraft vary from about 40,000 to 100,000.{{efn|name="ReferenceA"|[[Brian P.

In addition to known witch trials, witch hunts were often conducted by vigilantes, who may or may not have executed their victims. In Scotland, for example, cattle murrains were blamed on witches, usually peasant women, who were duly punished. A popular method called "scoring above the breath" meant slashing across a woman's forehead in order to remove the power of her magic. This was seen as a kind of emergency procedure which could be performed in absence of judicial authorities.<ref>{{cite book |title=The lore of Scotland: A guide to Scottish legends |author=Westwood, Jennifer |year=2011 |publisher=Arrow |others=Kingshill, Sophia |isbn=9780099547167 |location=London |oclc=712624576}}</ref>

On the basis of this evidence, Scarre and Callow asserted that the "typical witch was the wife or widow of an agricultural labourer or small tenant farmer, and she was well known for a quarrelsome and aggressive nature."

While it appears to be the case that the clear majority of victims in Germany were women, in other parts of Europe the witch-hunts targeted primarily men, thus in Iceland 92% of the accused were men, in Estonia 60%, and in Moscow two-thirds of those accused were male. In Finland, a total of more than 100 death row inmates were roughly equal in both men and women, but all [[Åland]]ers sentenced to witchcraft were only women.<ref>[https://www15.uta.fi/yky/arkisto/historia/noitanetti/kuolemantuomiot.html Noituus - Kuolemantuomiot] (in Finnish)</ref>

===India===
There is no documented evidence of witch-hunting in India before 1792.
The earliest evidence of witch-hunts in India can be found in the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] witch trials in 1792.<ref>{{cite book |last= Archer |first= W G |date=1979 |title=The Santals: Readings in Tribal Life |location= New Delhi |publisher= Concept Publishing Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Crooke|first=W |date= 1969|title= The Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India|location=Delhi |publisher= Munshiram Manoharlal }}</ref> In the [[Singhbhum]] district of the [[Chhotanagpur]] division in [[British India]], not only were those accused of being witches murdered, but also those related to the accused to ensure that they won't avenge the deaths (Roy Choudhary 1958: 88). The Chhotanagpur region was majorly populated by an [[adivasi]] population called the Santhals. The existence of witches was a belief central to the Santhals. Witches were feared and were supposed to be engaged in anti-social activities. They were also supposed to have the power to kill people by feeding on their entrails, and causing fevers in cattle among other evils. Therefore, according to the adivasi population the cure to their disease and sickness was the elimination of these witches who were seen as the cause.<ref name="Sinha 1672–1676">{{cite journal |last=Sinha |first= Shashank|title= Witch hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur |jstor= 4419566 |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=42 |issue= 19|pages= 1672–1676|year= 2007}}</ref>

The practice of witch-hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe. Unlike Europe, where witches were strangulated before being burnt, the santhals forced them "..to eat human excreta and drink blood before throwing them into the flames." <ref>{{cite journal |last= Varma|first=Daya |title= Witch-Hunt among Santhals |jstor= 4419670 |journal=Economic & Political Weekly |volume=42 |issue=23 |pages= 2130|year=2007 }}</ref>

The British banned the persecution of witches in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Chhotanagpur in the 1840s–1850s. Despite the ban, very few cases were reported as witch-hunting was not seen as a crime. The Santhals believed that the ban in fact allowed the witches to flourish. Thus, the effect of the ban was contrary to what the British had intended. During 1857–58, there was a surge in witch-hunting. This can be viewed as a mode of resistance to the British rule as part of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|larger revolt of 1857]].<ref name="Sinha 1672–1676"/>

Witch-hunts still occur today in societies where belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] is prevalent. In most cases, these are instances of [[lynching]] and burnings, reported with some regularity from much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], from [[Saudi Arabia]] and from Papua New Guinea. In addition, there are some countries that have legislation against the practice of sorcery. The only country where witchcraft remains legally punishable by [[death penalty|death]] is Saudi Arabia.

Witch-hunts in modern times are continuously reported by the [[UNHCR]] of the [[United Nations Organization|UNO]] as a massive violation of human rights. Most of the accused are women and children but can also be elderly people or marginalised groups of the community such as [[albino]]s and the [[HIV]]-infected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home/opendocPDFViewer.html?docid=4981ca712|title=UNHCR Research Paper No. 169 Witchcraft allegations, refugee protection and human rights: a review of the evidence, January 2009|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}</ref> These victims are often considered burdens to the community, and as a result are often driven out, starved to death, or killed violently, sometimes by their own families in acts of [[social cleansing]].<ref>Miguel, Edward.

[[Audrey I. Richards]], in the journal ''Africa'', relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the ''Bamucapi'', appeared in the villages of the [[Bemba people]] of Zambia.<ref>''A Modern Movement of Witch Finders'' Audrey I Richards (Africa: Journal of the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, Ed. Diedrich Westermann.) Vol VIII, 1935, published by Oxford University Press, London.</ref> They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a [[mirror]], and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to "yield up his horns"; i.e. give over the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] containers for [[curse]]s and evil [[potion]]s to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called ''kucapa'' which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.

The villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up ''all'' the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.

The Bemba people believed misfortunes such as [[wart]]ings, [[haunting]]s and [[famine]]s to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa, beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Whereas witchcraft cases in the colonial era, especially in former British Central Africa, were based on the official dogma that witchcraft is an illusion (so that people invoking witchcraft would be punished as either impostors or slanderers), in contemporary legal practice in Africa witchcraft appears as a reality and as an actionable offence in its own right.<ref>{{cite web |first=Wim |last=van Binsbergen |url=http://www.shikanda.net/african_religion/witchtxt.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030511000417/http://www.shikanda.net/african_religion/witchtxt.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-05-11 |publisher=Shikanda.net |title=Witchcraft in Modern Africa |year=2002 }}</ref>}}

In Sierra Leone, the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the ''kɛmamɔi'' (native [[Mende people|Mende]] witch-finder) on social ethics : "Witchcraft ... takes hold in people's lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid.

In [[India]], labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2% of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/the-world/070716/recourse-rare-witch-hunt-victims-in-india |title=Recourse rare for witch hunt victims in India |website=Women's eNews}}</ref>

Western media frequently write of a '[[Stalinist]] witch-hunt'<ref>[[Jackie Mansky]], 'The True Story of the Death of Stalin', [[Smithsonian.com]], 10 October 2017</ref> or a '[[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] witch-hunt,<ref>[[Arthur Miller]], "Why I wrote 'The Crucible'", [[The New Yorker]], 13 October 1996</ref> In these cases, the word 'witch-hunt' is used as a [[metaphor]] to illustrate the brutal and ruthless way in which political opponents are denigrated and persecuted.
