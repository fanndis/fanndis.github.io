{{Main|History of Florence|Timeline of Florence}}
[[File:Colored woodcut town view of Florence.jpg|thumb|View of Florence by Hartmann Schedel, published in 1493]]

Florence originated as a Roman city, and later, after a long period as a flourishing trading and banking [[medieval commune]], it was the birthplace of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. It was politically, economically, and culturally one of the most important cities in Europe and the world from the 14th to 16th centuries.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

The language spoken in the city during the 14th century came to be accepted as the model for what would become the [[Italian language]]. Thanks especially to the works of the Tuscans [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], Florentine dialect, above all the local dialects, was adopted as the basis for a national literary language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://italian.about.com/library/weekly/aa060699a.htm |title=History of the Italian Language |publisher=italian.about.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>

Starting from the late [[Middle Ages]], Florentine money—in the form of the gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]]—financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, to Lyon and Hungary. Florentine bankers financed the English kings during the [[Hundred Years War]]. They similarly financed the papacy, including the construction of their [[Avignon Papacy|provisional capital of Avignon]] and, after their return to Rome, the reconstruction and Renaissance embellishment of Rome.

Florence was home to the Medici, one of European history's most important noble families. [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] was considered a political and cultural mastermind of Italy in the late 15th century. Two members of the family were [[pope]]s in the early 16th century: [[Leo X]] and [[Clement VII]]. [[Catherine de Medici]] married King [[Henry II of France]] and, after his death in 1559, reigned as regent in France. [[Marie de' Medici]] married [[Henry IV of France]] and gave birth to the future King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. The Medici reigned as [[Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], starting with [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1569 and ending with the death of [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]] in 1737.

Situated along the ''[[Via Cassia]]'', the main route between Rome and the north, and within the fertile valley of the [[Arno]], the settlement quickly became an important commercial centre.

In centuries to come, the city experienced turbulent periods of [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] rule, during which the city was often troubled by warfare between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], which may have caused the population to fall to as few as 1,000 people. Peace returned under [[Lombards|Lombard]] rule in the 6th century. Florence was conquered by [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and became part of the [[March of Tuscany|Duchy of Tuscany]], with [[Lucca]] as capital. The population began to grow again and commerce prospered. In 854, Florence and [[Fiesole]] were united in one county.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Explore the World Nelles Pocket: Florence – Fiesole, Prato, Pistoia, San Gimignano, Voltera, Siena|last=Bleek|first=Ulrike|publisher=Gunter Nelles|year=|isbn=|location=Munich|pages=13}}</ref>

===Second millennium===
[[File:Firenze-sanminiato01.jpg|thumb|right|The Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]]]
[[Hugh, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Hugo]] chose Florence as his residency instead of [[Lucca]] at about 1000&nbsp;AD. The [[Golden Age]] of Florentine art began around this time. In 1013, construction began on the Basilica di [[San Miniato al Monte]]. The exterior of the church was reworked in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] between 1059 and 1128. In 1100, Florence was a "[[Commune]]", meaning a city state. The city's primary resource was the [[Arno|Arno river]], providing power and access for the industry (mainly textile industry), and access to the Mediterranean sea for international trade. Another great source of strength was its industrious merchant community. The Florentine merchant banking skills became recognised in Europe after they brought decisive financial innovation (e.g. [[bills of exchange]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13484709|title=Cradle of capitalism|date=16 April 2009|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=16 October 2016}}</ref> [[double-entry bookkeeping system]]) to medieval fairs. This period also saw the eclipse of Florence's formerly powerful rival [[Pisa]] (defeated by [[Genoa]] in 1284 and subjugated by Florence in 1406), and the exercise of power by the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] elite following an anti-aristocratic movement, led by Giano della Bella, that resulted in a set of laws called the [[Ordinances of Justice]] (1293).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Edward|title=The Shadowy, Violent Perimeter: Dante Enters Florentine Political Life|date=1995|journal=Dante Studies, with the Annual Report of the Dante Society|number=113|pages=69–87|jstor=40166507}}</ref>

At the height of demographic expansion around 1325, the urban population may have been as great as 120,000, and the rural population around the city was probably close to 300,000.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Day |first1=W.R. |s2cid=161168875 |title=The population of Florence before the Black Death: survey and synthesis |journal=Journal of Medieval History |date=3 January 2012 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=93–129 |doi=10.1016/S0304-4181(02)00002-7}}</ref> The [[Black Death]] of 1348 reduced it by over half<!-- ~50,000 -->,<ref>"[http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/ Decameron Web, Boccaccio, Plague]".

After their suppression, Florence came under the sway (1382–1434) of the [[House of Albizzi|Albizzi]] family, who became bitter rivals of the Medici.

In the 15th century, Florence was among the largest cities in Europe with a population of 60,000 and was considered rich and economically successful.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pallanti, Giuseppe|title=Mona Lisa Revealed: The True Identity of Leonardo's Model|year=2006|publisher=Skira|location=Florence, Italy|pages=[https://archive.org/details/monalisarevealed00pall/page/17 17, 23, 24]|isbn=978-88-7624-659-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/monalisarevealed00pall/page/17}}</ref> [[Cosimo de' Medici]] was the first Medici family member to essentially control the city from behind the scenes. Although the city was technically a democracy of sorts, his power came from a vast [[patronage]] network along with his alliance to the new immigrants, the ''gente nuova'' (new people). The fact that the Medici were bankers to the pope also contributed to their ascendancy. Cosimo was succeeded by his son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], who was, soon after, succeeded by Cosimo's grandson, [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] in 1469. Lorenzo was a great patron of the arts, commissioning works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]. Lorenzo was an accomplished poet and musician and brought composers and singers to Florence, including [[Alexander Agricola]], [[Johannes Ghiselin]], and [[Heinrich Isaac]]. By contemporary Florentines (and since), he was known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent" (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

Following Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1492, he was succeeded by his son [[Piero II de' Medici|Piero&nbsp;II]]. When the French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles&nbsp;VIII]] invaded [[northern Italy]], Piero&nbsp;II chose to resist his army. But when he realised the size of the [[French Army|French army]] at the gates of Pisa, he had to accept the humiliating conditions of the French king. These made the Florentines rebel, and they expelled Piero&nbsp;II. With his exile in 1494, the first period of Medici rule ended with the restoration of a republican government.

====Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medici Popes====
[[File:Hanging and burning of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence.jpg|thumb|right|[[Girolamo Savonarola]] being burnt at the stake in 1498. The brooding [[Palazzo Vecchio]] is at centre right.]]
During this period, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] [[Girolamo Savonarola]] had become [[prior]] of the [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] monastery in 1490. He was famed for his penitential sermons, lambasting what he viewed as widespread immorality and attachment to material riches. He praised the exile of the Medici as the work of God, punishing them for their decadence. He seized the opportunity to carry through political reforms leading to a more democratic rule. But when Savonarola publicly accused [[Pope Alexander VI]] of corruption, he was banned from speaking in public. When he broke this ban, he was excommunicated. The Florentines, tired of his extreme teachings, turned against him and arrested him. He was convicted as a heretic and [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] on 23 May 1498.

A second individual of unusually acute insight was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], whose prescriptions for Florence's regeneration under strong leadership have often been seen as a legitimisation of political expediency and even malpractice. In other words, Machiavelli was a political thinker, perhaps most renowned for his political handbook, titled [[The Prince]], which is about ruling and the exercise of power. Commissioned by the Medici, Machiavelli also wrote the [[Florentine Histories]], the history of the city. Florentines drove out the Medici for a second time and re-established a republic on 16 May 1527. Restored twice with the support of both [[Emperor Charles V]] and [[Pope Clement VII]] (Giulio de Medici), the Medici in 1532 became hereditary dukes of Florence, and in 1569 [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], ruling for two centuries. In all Tuscany, only the Republic of Lucca (later a [[Duchy of Lucca|Duchy]]) and the Principality of [[Piombino]] were independent from Florence.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
[[File:Wenceslaus Werlin-Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and his family.jpg|thumb|[[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his family. Leopold was, from 1765 to 1790, the [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]] of Tuscany]]
The extinction of the Medici dynasty and the accession in 1737 of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], [[Lorraine (duchy)|duke of Lorraine]] and husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], led to Tuscany's temporary inclusion in the territories of the Austrian crown. It became a [[secundogeniture]] of the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] dynasty, who were deposed for the [[House of Bourbon-Parma]] in 1801. From 1801 to 1807 Florence was the capital of the [[Napoleon]]ic client state [[Kingdom of Etruria]]. The Bourbon-Parma were deposed in December 1807 when Tuscany was annexed by [[First French Empire|France]]. Florence was the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the French département of [[Arno (department)|Arno]] from 1808 to the fall of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in 1814. The Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was restored on the throne of Tuscany at the [[Congress of Vienna]] but finally deposed in 1859. Tuscany became a region of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

Florence replaced [[Turin]] as Italy's capital in 1865 and, in an effort to modernise the city, the old market in the Piazza del Mercato Vecchio and many medieval houses were pulled down and replaced by a more formal street plan with newer houses. The Piazza (first renamed Piazza [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele&nbsp;II]], then [[Piazza della Repubblica (Florence)|Piazza della Repubblica]], the present name) was significantly widened and a large triumphal arch was constructed at the west end. This development was unpopular and was prevented from continuing by the efforts of several British and American people living in the city.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A museum recording the destruction stands nearby today.

The country's second capital city was superseded by Rome six years later, after the withdrawal of the French troops allowed the [[capture of Rome]].

===20th century===
[[File:SanMiniatoAlMonte-Cimetiere.jpg|thumb|''Porte Sante'' cemetery, burial place of notable figures of Florentine history.]]
During [[World War II in Europe|World War II]] the city experienced a year-long German occupation (1943–1944) being part of the [[Italian Social Republic]]. Hitler declared it an [[open city]] on July 3, 1944 as troops of the [[British Eighth Army|British 8th Army]] closed in.<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2681509 July 3, 1944 newspaper archive]</ref> In early August, the retreating Germans decided to demolish all the bridges along the [[Arno]] linking the district of Oltrarno to the rest of the city, making it difficult for troops of the 8th Army to cross. However, at the last moment Charles Steinhauslin, at the time consul of 26 countries in Florence, convinced the German general in Italy that the [[Ponte Vecchio]] was not to be destroyed due to its historical value.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Instead, an equally historic area of streets directly to the south of the bridge, including part of the [[Vasari Corridor|Corridoio Vasariano]], was destroyed using mines. Since then the bridges have been restored to their original forms using as many of the remaining materials as possible, but the buildings surrounding the Ponte Vecchio have been rebuilt in a style combining the old with modern design. Shortly before leaving Florence, as they knew that they would soon have to retreat, the Germans executed many [[Tuscan Committee of National Liberation|freedom fighters]] and political opponents publicly, in streets and squares including the Piazza Santo Spirito.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Florence was liberated by [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand]], [[6th Armoured Division (South Africa)|South African]] and British troops on 4 August 1944 alongside partisans from the [[Tuscan Committee of National Liberation]] (CTLN). The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] soldiers who died driving the Germans from Tuscany are buried in cemeteries outside the city (Americans about {{convert|9|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} south of the city, British and Commonwealth soldiers a few kilometres east of the centre on the right bank of the Arno).

At the end of World War II in May 1945, the US Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilised American service men and women in Florence, Italy. The first American University for service personnel was established in June 1945 at the School of Aeronautics in Florence, Italy. Some 7,500 soldier-students were to pass through the University during its four one-month sessions (see [[G. I. American Universities]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://giuniversity.wordpress.com/florence/ |title=University Study Center, Florence « The GI University Project |publisher=Giuniversity.wordpress.com |date= 2010-07-04|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>

In November 1966, the [[1966 Flood of the River Arno in Florence|Arno flooded]] parts of the centre, damaging many art treasures. Around the city there are tiny placards on the walls noting where the flood waters reached at their highest point.

</gallery>

[[File:Florence City Council 2019.svg|thumb|right|250px|Seats in the Florence City Council <br>(2019–2024)]]
The legislative body of the [[Italian communes|municipality]] is the City Council (''Consiglio Comunale''), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Committee (''Giunta Comunale''), composed by 7 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]], that is nominated and presieded over by a directly elected [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor]]. The current mayor of Florence is [[Dario Nardella]].

The municipality of Florence is subdivided into five administrative Boroughs (''Quartieri''). Each Borough is governed by a Council (''Consiglio'') and a President, elected contextually to the city Mayor. The urban organisation is governed by the Italian Constitution (art. 114). The Boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition they are supplied with an autonomous founding in order to finance local activities. The Boroughs are:
* Q1 – [[Historic Centre of Florence|Centro storico]] (Historic Centre); population: 67,170;
* Q2 – [[Campo di Marte]]; population: 88,588;
* Q3 – Gavinana-[[Galluzzo]]; population: 40,907;
* Q4 – Isolotto-[[Legnaia]]; population: 66,636;
* Q5 – Rifredi; population: 103,761.

All of the five boroughs are governed by the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]].

The former Italian Prime Minister (2014–2016), [[Matteo Renzi]], served as mayor from 2009 to 2014.

[[File:Ponte Vecchio Firenze.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Vecchio]], which spans the [[Arno river]]]]
Florence is known as the "cradle of the Renaissance" (''la culla del Rinascimento'') for its monuments, churches, and buildings. The best-known site of Florence is the domed cathedral of the city, [[Florence Cathedral|Santa Maria del Fiore]], known as ''The Duomo'', whose dome was built by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. The nearby [[Campanile]] (partly designed by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]) and the [[Baptistery of Florence Cathedral|Baptistery]] buildings are also highlights. The dome, 600 years after its completion, is still the largest dome built in brick and mortar in the world.<ref>Ross King, ''Brunelleschi's Dome, The Story of the great Cathedral of Florence'', Penguin, 2001</ref> In 1982, the '''[[Historic Centre of Florence|historic centre of Florence]]''' (Italian: ''centro storico di Firenze'') was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by the [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Historic Centre of Florence – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/174|website = whc.unesco.org|accessdate = 8 July 2015|first = UNESCO|last = Centre}}</ref> The centre of the city is contained in [[Defensive wall|medieval walls]] that were built in the 14th century to defend the city. At the heart of the city, in [[Piazza della Signoria]], is [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]]'s [[Fountain of Neptune, Florence|Fountain of Neptune]] (1563–1565), which is a masterpiece of [[marble sculpture]] at the terminus of a still functioning Roman [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]].

The layout and structure of Florence in many ways harkens back to the Roman era, where it was designed as a [[garrison]] settlement.<ref name="britannica.com"/> Nevertheless, the majority of the city was built during the Renaissance.<ref name="britannica.com"/> Despite the strong presence of Renaissance architecture within the city, traces of [[medieval architecture|medieval]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] and [[modern architecture]] can be found. The [[Palazzo Vecchio]] as well as the Duomo, or the city's Cathedral, are the two buildings which dominate Florence's skyline.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

The river Arno, which cuts through the old part of the city, is as much a character in Florentine history as many of the people who lived there. Historically, the locals have had a love-hate relationship with the Arno – which alternated between nourishing the city with commerce, and destroying it by flood.
[[File:Cityscape of Florence in the Night.jpg|thumb|Florence at night from Piazzale Michelangelo]]
[[File:Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|alt=Palazzo Pitti|left|thumb|[[Palazzo Pitti]]]]
One of the bridges in particular stands out — the Ponte Vecchio (''Old Bridge''), whose most striking feature is the multitude of shops built upon its edges, held up by stilts. The bridge also carries [[Vasari Corridor|Vasari's elevated corridor]] linking the Uffizi to the Medici residence ([[Palazzo Pitti]]). Although the original bridge was constructed by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], the current bridge was rebuilt in the 14th century. It is the only bridge in the city to have survived World War&nbsp;II intact. It is the first example in the western world of a bridge built using segmental [[arch]]es, that is, arches less than a semicircle, to reduce both span-to-rise ratio and the numbers of pillars to allow lesser encumbrance in the riverbed (being in this much more successful than the Roman [[Alconétar Bridge]]).

[[File:Vechio Ponte Santa Trinita with the Oltrarno district.jpg|thumb|[[Ponte Santa Trinita]] with the [[Oltrarno]] district]]
The church of [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] contains the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici Chapel]], the [[mausoleum]] of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]—the most powerful family in Florence from the 15th to the 18th century. Nearby is the Uffizi Gallery, one of the finest art museums in the world – founded on a large bequest from the last member of the Medici family.
[[File:Florence Duomo from Michelangelo hill.jpg|thumb|left|Florence Duomo as seen from Michelangelo hill.]]
The Uffizi is located at the corner of [[Piazza della Signoria]], a site important for being the centre of Florence's civil life and government for centuries. The [[Palazzo della Signoria]] facing it is still home of the municipal government. Many significant episodes in the [[history of art]] and political changes were staged here, such as:
* In 1301, [[Dante Alighieri]] was sent into exile from here (commemorated by a plaque on one of the walls of the Uffizi).
* On 26 April 1478, [[Jacopo de' Pazzi]] and his retainers tried to raise the city against the Medici after the plot known as ''La congiura dei Pazzi'' (''[[Pazzi conspiracy|The Pazzi conspiracy]]''), murdering [[Giuliano de' Medici (1453–1478)|Giuliano di Piero de' Medici]] and wounding his brother Lorenzo. All the members of the plot who could be apprehended were seized by the Florentines and hanged from the windows of the palace.
* In 1497, it was the location of the [[Bonfire of the Vanities]] instigated by the Dominican friar and preacher [[Girolamo Savonarola]]
* On 23 May 1498, the same Savonarola and two followers were hanged and burnt at the stake. (A round plate in the ground marks the spot where he was hanged)
* In 1504, [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's David]] (now replaced by a replica, since the original was moved in 1873 to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]]) was installed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as Palazzo Vecchio).

The [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in Piazza della Signoria is the location of a number of statues by other sculptors such as [[Donatello]], [[Giambologna]], Ammannati and [[Benvenuto Cellini|Cellini]], although some have been replaced with copies to preserve the originals.

===Monuments, museums and religious buildings===
{{see also|List of churches in Florence|Theatres in Florence}}
[[File:Galeri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Piazzale degli Uffizi]]
Florence contains several palaces and buildings from various eras. The Palazzo Vecchio is the [[City and town halls|town hall]] of Florence and also an art museum. This large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Battlement|crenellated]] fortress-palace overlooks the [[Piazza della Signoria]] with its copy of Michelangelo's David statue as well as the gallery of statues in the adjacent [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. Originally called the ''Palazzo della Signoria'', after the [[Signoria of Florence]], the ruling body of the [[Republic of Florence]], it was also given several other names: ''Palazzo del Popolo'', ''Palazzo dei Priori'', and ''Palazzo Ducale'', in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno to the Palazzo Pitti. It is linked to the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti through the [[Corridoio Vasariano]].

[[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], designed by [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo]] for [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo il Vecchio]], of the Medici family, is another major edifice, and was built between 1445 and 1460. It was well known for its stone masonry that includes rustication and ashlar. Today it is the head office of the Metropolitan City of Florence and hosts museums and the [[Biblioteca Riccardiana|Riccardiana Library]]. The [[Palazzo Strozzi]], an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, was inspired by the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi|Palazzo Medici]], but with more harmonious proportions. Today the palace is used for international expositions like the annual antique show (founded as the Biennale dell'Antiquariato in 1959), fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events. Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]], with the library and reading room.<br />
There are several other notable places, including the [[Palazzo Rucellai]], designed by Leon Battista Alberti between 1446 and 1451 and executed, at least in part, by [[Bernardo Rossellino]]; the [[Palazzo Davanzati]], which houses the museum of the Old Florentine House; the [[Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali (Florence)|Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali]], designed in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style in 1871; the [[Palazzo Spini Feroni]], in [[Piazza Santa Trinita]], a historic 13th-century private palace, owned since the 1920s by shoe-designer [[Salvatore Ferragamo]]; as well as various others, including the Palazzo Borghese, the Palazzo di Bianca Cappello, the [[Palazzo Antinori]], and the Royal building of Santa Maria Novella.<ref>Travel in Tuscany.

The [[Vasari Corridor]] is another gallery, built connecting the Palazzo Vecchio with the Pitti Palace passing by the Uffizi and over the Ponte Vecchio. The Galleria dell'Accademia houses a Michelangelo collection, including the [[David (Michelangelo)|David]]. It has a collection of Russian icons and works by various artists and painters. Other museums and galleries include the [[Bargello]], which concentrates on sculpture works by artists including Donatello, [[Giambologna]] and [[Michelangelo]]; the Palazzo Pitti, containing part of the Medici family's former private collection. In addition to the Medici collection, the palace's galleries contain many Renaissance works, including several by [[Raphael]] and [[Titian]], large collections of costumes, ceremonial carriages, silver, porcelain and a [[Palazzo Pitti#Gallery of Modern Art|gallery of modern art]] dating from the 18th century. Adjoining the palace are the [[Boboli Gardens]], elaborately landscaped and with numerous sculptures.

In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Florence grew by 3.22 percent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo.istat.it/bil2007/index.html |title=Statistiche demografiche ISTAT |publisher=Demo.istat.it |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> The [[birth rate]] of Florence is 7.66 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

==Economy==
Tourism is, by far, the most important of all industries and most of the Florentine economy relies on the money generated by international arrivals and students studying in the city.<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210642/Florence# |title=Florence (Italy) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> The value tourism to the city totalled some €2.5&nbsp;billion in 2015 and the number of visitors had increased by 5.5% from the previous year.<ref name="theflorentine.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/news/2016/05/florence-economy-double-nations/|title=Economy of Florence twice the national average – The Florentine|date=27 May 2016|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>

In 2013, Florence was listed as the second best world city by ''Condé Nast Traveler''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/16/travel/cn-traveler-top-cities/ |title=The world best cities are... |publisher=CNN |date= 16 October 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>

Manufacturing and commerce, however, still remain highly important. Florence is also Italy's 17th richest city in terms of average workers' earnings, with the figure being €23,265 (the overall city's income is €6,531,204,473), coming after [[Mantua]], yet surpassing [[Bolzano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/speciali/redditi_comuni_08/ |title=La classifica dei redditi nei comuni capoluogo di provincia |publisher=Il Sole 24 ORE |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>

===Industry, commerce and services===
Florence is a major production and commercial centre in Italy, where the Florentine industrial complexes in the suburbs produce all sorts of goods, from furniture, rubber goods, chemicals, and food.<ref name="britannica.com"/> However, traditional and local products, such as antiques, handicrafts, glassware, leatherwork, art reproductions, jewellery, souvenirs, elaborate metal and iron-work, shoes, accessories and high fashion clothes also dominate a fair sector of Florence's economy.<ref name="britannica.com"/> The city's income relies partially on services and commercial and cultural interests, such as annual fairs, theatrical and lyrical productions, art exhibitions, festivals and fashion shows, such as the [[Calcio Fiorentino]]. Heavy industry and machinery also take their part in providing an income. In Nuovo Pignone, numerous factories are still present, and small-to medium industrial businesses are dominant. The Florence-Prato-Pistoia industrial districts and areas were known as the 'Third Italy' in the 1990s, due to the exports of high-quality goods and automobile (especially the [[Vespa]]) and the prosperity and productivity of the Florentine entrepreneurs. Some of these industries even rivalled the traditional industrial districts in [[Emilia–Romagna|Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Veneto]] due to high profits and productivity.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

In the fourth quarter of 2015, manufacturing increased by 2.4% and exports increased by 7.2%. Leading sectors included mechanical engineering, fashion, pharmaceutics, food and wine. During 2015, permanent employment contracts increased by 48.8 percent, boosted by nationwide tax break.<ref name="theflorentine.net"/>

===Tourism===
[[File:Florencja Il Porcelino RB.jpg|thumb|left|Tourists flock to the [[Porcellino|Fontana del Porcellino]].]]
Tourism is the most significant industry in central Florence. From April to October, tourists outnumber local population. Tickets to the Uffizi and Accademia museums are regularly sold out and large groups regularly fill the basilicas of [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]] and [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella|Santa Maria Novella]], both of which charge for entry. Tickets for The Uffizi and Accademia can be purchased online prior to visiting.<ref>{{cite web|title = Florence, Italy: Tourist Travel Guide for Holidays in Florence, Firenze, Italy|url = http://www.visitflorence.com/|website = www.visitflorence.com|accessdate = 28 September 2015}}</ref> In 2010, readers of ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' magazine ranked the city as their third favourite tourist destination.<ref name="travelandleisure.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/worldsbest/2010/cities |title=Travel + Leisure |publisher=Travelandleisure.com |accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In 2015, Condé Nast Travel readers voted Florence as the best city in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-07-01/best-things-to-do-in-florence-italy |title=15 Best Things to Do in Florence, Italy |website=Cntraveler.com |accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>

Studies by Euromonitor International have concluded that cultural and history-oriented tourism is generating significantly increased spending throughout Europe.<ref>[http://www.euromonitor.com/Tourists_spend_more_than_ever_before_on_cultural_destinations Tourists spend more than ever before on cultural destinations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209035854/http://www.euromonitor.com/Tourists_spend_more_than_ever_before_on_cultural_destinations |date=9 February 2010 }} (for 2004–2005) at Euromonitor International</ref>

Tourism brings revenue to Florence, but also creates certain problems. The Ponte Vecchio, The [[Mercato Centrale (Florence)|San Lorenzo Market]] and Santa Maria Novella are plagued by pickpockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourcoffeebreak.co.uk/lifestyle/26338763698/where-in-europe-are-you-most-likely-to-be-a-victim-of-pickpocketing/|title=Where in Europe are you Most Likely to be a Victim of Pickpocketing?|website=Yourcoffeebreak.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The province of Florence receives roughly 13&nbsp;million visitors per year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism-review.com/florence-a-record-year-for-the-tourism-industry-news4438|title=Florence: A Record Year for the Tourism Industry – .TR|first=Bill Alen|last=Bill.Alen@tourism-review.com|website=Tourism-review.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> and in peak seasons, popular locations may become overcrowded as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20160718/italys-holiday-hotspots-struggling-with-too-many-tourists|title=Italian hotspots struggling with 'too many tourists'|date=18 July 2016|website=Thelocal.it|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> In 2015, Mayor Dario Nardella expressed concern concern over visitors who arrive on buses, stay only a few hours, spend little money but contribute significantly to overcrowding. "No museum visit, just a photo from the square, the bus back and then on to Venice... We don’t want tourists like that," he said.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/06/florence-risk-tourists-buildings|title=Florence seeks a better class of tourist to share its besieged medieval treasures|first=Stephanie|last=Kirchgaessner|date=6 December 2015|accessdate=28 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

Some tourists are less than respectful of the city's cultural heritage, according to Nardella. In June 2017, he instituted a programme of spraying church steps with water to prevent tourists from using such areas as picnic spots. While he values the benefits of tourism, he claims that there has been "an increase among those who  sit down on church steps, eat their food and leave rubbish strewn on them," he explained.<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/31/florence-mayor-dario-nardella-hosepipes-basilica-santa-croce|title=Florence mayor aims to keep picnicking tourists at bay with hosepipes|first=Angela|last=Giuffrida|date=31 May 2017|accessdate=28 October 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> To boost the sale of traditional foods, the mayor had introduced legislation (enacted in 2016) that requires restaurants to use typical Tuscan products and rejected McDonald's application to open a location in the  Piazza del Duomo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/florence-church-tourists-water-wet-hose-santa-croce-basilica-picnics-eating-food-italy-a7767111.html|title=Florence is hosing down monuments to deter tourists|date=1 June 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>

===Food and wine production===
[[File:Fiaschi of basic Chianti.jpg|right|thumb|''Fiaschi'' of basic Chianti.]]
Food and wine have long been an important staple of the economy. The [[Chianti (region)|Chianti region]] is just south of the city, and its [[Sangiovese]] grapes figure prominently not only in its [[Chianti|Chianti Classico]] wines but also in many of the more recently developed Supertuscan blends. Within {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}} to the west is the Carmignano area, also home to flavourful sangiovese-based reds. The celebrated Chianti Rufina district, geographically and historically separated from the main Chianti region, is also few kilometres east of Florence. More recently, the Bolgheri region (about {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest of Florence) has become celebrated for its "[[Super Tuscan]]" reds such as [[Sassicaia]] and [[Ornellaia]].<ref name=OCW-bol>{{cite web|last=Oxford Companion to Wine |title=Bolgheri |url=http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=369 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808193907/https://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=369 |archivedate=8 August 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>

[[File:Uffizi Hallway.jpg|thumb|The [[Uffizi]] are the 10th most visited art museum in the world.]]
Florentine architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1466) and Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) were among the fathers of both Renaissance and [[Neoclassical architecture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Why-Was-Florence-Considered-Important-For-74009.html |title=Why Was Florence Considered Important For Culture And Arts? – Essay – Michellekim |publisher=StudyMode.com |accessdate=14 March 2010}}</ref>

The cathedral, topped by Brunelleschi's dome, dominates the Florentine skyline. The Florentines decided to start building it – late in the 13th century, without a design for the dome. The project proposed by Brunelleschi in the 14th century was the largest ever built at the time, and the first major dome built in Europe since the two great domes of Roman times – the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome, and [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]. The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore remains the largest brick construction of its kind in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tripleman.com/index.php?showimage=737 |title=The Duomo of Florence &#124; Tripleman |publisher=www.tripleman.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunelleschisdome.com/ |title=brunelleschi's dome – Brunelleschi's Dome |publisher=Brunelleschisdome.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> In front of it is the medieval Baptistery. The two buildings incorporate in their decoration the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. In recent years, most of the important works of art from the two buildings – and from the nearby [[Giotto's Campanile]], have been removed and replaced by copies. The originals are now housed in the Museum dell'Opera del Duomo, just to the east of the cathedral.

Florence has large numbers of art-filled churches, such as San Miniato al Monte, San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Santa Maria del Carmine, Santa Croce, Santo Spirito, the Annunziata, Ognissanti and numerous others.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

Artists associated with Florence range from [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Paolo Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Donatello and Massaccio and the della Robbia family; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Others include Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Filippo Lippi, Bernardo Buontalenti, Orcagna, Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, the Rossellis, the Sangallos, and Pontormo.

===Language===
{{Main|Florentine dialect}}
{{See also|Tuscan language}}

Florentine (''fiorentino''), spoken by inhabitants of Florence and its environs, is a [[Tuscan Language|Tuscan dialect]] and the immediate [[Proto-language|parent language]] to modern Italian.

Although its vocabulary and pronunciation are largely identical to standard Italian, differences do exist. The ''Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo'' (Dictionary of Modern Florentine) reveals [[Lexicon (linguistics)|lexical]] distinctions from all walks of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vocabolariofiorentino.it/contenuti/introduzione|title=Vocabolario del fiorentino contemporaneo|trans-title=Dictionary of Contemporary Florentine|publisher=Accademia della Crusca|language=Italian|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref> Florentines have a highly recognisable accent in phonetic terms due to the so-called [[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]): "hard ''c''" {{IPAslink|k}} between two vowels is pronounced as a [[Voiceless glottal fricative|fricative]] {{IPAblink|h}} similar to an English ''h'', so that ''dico'' 'I say' is phonetically {{IPA-itdia|ˈdiːho|}}, ''i cani'' 'the dogs' is {{IPA-itdia|iˈhaːni|}}. Similarly, ''t'' between vowels is pronounced {{IPAblink|θ}} as in English ''thin'', and ''p'' in the same position is the [[bilabial]] fricative {{IPAblink|ɸ}}. Other traits include using a form of the [[subjunctive mood]] last commonly used in medieval times,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} a frequent usage in everyday speech of the modern subjunctive, and a shortened pronunciation of the [[article (grammar)|definite article]], {{IPAblink|i}} instead of "il", causing [[gemination|doubling]] of the consonant that follows, so that ''il cane'' 'the dog', for example, is pronounced {{IPA-itdia|ikˈkaːne|}}.

Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular<ref name="florenceholidays.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceholidays.com/florence-vacation-literature-in-florence.html |title=Literature in Florence, Florentine Writers and Poets |publisher=Florenceholidays.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> instead of the Latin used for most literary works at the time.

===Literature===
[[File:Decamaron intro.jpg|thumb|The introduction of the ''Decameron'' (1350–1353) by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].]]
Despite Latin being the main language of the courts and the Church in the Middle Ages, writers such as Dante Alighieri<ref name="florenceholidays.com"/> and many others used their own language, the Florentine vernacular descended from Latin, in composing their greatest works. The oldest literary pieces written in Florentine go as far back as the 13th century. Florence's literature fully blossomed in the 14th century, when not only Dante with his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (1306–1321) and Petrarch, but also poets such as [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and [[Lapo Gianni]] composed their most important works.<ref name="florenceholidays.com"/> Dante's masterpiece is the ''Divine Comedy'', which mainly deals with the poet himself taking an allegoric and moral tour of Hell, Purgatory and finally Heaven, during which he meets numerous mythological or real characters of his age or before. He is first guided by the Roman poet [[Virgil]], whose non-Christian beliefs damned him to Hell.

All of this is written in a series of 100 distinct novellas.<ref name="florenceholidays"/>

In the 16th century, during the Renaissance, Florence was the home town of political writer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, whose ideas on how rulers should govern the land, detailed in ''The Prince'', spread across European courts and enjoyed enduring popularity for centuries. These principles became known as ''Machiavellianism''.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Florence}}
{{See also|Music of Tuscany}}
[[File:Teatro della Pergola, Firenze 1.JPG|thumb|The Teatro della Pergola.]]
Florence became a musical centre during the Middle Ages and music and the performing arts remain an important part of its culture. The growth of Northern Italian Cities in the 1500s likely contributed to its increased prominence. During the Renaissance, there were four kinds of musical patronage in the city with respect to both sacred and secular music: state, corporate, church, and private. It was here that the [[Florentine Camerata]] convened in the mid-16th century and experimented with setting tales of Greek mythology to music and staging the result—in other words, the first operas, setting the wheels in motion not just for the further development of the operatic form, but for later developments of separate "classical" forms such as the symphony and concerto.  After the year 1600, Italian trends prevailed across Europe, by 1750 it was the primary musical language. The genre of the [[Madrigal]], born in Italy, gained popularity in Britain and elsewhere. Several Italian cities were "larger on the musical map than their real-size for power suggested. Florence, was once such city which experienced a fantastic period in the early seventeenth Century of musico-theatrical innovation, including the beginning and flourishing of opera.<ref name="Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182">.Hanning, Barbara Russano, J. Peter Burkholder, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. Concise History of Western Music. New York: W.W. Norton, 2010.pg. 182.</ref>

Opera was invented in Florence in the late 16th century when Jacobo Peri's ''Dafne'' an opera in the style of [[monody]], was premiered.  Opera spread from Florence throughout Italy and eventually Europe.  Vocal Music in the choir setting was also taking new identity at this time.  At the beginning of the 17th century, two practices for writing music were devised, one the first practice or ''[[Prima pratica|Stile Antico]]/Prima Prattica'' the other the ''[[Stile Moderno]]/Seconda Prattica''.  The Stile Antico was more prevalent in Northern Europe and Stile Moderno was practiced more by the Italian Composers of the time.<ref>Grout, Donald Jay, Donald Jay Grout, and Claude V. Palisca. A History of Western Music. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1973.</ref>

Composers and musicians who have lived in Florence include Piero Strozzi (1550 – after 1608), Giulio Caccini (1551–1618) and Mike Francis (1961–2009). Giulio Caccini's book ''Le Nuove Musiche'' was significant in performance practice technique instruction at the time.<ref name="Hanning, Barbara Russano 2010. pg. 182"/>  The book specified a new term, in use by the 1630s, called [[monody]] which indicated the combination of voice and [[basso continuo]] and connoted a practice of stating text in a free, lyrical, yet speech-like manner.  This would occur while an instrument, usually a keyboard type such as [[harpsichord]], played and held chords while the singer sang/spoke the monodic line.<ref>Bonds, Mark E., Etd. Kassell, Richard.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Bistecca alla fiorentina-01.jpg|thumb|Florentine steak in Florence]]
Florentine food grows out of a tradition of peasant eating rather than rarefied high cooking. The majority of dishes are based on meat. The whole animal was traditionally eaten; [[tripe]] (''trippa'') and stomach (''[[lampredotto]]'') were once regularly on the menu and still are sold at the food carts stationed throughout the city. [[Antipasto|Antipasti]] include ''crostini toscani'', sliced bread rounds topped with a chicken liver-based [[pâté]], and sliced meats (mainly [[prosciutto]] and [[salame]], often served with melon when in season). The typically saltless Tuscan bread, obtained with natural [[levain]] frequently features in Florentine courses, especially in its soups, ''[[ribollita]]'' and ''[[pappa al pomodoro]]'', or in the salad of bread and fresh vegetables called ''[[panzanella]]'' that is served in summer. The ''[[T-bone steak|bistecca alla fiorentina]]'' is a large (the customary size should weigh around {{convert|1.2|to|1.5|kg|oz|-1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) – the "date" steak – [[T-bone steak]] of [[Chianina]] beef cooked over hot charcoal and served very rare with its more recently derived version, the ''tagliata'', sliced rare beef served on a bed of [[Eruca sativa|arugula]], often with slices of [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] on top. Most of these courses are generally served with local [[olive oil]], also a prime product enjoying a worldwide reputation.<ref>{{cite web|author=welcometuscany.it|url=http://www.welcometuscany.it/special_interest/wine_food_olive_oil/olive_oil.htm |title=Tuscany italy tuscany tourists guide, travel tips extra virgin olive oil wines and foods of the most beautiful land in the world |publisher=welcometuscany.it |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref> <br/>Among the desserts, ''schiacciata alla fiorentina'', a white flatbread cake, is one of the most popular; it is a very soft cake, prepared with extremely simple ingredients, typical of Florentine cuisine, and is especially eaten at [[Carnival]].

===Science and discovery===
[[File:Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze - paleontology.JPG|thumb|left|A display of [[proboscidean]]s in the [[Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze]], or the Natural History Museum of Florence]]
Florence has been an important scientific centre for centuries, notably during the Renaissance with scientists such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Florentines were one of the driving forces behind the [[Age of Discovery]]. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]], a student of Brunelleschi, that [[Christopher Columbus]] used to sell his "enterprise" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he used on his first voyage. Mercator's "Projection" is a refined version of Toscanelli's, taking the Americas into account.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and other scientific disciplines. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for modern scientific understanding.

===Fashion===

[[File:Via de Tornabuoni 07.JPG|thumb|Luxury boutiques along Florence's prestigious Via de' Tornabuoni.]]

By the year 1300 Florence had become a centre of textile production in Europe. Many of the rich families in Renaissance Florence were major purchasers of locally produced fine clothing, and the specialists of fashion in the economy and culture of Florence during that period is often underestimated.<ref>Frick, Carole Collier. ''Dressing Renaissance Florence: Families, Fortunes, and Fine Clothing''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002.</ref> Florence is regarded by some as the birthplace and earliest centre of the modern (post World War Two) fashion industry in Italy. The Florentine "soirées" of the early 1950s organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini were events where several Italian designers participated in group shows and first garnered international attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgiorgini.it/italianfashion.htm |title=The birth of italian fashion |publisher=Gbgiorgini.it |date= |accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref> Florence has served as the home of the Italian fashion company [[Salvatore Ferragamo Italia S.p.A.|Salvatore Ferragamo]] since 1928. [[Gucci]], [[Roberto Cavalli]], and [[Emilio Pucci]] are also headquartered in Florence. Other major players in the fashion industry such as [[Prada]] and [[Chanel]] have large offices and stores in Florence or its outskirts. Florence's main upscale shopping street is [[Via de' Tornabuoni]], where major luxury fashion houses and jewellery labels, such as [[Armani]] and [[Bulgari]], have their elegant boutiques. Via del Parione and Via Roma are other streets that are also well known for their high-end fashion stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/guides/europe/italy/florence/where-to-shop |title=Conde Nast Traveller's guide to shopping in Florence |publisher=Cntraveller.com |date= |accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>

===Historical evocations===

====''Scoppio del Carro''====
The ''[[Scoppio del carro|Scoppio del Carro]]'' ("Explosion of the Cart") is a celebration of the [[First Crusade]]. During the day of Easter, a cart, which the Florentines call the ''Brindellone'' and which is led by four white oxen, is taken to the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] between the Baptistery of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] (''Battistero di San Giovanni'') and the [[Florence Cathedral]] (''Santa Maria del Fiore''). The cart is connected by a rope to the interior of the church. Near the cart there is a model of a dove, which, according to legend, is a symbol of good luck for the city: at the end of the Easter mass, the dove emerges from the nave of the Duomo and ignites the fireworks on the cart.

====''Calcio Storico''====
[[File:Calcio Storico Corteo.jpg|thumb|Calcio Storico]]
{{See also|Calcio Fiorentino}}

''Calcio Storico Fiorentino'' ("Historic Florentine [[Association football|Football]]"), sometimes called ''Calcio in costume'', is a traditional sport, regarded as a forerunner of soccer, though the actual gameplay most closely resembles rugby. The event originates from the [[Middle Ages]], when the most important Florentine nobles amused themselves playing while wearing bright costumes. The most important match was played on 17 February 1530, during the [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|siege of Florence]]. That day [[Papal States|Papal troops]] besieged the city while the Florentines, with contempt of the enemies, decided to play the game notwithstanding the situation. The game is played in the Piazza di [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. A temporary arena is constructed, with bleachers and a sand-covered playing field. A series of matches are held between four teams representing each ''quartiere ''(quarter) of Florence during late June and early July.<ref>[http://www.calciostorico.it/ Calcio Storico Fiorentino (Official site)] {{in lang|it}}</ref> There are four teams: Azzurri (light blue), Bianchi (white), Rossi (red) and Verdi (green). The Azzurri are from the quarter of Santa Croce, Bianchi from the quarter of Santo Spirito, Verdi are from San Giovanni and Rossi from Santa Maria Novella.

==Transportation==
{{See also|Trams in Florence}}

=== Cars ===
The centre of Florence is closed to through-traffic, although buses, taxis and residents with appropriate permits are allowed in. This area is commonly referred to as the ZTL (''Zona Traffico Limitato''), which is divided into several subsections.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.italyperfect.com/blog/the-ztl-avoid-restricted-traffic-zones-fines-in-italy.html|title=The ZTL – Avoid Restricted Traffic Zones & Fines in Italy – Italy Perfect Travel Blog|date=2015-06-16|work=Italy Perfect Travel Blog|access-date=2018-02-03|language=en-US}}</ref> Residents of one section, therefore, will only be able to drive in their district and perhaps some surrounding ones. Cars without permits are allowed to enter after 7.30&nbsp;pm, or before 7.30&nbsp;am. The rules shift during the tourist-filled summers, putting more restrictions on where one can get in and out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.florence-on-line.com/maps-of-florence/florence-driving-map-ztl.html|title=Florence Driving Map, the ZTL explained : Florence On Line|website=www.florence-on-line.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}</ref>

[[File:Tramvia firenze sirio.jpg|thumb|right|[[List of town tramway systems in Italy|Tramway]] [[Sirio]] in Florence]]
[[File:Firenze - mappa rete tranviaria.png|thumb|Route map of the tramway]]

The principal public transit network in the city is run by the [http://www.ataf.net/Default.aspx?LN=en-US ATAF and Li-nea] bus company. Individual tickets, or a pass called Carta Agile with multiple rides, are purchased in advance and must be validated once on board. These tickets may be used on ATAF and Li-nea buses, Tramvia and second-class local trains only within city railway stations. Train tickets must be validated before boarding. The main bus station is next to Santa Maria Novella [[railway station]]. [[Trenitalia]] runs trains between the railway stations within the city, and to other destinations around Italy and Europe. The central railway station, [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]], is about {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} northwest of the Piazza del Duomo. There are two other important stations: [[Firenze Campo di Marte railway station|Campo di Marte]] and [[Firenze Rifredi railway station|Rifredi]]. Most bundled routes are Firenze—Pisa, Firenze—Viareggio and Firenze-Arezzo (along the main line to Rome). Other local railways connect Florence with [[Borgo San Lorenzo]] in the Mugello area (Faentina railway) and [[Siena]].

Long distance {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} buses are run by the SITA, Copit, and CAP companies. The transit companies also accommodate travellers from the [[Amerigo Vespucci Airport]], which is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the city centre, and which has scheduled services run by major European carriers.

=== Trams ===
{{Main|Trams in Florence}}
In an effort to reduce air pollution and car traffic in the city, a multi-line tram network called ''Tramvia'' is under construction. The first line began operation on 14 February 2010 and connects Florence's primary intercity railway station ([[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]]) with the southwestern suburb of [[Scandicci]]. This line is {{convert|7.4|km|1|abbr=on}} long and has 14 stops. The construction of a second line began on 5 November 2011, construction was stopped due to contractors' difficulties and restarted in 2014 with the new line opening on February 11, 2019. This second line connects Florence's airport with the city centre. A third line (from [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella]] to the Careggi area, where the most important hospitals of Florence are located) is also under construction.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arriva La Tramvia (in Italian)|url=http://www.gestramvia.it/home.html|publisher=GEST|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |title=Tramvia – Il Sistema Tramviario Fiorentino |accessdate=11 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202152941/http://www.comune.firenze.it/opencms/export/sites/retecivica/amm/piani_e_progetti/Tramvia.html |archivedate=2 February 2012 }}, Tramvia page of Florence's city government web site (in Italian).</ref><ref>[[Trams in Florence]], Wikipedia article "Florence tramway"</ref>{{circular reference|date=August 2020}}
