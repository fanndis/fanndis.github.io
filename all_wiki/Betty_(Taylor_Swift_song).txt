"'''Betty'''" (stylized in [[Letter case#All lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], from her eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'', which was released on July 24, 2020, through [[Republic Records]]. As the fourteenth track on the album, it was written by Swift and [[Joe Alwyn]] (under the pseudonym William Bowery), and was produced by Swift, [[Aaron Dessner]] and [[Jack Antonoff]]. It impacted [[country radio]] as a single on August 17, 2020. "Betty" is a [[country]] and [[folk rock]] tune steered by a [[harpsichord]] and a variety of guitars, with a dominant [[harmonica]] intertwining throughout. Lyrically, it depicts James apologizing to Betty for his [[infidelity]]; James and Betty are two of the three core characters involved in a fictitious [[love triangle]] described in ''Folklore.''

Upon release, "Betty" received widespread acclaim from [[music critics]], who welcomed Swift's return to her country roots and praised the song's [[storytelling]] and [[key change]]. The song debuted at number 6 on [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Songs]] chart, and number 42 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], scoring Swift her twenty-second top-10 hit on the former. Elsewhere, the song reached the top-40 in Australia, Canada and Singapore. "Betty" received its debut performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry House]] as part of the [[55th Academy of Country Music Awards]] on September 16, 2020; this live version was released to all music platforms the next day.

"Betty" is the only song on ''Folklore'' that involves both the producers Swift picked for the album—[[Jack Antonoff]] and [[Aaron Dessner]]—every other track was either produced by Antonoff or Dessner. For the song's sound, Swift used [[Bob Dylan]]'s albums ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963) and ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967) as reference points.<ref name="DessnerRS">{{cite magazine|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=July 24, 2020|title=How Aaron Dessner and Taylor Swift Stripped Down Her Sound on 'Folklore'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/aaron-dessner-taylor-swift-interview-folklore-1033870/|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729093538/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/aaron-dessner-taylor-swift-interview-folklore-1033870/|archive-date=July 29, 2020|accessdate=July 31, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="DessnerVulture">{{cite web|last=Gerber|first=Brady|date=July 27, 2020|title=The Story Behind Every Song on Taylor Swift's folklore|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/taylor-swift-folklore-aaron-dessner-breaks-down-every-song.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728234347/https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/taylor-swift-folklore-aaron-dessner-breaks-down-every-song.html|archive-date=July 28, 2020|access-date=July 29, 2020|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}</ref> William Bowery, who is also credited as a songwriter, appears to have no online presence, and was presumed to be a [[pseudonym]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=July 23, 2020|title=Hear Taylor Swift's New Album 'Folklore'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|magazine=Rolling Stone|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725062452/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|archive-date=July 25, 2020|accessdate=July 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=July 23, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Was Bummed About Her Summer Plans Not Panning Out, So She's Releasing A New Album...

Like the majority of ''Folklore'', "Betty" displays vivid [[storytelling]].<ref name=":2" /> It is one of the three tracks on the album that depicts a fictitious storyline, what Swift refers to as the "teenage [[love triangle]]", along with "[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]" and "August". These three tracks narrate the story of the same love triangle from the perspectives of each of the characters involved, at different times in their lives.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaplan|first=Ilana|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Is at Her Most Emotionally Raw On Surprise New Album 'Folklore'|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/taylor-swift-folklore|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725223013/https://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/article/taylor-swift-folklore|archive-date=July 25, 2020|access-date=July 27, 2020|website=[[British Vogue]]|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name="Rolling Stone" /> "Betty" is the tale from the perspective of the cheating boyfriend James, whose girlfriend is Betty, as he involves himself in a "summer fling" with the unnamed female narrator of "August". Therefore, James debates "show[ing] up" at Betty's party to reconcile with her. He apologizes about his past mistakes but does not fully own up to them, citing his [[agoraphobia]] and Betty's "wandering eye" as excuses.<ref name="Carson">{{cite web|last=Carsom|first=Sarah|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift, Folklore, review: a dazzling, timeless surprise album|url=https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724041853/https://inews.co.uk/culture/music/taylor-swift-folklore-review-dazzling-timeless-surprise-new-eighth-album-folk-cardigan-lyrics-561733|archive-date=July 24, 2020|accessdate=July 24, 2020|website=[[i (newspaper)|i]]}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{cite web|last=Antar|first=Adam|date=July 24, 2020|title=Folklore: a review and analysis of Taylor Swift's new surprise eighth album|url=https://medium.com/@adamantar/folklore-a-review-and-analysis-of-taylor-swifts-new-surprise-eighth-album-5e28140f0abb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 27, 2020|website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]|language=en}}</ref>

"Betty" has been described as a [[Country music|country]] and [[folk rock]] tune,<ref name=":7" /> propelled by an interlacing [[harmonica]], a multitude of guitars: [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]], [[Electric guitar|electric]], [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]], [[Lap steel guitar|lap steel]], [[High-string guitar|high string]] and [[Bass guitar|bass]] guitars,<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Leaves Her Comfort Zones Behind on the Head-Spinning, Heartbreaking 'Folklore'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/taylor-swift-leaves-her-comfort-zones-behind-on-the-head-spinning-heart-breaking-folklore-1033533/|accessdate=July 24, 2020|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-date=July 24, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724155901/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/taylor-swift-leaves-her-comfort-zones-behind-on-the-head-spinning-heart-breaking-folklore-1033533/|url-status=live}}</ref> and other instruments such as a [[harpsichord]], [[vibraphone]], [[saxophone]]s, [[drum]]s, [[Percussion instrument|percussions]], [[Mellotron]] and a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]]. Swift explained the song as follows:

{{Quote|text=[James] has lost the love of his life basically and doesn't understand how to get it back. [...] This is a song that I wrote from the perspective of a 17-year-old boy. I've always loved that in music you can kinda slip into different identities and you can sing from other people's perspectives. So that's what I did on this one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-talks-betty-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-daughter/|last=Mizoguchi|first=Karen|date=August 6, 2020|title=Taylor Swift on Blake Lively's Daughter in 'Betty': 'I Named the Characters After My Friends' Kids'|accessdate=August 6, 2020|website=[[People (magazine)|People]]|archive-date=August 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807022801/https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-talks-betty-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-daughter/|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Written in the key of [[C major]], "Betty" has a moderate [[tempo]] of 96 beats per minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Key & BPM for betty by Taylor Swift|url=https://tunebat.com/Info/betty-Taylor-Swift/5kI4eCXXzyuIUXjQra0Cxi|access-date=August 11, 2020|website=TuneBat}}</ref> Swift's vocals in the song span between a range of G<sub>3</sub> to G<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift "betty" Sheet Music in C major|url=https://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0214786|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 14, 2020|website=Musicnotes.com}}</ref> The lyrical structure of "Betty" is characterized by a dramatic shift from the verses' [[past tense]], to a [[conditional mood]] in the chorus, and to the [[present tense]] in the climax,<ref name=":2" /> where a [[key change]] occurs between its [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] and final chorus.<ref name=":5" /> Inez is an additional character named in the song, who is portrayed as a [[Gossipping|gossiping]] neighbor. James confesses that, even though Betty does not usually believe Inez because her gossips are mostly false, Inez is right this time about him. The characters—James, Betty and Inez—are named after the daughters of actors [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Blake Lively]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Igoe|first=Katherine J.|date=August 7, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Talks Using Blake Lively & Ryan Reynolds' Kids' Names for 'Folklore'|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a33544742/taylor-swift-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-betty-folklore/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 26, 2020|website=[[Marie Claire]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

Due to the lack of mention of James's gender anywhere in the album, "Betty" is also interpreted as a [[queer]] anthem.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Kircher|first=Madison Malone|date=July 24, 2020|title=Taylor Swift's 'betty' Is Queer Canon.

I have my own ideas. I also know where Taylor's heart is, and I think that's great anytime a song takes on greater meaning for anyone".<ref name="DessnerVulture" />
