==History==

Among the first teachers were R.W. Gunnison, Miss Augusta Meacham, and George A. Follansbee."<ref>{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofcookcou02good | title = History of Cook County, Illinois | editor1-first = Weston B. | editor1-last = Goodspeed | editor2-first = Daniel D. | editor2-last = Healy | volume = 2 | publisher = Goodspeed Historical Association | location = Chicago | year = 1909 | accessdate = 2019-03-26 | page = [https://archive.org/details/historyofcookcou02good/page/272 272] }}</ref>
