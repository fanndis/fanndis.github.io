The '''2011 FIFA Women's World Cup''' was the sixth [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] competition, the world championship for [[List of women's national association football teams|women's national]] [[association football]] teams. It was held from 26 June to 17 July 2011 in Germany, which won the right to host the event in October 2007. [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] won the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final|final]] against the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]] on a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] following a 2–2 draw after [[Extra time (association football)|extra time]] and became the first [[Asian Football Confederation|Asian]] team to win a senior FIFA World Cup in what was considered as the greatest giant-killing in the world's football history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/matches/round=255989/match=300144437/summary.html |title=Japan edge USA for maiden title |date=17 July 2011 |work=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref><ref>https://www.thenationalnews.com/sport/japan-hold-their-nerve-on-penalties-to-lift-women-s-world-cup-1.593362</ref>

The matches were played in nine stadiums in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the [[Commerzbank Arena]] in [[Frankfurt]]. Sixteen teams were selected for participation via a [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|worldwide qualification tournament]] that began in 2009. In the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup#Group stage|first round]] of the tournament finals, the teams competed in [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These eight teams advanced to the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]], where two rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.

==Host selection==
[[File:2011WWC-candidates.png|thumb|right|180px|Six original candidates]]
Six nations, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Peru and Switzerland, initially declared their interest in hosting the 2011 Women's World Cup. The [[German Football Association]] announced its hopes to host the tournament on 26 January 2006, following a pledge from German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] to fully support a potential bid.<ref>[http://wm2006.deutschland.de/DE/Content/WMAktuell/Reden/2005/rede-von-bundeskanzlerin-merkel-bundestag-dfb-leipzig.html Rede von Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526192059/http://wm2006.deutschland.de/DE/Content/WMAktuell/Reden/2005/rede-von-bundeskanzlerin-merkel-bundestag-dfb-leipzig.html |date=26 May 2011 }}.

The final bidding dossiers had to be handed over before 1 August 2007. Switzerland withdrew on 29 May 2007, stating that Europe is heavily focused on France and Germany, and a third European bid appeared futile. On 27 August 2007, France also withdrew, reportedly in exchange for Germany's support for their bid to host the men's [[UEFA Euro 2016]].<ref>Juchem, Markus.

==Venues==
After the German Football Association (DFB) expressed its intention to bid for the Women's World Cup, 23 German cities applied to host World Cup games. Twelve cities were chosen for the official bidding dossier handed over to FIFA in August 2007.<ref>[https://www.dfb.de/index.php?id=500014&tx_dfbnews_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=11121 DFB benennt zwölf Städte und Stadien für Frauen-WM 2011].

The official opening game was held between Germany and Canada at the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Berlin]], the venue of the 2006 men's [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup Final]]; it was the only match played in Berlin. However, it was not the first match of the tournament—it was preceded by a match at [[Rhein-Neckar-Arena]] in [[Sinsheim]] pitting France and Nigeria. The final of the tournament took place at the [[Commerzbank-Arena]] in [[Frankfurt]], the venue of the 2005 men's [[2005 FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]] final. [[Borussia-Park]] in [[Mönchengladbach]] and Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena hosted the semi-finals. The third place play-off was held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena.<ref name="venues"/>

Since 2007, five of the stadiums were either newly built ([[Augsburg]], [[Dresden]] and Sinsheim) or remodelled ([[Bochum]] and [[Leverkusen]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Augsburg Stadium |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5021757/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dresdem Stadium |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5001653/index.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712204353/http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium%3D5001653/index.html |archivedate=12 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sinsheim Stadium |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5021571/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Bochum Stadium |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=340/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Leverkusen Stadium |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5000055/index.html}}</ref> Six stadiums would be home grounds for German [[Bundesliga|First Bundesliga]] clubs in the upcoming [[2011–12 Bundesliga|2011–12 season]], while the other three would be home to [[2.

Several of the stadiums were officially referred to simply as "FIFA Women's World Cup Stadium" because FIFA prohibited sponsorship of stadiums unless the stadium sponsors were also official tournament sponsors. With no standing-room terraces allowed, all stadiums had a lower total capacity compared to German Bundesliga games. Capacity data is given according to FIFA:<ref name="stadiums">FIFA.

==Teams and qualification==
{{Main|2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification}}

===Number of participating teams===
FIFA had considered the prospect of increasing the number of teams from 16 to 24, to reflect the growing global popularity of women's football and the Women's World Cup. However, on 14 March 2008, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] decided to keep the number of participants at 16, concerned that more teams would dilute the quality of play.<ref name="FIFA keeps 16 teams">Associated Press. [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=soccer%20&id=3292983 FIFA keeps 16 teams for 2011 Women's World Cup]. ESPN.com. 13 March 2008. Retrieved 30 July 2008.</ref> The idea of having 20 teams taking part, which had been discussed briefly, was ruled impossible to implement in terms of fixture planning and logistics.<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/organisation/media/newsid=723580/index.html Sixteen teams at Germany 2011]. FIFA.com. 16 March 2008. Retrieved 29 April 2008.</ref> During the [[2007 Women's World Cup]], FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] had campaigned for the idea to increase the number of teams, although this proposal was not unquestioned. In particular the 11–0 victory of [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]] over [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]] in the opening game of the 2007 tournament had caused a debate over whether there were 24 national teams on a comparable level.<ref>AFP.

===Confederation allocation===
In October 2008, the FIFA Executive Committee announced a change to the allocation of the qualifying berths for its continental confederations. Asia was granted 3 automatic berths instead of 2.5 for the finals (although in 2007 the host nation was an additional qualifier from Asia). Europe's allocation was reduced from 5 to 4.5 (although it effectively increased to 5.5 because of the automatic qualification of the host nation). The North/Central American and Caribbean confederation (CONCACAF) retained their 2.5 qualifiers, Africa and South America 2 each, and Oceania 1. The 16th qualifying spot was determined through a [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA–CONCACAF play-off)|play-off]] between the third-placed team in CONCACAF and the winner of repechage play-offs in Europe.<ref name="slots">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/95/40/01/circularno.1168-fifawomensworldcup2011.pdf|publisher=FIFA.com |title=FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 |author=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref>

FIFA also ruled that each confederation has to ensure that at least one third of its member associations enter their women's national teams for World Cup qualification, otherwise FIFA would re-examine the current slot allocation. In Africa and the Middle East a considerable percentage of teams had withdrawn from World Cup qualification in the past.<ref name="slots"/>

For European teams, the 2011 Women's World Cup was also used as a qualification tournament for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]. Besides [[Great Britain and Northern Ireland Olympic football team|Team Great Britain]], Europe had two additional qualifiers for the Summer Olympics.  With Germany losing their quarter-final, France, which had already reached the semi-finals, secured qualification to the Olympics. Sweden followed as UEFA's second team with its win against Australia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Double joy for France, dream over for England |url=http://sports.ndtv.com/football/news/item/175683-double-joy-for-france-dream-over-for-england-in-womens-world-cup |publisher=sports.ndtv.com |accessdate=10 July 2011 |date=10 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324012952/http://sports.ndtv.com/football/news/item/175683-double-joy-for-france-dream-over-for-england-in-womens-world-cup |archive-date=24 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sweden sweep past Australia to seal semi-final berth |url=http://www.uefa.com/womensworldcup/matches/season=2011/round=2000044/match=2008267/postmatch/report/ |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=10 July 2011 |date=10 July 2011}}</ref>

===Qualified teams===

Qualification for the tournament took place between April 2009 and November 2010. As the host nation, Germany were granted automatic qualification, while the remaining national teams qualified through their continental confederations. Most confederations used their continental championship tournaments – the [[2010 AFC Women's Asian Cup|AFC Women's Asian Cup]], [[2010 African Women's Football Championship|CAF Women's Championship]], [[2010 OFC Women's Championship|OFC Women's Championship]], [[2010 Sudamericano Femenino|Sudamericano Femenino]] and [[2010 CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup|CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup]] – to determine qualification. The exception to this was UEFA, which used its own [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying tournament]].<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/qualifiers/index.html Qualifiers]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 7 December 2009.</ref> One qualification spot was determined by a [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification (UEFA–CONCACAF play-off)|play-off]] between a UEFA and CONCACAF team.

The World Cup tickets were offered in several sales phases. During the first sales period from 29 October 2009 to 31 August 2010, only so-called city series tickets were offered. Each city series includes tickets for all games of that particular host city. The prices ranged from [[euro|€]]30 to €415. In the second sales period from 17 February to 31 August 2010, so-called 20Eleven tickets were sold to groups of at least 11 people, offered at a 20 percent discount and directed primarily at schools and clubs. Single tickets for all matches were first sold starting 15 September 2010. The prices of individual tickets range from €10 to €200. On 18 March 2011, 100 days before the opening game, the last sales phase started, with all remaining tickets being sold in the order in which orders are received.<ref name="tickets">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/organisation/ticketing/salesphases.html |publisher=FIFA.com |title=FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 |author=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=14 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712191741/http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/organisation/ticketing/salesphases.html |archivedate=12 July 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

;Pot 1: The groups of the four seeded teams were predetermined before the draw.

;Pot 2: Australia and Korea DPR could not be drawn against fellow AFC qualifier Japan in Group B. Similarly, Canada and Mexico could not be drawn against the other CONCACAF qualifier (the United States) in Group C.

;Pot 3: To avoid two CONMEBOL teams being drawn into Group D, if Colombia were not the first team drawn from Pot 3 then the side drawn would be placed directly into Group D.

;Pot 4: Group A would be the group with two European teams.

The group draw was staged in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, on 29 November 2010 at the Congress Centrum.

==Group stage==
The first round, or group stage, sees the sixteen teams divided into four groups of four teams. Each group is a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] of six games, where each team plays one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams are awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group qualifies for the quarter-finals.<ref name="regulations"/>

The match schedule for the tournament was released on 20 March 2009, with the hosts placed in position A1. Unlike previous Women's World Cup final tournaments, there were no double-headers, but matches on the same day were held in different venues. According to the Organising Committee, this "signals the increased quality and status of the women's finals".<ref name="matchschedule">[https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/organisation/media/newsid=1039783/index.html FIFA Women's World Cup 2011 match schedule published].
