'''Roseanne Cherrie Barr''' (born November 3, 1952) is an American actress, comedian, writer, producer, and presidential candidate. Barr began her career in [[stand-up comedy]] before gaining acclaim in the television sitcom ''[[Roseanne]]'' (1988–1997; 2018). She won an [[Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress for her work on the show.

Barr became a stand-up comedian in 1980. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she gained fame through her role in ''Roseanne'' and other performances. Barr sparked controversy when performing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" at a nationally aired baseball game on July 25, 1990. After singing the anthem in what many perceived to be a deliberately disrespectful manner, Barr grabbed her groin and spat. This performance was met with condemnation from baseball fans and sportswriters, and was called "disgraceful" by then-President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref name=Anthem>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/07/23/roseanne-on-the-day-she-shrieked-the-star-spangled-banner-grabbed-her-crotch-and-earned-a-rebuke-from-president-bush/ |title=Roseanne on the day she shrieked 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' grabbed her crotch and earned a rebuke from President Bush |date=July 23, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref>

When Barr was three years old, she got [[Bell's palsy]] on the left side of her face. Barr said, "[so] my mother called in a rabbi to pray for me, but nothing happened.

Years later, Barr learned that Bell's palsy was usually temporary and that the Mormon elder came "exactly at the right time".<ref name="jjournal"/>

In 1986, she performed on a [[Rodney Dangerfield]] special and on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', and the following year had her own [[HBO]] special called ''The Roseanne Barr Show'', which earned her an [[American Comedy Awards|American Comedy Award]] for the funniest female performer in a television special.<ref name="SanFranciscoChronicle1988">{{cite journal|last=Dykstra|first=Carol|journal=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Domestic Goddess Rules Her Own Show – Comedian Roseanne Barr turns housework into hilarity |date=October 16, 1988}}</ref>

===''Roseanne'' sitcom, film, books, and talk show: 1987–2004===
{{Main|Roseanne}}
In 1987, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' executive producers [[Carsey-Werner Productions|Marcy Carsey]] and [[Tom Werner]] wanted to bring a "no-perks family comedy" to television. They hired ''Cosby'' writer [[Matt Williams (producer)|Matt Williams]] to write a script about factory workers and signed Barr to play [[Roseanne Conner]].<ref name="Reunion">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2008/10/24/roseanne-family-reunion/|title= A Roseanne family reunion|last=Stransky|first=Tanner|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|page=1|date=October 24, 2008|access-date=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602175441/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20235368,00.html|archive-date=June 2, 2011|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The show premiered on October 18, 1988, and was watched by 21.4&nbsp;million households, making it the highest-rated debut of that season.<ref name="Reunion"/>

Barr became outraged when she watched the first episode of ''Roseanne'' and noticed that in the credits, Williams was listed as creator.<ref name="Reunion"/> She told Tanner Stransky of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "We built the show around my actual life and my kids. The 'domestic goddess', the whole thing."<ref name="Reunion"/> In the same interview, Werner said, "I don't think Roseanne, to this day, understands that this is something legislated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]], and it's part of what every show has to deal with. They're the final arbiters."<ref name="Reunion"/>

During the first season, Barr sought more creative control over the show, opposing Williams' authority. Barr refused to say certain lines and eventually walked off set. She threatened to quit the show if Williams did not leave. ABC let Williams go after the thirteenth episode.<ref name="Reunion"/> Barr gave [[Amy Sherman-Palladino]] and [[Joss Whedon]] their first writing jobs on ''Roseanne''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/25/entertainment/la-et-st-bunheads-sherman-palladino-20130225|title=Amy Sherman-Palladino Hopes 'Bunheads' Gets a Callback|date=February 25, 2013|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name=nymag/>

''Roseanne'' ran for nine seasons from 1988 to 1997. Barr won an [[Emmy]], a [[Golden Globe]], a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Award]], and three [[American Comedy Awards]] for her part in the show. Barr had crafted a "fierce working-class domestic goddess" persona in the eight years preceding her sitcom and wanted to do a realistic show about a strong mother "who was not a victim of patriarchal consumerism."<ref name=nymag>Barr, R.

For the final two seasons, Barr earned $40 million, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business at the time, after [[Oprah Winfrey]].<ref name="slate">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1820/|last=Plotz|first=David|title=Domestic Goddess Dethroned|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=May 18, 1997|access-date=April 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404195447/http://www.slate.com/id/1820|archive-date=April 4, 2011|url-status=live|quote=She's earned $40 million in the last two years, making her the second-highest-paid woman in show business, after [[Oprah]]}}</ref>

[[Barbara Ehrenreich]] called Barr a working-class spokesperson representing "the hopeless underclass of the female sex: polyester-clad, overweight occupants of the slow track; fast-food waitresses, factory workers, housewives, members of the invisible pink-collar army; the despised, the jilted, the underpaid,"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|date=April 2, 1990|title=The Undainty Feminism of Roseanne Barr|journal=[[The New Republic]]|pages=28–31}}</ref> but a master of "the kind of class-militant populism that the Democrats, most of them anyway, never seem to get right."<ref>{{cite web |last=Taranto |first=James |date=August 1, 1990 |url=http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |title=Roseanne Barr: From Deification to Disgust |work=[[New York Tribune]] |access-date=September 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915015014/http://home.roadrunner.com/~taranto/roseanne.htm |archive-date=September 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Barr refuses to use the term "blue collar" because it masks the issue of class.<ref>Campbell, R.

On July 25, 1990, Barr performed "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" [[off-key]] before a baseball game between the [[San Diego Padres]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] at [[Jack Murphy Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roseanne-barr-fergie-national-anthem_us_5a8b1014e4b05c2bcace097f |title=Roseanne Jokes Her National Anthem Was 'Better' Than Fergie's |first=Curtis M. |last=Wong |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com |date=February 19, 2018 |access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> She later said she was singing as loudly as possible to hear herself over the public-address system, so her rendition of the song sounded "screechy". Following her rendition, she mimicked the often-seen actions of players by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. Barr later said that the Padres had suggested she "bring humor to the song", but many criticized the episode, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], who called her rendition "disgraceful".<ref name=Anthem/><ref>{{cite web|last=Laurence|first=Robert|url=http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20030717-9999_1c17barr.html|title=Roseanne Tries Raising the Bar|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|publisher=[[Platinum Equity]]|date=July 17, 2003|access-date=March 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313182411/http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20030717-9999_1c17barr.html|archive-date=March 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Barr revisited this incident during her ''[[Comedy Central Roast]]'' in 2012, wherein she once again belted out the last few bars of the national anthem, without screeching.<ref>Good, Dan.

===Parkland shooting tweet===
In late March 2018, Barr tweeted about a conspiracy theory involving [[David Hogg]], a survivor of the Marjory [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] in Parkland, Florida. The conspiracy theory falsely claims Hogg gave a Nazi salute at a [[March for Our Lives]] rally on March 24. Barr later deleted her tweet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/188654/roseanne-barr-apparently-tweeted-about-a-conspiracy-theory-involving-parkland-student-david-hogg#.KPZp1W7Bu|title=Roseanne Barr apparently tweeted about a conspiracy theory involving Parkland student David Hogg}}</ref>

===George Soros===
Barr claimed that [[George Soros]] helped Nazis round up Jews to send them to concentration camps. In reality, his assimilated father entrusted him to a Hungarian arrow cross Fascist friend with whom the fourteen year old Soros went to inventory Jewish properties. Soros recently said he need not feel guilty since if he didn't do that someone else would have. In response to a tweet about Soros by [[Chelsea Clinton]], Barr tweeted using a clip from ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview of Soros and misquoted him. She later apologized for her comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roseanne-barr-apologizes-for-calling-george-soros-a-nazi_n_5b1eba74e4b0bbb7a0e01ec2|title=Roseanne Barr apolgizes for calling George Soros a Nazi|website=HuffPost}}</ref>

Barr's running mate, Cindy Sheehan, immediately had disagreements with Barr, from Barr's views on policy, to Barr's desire to only campaign online, and Barr's treatment of Green Party nominee [[Jill Stein]], leading Sheehan to request that her name be taken off the Peace and Freedom Party ticket.

Barr appeared on the ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida. She did not appear on the ballot in her home state of Hawaii, which did not allow write-in votes. She ended up voting for President [[Barack Obama|Obama]]. She received 67,326 votes nationwide, placing sixth overall with 0.05% of the popular vote; Stein, who appeared on the ballot of thirty-six states and the [[District of Columbia]], placed far ahead of her in fourth place with 0.36% of the popular vote and 469,627 votes.<ref name="FEC"/>

Barr was followed by a film crew throughout her entire campaign, with documentarian [[Eric Weinrib]] directing, leading to questions about the sincerity of her campaign.
