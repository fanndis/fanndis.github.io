==Early life and education==
[[File:George Stephanopoulos crop.jpg|thumb|left|Stephanopoulos speaking at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] in March 2006]]
Stephanopoulos was born in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], the son of Nickolitsa "Nikki" Gloria (née Chafos) and Robert George Stephanopoulos. His parents are of [[Greece|Greek]] descent.<ref>''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', PBS, November 18, 2014.</ref> His father is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] priest and [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] ''[[emeritus]]'' of the [[Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="father'sbio">[http://www.goarch.org/archdiocese/affiliates/rca/biography/stephanopoulos_robert "Fr. Robert George Stephanopoulos"]. [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. Retrieved December 20, 2009.</ref>  Currently, his father is a retired priest at Sts. Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox church in Cleveland Heights, OH.  His mother was the director of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] National News Service for many years.<ref name="father'sbio"/>  She now also attends St Cons, and is a regular member of the church.  In his youth, he became a follower of the Greek Orthodox faith, and long considered entering the priesthood.

Following some time in [[Purchase, New York]], Stephanopoulos moved to the eastern suburbs of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], where he attended [[Orange High School (Ohio)|Orange High School]] in [[Pepper Pike, Ohio|Pepper Pike]].<ref name="Fong">{{cite news|url=https://www.cleveland.com/education/2009/10/post.html|title=George Stephanopoulos returns home to praise Cuyahoga Community College|first=Marvin|last=Fong|work=[[The Plain Dealer#cleveland.com|Cleveland.com]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=[[Brooklyn, Ohio]]|date=October 13, 2009|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref> While at Orange, he was on the [[wrestling]] team, competing at lower weight classes.  He told [[Howard Stern]] in May 2020 that he would sometimes work out wrapped in plastic, so he could lose water weight before the [[weigh-in]], prior to a match.  Academically, he was the number two student in his graduating class.

In 1982, Stephanopoulos received a bachelor of arts degree in [[political science]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] and was the [[salutatorian]] of his class.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stephanopoulos Returns to Columbia to Teach|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol22/vol22_iss11/record2211.13.html|access-date=2020-10-16|website=www.columbia.edu}}</ref> While at Columbia, he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] his junior year, was awarded a [[Harry S.

Stephanopoulos's father wanted his son to become either a lawyer or a priest.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Promising his father that he would attend law school eventually, George took a job in [[Washington, D.C.]], as an aide to Democratic [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] [[Ed Feighan]] of Ohio.

==Career==
===Politics===
====1988 U.S. presidential election====
In 1988, Stephanopoulos worked on the [[Michael Dukakis]] [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 U.S. presidential campaign]].{{sfn|Hess|2008|page=36}} He has noted that one of his attractions to this campaign was that Dukakis was a [[Greek-American]] liberal from Massachusetts.<ref>Stephanopoulos, George, ''All Too Human&nbsp;– A Political Education'', p. 21.</ref> After this campaign, Stephanopoulos became the "floor man" for [[Dick Gephardt]], [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader]]; he held this position until he joined the Clinton campaign.{{sfn|Loesch|2016|page=71}}

====Clinton Administration====<!--"clinton administration" is title of era; thus both capped-->
Stephanopoulos was, along with [[David Wilhelm]] and [[James Carville]], a leading member of [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|Clinton's 1992 U.S. presidential campaign]]. His role on the campaign is portrayed in the [[documentary]] film ''[[The War Room]]'' (1993).{{sfn|Loesch|2016|page=71}}

At the outset of Clinton's presidency, Stephanopoulos served as the ''de facto'' [[White House Press Secretary|press secretary]], briefing the press even though [[Dee Dee Myers]] was officially the [[White House Press Secretary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/White-House-press-secretary|title=White House Press Secretary - Definition & History |accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref>

=====Attempt to obstruct Regulatory Agency Investigation=====
Newsweek reported that Stephanopoulos attempted to obstruct a Regulatory Agency Investigation, with his objection to an appointee. On February 25, 1994, Stephanopoulos and [[Harold M. Ickes|Harold Ickes]] had a conference call with [[Roger Altman]] to discuss the [[Resolution Trust Corporation]]'s choice of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawyer Jay Stephens to head the [[Madison Guaranty]] investigation, that later turned into the [[Whitewater controversy]].<ref>[[Staff writer]] (undated).

Stephanopoulos resigned from the Clinton administration shortly after [[United States elections, 1996|Clinton was re-elected in 1996]].<ref>[[Staff writer]] (undated). [https://archive.today/20120720160637/http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542062 "George Stephanopoulos Biography – (1961–)"].  ''[[A&E Television Networks]]'' (''via'' ''[[The Biography Channel]]''). Retrieved December 19, 2009.</ref>

His [[memoir]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'' (1999), was published after he left the White House during Clinton's second term. It quickly became a number-one bestseller on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/bsp/besthardnonfiction.html|accessdate=May 14, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 28, 1999}}</ref> In the book, Stephanopoulos spoke of his [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and how his face broke out into [[hives]] due to the pressures of conveying the Clinton White House message. Clinton referred to the book in his autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'', apologizing for what he felt in retrospect to be excessive demands placed on the young staffer.

Stephanopoulos's book covers his time with Clinton from the day he met him in September 1991, to the day Stephanopoulos left the White House in December 1996, through two presidential campaigns and four years in the White House. Stephanopoulos describes Clinton in the book as a "complicated man responding to the pressures and pleasures of public life in ways I found both awesome and appalling".<ref>Stephanopoulos, George, All Too Human – A Political Education, p. 5.</ref>

===Journalism===
====ABC News====
After leaving the [[White House]] at the end of Clinton's first term, Stephanopoulos became a political analyst for [[ABC News]], and served as a correspondent on ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] Sunday morning public affairs program; ''World News Tonight'', the evening news broadcast; ''Good Morning America'', the morning news program; along with other various special broadcasts.

=====2002–2009: ABC's ''This Week''=====
[[File:Hillary Clinton and Robert M. Gates talk with George Stephanopoulos, 2009 (1).jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense [[Robert M. Gates]] and Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] talk with George Stephanopoulos in December 2009 in [[Washington, D.C.]].]]
In September 2002, Stephanopoulos became host of ''This Week'', and ABC News officially named him "Chief Washington Correspondent" in December 2005.<ref name="abc133369">[[Staff writer]] (December 10, 2009). [https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/story?id=133369 "George Stephanopoulos' Biography – Anchor, ''Good Morning America''; Chief Political Correspondent; Anchor, ''This Week''"]. Retrieved December 19, 2009.</ref> The program's title added the new host's name.

When named to the position, Stephanopoulos was a relative newcomer to the show, usurping longtime panelists and short-term co-hosts [[Sam Donaldson]] and [[Cokie Roberts]] who, for a few years, briefly replaced the longtime original host, [[David Brinkley]].

Opinion columnist and part-time ABC News commentator [[George Will]] was the only remaining member of the original ''This Week'' panel from the Brinkley days to participate consistently in the weekly show until 2013; Donaldson and Roberts were phased out and only appeared on the program on a very limited basis. [[Fareed Zakaria]] was a weekly panelist during the first two years of Stephanopoulos' tenure, broadening the show with his perspective on world and Middle Eastern issues.

======''This Week'' ratings: 3rd place in Sunday policy forums======
In 2017-2018 ratings for This Week fell to 3rd place after competitors Meet The Press and Face The Nation, in all ratings metrics of the audience. The program finished ahead of only "Fox News Sunday."

ABC News executives reportedly offered [[Ted Koppel]], former ''[[Nightline (U.S. news program)|Nightline]]'' anchor, the ''This Week'' host job in 2005 after the program's ratings had become a regular third-, fourth-, and sometimes fifth-place finish after competitors NBC, CBS, Fox, and syndicated programs.<ref name="steinberg">{{Registration required}} [[Jacques Steinberg|Steinberg, Jacques]] (April 1, 2005).

In February 2009, the gap between NBC's ''Meet the Press'' and its competitors – CBS' ''[[Face the Nation]]'' and ABC's ''This Week'' – began closing. ''Meet the Press'' posted its lowest ratings since NBC's [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] became moderator in early February, with the show airing Sunday, February 1, averaging just 3.9&nbsp;million viewers. ''Face the Nation'' averaged 3.33&nbsp;million total viewers, while ''This Week'' came in just behind with 3.32&nbsp;million total viewers.

=====2008 U.S. presidential debate=====
On April 16, 2008, Stephanopoulos co-moderated, with [[Charles Gibson]], the twenty-first, and ultimately final, [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential debates, 2008|Democratic Party presidential debate]] between Illinois Senator Barack Obama and New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for the [[United States elections, 2008|2008 election cycle]]. While the debate received record ratings, the co-moderators were heavily criticized for focusing most of the first hour of the debate on controversies that occurred during the campaign rather than issues such as the economy and the [[Iraq War]]. Stephanopoulos acknowledged the legitimacy of the concerns over the order of the questions,<ref>{{cite news|last=Abcarian|first=Robin|title=Stephanopoulos Defends His Questions to Obama|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=December 19, 2009 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/04/stephanopoulos.html}}</ref> but said they were issues in the campaign that had not been covered in previous debates.<ref name="ratings">{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24189180|title=Ratings, Criticism Big for ABC Debate – Gibson, Stephanopoulos Draw Fire for 'Shoddy' Work|author=[[Staff writer]] |agency=[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]] (''via'' ''[[NBC News]]'')|date=April 17, 2008| accessdate=December 19, 2009}}</ref> ABC had sought out a woman who opposed Obama and aired a video of her asking a trivial question, repeated by Stephanopolous, about why Obama wasn't wearing a flag pin.

In December 2009, ABC News president David Westin offered Stephanopoulos [[Diane Sawyer|Diane Sawyer's]] job on ''Good Morning America'' after Sawyer was named anchor of ''World News''. Stephanopoulos accepted the new position and began co-anchoring ''GMA'' on December 14, 2009. Stephanopoulos announced on January 10, 2010, that that would be his last broadcast as the permanent host of ''This Week''. However, after his successor, [[Christiane Amanpour]], left the show amid sagging ratings, it was announced that Stephanopoulos would return as host of ''This Week'' in December 2011. He signed a deal to stay with ABC until 2021 worth [[United States Dollar|$]]105 million.{{sfn|Loesch|2016|page=69}}

Stephanopoulos was one of the substitute anchors for Sawyer on nights when she was away on assignment or unavailable.

=====2012 Republican debate moderator=====
On January 7, 2012, Stephanopoulos was the co-moderator of a debate among [[Mitt Romney]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Rick Santorum]]. During the debate, Stephanopoulos repeatedly asked Romney whether the former Massachusetts governor believes the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn a 1965 ruling that a constitutional right to privacy bars states from banning contraception.  During the debate, Romney said it was a preposterous question.<ref>Yahoo: [https://news.yahoo.com/george-stephanopoulos-obsesses-contraception-republican-debate-193800729.html George Stephanopoulos Obsesses About Contraception at Republican Debate.]  January 9, 2012.</ref> During the fall presidential campaign, the Obama campaign used the question and answer to intimate there was a political [[War on Women]].

=====2014–present: ABC News chief anchor=====
Following Diane Sawyer's departure from [[ABC World News|World News]] at the end of August 2014, Stephanopoulos became the Chief Anchor at ABC News while retaining his current roles on ''GMA'' and ''This Week''. Stephanopoulos is now the lead anchor for coverage of breaking news and major special events.<ref name = "SawyerStepDown" />

In 2009, Stephanopoulos spoke at the annual [[Tri-C Presidential Scholarship Luncheon]] held at the [[Renaissance Cleveland Hotel]] and praised [[Cuyahoga Community College]].<ref name="Fong"/>

==Controversies==
===Real estate loan controversy===
In 1994, columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] reported that Stephanopoulos signed an $835,000 commercial real estate deal consisting of a two-story apartment, including an eyewear retailer, with a below-market loan rate from a bank owned by [[Hugh McColl]], who had been called by President Clinton "the most enlightened banker in America". A NationsBank commercial loan officer said that this loan did "not fit our product matrix" as banks typically offer such loans for only those customers who have deep pockets and on a short-term adjustable rate basis.  Stephanopoulos's real estate agent explained that "nobody making $125,000 could qualify for the property without the commercial property (lease)." One former senior bank regulator told Anderson that, "If his name were George Smith, and he didn't work in the White House, this loan wouldn't have gotten made."<ref>{{cite news |title=Did Stephanopoulos Make Out Like A Bandit? |first=Jack |last=Anderson |work=Standard-Democrat |location=Sikeston, Missouri |date=July 28, 1994}}</ref>

Regarding the controversy, NationsBank stated, "The loan described by Jack Anderson as a commercial loan to George Stephanopoulos was, in fact, a residential mortgage loan.  At the time the loan commitment was made, Mr.&nbsp;Anderson (or his imaginary 'George Smith' who 'doesn't work in the White House') could have walked into any NationsBank Mortgage Company office in the D.C. area and received the same excellent rate and term for the same deal."<ref>{{cite news|title=NationsBank Responds to Jack Anderson Column |agency=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NATIONSBANK+RESPONDS+TO+JACK+ANDERSON+COLUMN-a015602064 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022041547/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NATIONSBANK+RESPONDS+TO+JACK+ANDERSON+COLUMN-a015602064 |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 22, 2013 |date=July 21, 1994}}</ref>

However, Stephanopoulos's realtor states that he would not have qualified for the loan without the commercial property rent.  One NationsBank source states that the issuance of a residential loan on mixed-use properties is such a rarity that it was not even addressed in the "NationsBank Mortgage Corporation's Program Summary" or its "Credit Policy Manual." A NationsBank underwriting memo revealed that one of the three restrictions for mixed-use properties is that "the borrower must be the owner of the business entity." The source claims that NationsBank told the listing agent that, "We're not (interested in mixed-use properties), but we do have an appetite for this particular loan." NationsBank's primary regulator at the time was Comptroller of the Currency [[Eugene Ludwig]], a Rhodes scholar who attended [[Yale Law School]] with President Clinton, and who had been asked to investigate NationsBank by Democratic congressmen [[Henry B. Gonzalez]] and [[John Dingell]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Labash |first=Matt |date=October 1994  |title=Buy George |journal=The American Spectator |pages=30–34 |location=Arlington, Virginia |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AmSpectator-1994oct-00030}}</ref>

Based on Stephanopoulos's donations to The Clinton Foundation charity and his behavior during prior interviews and presidential debates, Republican party leaders and candidates expressed their distrust, and called for him to be banned from moderating 2016 Presidential debates, due to bias and [[conflict of interest]].<ref name=NYT51415b /><ref name=NYT51415c>{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |date=May 14, 2015 |title=Rand Paul: George Stephanopoulos Shouldn't Moderate 2016 Debates |url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/14/rand-paul-stephanopoulos-shouldnt-moderate-2016-debates/?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |access-date=May 14, 2015|quote=Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, said that the donations and Mr. Stephanopoulos’s close ties with the Clintons should preclude him from moderating any debates in the 2016 presidential campaign.}}</ref> He agreed to drop out as a moderator of the scheduled [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2016|February 2016 Republican Presidential primary debate]].<ref name="DBashCNNMoney05152015">{{cite news |last=Bash |first=Dana |date=May 15, 2015 |title=Stephanopoulos seeks to move past Clinton donations scandal |url=https://money.cnn.com/2015/05/15/media/george-stephanopoulos-analysis-clinton-foundation/index.html?iid=EL |newspaper=[[CNNMoney]] |location=[[Atlanta, Georgia]] |access-date=May 15, 2015|quote=On "The Daily Show" last month, Stephanopoulos said that when foreign governments and other entities give millions to the Clinton foundation, "everybody" knows there's "a hope that that's going to lead to something, and that's what you have to be careful of."}}</ref>

===Jeffrey Epstein association===
In 2010, Stephanopoulos attended a dinner party at the home of convicted sex offender socialite [[Jeffrey Epstein]] alongside [[Chelsea Handler]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Katie Couric]], [[Prince Andrew]], [[Charlie Rose]] and [[Eva Andersson-Dubin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-moved-freely-hollywood-circles-2008-conviction-1223336|title=Jeffrey Epstein Moved Freely in Hollywood Circles Even After 2008 Conviction|website=The Hollywood Reporter|first1=Tatiana|last1=Siegel|first2=Marisa|last2=Guthrie|date=July 10, 2019|accessdate=July 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks|title=Katie Couric, Woody Allen: Jeffrey Epstein's Society Friends Close Ranks|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|first=Alexandra|last=Wolfe|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=July 2, 2020}}</ref> Following Epstein's arrest in July 2019, the party resurfaced online, with those attending receiving backlash, Stephanopoulos denied being friends with Epstein, with the party being the only encounter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/09/jeffrey-epsteins-social-contacts-with-katie-couric-george-stephanopoulos-other-celebs-scrutinized/|title=Jeffrey Epstein's social contacts with Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, other celebs scrutinized|website=[[The Mercury News]]|first=Martha|last=Ross|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=July 2, 2020}}</ref> 

Stephanopoulos told ''The New York Times'': "That dinner was the first and last time I’ve seen him, I should have done more due diligence. It was a mistake to go.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-new-york-elite.html|title=Jeffrey Epstein Was a Sex Offender.

==In popular culture==
Stephanopoulos was the inspiration for the character of Henry Burton in [[Joe Klein|Joe Klein's]] novel ''[[Primary Colors (novel)|Primary Colors]]'' (1996). Burton was subsequently portrayed by [[Adrian Lester]] in the [[Primary Colors (film)|1998 film adaptation]]. [[Michael J. Fox]]'s character, Lewis Rothschild, in the film ''[[The American President (film)|The American President]]'' (1995), written by [[Aaron Sorkin]] was modeled after Stephanopoulos. He was also used by Sorkin as the model for [[Rob Lowe|Rob Lowe's]] character, [[Sam Seaborn]], on the television drama series ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/17/featuresreview.review1|title=A beginner's guide to the West Wing|first=Mark|last=Morris|date=December 17, 2000|accessdate=October 15, 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> According to Stephanopoulos, his role in the Clinton administration was more like [[Bradley Whitford|Bradley Whitford's]] character [[Josh Lyman]] than Seaborn or Rothschild.<ref>Krakauer, Steve (April 2, 2008). [http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a10130.asp?c=mbennf "So What Do You Do, George Stephanopoulos, Anchor, This Week – The Political Advisor-turned-Anchor Talks the Bush Legacy, Moving to Newseum, and the County's Political Climate"].  ''[[Mediabistro.com]]''. Retrieved December 19, 2009.</ref> Stephanopoulos also appeared as himself in the first season of ''[[Spin City]]'' starring Michael J. Fox in an episode entitled "An Affair to Remember". Fox's Deputy-Mayor character was partially inspired by Stephanopoulos, but this is turned around for comedic effect with Fox commenting at the end of the episode "I don't know what the big deal with that guy is anyway... all he does is copy from me".

Stephanopoulos has an episode of the [[Friends (season 1)|first season]] of the TV series ''[[Friends]]'' named after him titled, "The One with George Stephanopoulos". In the episode, [[Monica Geller]], [[Rachel Green]], and [[Phoebe Buffay]] are accidentally given Stephanopoulos's pizza while he was sent theirs. They learn from the pizza delivery man that Stephanopoulos is staying in an apartment across the street from theirs. Being attracted to him, they proceed to spy on him throughout most of the night. In an episode of the animated TV series ''[[American Dad!]]'' titled "Iced, Iced Babies", [[Francine Smith|Francine]] breaks into a sperm bank in pursuit of injecting herself with the first sample she finds. The first vial she grabbed was Stephanopoulos' and threatened [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan]] she would [[impregnate]] herself using a turkey baster. Stan countered her saying he had "only the third-best rated talk show". Stephanopoulos appeared in the ''[[Pawn Stars]]'' episode "Buy the Book", where he bought a first edition of [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway's]] ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' for $675 after haggling with owner [[Rick Harrison]]. During 1999, he was also referenced as a former boyfriend of the fictional character Robin John in an episode of ''[[Popular (TV series)|Popular]]'', titled ''Wild, Wild Mess''.

Stephanopoulos returned to his ''alma mater'', Columbia University, in 2003, serving as the keynote speaker at Columbia College's Class Day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sachare|first=Alex|title=Class of 2003 Steps Out|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jul03/features1.php|work=Columbia College Today|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=May 14, 2011|date=July 2003|quote=George Stephanopoulos ’82, ABC newsman and former advisor to President Clinton, was the keynote speaker at Class Day.
