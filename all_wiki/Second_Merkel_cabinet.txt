== Resignations, dismissals and replacements ==
The second Merkel cabinet has been reshuffled several times. The first change occurred on 30 November 2009, when [[Franz Josef Jung]] resigned as Labour Minister amidst controversy surrounding the [[2009 Kunduz airstrike|Kunduz airstrike]], which happened while he was Defense Minister in the previous cabinet. He was succeeded by former Family Affairs Minister [[Ursula von der Leyen]], who was in turn succeeded by [[Kristina Schröder]].

On 3 March 2011, [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] stepped down as Defense Minister following the discovery of plagiarized content in his doctoral dissertation. He was succeeded by former Interior Minister [[Thomas de Maizière]], who was in turn succeeded by [[Hans-Peter Friedrich]].

On 10 May 2011, [[Rainer Brüderle]] was elected as the FDP's parliamentary leader and resigned his position as Economics Minister. He was succeeded by former Health Minister [[Philipp Rösler]], who was in turn succeeded by [[Daniel Bahr]]. On 13 May 2011, the FDP elected Rösler to succeed [[Guido Westerwelle]] as party chairman. Rösler was then named [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]] on 16 May 2011, succeeding Westerwelle in this position as well. Westerwelle retained the position of Foreign Minister.

On 16 May 2012, Merkel requested that [[President of Germany|President]] [[Joachim Gauck]] dismiss Environment Minister [[Norbert Röttgen]] after the CDU's defeat in the [[2012 North Rhine-Westphalia state election|North Rhine-Westphalia state election]]. Röttgen had been CDU chairman for that state. He was dismissed on 22 May 2012 and was succeeded as Environment Minister by [[Peter Altmaier]].
