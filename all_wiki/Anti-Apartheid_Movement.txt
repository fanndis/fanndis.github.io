{{International opposition to Apartheid}}

The '''Anti-Apartheid Movement''' ('''AAM'''), originally known as the '''Boycott Movement''', was a British organisation that was at the centre of the international movement opposing the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid|apartheid system]] and supporting South Africa's non-White population who were persecuted by the policies of apartheid.<ref name=Lisson>[http://www.anc.org.za/content/anti-apartheid-movement-britain-and-south-africa-anti-apartheid-protest-vs-real-politik "The Anti-Apartheid Movement, Britain and South Africa: Anti-Apartheid Protest vs Real Politik"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530050503/http://www.anc.org.za/content/anti-apartheid-movement-britain-and-south-africa-anti-apartheid-protest-vs-real-politik |date=30 May 2017 }}, Arianna Lisson, PhD Dissertation, 15 September 2000.</ref> The AAM changed its name to [[ACTSA: Action for Southern Africa]] in 1994, when South Africa achieved majority rule through free and fair elections, in which all races could vote.

==History==

===A consumer boycott organisation===

{{Apartheid}}
In response to an appeal by [[Albert Luthuli]], the Boycott Movement was founded in [[London]] on 26 June 1959 at a meeting of [[South Africa]]n exiles and their supporters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catalogue of the archive of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, 1956-98 |publisher=Bodleian Library of Commonwealth and A/frican Studies |url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/rhodes/aam/aam.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607042030/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/rhodes/aam/aam.html |archivedate=7 June 2007  }}</ref> Members included Vella Pillay, Ros Ainslie, Abdul Minty and Nanda Naidoo.<ref>Stefan Manz and Panikos Panayi (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=peaMAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT237&lpg=PT237&dq=%22ros+ainslie%22+%22peter+koinange%22&source=bl&ots=1S-XD2LzFi&sig=RooM738bINHQdhgqWIoAqsjotvY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sFFRU8DnG4SX4wS04YGgCw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ros%20ainslie%22%20%22peter%20koinange%22&f=false ''Refugees and Cultural Transfer to Britain''], Routledge, 2013, p. 163.</ref> [[Julius Nyerere]] would summarise its purpose:

<blockquote>We are not asking you, the British people, for anything special. We are just asking you to withdraw your support from apartheid by not buying South African goods.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Anti-Apartheid Movement: A 40-year Perspective |publisher=South Africa House, London |url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/symposium.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509010117/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/symposium.html |archivedate=9 May 2007 }}</ref></blockquote>

The boycott attracted widespread support from students, trade unions and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]] parties. On 28 February 1960, the movement launched a March Month, Boycott Action at a rally in [[Trafalgar Square]]. Speakers at the rally included Labour Party Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]], Liberal MP [[Jeremy Thorpe]], Conservative peer [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham]], and [[Tennyson Makiwane]] of the [[African National Congress]].<ref>C. Gurney, "A Great Cause: The Origins of the Anti-Apartheid Movement", ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', Vol. 26, No. 1, pp. 123â€“144.</ref>
.

===Expansion and renaming===

The [[Sharpeville massacre]] occurred on 21 March 1960, when 69 unarmed protesters were shot dead by the South African police, triggered an intensification of action. The organisation was renamed the "Anti-Apartheid Movement" and instead of just a consumer boycott the group would now "co-ordinate all the anti-apartheid work and keep South Africa's apartheid policy in the forefront of British politics",<ref name=Lisson/> and campaign for the total isolation of apartheid South Africa, including economic sanctions.

At the time, the [[United Kingdom]] was South Africa's largest foreign investor and South Africa was the UK's third biggest export market. The ANC was still committed to peaceful resistance: armed struggle through [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] would only begin a year later.

===Early successes===

====Commonwealth membership====

The AAM scored its first major victory when South Africa was forced to leave the [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] in 1961.  It held a 72-hour vigil outside the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]] venue, [[Marlborough House]], and found willing allies in Canada, India and the newly independent Afro-Asian [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] member states. In 1962, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all member states to impose a trade boycott against South Africa. In 1963, the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] called for a partial arms ban against South Africa, but this was not mandatory under Chapter VII of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].{{fact|date=November 2020}}

====Olympic participation====
{{main|Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics}}
[[Abdul Minty]], who took over from Rosalynde Ainslie as the AAM's Hon. Secretary in 1962, also represented the South African Sports Association, a non-racial body set up in South Africa by Dennis Brutus.  In the same year, he presented a letter to the International Olympic Committee meeting in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany about racism in South African sports. The result was a ruling that suspended South Africa from the [[1964 Tokyo Olympics]].<ref name=Lisson/> South Africa was finally expelled from the Olympics in 1970.

===Economic sanctions campaign===
{{Main|Disinvestment from South Africa}}
In November 1962, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed [[UN General Assembly Resolution 1761|Resolution 1761]], a non-binding resolution establishing the [[United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid]] and called for imposing economic and other sanctions on South Africa.  All Western nations refused to join the committee as members.  This boycott of a committee, the first such boycott, happened because it was created by the same General Assembly resolution that called for economic and other sanctions on South Africa, which at the time the West strongly opposed.

Following this passage of this resolution, the Anti-Apartheid Movement spearheaded the arrangements for international conference on sanctions to be held in London in April 1964.  According to Lisson, "The aim of the Conference was to work out the practicability of economic sanctions and their implications on the economies of South Africa, the UK, the US and the Protectorates. Knowing that the strongest opposition to the application of sanctions came from the West (and within the West, the UK), the Committee made every effort to attract as wide and varied a number of speakers and participants as possible so that the Conference findings would be regarded as objective."<ref name=Lisson/>

The conference was named the ''International Conference for Economic Sanctions Against South Africa''.  Lisson writes:

<blockquote>The Conference established the necessity, the legality and the practicability of internationally organised sanctions against South Africa, whose policies were seen to have become a direct threat to peace and security in Africa and the world. Its findings also pointed out that in order to be effective, a programme of sanctions would need the active participation of Britain and the US, who were also the main obstacle to the implementation of such a policy.<ref name=Lisson/></blockquote>

The AAM was enthusiastic with the results of the conference for two key reasons.<ref name=Lisson/>  First, because of "the new seriousness with which the use of economic sanctions is viewed."  Second, because the AAM was able to meet for the first time with the ''UN Special Committee on Apartheid'', a meeting that established a long-lasting working relationship between the two parties.

However, the conference was not successful in persuading the UK to take up economic sanctions against South Africa. Rather, the British government "remained firm in its view that the imposition of sanctions would be unconstitutional "because we do not accept that this situation in South Africa constitutes a threat to international peace and security and we do not in any case believe that sanctions would have the effect of persuading the South African Government to change its policies"."<ref name=Lisson/>

====Making sanctions an election issue====
The Anti-Apartheid Movement tried to make sanctions an election issue for the [[1964 UK general election]]. Candidates were asked to state their position on economic sanctions and other punitive measures against the South African government. Most candidates who responded answered in the affirmative. After the Labour Party's victory at the 1964 general election after thirteen years in opposition; commitment to the anti-apartheid cause dissipated. In short order, [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Harold Wilson]] told the press that his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was "not in favour of trade sanctions partly because, even if fully effective, they would harm the people we are most concerned about; the Africans and those White South Africans who are having to maintain some standard of decency there."<ref name=Lisson/> Even so, Lisson writes that the "AAM still hoped that the new Labour Government would be more sensitive to the demands of public opinion than the [[Douglas-Home ministry|previous Government]]." But by the end of 1964, it was clear that the election of the Labour Party had made little difference in the governments overall unwillingness to impose sanctions.

====Rejection by the West====
Lisson summarises the UN situation in 1964:

<blockquote>At the UN, Britain consistently refused to accept that the situation in South Africa fell under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII of the [United Nations] Charter]]. Instead, in collaboration with the US, it worked for a carefully worded appeal on the [[Rivonia Trial]] and other political trials to try to appease Afro-Asian countries and public opinion at home and abroad; by early 1965 the issue of sanctions had lost momentum.<ref name=Lisson/></blockquote>

===Academic boycott campaign===
{{Main|Academic boycott of South Africa}}
The Anti-Apartheid Movement was instrumental in initiating an [[academic boycott of South Africa]] in 1965. The declaration was signed by 496 university professors and lecturers from 34 British universities to protest against apartheid and associated violations of academic freedom. They made a special reference to the issue of banning orders against two South African academics named [[Jack Simons (academic)|Jack Simons]] and [[Eddie Roux]], who were two well-known progressive academics.<ref name=SpotlightOnSA>* Spotlight on South Africa, Dar es Salaam, 26 November 1965, reprinted by on the ANC Website for Historical Documents {{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/academic65.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707163944/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/academic65.html |archivedate=7 July 2007  }}</ref>

A part of the declaration:

{{quote|Academic Boycott of South Africa: Declaration by British Academics, 1965
We, the (undersigned) professors and lecturers in British universities in consultation with the ''Anti-Apartheid Movement'':
# Protest against the bans imposed on Professors Simons and Roux;
# Protest against the practice of racial discrimination and its extension to higher education;
# Pledge that we shall not apply for or accept academic posts in South African universities which practise racial discrimination.<ref name=SpotlightOnSA/>
}}

===Cooperation with the United Nations===
Faced with the failure to persuade the West to impose economic sanctions, in 1966 the AAM formulated a strategy whereby they would shift toward spearheading "an international campaign against apartheid under the auspices of the United Nations."<ref name=Reddy>"AAM and UN: partners in the international campaign against apartheid" in [http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/symposium.html "The Anti-Apartheid Movement: A 40-year Perspective"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509010117/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/symposium.html |date=9 May 2007 }}, E. S. Reddy, 25â€“26 June 1999.</ref> AAM's proposed strategy was approved by the [[UN Special Committee on Apartheid]] and then by the General Assembly.  This new partnership formed the basis for all future action against apartheid.  The man originally responsible for the new strategy gives this summary:

<blockquote>The strategy was to press for a range of measures to isolate the regime, support the liberation movement and inform world public opinion; to continue pressing for effective sanctions as the only means for a peaceful solution, and at the same time to obtain action on other measures which could be decided by a majority vote in the General Assembly; to isolate the major trading partners of South Africa by persuading other Western countries to co-operate in action to the greatest feasible extent; and to find ways to promote public opinion and public action against apartheid, especially in the countries which were the main collaborators with the South African regime. This also meant that we built the broadest support for each measure, thereby welcoming co-operation rather than alienating governments and organisations which were not yet prepared to support sanctions or armed struggle.<ref name=Reddy/></blockquote>
