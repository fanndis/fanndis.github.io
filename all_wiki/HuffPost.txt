An early ''Huffington Post'' strategy was crafting [[search engine optimization|search engine optimized]] stories and headlines based around [[keyword research|trending keywords]], such as "What Time Is the Super Bowl?"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/a-brief-history-of-what-time-is-the-super-bowl/283497/ |title=A Brief History of 'What Time Is the Super Bowl?' |last=Meyer | first=Robinson |work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=January 31, 2014}}</ref>

In January 2011, the ''Huffington Post'' website received 35% of its traffic from [[web search engine]]s, compared to 20% at [[CNN]].<ref name=lure>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/media/11search.html | title=Web Words That Lure the Readers | last=Cain Miller | first=Claire | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 10, 2011 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> This strategy appealed to AOL CEO [[Tim Armstrong (executive)|Tim Armstrong]], who tried to implement similar [[Search engine optimization|SEO]]-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of ''Huffington Post''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-aol-way | title=Leaked: AOL's Master Plan | last=Carlson | first=Nicholas | work=[[Business Insider]] |date=February 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://slate.com/technology/2011/02/aol-and-huffington-post-merger-search-engine-optimization-won-t-work-forever.html | title=HuffPo's Achilles' Heel | last=Manjoo | first=Farhad |authorlink= Farhad Manjoo | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=February 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=lure/>

''The Huffington Post'' subsumed many of AOL's ''Voices'' properties, including ''AOL Black Voices'', which was established in 1995 as [[Blackvoices.com]], and ''AOL Latino'', ''Impact'' (launched in 2010 as a partnership between ''Huffington Post'' and [[Causecast]]), ''Women'', ''Teen'', ''College'', ''Religion'', and the Spanish-language ''Voces (en espa√±ol)''. The ''Voices'' brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of ''Gay Voices'', dedicated to [[LGBT]]-relevant articles.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/causecast-ryan-scott_b_1382897 | title= Social Good Stars: Causecast CEO Ryan Scott on the Future of Cause Marketing | first=Amy | last=Neumann | work=HuffPost | date=March 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=McGann | first=Laura |url=https://www.niemanlab.org/2010/03/huffington-post-outsources-section-to-online-fundraising-organization/ | title=Huffington Post outsources section to online fundraising organization | work=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] |date=December 20, 2013}}</ref>

By late 2013, the website operated as a "stand-alone business" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing "premium advertising".<ref>{{cite news | first=Lucia | last=Moses | url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/huffpost-takes-more-control-destiny-new-ad-staff-separate-aol-154443/ | title=HuffPost Takes More Control of Destiny With New Ad Staff Separate From AOL | work=[[Adweek]] | date=December 12, 2013 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>
