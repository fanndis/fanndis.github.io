'''''Family Guy''''' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] that premiered on television on January 31, 1999. The series is produced by [[Fuzzy Door Productions]] and [[20th Television]], and is syndicated by the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox.com/familyguy/about |title=About the Show |publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102043038/http://www.fox.com/familyguy/about/ |archivedate=November 2, 2012}}</ref>

The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a family consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[pet dog]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its surreal and [[dark humor]] in the form of [[metafictional]] [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, [[The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry & Steve'']]. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. ''Family Guy'''s cancellation was announced shortly after the [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]] had aired in 2002, with [[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein|one unaired episode]] eventually premiering on [[Adult Swim]] in 2003, finishing the series' original run. Favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] from syndicated reruns since then convinced Fox to revive the show in 2004; a [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth season]] would begin airing the following year on May 1, 2005.

Since its premiere, ''Family Guy'' has been widely acclaimed. The series has been nominated for 12 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 11 [[Annie Award]]s, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]], the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1961. In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Family Guy'' the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.<ref name="tvguide1">{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx |title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time |publisher=TV Guide |date=September 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710095501/https://www.tvguide.com/news/greatest-cartoons-tv-guide-magazine-1071203/ |archive-date=July 10, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> The series has also attracted [[Family Guy controversies|criticism and controversy]] for its offensive content, violence, and writing.

Many [[tie-in]] media have been released, including ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', a [[direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]] special released in 2005; ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and [[Walter Murphy]]; a [[Family Guy Video Game!|video game]] and [[pinball machine]], released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by [[HarperCollins|Harper Adult]]; and ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy]]'' (2010), a collection of three episodes parodying the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', featuring [[Cleveland Brown]], aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013.

The show revolves around the adventures of the [[Griffin family]], consisting of father [[Peter Griffin]], a bumbling and clumsy yet well-intentioned [[blue-collar worker]]; [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], a pretty stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy [[Pewterschmidt family]]; [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], their often-bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family; [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, is simply a younger version of his father; and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who is an adult-mannered [[Mad scientist|evil genius]] and uses stereotypical [[Archenemy|archvillain]] phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, [[Martini (cocktail)|martini-swilling]], sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], though he is still considered a pet in many ways.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |title=Fox revisits ''Family Guy'' Company |newspaper=USA Today}}</ref>

The primary setting of ''Family Guy'' is Quahog ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|h|ɒ|ɡ}}  [pron. ko-hog or kwo-hog]), a [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional city]] in [[Rhode Island]] that was founded by Peter's ancestor, Griffin Peterson.

These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.<ref name="AOL">{{cite web|url=http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |title='American Dad' and 'Family Guy' Creator Seth MacFarlane Is Animated About Work and Play |website=The TV Tattler |publisher=AOL|accessdate=August 8, 2010 |date=August 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510223108/http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |archivedate=May 10, 2011 }}</ref> The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.<ref name="Road to"/>

MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like "[[Death Has a Shadow]]" and "[[Mind Over Murder]]". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.<ref name=TVIGNFest>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/696/696615p1.html|title=William S.

Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on the ''Family Guy'' staff.

During the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed "a colossal dick move" in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

===Early history and cancellation===
''Family Guy'' officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] on January 31, 1999, with "[[Death Has a Shadow]]". The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.<ref name="Family Guy may return">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm |title='Family Guy' may return  |work=USA Today |date=November 18, 2003 |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |first1=Gary |last1=Levin |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69hpTQTOz?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm |archive-date=August 6, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The show returned on April 11, 1999, with "[[I Never Met the Dead Man]]". ''Family Guy'' garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30&nbsp;pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between ''The Simpsons'' and ''[[The X-Files]]''.<ref name="history"/> At the end of its first season the show ranked at No. 33 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], with 12.8 million households tuning in.<ref name="Geocities">{{cite news |url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html |work=[[GeoCities]] |date=March 24, 2004 |title=1998–99 Ratings |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029011819/http://geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html |archivedate=October 29, 2009}}</ref> The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9&nbsp;pm, on September 23, 1999. ''Family Guy'' was pitted against NBC's ''[[Frasier]]'', and the series' ratings declined sharply.<ref name="history"/> Subsequently, Fox removed ''Family Guy'' from its schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30&nbsp;pm on Tuesdays, where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s then-new breakout hit ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'', coming in at No. 114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} Fox announced that the show had been canceled in May 2000, at the end of the second season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=109DC26AF6A16776&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D |title=''Family Guy'' Returns, Just As Funny As Ever |work=Boston Globe |first=Matthew |last=Gilbert |accessdate=August 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007223416/http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=109DC26AF6A16776&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D |archive-date=October 7, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, following a last-minute reprieve, on July 24, 2000, Fox ordered 13 additional episodes of ''Family Guy'' to form a third season.<ref name="Family Guy may return"/>

The show returned on November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00&nbsp;pm. This slot brought it into competition with ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'' (a situation that was later referenced in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'').<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/dvd-reviews/family-guy-presents-stewie-griffin-the-untold-story/2006/01/23/1137864848861.html |publisher=Fairfax Media |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |title=Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story |first=Michael |last=Idato |date=January 23, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511220807/http://www.theage.com.au/news/dvd-reviews/family-guy-presents-stewie-griffin-the-untold-story/2006/01/23/1137864848861.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> During its second and third seasons, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered.<ref name="VanDerWerff, Todd">{{cite web |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/to-surveil-with-lovebrotherly-lovebrian-stewie%2C40698/ |title=To Surveil With Love"/"Brotherly Love"/"Brian & Stewie |author=VanDerWerff, Todd |publisher=[[The Onion]], Inc. |website=[[The A.V.

In December 2007, ''Family Guy'' was again accused of copyright infringement when actor [[Art Metrano]] filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act involving absurd "faux" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "[[Fine and Dandy (song)|Fine and Dandy]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |title=Magician sues over cartoon Jesus |website=Chortle |accessdate=September 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69hqN1rLi?url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/12/06/6128/magician_sues_over_cartoon_jesus |archive-date=August 6, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Arthur Metrano, vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Seth MacFarlane, Steve Callaghan and Alex Borstein |court=[[United States District Court for the Central District of California|United States District Court, Central District of California]] |accessdate=April 27, 2010|date=December 5, 2007|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1206_metrano_fox_wm.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> In July 2009, a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved – "purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work" and "amount and substantiality of the taking" – counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth – "economic impact" – had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers – not Metrano or his act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2009/07/the-amazing-metrano-family-guy-and-fair-use.html |title=The Amazing Metrano, Family Guy, and Fair Use |first=Dave |last=Fagundes |date=July 20, 2009 |website=PrawfsBlawg |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305134349/http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2009/07/the-amazing-metrano-family-guy-and-fair-use.html |archive-date=March 5, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssjr.com/pubdigassets/publications/lawyer_6/withcover.pdf |title=Copyright Lessons from Family Guy Add Insult to Injury to Support Your Fair-Use Defense |author=Andy I.

The original idea for the "Road to" episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope and [[Dorothy Lamour]]. The first episode was directed by [[Dan Povenmire]], who would direct the rest of the "Road to" episodes until the episode "[[Road to Rupert]]", at which point he had left the show to create ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.<ref name="QA">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|title= Q&A: Dan Povenmire|author= Bond, Paul.|date= June 7, 2009|publisher=e5 Global Media|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}{{dead link|date=April 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024123628/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|archivedate=October 24, 2008|publisher=[[RealNetworks]]|website=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Europe|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the "Road to" episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017073610/http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|archivedate=October 17, 2009|publisher=RealNetworks|website=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Germany|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>

The "Road to" episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian, and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family-guy-stewie-and-brians-greatest-adventures |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131223115746/http://uk.ign.com/articles/2010/01/12/family-guy-stewie-and-brians-greatest-adventures|archivedate=December 23, 2013|website=IGN|title=Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |url-status=dead |accessdate=December 23, 2013|date=January 11, 2010}}</ref>

===Humor===
''Family Guy'' uses the filmmaking technique of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]], which occur in the majority of ''Family Guy'' episodes.<ref name=fhm>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |title='Family Guy'{{'}}s Seth MacFarlane interviewed! |website=[[FHM]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831065643/http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |archivedate=August 31, 2009}}</ref> Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.

Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at [[matricide]]. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.<ref name=matee/> ''Family Guy'' often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters [[Fourth wall|break the fourth wall]] by addressing the audience. For example, in "[[North by North Quahog]]", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', ''[[Wonderfalls]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', ''[[Skin (TV series)|Skin]]'', ''[[Girls Club (TV series)|Girls Club]]'', ''[[Cracking Up (TV series)|Cracking Up]]'', ''[[The Pitts]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Get Real (U.S. TV series)|Get Real]]'', ''[[FreakyLinks]]'', ''[[Wanda at Large]]'', ''[[Costello (TV series)|Costello]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', ''[[A Minute with Stan Hooper]]'', ''[[Normal, Ohio]]'', ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]'', ''[[Harsh Realm]]'', ''[[Keen Eddie]]'', ''[[The $treet]]'', ''[[The American Embassy]]'', ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'', ''[[The Tick (2001 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Luis (TV series)|Luis]]'', and ''[[Greg the Bunny]]''. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during ''Family Guy''{{'}}s hiatus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206165055/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|title='Dad' Joins MacFarlane's 'Family'|work=New York Daily News|author=Bianculli, David|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Back in the Fold|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=April 28, 2005|page=W37}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=An amazing comeback cartoon&nbsp;– Why Fox resurrected Family Guy|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|location=Bergen County, New Jersey|date=May 1, 2005|author=Rohan, Virginia}}</ref>

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's "Freakin' sweet", Cleveland's "Oh, that's nasty", and Joe's "Bring it on!"<ref name=matee>{{cite web|publisher=New Corporation|website=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|title=Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=May 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531091252/http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|archive-date=May 31, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode "[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "[[D'oh!]]", to which Lois replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20318518,00.html |title=Tiffani Thiessen Is Expecting a Baby |website=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |author=Jordan, Julie |accessdate=September 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108123507/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20318518,00.html |archive-date=January 8, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
In 2016, a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' study of the 50 TV shows with the most [[Facebook Like]]s found that like other satirical comedies, ''Family Guy'' "is most popular in cities. The show's popularity was more correlated with [[2016 United States presidential election|support for Hillary Clinton]] than any other show".<ref name="katz20161227">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html |title='Duck Dynasty' vs. 'Modern Family': 50 Maps of the U.S. Cultural Divide |last=Katz |first=Josh |date=December 27, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=February 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170329083111/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/26/upshot/duck-dynasty-vs-modern-family-television-maps.html?_r=1 |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> As of 2008, the franchise has generated {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in total revenue, including {{US$|400 million|long=no}} from [[TV syndication]], {{US$|400 million|long=no}} from [[DVD]] sales, and {{US$|200 million|long=no}} from merchandise sales.<ref name="foxnews"/>
