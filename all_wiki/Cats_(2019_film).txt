'''''Cats''''' is a 2019 [[Musical film|musical]] [[fantasy film]] based on the 1981 [[Tony Award]]-winning stage musical [[Cats (musical)|of the same name]] by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], which in turn was based on the poetry collection ''[[Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats]]'' (1939) by [[T. S. Eliot]]. The film is directed by [[Tom Hooper]]—in his second feature musical following ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (2012)—from a screenplay by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]] and Hooper and features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[James Corden]], [[Judi Dench]], [[Jason Derulo]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Ian McKellen]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Rebel Wilson]], and [[Francesca Hayward]].

''Cats'' was theatrically released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 20 December 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received negative reviews from critics, who criticized the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI effects]], plot, and tone, with many calling it [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst films of all time]]. The film was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $75 million on a budget as high as $100 million and is estimated to have lost Universal Pictures as much as $114 million.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Victoria, a young white cat, is dropped in the streets of [[London]] by her owner in the middle of the night. The alley cats witnessing this introduce themselves to her as the "[[Jellicle cats|Jellicles]]". Two toms, meek magician Mr. Mistoffelees who develops a crush on Victoria and the loyal Munkustrap, and two queens, the snooty Cassandra and Demeter, take Victoria under their wing and show her the world of the Jellicles as they hype up the Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where cats compete for the chance to go to the [[Heaviside Layer (Cats)|Heaviside Layer]] and [[reincarnation|be granted a new life]].

Throughout the film, the competitors are introduced and express their contributions to the community: Jennyanydots, a domestic tabby, boosts the productivity of mice and roaches; the Rum Tum Tugger, a flirtatious tom who riles up the others; Grizabella, a glamour cat; Bustopher Jones, a bourgeois cat who boasts about his weight and shares food scraps from the garbage; Skimbleshanks, a tidy ginger cat who [[tap-dance|taps]] along the railway; Gus, an aged theatre cat who has played some of the biggest roles in history; and Macavity, a villainous stray with the power to [[teleportation|apparate]] and who kidnaps the other contestants (save for Tugger) in order to be made the Jellicle Choice by default.

Victoria also happens to meet the mischievous twins Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer who enjoy causing trouble and messing with things in the house of their human family. They convince Victoria to join in the fun, but leave her tangled up in some necklaces when the family dog is alerted to their presence. Luckily, Mr. Mistoffelees comes to rescue Victoria, distracting the dog and escaping with her. They return to the group, just in time to see the arrival of the tribe's wise and beloved [[matriarch]] Old Deuteronomy. The Jellicle Ball commences inside the abandoned Egyptian Theatre.  Victoria dances a ballet solo in the moonlight but is distracted by Cassandra harassing Grizabella, a former member of the tribe who was banished for, among other things, her past allegiance with Macavity. Victoria relates to Grizabella's feelings of abandonment. As Grizabella slinks away into the streets, Old Deuteronomy witnesses their quiet camaraderie and assures Victoria that she can become a Jellicle herself in time.

The Ball is interrupted by [[femme fatale]] Bombalurina, who performs a song and dance number dedicated to Macavity: a distraction to incapacitate the party with [[catnip]]. Macavity arrives, demanding to be made the Jellicle Choice. Old Deuteronomy deems him unworthy and is subsequently kidnapped and placed with Macavity's other victims. As the Jellicles recuperate, distraught over their leader's disappearance, Victoria suggests that Mr. Mistoffelees use his powers to conjure Old Deuteronomy back. He tries a few times, eventually making Old Deuteronomy reappear. The cats rejoice and praise Mr. Mistoffelees; he and Victoria dance together. Meanwhile, a thwarted Macavity and Bombalurina apparate away from his victims, who begin to free themselves by way of Jennyanydots' costume change, leaving his lackey, Growltiger, to walk the plank at the mercy of the emancipated cats.

Grizabella returns to the Egyptian. Victoria vouches for her and urges her to sing her true feelings. Grizabella proceeds to sing a passionate ballad about her mistakes, her former glory, and her beauty, sentiments that touch the hearts of the Jellicles. Old Deuteronomy names Grizabella the Jellicle Choice and sends her off to the Heaviside Layer in a chandelier (repaired by Mr. Mistoffelees' magic to float like a [[hot air balloon]]). Macavity, in one last attempt to reach the Heaviside Layer, leaps onto a rope from the chandelier but falls onto [[Nelson's Column]]. The Jellicles, reunited with their kidnapped brethren, and perched on a lion statue, watch Grizabella ascend as the morning sun appears above the horizon. After the congregation disperses, Old Deuteronomy welcomes Victoria to the tribe.

===Development===
An animated film adaptation based on the musical was initially planned by [[Amblimation]] in the 1990s, but was abandoned with the studio's closure.<ref>{{cite news |last=Errico |first=Maurice |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/33619/cats-will-be-a-movie-and-a-cartoon |title="Cats" Will be a Movie—and a Cartoon |publisher=[[E!

In February 2016, it was reported that [[Tom Hooper]] was in negotiations to direct the film, and was considering actresses, including [[Suki Waterhouse]], to star.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/06/tom-hooper-to-direct-film-version-of-cats-musical-suki-waterhouse |title=Tom Hooper to milk Cats musical for movie version |last=Child |first=Ben |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=7 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507225207/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/06/tom-hooper-to-direct-film-version-of-cats-musical-suki-waterhouse |archive-date=7 May 2019 |url-status=live|date=6 May 2016 }}</ref> In May 2016, Hooper was confirmed as director.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/cats-movie-tom-hooper-1201767798/ |title=Tom Hooper to Direct 'Cats' Movie for Universal |last=McNary |first=Dave |date=6 May 2016 |website=Variety|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223150748/http://variety.com/2016/film/news/cats-movie-tom-hooper-1201767798/|archive-date=23 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite the negative critical reception, the production design (particularly the set decoration), casting, and most of the performances with the musical moments received praise.

Rich Juzwiak of ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'' predicted in early January 2020 that ''Cats'' might become a [[Cult film#"So bad it's good"|cult classic]] like ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', noting that [[sing-along]] screenings of the film were already taking place in [[Toronto]] and [[Los Angeles]] and were selling out.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://themuse.jezebel.com/cats-may-have-a-10th-life-as-a-cult-classic-1840898848|title=Cats May Have a 10th Life as a Cult Classic|last=Juzwiak|first=Rich|date=9 January 2020|work=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]|access-date=15 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200115122013/https://themuse.jezebel.com/cats-may-have-a-10th-life-as-a-cult-classic-1840898848|archive-date=15 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/cats-movie-cult-classic-toronto-revue/|title=Cats is already getting the cult classic treatment in Toronto|last=Wilner|first=Norman|date=11 January 2020|work=Toronto Now|access-date=15 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200112232810/https://nowtoronto.com/movies/features/cats-movie-cult-classic-toronto-revue/|archive-date=12 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> {{asof|2020|02}} Milwaukee's [[Oriental Theatre (Milwaukee)|Oriental Theatre]], [[Coolidge Corner Theatre]] near Boston, and FilmScene in [[Iowa City]] are among notable small theaters showing ''Cats''.
