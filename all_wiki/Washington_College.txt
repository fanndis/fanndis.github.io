'''Washington College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Chestertown, Maryland]]. Maryland granted Washington College its charter in 1782. [[George Washington]] supported the founding of the college by consenting to have the "College at Chester" named in his honor, through generous financial support, and through service on the college's Board of Visitors and Governors. Washington College is the [[Colonial Colleges|10th-oldest college]] in the [[United States]] and was the first college chartered after American independence. The school became [[coeducational]] in 1891.

==History==
[[File:Bronze GW Statue.jpg|thumb|left|A bronze George Washington statue overlooks the campus green.]]
Washington College evolved from the Kent County Free School, an institution of more than 200 years' standing in "Chester Town," which by the college's founding date of 1782 had reached considerable strength and importance as a port city. [[George Washington]] consented to the fledgling college's use of his name, pledged the sum of 50 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] to its establishment, and extended his warm wishes for the "lasting and extensive usefulness" of the institution.<ref>[[George Washington]] to William Smith, August 18, 1782. George Washington Papers, Library of Congress</ref> He later served on Washington College's Board of Visitors and Governors — his only such involvement with an institution of higher learning.

The college's first president, the Reverend [[William Smith (Episcopalian priest)|William Smith]], was a prominent figure in colonial affairs of letters and church, and he had a wide acquaintance among the great men of colonial days, including [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Joining General Washington on the Board of Visitors and Governors of the new college were such distinguished figures as U.S. Senator [[John Henry (Maryland)|John Henry]], Congressman [[Joshua Seney]] and [[William Paca]], Governor of Maryland. The Maryland legislature granted its first college charter upon Washington College in May 1782.<ref>[http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519054204/http://revcollege.washcoll.edu/firstcollege/index.html |date=May 19, 2012 }}</ref> The following spring, on May 14, 1783, the college held its first commencement.

President Smith had envisaged Washington College as the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] Campus of a public “[[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]” with [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] as its Western Shore counterpart, a proposal incorporated into the later institution's 1784 state charter, but the [[Maryland General Assembly|Maryland General Assembly's]] reluctance to provide funding meant this was never more than a paper institution and the relationship ended with Smith's return to Philadelphia in 1789.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tilghman|first1=Tench Francis|title=The Early History of St. John's College in Annapolis|date=1984|publisher=St. John's College Press|location=Annapolis}}</ref>

With his election as first President of the United States, General Washington retired from the Board of Visitors and Governors and accepted the honorary degree of doctor of laws, which a delegation from Chestertown presented to him on June 24, 1789, in New York, then the seat of Congress. Since Washington's last visit to campus, Washington College has hosted five U.S. presidents: [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Harry S Truman]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

The original college building cornerstone was laid in May 1783, it opened in 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a basement fire January 11, 1827.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743-1900}}</ref> The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 on the site of the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Register Listings in Maryland|url={{MHT url|id=557}}|accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref>

===Varsity sports===
[[File:WashingtonCollegeWar.On.The.Shore.jpg|thumb|The annual lacrosse rivalry between Washington College and [[Salisbury University]] is known as '''The War on the Shore'''.]]
Washington College has competed in intercollegiate athletics since the 19th century.  Its oldest current varsity sports are the baseball team, which dates back to at least the early 1870s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/bsb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> and the men's basketball team, which played its 100th season in 2011–12.<ref name="washingtoncollegesports.com">{{cite web|url=http://washingtoncollegesports.com/sports/mbkb/history/alltime_records |title=washingtoncollegesports.com |publisher=washingtoncollegesports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> Men's teams are known as the Shoremen; women's teams are known as the Shorewomen.

While men have been playing varsity sports at Washington College for well over a century, varsity opportunities for women have been a more recent development. The first varsity sports for women&nbsp;– rowing, tennis, and volleyball&nbsp;– were added in the mid-1970s and were followed by the additions of softball, lacrosse, field hockey, and swimming by the mid-1980s. Varsity women's basketball began play during the 1993–94 season, while co-ed sailing was elevated to varsity status four years later. The women's soccer team is the college's newest varsity sport; it began play during the fall of 1998.

Washington College fielded a varsity football team through 1950, a men's track and field team through 1982, and a men's cross country team through 1989. The college previously sponsored varsity men's golf and varsity wrestling.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

14 of Washington College's 17 varsity teams compete in the [[Centennial Conference]]. The men's and women's rowing teams compete in the [[Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference]] (MARC), while the sailing team competes in the [[Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association]] (MAISA) of the [[Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association]] (ICSA).

The rowing and sailing teams host regattas on the [[Chester River]] and call the college's Truslow Boat House and Lelia Hynson Boating Park home.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
