==Early career==
Paulson was Staff Assistant to the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense]] at [[The Pentagon]] from 1970 to 1972.<ref name="nature">[http://www.nature.org/pressroom/leadership/art11950.html "Henry M. Paulson Jr."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626180416/http://www.nature.org/pressroom/leadership/art11950.html |date=June 26, 2010 }}, The Nature Conservancy 2006</ref> He then worked for the administration of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], serving as assistant to [[John Ehrlichman]] from 1972 to 1973.

==Goldman Sachs==
Paulson joined [[Goldman Sachs]] in 1974, working in the firm's Chicago office under James P. Gorter, covering large industrial companies in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Goldman's Alpha War|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2011/05/goldman-sachs-201105|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 2011|first=William D.|last=Cohan}}</ref> He became a partner in 1982. From 1983 until 1988, Paulson led the Investment Banking group for the [[Midwest]] Region, and became managing partner of the Chicago office in 1988. From 1990 to November 1994, he was co-head of Investment Banking, then Chief Operating Officer from December 1994 to June 1998,<ref>[http://www.gs.com/our_firm/investor_relations/financial_reports/docs/prospectus_usa_multipage/USA/Management.html "Management"], Goldman Sachs, 2006</ref> eventually succeeding [[Jon Corzine]] as chief executive.

Paulson Jr."], ''[[Forbes]]'', 2006</ref> His net worth has been estimated at over $700 million.<ref name="Forbes"/>

Paulson has personally built close relations with China during his career. In July 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported "Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has intimate relations with the Chinese elite, dating from his days at Goldman Sachs when he visited the country more than 70 times."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/07/16/ccusdebt116.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=US faces global funding crisis, warns Merrill Lynch | date=July 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

Before becoming Treasury Secretary, he was required to liquidate all of his stock holdings in Goldman Sachs, valued at over $600 million in 2006, in order to comply with conflict-of-interest regulations.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Gelsi |url=http://articles.marketwatch.com/2006-06-30/news/30767746_1_paulson-goldman-sachs-stock-units |title=Paulson files to sell $500 mln of Goldman stock - MarketWatch |publisher=MarketWatch |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=2012-10-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104015012/http://articles.marketwatch.com/2006-06-30/news/30767746_1_paulson-goldman-sachs-stock-units |archive-date=January 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Because of a tax provision passed under President George H.W.

Paulson identified the wide gap between the richest and poorest Americans as an issue on his list of the country's four major long-term economic issues to be addressed, highlighting the issue in one of his first public appearances as Secretary of Treasury.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0803/p03s03-usec.html "New Treasury head eyes rising inequality"], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', August 3, 2006, Retrieved August 3, 2006.</ref>

Paulson conceded that chances were slim for agreeing on a method to reform [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] financing, but said he would keep trying to find [[bipartisan]] support for it.<ref name="cnn-money">{{cite news |author1=Jeanne Sahadi |title=Paulson: Social Security fix needed |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/03/25/pf/soc_sec_trustees_report/index.htm |accessdate=11 December 2018 |work=CNN Money |date=25 March 2008}}</ref>

He also helped to create the [[Hope Now Alliance]] to help struggling homeowners during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=HOPE NOW Alliance Created to Help Distressed Homeowners |url=http://www.fsround.org/media/pdfs/AllianceRelease.pdf |publisher=[[Hope Now Alliance]] |date=October 10, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923125650/http://www.fsround.org/media/pdfs/AllianceRelease.pdf |archive-date=September 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Paulson was known to have persuaded President George W. Bush to allow him to spearhead [[U.S.-China relations]] and initiated and led the U.S.-China [[Strategic Economic Dialogue]], a forum and mechanism under which the two countries addressed global areas of immediate and long-term strategic and economic interest. In spring 2007, Paulson warned an audience at the [[Shanghai Futures Exchange]] that China needed to free up capital markets to avoid losing potential economic growth, saying: "An open, competitive, and liberalized financial market can effectively allocate scarce resources in a manner that promotes stability and prosperity far better than governmental intervention." In September 2008, in light of the economic crisis experienced by the U.S. in the interim, Chinese leaders evidenced hesitation to follow Paulson's advice.<ref>{{Cite news|title=China Shuns Paulson's Free Market Push as Meltdown Burns U.S.|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aCl7bFUJzWRk|first=Zhao|last=Yidi|first2=Kevin|last2=Hamlin|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=September 23, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>  When the U.S. needed to issue a huge volume of bonds to stabilize the financial market, it relied on China, the top holder of [[National debt of the United States|US debt]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=The master of China's US debt might be the next vice president|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/The-master-of-China-s-US-debt-might-be-the-next-vice-president|first=TETSUSHI|last=TAKAHASHI|first2=YUSHO|last2=CHO|publisher=[[The Nikkei]]|date=2018-02-08|accessdate=2018-12-24}}</ref>

===Notable statements===
In April 2007, he delivered an upbeat assessment of the economy, saying growth was healthy and the housing market was nearing a turnaround. "All the signs I look at" show "the housing market is at or near the bottom," Paulson said in a speech to a business group in New York. The U.S. economy is "very healthy" and "robust," Paulson said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/paulson-says-us-housing-sector-at-or-near-bottom|title=Paulson says U.S. housing sector 'at or near bottom'|author=Greg Robb|publisher=MarketWatch|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>

In August 2007, Secretary Paulson explained that U.S. subprime mortgage fallout remained largely contained due to the strongest global economy in decades.<ref>{{Cite news| last =Lawder | first = David | title = Paulson sees subprime woes contained | agency = [[Reuters]]| date =August 1, 2007 | url =http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKBJC00005820070801| accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref>

On March 26, 2008, Secretary Paulson said in remarks at the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]],

<blockquote>As we work our way through this turbulence, our highest priority is limiting its impact on the real economy. We must maintain stable, orderly and liquid financial markets and our banks must continue to play their vital role of supporting the economy by making credit available to consumers and businesses. And we must of course focus on housing, which precipitated the turmoil in the capital markets, and is today the biggest downside risk to our economy. We must work to limit the impact of the housing downturn on the real economy without impeding the completion of the necessary housing correction. I will address each of these in turn. Regulators and policy makers are vigilant; we are not taking anything for granted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp887.aspx |title=Remarks by Secretary Henry M.

In May 2008, ''The Wall Street Journal'' wrote that Paulson said U.S. financial markets are emerging from the credit crunch that many economists believe has pushed the country to the brink of recession.  "I do believe that the worst is likely to be behind us," Paulson told the newspaper in an interview.<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/24493133/Paulson_Says_Markets_Emerging_From_Crunch_WSJ.

On November 18, in testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]], Secretary Paulson told lawmakers,

<blockquote>There is no playbook for responding to turmoil we have never faced. We adjusted our strategy to reflect the facts of a severe market crisis always keeping focused on Congress's goal and our goal – to stabilize the financial system that is integral to the everyday lives of all Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1279.aspx |title=Testimony by Treasury Secretary Henry M.

On November 20, 2008, during remarks at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]], Secretary Paulson said,

<blockquote>We are working through a severe financial crisis caused by many factors, including government inaction and mistaken actions, outdated U.S. and global [[financial regulation|financial regulatory systems]], and by the excessive risk-taking of financial institutions. This combination of factors led to a critical stage this fall when the entire U.S. financial system was at risk. This should never happen again. The United States must lead global financial reform efforts, and we must start by getting our own house in order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1285.aspx |title=Remarks by Secretary Henry M.

===Lehman's bankruptcy ===
The support given by the Federal Reserve Board, under Ben Bernanke, and the US Treasury with Paulson at the helm, in the acquisition of [[Bear Stearns]] by [[J.P. Morgan]] and the $200bn facility made available to [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] attracted a great deal of criticism in congress by both Republicans and Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|author=James B.

"Well, as you know, we're working through a difficult period in our financial markets right now as we work off some of the past excesses. But the American people can remain confident in the soundness and the resilience of our financial system."

<br />

In the aftermath of Lehman's failure and the simultaneous purchase of [[Merrill Lynch]] by [[Bank of America]], already fragile credit markets froze, so that companies that had nothing to do with banking but needed financing (e.g. General Electric) could not get daily funding requirements which had the effect of sending the US equity/bond markets into turmoil between September 15, 2008, and September 19, 2008.

===U.S. government economic bailout of 2008===
[[File:President Bush Discusses Economy 2008-9-19.jpg|thumb|Paulson, [[Ben Bernanke]] and [[Christopher Cox]] in September 2008 as President Bush speaks about the economy]]
Paulson, acting as U.S. Treasury Secretary, caused outcries from both the Republican and Democratic Parties as well as the general populace as he tried to get the situation under control.

Through unprecedented intervention by the U.S. Treasury, Paulson led government efforts which he said were aimed at avoiding a severe economic slowdown. After the Dow Jones dropped 30% and turmoil ensued in the global markets, Paulson pushed through legislation authorizing the Treasury to use $700 billion to stabilize the financial system. Working with Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]], he influenced the decision to create a credit facility (bridge loan and [[Warrant (finance)|warrants]]) of US$85 billion to [[American International Group]] so it would avoid filing bankruptcy, after having been told that AIG held teacher pension plans, 401k plans, $1.5 trillion in life insurance plans for Americans, and the French Finance Minister called to let Paulson know that AIG held the interests of many Eurozone countries.

On September 19, 2008, Paulson called for the U.S. government to use hundreds of billions of Treasury dollars to help financial firms clean up nonperforming mortgages threatening the liquidity of those firms.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jeanne |last=Sahadi |title=Rescue cost: Hundreds of billions |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/19/news/economy/paulson_plan_cost/index.htm |publisher=CNN |date=September 19, 2008 }}</ref> Because of his leadership and public appearances on this issue, the press labeled these measures the "[[Proposed bailout of U.S. financial system (2008)|Paulson financial rescue plan]]" or simply the Paulson Plan.<ref>{{ cite news |title =Paulson plan| work = [[Google News]] search |url=https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&num=100&lr=&as_filetype=&ft=i&as_sitesearch=&as_qdr=all&as_rights=&as_occt=any&cr=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&safe=off&q=paulson-plan&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wn }}{{Failed verification|date=July 2010}}</ref>

With the passage of [[H.R. 1424]], Paulson became the manager of the [[United States Emergency Economic Stabilization fund]].

As Treasury Secretary, he also sat on the newly established [[Financial Stability Oversight Board]] that oversaw the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]].

Paulson agreed with Bernanke that the only way to unlock the frozen capital markets was to provide direct injections into financial institutions so investors would have confidence in these institutions. The government would take a non-voting share position, with 5% dividends for the first year on the money lent to the banks and 9% thereafter until the banks stabilized and could repay the government loans. According to the book ''Too Big To Fail'', Paulson, Bernanke, New York Federal Reserve Chairman Timothy Geithner, and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair attended the meeting on October 13, 2008, at which this plan was presented to the CEOs of nine major banks.

====Conflict of interest claims====
It has been pointed out that Paulson's plan could potentially have some [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], since Paulson was a former CEO of [[Goldman Sachs]], a firm that might benefit largely from the plan. Economic columnists called for more scrutiny of his actions.<ref>{{cite news

The [[Goldman Sachs]] benefit from the AIG bailout was recently estimated as US$12.9 billion and GS was the largest recipient of the public funds from AIG.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/03/german_and_fren.html|title=German and French banks got $36 billion from AIG Bailout|author=Michael Mandel|date=March 15, 2009|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref> Creating the [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) forming the basis of the current crisis was an active part of Goldman Sach's business during Paulson's tenure as CEO.
Opponents argued that Paulson remained a Wall Street insider who maintained close friendships with higher-ups of the bailout beneficiaries. Some time after the passage of a rewritten bill, the press reported that the Treasury was now proposing to use these funds ($700 billion) in ways other than what was originally intended in the bill.<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Dunbar|title=Uses for $700 billion bailout money ever shifting|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-10-25-bailout-plan_N.htm|agency=Associated Press|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2008|accessdate=November 14, 2010}}</ref>
