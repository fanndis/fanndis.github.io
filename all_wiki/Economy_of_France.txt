== Rise and decline of dirigisme ==
France embarked on an ambitious and very successful program of modernization under state coordination. This programm of ''[[dirigisme]]'', mostly implemented by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects.

The 1981 election of president [[François Mitterrand]] saw a short-lived increase in governmental control of the economy, nationalizing many industries and private banks. This form of increased ''dirigisme'', was criticized as early as 1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce ''dirigisme'' and start an era of [[austerity|rigueur]] ("rigor") or corporation. As a result, the government largely retreated from economic intervention; ''dirigisme'' has now essentially receded, though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.

Despite being a widely liberalized economy, the government continues to play a significant role in the economy: government spending, at 56% of GDP in 2014, is the second-highest in the European Union. Labor conditions and wages are highly regulated. The government continues to own shares in corporations in several sectors, including energy production and distribution, automobiles, transportation, and telecommunications. However these shareholdings are being rapidly sold, the state keeping mostly symbolic stakes in those companies (aside from rail transportation and energy).

In April and May 2012, France held a [[2012 French presidential election|presidential election]] in which the winner [[François Hollande]] had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France's budget deficit by 2017. The new government stated that it aimed to cancel recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over a million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases; and building additional public housing for the poor.

In June 2012, Hollande's [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] won an overall majority in the [[2012 French legislative election|legislative elections]], giving it the capability to amend the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] and allowing immediate enactment of the promised reforms. French government bond interest rates fell 30% to record lows,<ref>Bloomberg (2012) [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GFRN10:IND French government bond interest rates] (graph)</ref> less than 50 [[basis point]]s above German government bond rates.<ref>Bloomberg (2012) [https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GDBR10:IND German government bond interest rates] (graph)</ref>

In July 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the French government issued 10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its history (which means that investors buying French bonds will pay, rather than receive, interest for owning French sovereign debt).<ref>[https://www.france24.com/en/20190704-france-issues-first-10-year-bond-negative-interest-rate France issues first 10-year bond at negative interest rate], [[France 24]], 4 July 2020</ref>

=== National debt ===

The Government of France has run a [[budget deficit]] each year since the early 1970s. As of 2019, French government debt reached €2,331&nbsp;billion an equivalent of 99.2% of French GDP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/GGXWDG_NGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/FJI/COL/FRA|title=World Economic Outlook (April 2019) – General government gross debt |website=imf.org|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>

Under European Union rules, member states are supposed to limit their debt to 60% of output or be reducing the ratio structurally towards this ceiling, and run public deficits of no more than 3.0% of GDP.<ref name="france1">{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20120928-french-debt-jumps-minister-promises-meet-deficit-target|title=French debt jumps, minister promises to meet deficit target|date=28 September 2012|publisher=FRANCE 24|accessdate=27 November 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

In late 2012, [[Credit rating agency|credit-rating agencies]] warned that growing French government debt levels risked [[List of countries by credit rating|France's AAA credit rating]], raising the possibility of a future credit downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French government.<ref>{{cite news|last=John |first=Mark |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/26/us-france-debt-idUSBRE89P0SO20121026 |title=Analysis: Low French borrowing costs risk negative reappraisal |work=Reuters |date= 26 October 2012|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> In 2012 France was downgraded by ratings agencies Moody's, Standard&Poor's, and Fitch to the AA+ credit rating.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16552623 | work=BBC News | title=France loses AAA rating as euro governments downgraded | date=13 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-12/france-loses-top-credit-rating-as-fitch-cites-lack-of-growth.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Mark | last=Deen | title=France Loses Top Credit Rating as Fitch Cites Lack of Growth | date=12 July 2013}}</ref>

The leading industrial sectors in France are telecommunications (including communication satellites), aerospace and defense, ship building (naval and specialist ships), pharmaceuticals, construction and civil engineering, chemicals, textiles, and automobile production. The [[chemical industry]] is a key sector for France, helping to develop other manufacturing activities and contributing to economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invest-in-france.org/Medias/Publications/227/Chemical%20Industry.pdf|title=Chemical industry|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820153526/http://www.invest-in-france.org/Medias/Publications/227/Chemical%20Industry.pdf|archive-date=20 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[Research and development]] spending is also high in France at 2.26% of GDP, the fourth-highest in the OECD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article511|title=France in the United States: Economy|publisher=[[French Embassy, Washington, D.C.|Embassy of France in Washington]]|accessdate=23 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009235442/http://ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article511|archive-date=9 October 2011}}</ref>

Industry contributes to French exports: as of 2018, the [[Observatory of Economic Complexity]] estimates that France's largest exports "are led by [[Aeroplanes|Planes]], [[Helicopters]], and/or [[Spacecraft]] ($43.8B), [[Cars]] ($26B), Packaged [[Medicaments]] ($25.7B), Vehicle Parts ($16.5B), and [[Gas Turbine]]s ($14.4B)."<ref>[https://oec.world/en/profile/country/fra Country profile: France], [[Observatory of Economic Complexity]] (page retrieved on 28 Septembre 2020)</ref>

[[Sophia Antipolis]] is the major technology hub for the economy of France.

===Energy===
{{Further|Energy in France}}

France is the world-leading country in nuclear energy, home of global energy giants [[Areva]], [[Électricité de France|EDF]] and [[GDF Suez]]: [[nuclear power]] now accounts for about 78% of the country's electricity production, up from only 8% in 1973, 24% in 1980, and 75% in 1990. [[Radioactive waste|Nuclear waste]] is stored on site at reprocessing facilities.
Due to its [[Nuclear power in France|heavy investment]] in nuclear power, France is the smallest emitter of [[Greenhouse gas|carbon dioxide]] among the seven most industrialized countries in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/air_co2_emissions.htm|title=CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita in 2006|publisher=United Nations|date=August 2009|work=Environmental Indicators: Greenhouse Gas Emissions}}</ref>

In 2006 electricity generated in France amounted to 548.8 [[Watt-hour#Multiples|TWh]], of which:<ref>Source: [http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/energie/statisti/pdf/elec-analyse-stat.pdf ''L’Electricité en France en 2006 : une analyse statistique'']</ref>
*428.7 TWh (78.1%) were produced by [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear]] power generation
*60.9 TWh (11.1%) were produced by hydroelectric power generation
*52.4 TWh (9.5%) were produced by fossil-fuel power generation
**21.6 TWh (3.9%) by coal power
**20.9 TWh (3.8%) by natural-gas power
**9.9 TWh (1.8%) by other fossil fuel generation (fuel oil and gases by-products of industry such as [[blast furnace gas]]es)
*6.9 TWh (1.3%) were produced by other types of power generation (essentially [[waste-to-energy]] and [[wind turbine]]s)
**The electricity produced by wind turbines increased from 0.596 TWh in 2004, to 0.963 TWh in 2005, and 2.15 TWh in 2006, but this still accounts only for 0.4% of the total production of electricity (as of 2006).

In November 2004, [[Électricité de France|EDF]] (which stands for Electricité de France), the world's largest utility company and France's largest electricity provider, was floated with huge success on the French stock market. Notwithstanding, the French state still retains 70% of the capital.

Other electricity providers include [[Compagnie nationale du Rhône]] (CNR) and [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] (through [[Société nationale d'électricité et de thermique|SNET]]).

=== Agriculture ===
{{See also|French wine}}
[[File:Villiers Le Bacle le 14 juillet 2008 - 21.jpg|thumb|A wheat field in [[Villiers-le-Bâcle]]. France is the EU's largest agricultural producer.]]
[[File:Demi Castelviel Gabriel Coulet.jpg|thumb|[[Roquefort]] cheese]]

France is the world's sixth largest agricultural producer and EU's leading agricultural power, accounting for about one-third of all agricultural land within the EU. In the early 1980s, France was the leading producer of the three principal grains of wheat, barley, and maize. Back in 1983, France produced around 24.8&nbsp;million tonnes, which was a long way ahead of the United Kingdom and West Germany, the next two largest wheat producers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ilbery|first=Brian|title=Western Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press, New York|year=1986|isbn=0-19-823278-0|location=New York, United States|pages=[https://archive.org/details/westerneuropesys0000ilbe/page/ Pg. 41-42]|url=https://archive.org/details/westerneuropesys0000ilbe/page/}}</ref>

Northern France is characterized by large wheat farms. Dairy products, pork, poultry, and apple production are concentrated in the western region. Beef production is located in central France, while the production of fruits, vegetables, and wine ranges from central to southern France. France is a large producer of many agricultural products and is currently expanding its forestry and fishery industries. The implementation of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) and the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) have resulted in reforms in the agricultural sector of the economy.

As the world's second-largest agricultural exporter, France ranks just after the United States.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://info.france2.fr/encadres/L-Agriculture-en-chiffres-51414796.html L'Agriculture en chiffres]</ref> The destination of 49% of its exports is other [[EU members]] states. France also provides agricultural exports to many poor African countries (including its former colonies) which face serious food shortages. Wheat, beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products are the principal exports.

Exports from the United States face stiff competition from domestic production, other EU member states, and third-world countries in France. US agricultural exports to France, totaling some $600&nbsp;million annually, consist primarily of soybeans and soybean products, feeds and fodders, seafood, and consumer products, especially snack foods and nuts. French exports to the United States are much more high-value products such as [[French cheese|its cheese]], processed products and [[French wine|its wine]].

The French agricultural sector receives almost €11&nbsp;billion in EU subsidies. France's competitive advantage is mostly linked to the high quality and global renown of its produce, such as cheese and wine.

France produced, in 2018, 39.5&nbsp;million tons of [[sugar beet]] (2nd largest producer in the world, just behind Russia), which serves to produce sugar and [[ethanol]]; 35.8&nbsp;million tons of wheat (5th largest producer in the world); 12.6&nbsp;million tons of maize (11th largest producer in the world); 11.2&nbsp;million tons of [[barley]] (2nd largest producer in the world, only behind Russia); 7.8&nbsp;million tons of potato (8th largest producer in the world); 6.2&nbsp;million tons of grape (5th largest producer in the world); 4.9&nbsp;million tons of [[rapeseed]] (4th largest producer in the world, behind Canada, China and India); 2.2&nbsp;million tons of [[sugarcane]]; 1.7&nbsp;million tons of apple (9th largest producer in the world); 1.3&nbsp;million tons of [[triticale]] (4th largest producer in the world, only behind Poland, Germany and Belarus); 1.2&nbsp;million tons of [[sunflower seed]] (9th largest producer in the world); 712 thousand tons of [[tomatoes]]; 660 thousand tons of [[linen]]; 615 thousand tons of dry [[pea]]; 535 thousand tons of carrot; 427 thousand tons of [[oats]]; 400 thousand tons of [[soy]]; in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC/ France production in 2018, by FAO]</ref>

=== Tourism ===
{{Main|Tourism in France}}
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Palace of Versailles]] is one of the most popular tourist destinations in France. France is the top tourist destination in the world.]]

France is the world's most popular tourist destination with more than 83.7&nbsp;million foreign tourists in 2014,[http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2015/04/08/20005-20150408ARTFIG00013-la-france-toujours-premiere-destination-touristique-au-monde.php] ahead of Spain (58.5&nbsp;million in 2006) and the United States (51.1&nbsp;million in 2006). This figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours in France, such as northern Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy during the summer.

France is home to cities of much cultural interest (Paris being the foremost), beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity. France also attracts many religious pilgrims to [[Lourdes]], a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées département, which hosts several million visitors a year.

According to figures from 2003, some popular tourist sites include (in visitors per year):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/deps/mini_chiff_03/fr/musee.htm|title=Musées et Monuments historiques|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224180811/http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/deps/mini_chiff_03/fr/musee.htm|archive-date=24 December 2007}}</ref> [[Eiffel Tower]] (6.2&nbsp;million), [[Louvre]] Museum (5.7&nbsp;million), [[Palace of Versailles]] (2.8&nbsp;million), [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] (2.6&nbsp;million), [[Musée d'Orsay]] (2.1&nbsp;million), [[Arc de Triomphe]] (1.2&nbsp;million), [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Centre Pompidou]] (1.2&nbsp;million), [[Mont-Saint-Michel]] (1&nbsp;million), [[Château de Chambord]] (711,000), [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (683,000), [[Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg]] (549,000), [[Puy-de-Dôme (mountain)|Puy de Dôme]] (500,000), [[Musée Picasso]] (441,000), [[Carcassonne]] (362,000).  However, the most popular site in France is [[Disneyland Paris]], with 9.7&nbsp;million visitors in 2017<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.statista.com/statistics/236162/attendance-at-the-paris-disneyland-park-theme-park/|title=Disneyland Park Paris attendance}}</ref>

=== Arms industry ===
[[File:IAF Rafale aircraft touching down at Air Force Station Ambala on its arrival on 29 July 2020 (cropped).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Dassault Rafale]]]]
The French arms industry's main customer, for whom they mainly build warships, guns, nuclear weapons and equipment, is the French government.

Record high defence expenditure (currently{{When|date=May 2018}} at €35&nbsp;billion), which was considerably increased under the government of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], goes largely to the French arms industries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

During the 2000–2015 period, France was the fourth largest [[Arms industry#World's largest arms exporters|weapons exporter]] in the world.<ref>[http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php SIPRI Arms Transfers Database], data 2000–10.

French manufacturers export great quantities of weaponry to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Greece, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Singapore and many others.

It was reported that in 2015, French arms sales internationally amounted to 17.4&nbsp;billion U.S. dollars,<ref>[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2016/01/20/France-doubles-arms-sales-in-2015/9501453304801/ France doubles arms sales in 2015], UPI.com</ref> more than double the figure of 2014.<ref>[http://www.france24.com/en/20150503-arms-sales-becoming-france-new-el-dorado-but-what-cost-francois-hollande-saudi-arabia-rafale Arms sales becoming France’s new El Dorado, but at what cost?], [[France24]]</ref> [[Vice News]] explained that "While the United Kingdom has lapsed somewhat in this regard, France has maintained a high-level of production of military equipment for land, air, and sea defense – an expensive approach that relies on the export of arms and technology."<ref>[https://news.vice.com/article/if-the-us-wont-sell-you-weapons-france-might-still-hook-you-up If the US Won't Sell You Weapons, France Might Still Hook You Up], [[Vice News]]</ref>

=== Fashion and luxury goods ===
{{Main|French fashion}}

According to 2017 data compiled by [[Deloitte]], [[Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey]] (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.<ref name="mode">[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ar/Documents/Consumer_and_Industrial_Products/Global-Powers-of-Luxury-Goods-abril-2019.pdf Global Powers of Luxury Goods 2019: Bridging the gap between the old and the new], [[Deloitte]]</ref> Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales ([[LVMH]], [[Kering SA]], [[L'Oréal]]), more than any other country in the world.<ref name="mode"/>

[[File:Gare de l'Est Paris 2007 a5.jpg|thumb|right|Two high-speed [[TGV]] trains by [[Alstom|Alstom SA]] at [[Gare de l'Est|Paris-Gare de l'Est]]]]

Transportation in France relies on one of the densest networks in the world with 146&nbsp;km of road and 6.2&nbsp;km of rail lines per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It is built as a web with Paris at its center.<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/france_829/decouvrir-france_4177/france-a-z_2259/economie_2624/les-grands-secteurs-economiques_5945.html Les grands secteurs économiques] ''Ministère des Affaires étrangères'' Retrieved 4 November 2007</ref> The highly subsidised [[rail transport in France|rail transport network]] makes up a relatively small portion of travel, most of which is done by car. However the high-speed [[TGV]] trains make up a large proportion of long-distance travel, partially because intercity buses were prevented from operating until 2015.

With 3,220 kilometers of [[high-speed train]] lines, France boast the 2nd most expansive network in the world, only after China.<ref>[https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-high-speed-rail-development-worldwide Fact Sheet: High Speed Rail Development Worldwide], Environmental and Energy Institute</ref>

[[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] is one of the busiest airports in the world by passenger traffic.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.panynj.gov/content/dam/airports/statistics/statistics-general-info/annual-atr/ATR2019.pdf|title=2019 Annual Airport Traffic Report|publisher=Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|year=2020|location=United States}}</ref> Charles de Gaulle airport is third globally in the number of destinations served, and first in the number of countries served with non-stop flights.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anna.aero/2017/02/15/frankfurt-paris-cdg-lead-s17-airport-analysis/|title=Frankfurt and Paris CDG lead global analysis of airports in S17|date=15 February 2017|website=anna.aero|language=en-GB}}</ref>

France also boasts a number of seaports and harbours, including [[Bayonne]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], [[Brest, Finistère|Brest]], [[Calais]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville]], [[Dunkerque]], [[Fos-sur-Mer]], [[La Pallice]], [[Le Havre]], [[Lorient]], [[Marseille]], [[Nantes]], Nice, Paris, [[Port-la-Nouvelle]], [[Port-Vendres]], [[Roscoff]], [[Rouen]], [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Sète]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Toulon]]. There are approximately 470 airports in France and by a 2005 estimate, there are three heliports. 288 of the airports have paved runways, with the remaining 199 being unpaved. The national carrier of France is [[Air France]], a full service global airline which flies to 20 domestic destinations and 150 international destinations in 83 countries (including [[Overseas France]]) across all 6 major continents.

== Foreign Investment==

According to a study conducted by [[Ernst & Young]], France was in 2020 the largest [[Foreign Direct Investment]] recipient in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany.<ref name="FDI">[https://www.ey.com/en_gl/attractiveness/20/how-can-europe-reset-the-investment-agenda-now-to-rebuild-its-future How can Europe reset the investment agenda now to rebuild its future?], [[Ernst&Young|EY]], 28 May 2020</ref> 
EY attributed this as a "direct result of [[Emmanuel Macron|President Macron]]’s reforms of labor laws and corporate taxation, which were well received by domestic and international investors alike."<ref name="FDI"/>

France scored 5th in the 2019 [[AT Kearney]] FDI Confidence Index, up 2 notches from its 2017 ranking.<ref>[https://www.kearney.com/foreign-direct-investment-confidence-index/2019-full-report The 2019 Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index: Facing a growing paradox], [[AT Kearney]]</ref>

==Labour market==
According to a 2011 report by the American [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS), France's GDP per capita at [[purchasing power parity]] is similar to that of the UK, with just over US$35,000 per head.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Comparisons of GDP per Capita, and per Hour, 1960–2011 |url=http://www.bls.gov/fls/intl_gdp_capita_gdp_hour.pdf |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=7 November 2012}}</ref> To explain why French per capita GDP is lower than that of the United States, the economist [[Paul Krugman]] stated that "French workers are roughly as productive as US workers", but that the French have allegedly a ''lower workforce participation rate'' and "when they work, they work fewer hours". According to Krugman, the difference is due to the French making "different choices about retirement and leisure".<ref name="Paul">{{cite news|title=GDP Per Capita, Here and There|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/gdp-per-capita-here-and-there/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 January 2011|author=Paul Krugman}}</ref>

French employment rates for the working age population is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2020, only 64.4% of the French working age population were in employment, compared to 77% in Japan, 76.1% in Germany, 75.4% in the UK, but the French employment rate was higher than that of the US, which stood at 62.5%.<ref>{{cite web |author=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |year=2020 |url=http://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm |title=OECD Employment rate|format=PDF |accessdate=26 September 2020}}</ref> This gap is due to the low employment rate for 15–24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Since his [[French presidential election 2017|election in 2017]], [[Emmanuel Macron]] has introduced several labour market reforms which proved successful in decreasing the unemployment rate before the global [[COVID-19 recession]] struck.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/02/20/emmanuel-macrons-reforms-are-working-but-not-for-him Emmanuel Macron’s reforms are working, but not for him], [[The Economist]], 20 February 2020</ref> In late 2019, the French unemployment rate, though still high compared to other developed economies, was the lowest in a decade.<ref>

During the 2000s and 2010s, [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian economists]] sought out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France. Keynesian economists's theories led to the introduction of the [[35-hour workweek]] law in 1999.

In early April 2014, employers' federations and unions negotiated an agreement with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing an extension of their work time through [[smartphone]] communication outside of official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around 250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with staff during this time.<ref>{{cite news|title=When the French clock off at 6&nbsp;pm, they really mean it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2014/apr/09/french-6pm-labour-agreement-work-emails-out-of-office?CMP=fb_gu|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014|author=Lucy Mangan}}</ref>

== External trade ==
{{see also|List of exports of France}}

France is the 5th largest trading nation in the world, as well as the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany).<ref name="wto">[https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/wts2019_e/wts2019_e.pdf World Trade Statistical Review 2019], [[World Trade Organization]], p. 11</ref> Its foreign trade balance for goods had been in surplus from 1992 until 2001, reaching $25.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (25.4 G$) in 1998; however, the French [[balance of trade]] was hit by the economic downturn, and went into the red in 2000, reaching a US$15bn deficit in 2003. Total trade for 1998 amounted to $730&nbsp;billion, or 50% of GDP—imports plus exports of goods and services. Trade with European Union countries accounts for 60% of French trade.

In 1998, US–France trade stood at about $47&nbsp;billion – goods only. According to French trade data, US exports accounted for 8.7% – about $25&nbsp;billion – of France's total imports. US industrial chemicals, aircraft and engines, electronic components, telecommunications, computer software, computers and peripherals, analytical and scientific instrumentation, medical instruments and supplies, broadcasting equipment, and programming and franchising are particularly attractive to French importers.

The principal French exports to the US are aircraft and engines, beverages, electrical equipment, chemicals, cosmetics, luxury products and perfume. France is the ninth-largest trading partner of the US.

==''Régions'' economy==
{{main|List of French regions and overseas collectivities by GDP}}

[[File:Nominal GDP per capita, 2015 Eurostat France.png|thumb|left|Nominal GDP per capita, 2015 Eurostat]]

The economic disparity between French regions is not as high as that in other European countries such as the UK, Italy or Germany, and higher than in countries like Sweden or Denmark, or even Spain. However, Europe's wealthiest and second largest regional economy, Ile-de-France (the region surrounding Paris), has long profited from the capital city's economic hegemony.

The most important ''régions'' are Île-de-France (world's 4th and Europe 2nd wealthiest and largest regional economy), [[Rhône-Alpes]] (Europe's 5th largest regional economy thanks to its services, high-technologies, chemical industries, wines, tourism), [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] (services, industry, tourism and wines), [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] (European transport hub, services, industries) and [[Pays de la Loire]] (green technologies, tourism). Regions like [[Alsace]], which has a rich past in industry (machine tool) and currently stands as a high income service-specialized region, are very wealthy without ranking very high in absolute terms.

The rural areas are mainly in [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]], Limousin, and [[Centre-Val de Loire]], and wine production accounts for a significant proportion of the economy in [[Aquitaine]] ([[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux (or claret)]]), [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], and [[champagne (wine region)|champagne]] produced in [[Champagne-Ardennes]].

==Departments economy and cities==

=== Departmental income inequalities ===
{{see also|Departments of France}}
[[File:Eiffel Tower from the Tour Montparnasse, 1 May 2012 N3.jpg|thumb|300px|Paris is France's largest urban economy (and the world's third)]]

In terms of income, important inequalities can be observed among the French [[départements]].

According to the 2008 statistics of the INSEE, the [[Yvelines]] is the highest income department of the country with an average income of €4,750 per month. [[Hauts-de-Seine]] comes second, [[Essonne]] third, Paris fourth, Seine-et Marne fifth. [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] is the wealthiest region in the country with an average income of €4,228 per month (and is also the wealthiest region in Europe) compared to €3,081 at the national level. [[Alsace]] comes second, [[Rhône-Alpes]] third, [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]] fourth, and [[Upper Normandy]] fifth.

The poorest parts of France are the [[Overseas department|French overseas departments]], French Guiana being the poorest department with an average household income of €1,826. In Metropolitan France it is [[Creuse]] in the [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] region which comes bottom of the list with an average household income of €1,849 per month.<ref>[http://www.salairemoyen.com/departement.php?dept=23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104183327/http://www.salairemoyen.com/departement.php?dept=23|date=4 November 2011}}</ref>

=== Urban income inequalities ===
Huge inequalities can also be found among cities.
In the [[Paris metropolitan area]], significant differences exist between the higher standard of living of ''Paris Ouest'' and lower standard of living in areas in the northern [[Banlieue|''banlieues'']] of Paris such as Seine-Saint-Denis.

For cities of over 50,000 inhabitants, [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], a western suburb of Paris, is the wealthiest city in France with an average household income of €5,939, and 35% earning more than €8,000 per month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salairemoyen.com/revenus.php?Commune=92051&Ville=92200+-+NEUILLY+SUR+SEINE |title=Salaire moyen Neuilly-sur-Seine – 92200 (60501 habitants) : 4649 euros / mois par ménage – Tout savoir sur revenu moyen, salaire net, salaire brut et retraite par ville de France |publisher=Salairemoyen.com |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref>
But within Paris, four [[Arrondissements of Paris|''arrondissements'']] surpass wealthy Neuilly-sur-Seine in household income: the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th]], the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th]], the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th]] and the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th]]; the 8th "arrondissement" being the wealthiest district in France (the other three following it closely as 2nd, 3rd and 4th wealthiest ones).

== Wealth ==

=== Overview ===
In 2010, the French had an estimated wealth of US$14.0&nbsp;trillion for a population of 63 million.<ref>Credit Suisse 2010's Global Wealth Report, p. 32.</ref>

*In terms of aggregate wealth, the French are the wealthiest Europeans, accounting for more than a quarter of wealthiest European households.<ref>"Europe as a whole accounts for 35% of the individuals in the global top 1% (of wealthiest households), but France itself contributes a quarter of the European contingent." 2010's Global Wealth Report</ref> Globally, the French nation ranks fourth-wealthiest.<ref>Rankings: 1st: United States with $54.6 trillion for 318 million inhabitants; 2nd: Japan with $21 trillion for 127 million inhabitants; 3rd: China with $16.5 trillion for 1.331 billion inhabitants; 4th: France with $14.0 trillion for 63 million inhabitants.</ref><ref>" Although it has just 1.1% of the world’s adults, France ranks fourth among nations in aggregate household wealth – behind China and just ahead of Germany". 2010's Global Wealth Report. {{cite web |url=http://thewisebuck.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/credit_suisse_global_wealth_report1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427015348/http://thewisebuck.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/credit_suisse_global_wealth_report1.pdf |archive-date=27 April 2011 }}</ref>
*In 2010, wealth per French adult was a little higher than $290,000, down from a pre-crisis high of $300,000 in 2007. According to this ratio, the French are the wealthiest in Europe. The tax on wealth is paid by 1.1M of people in France, the payment of this tax starts when a €1.3M of assets is reached (there is a discount on the principal residence value).
*Almost every French household has at least $1,000 in assets.<ref>2010's Global Wealth Report, p. 32: "Very few households in France are recorded as having less than US$1000 per adult".</ref> Proportionally, there are twice as many French with assets of over $10,000 and four times as many French with assets of over $100,000 than the world average.<ref>2010's Global Wealth Report, p. 32: "The proportion with assets over $10,000 is double the world average, and the proportion with more than $100,000 is four times the global figure".</ref>
*The French are also among the least indebted populations in the developed world with [[Consumer debt|personal debt]] accounting for "little more than 10% of household assets".<ref>2010's Global Wealth Report.</ref>

=== Millionaires ===
France has the third-highest number of millionaires in Europe as of 2017. There were 1.617&nbsp;million millionaire households (measured in terms of US dollars) living in France in 2017, behind the UK (2.225M) and Germany (1.637).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-with-most-millionaires-2017-4|title=The 18 countries with the most millionaires|work=Business Insider|access-date=19 December 2017|language=en}}</ref>

The wealthiest man in France is the [[LVMH]] CEO and owner [[Bernard Arnault]].
