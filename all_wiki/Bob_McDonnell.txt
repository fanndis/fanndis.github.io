==Attorney General (2006–2009)==
{{Main|2005 Virginia Attorney General election}}
In 2005, McDonnell ran for attorney general. He campaigned on issues including protecting children from sexual predators, drug enforcement, identity theft, gang violence, and terrorism. The first result showed him with a victory of 323 votes, out of over 1.9 million votes cast, over his opponent, Democratic [[Senate of Virginia|State Senator]] [[Creigh Deeds]]. Deeds filed for a [[recount]], which began on December 20, 2005.

{{Main|2009 Virginia gubernatorial election|2009 Bob McDonnell gubernatorial campaign}}
McDonnell announced his candidacy for the 2009 Virginia gubernatorial election at American Legion's Boy's State of Virginia 2007, making him the seventh consecutive elected attorney general to run. The statewide candidates, including McDonnell as governor, were selected at a Republican State convention rather than a primary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/30/AR2009053001314.html|title=Robert F.

Less than two weeks later, Creigh Deeds won his party's nomination in a primary, setting up a "rematch" of the state attorney general's race four years earlier.

In early June, Deeds held a slight edge, with a 47%–41% advantage in a Rasmussen poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2009/virginia/toplines/toplines_virginia_governor_election_june_10_2009|title=Toplines – Virginia Governor Election – June 10, 2009 – Rasmussen Reports|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> As the campaign continued, the polls shifted toward McDonnell's favor, with several giving him a commanding lead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2009/virginia/election_2009_virginia_governor_election|title=Election 2009: Virginia Governor Election|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

He supported [[right-to-work law]]s, low operating cost of government and a simplified [[tax code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205193927/http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 5, 2009|title=McDonnell for Governor &#124; Issues|publisher=Bobmcdonnell.com|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> Having lived in various parts of the state, his road-side billboard varied with geographic location, describing him as "Tidewater's Own", "Northern Virginia's Own", and "Fairfax's Own".<ref name="bluecommonwealth.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bluecommonwealth.com/showDiary.do%3FdiaryId=1123.html|title=Bobby McSlick: Virginia's Own – Zelig?|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tooconservative.com/?p=4803|title="Fairfax's Own" Bob McDonnell|date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="McCartney">{{cite news |url=http://www.standard.net/topics/opinion/2009/10/08/can-northern-virginia-trust-mcdonnells-promises |work=The Washington Post|first=Bob|last=McCartney|title=Can Northern Virginia trust McDonnell's promises?|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

McDonnell proposed measures to move $480 million per year from school administration, and put it directly into classrooms; establish more specialized high schools to support high-demand industries; increase online learning through [[virtual school]]s; and support educational mentoring programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news8.net/news/stories/0909/655700.html|title=McDonnell Releases Virginia Education Funding Plan &#124; NewsChannel 8 |publisher=News8.net|date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues/issue_education|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815152324/http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues/issue_education|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 15, 2009|title=McDonnell for Governor &#124; Issues|publisher=Bobmcdonnell.com|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> McDonnell frequently expressed his support for President [[Barack Obama]]'s ideas on increasing parental choice through [[charter school]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/22/AR2009082202242.html |first=Fredrick |last=Kunkle |title=Fact Checker |work=The Washington Post |date=August 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Abortion===
Identifying as [[anti-abortion]], McDonnell campaigned as an opponent of elective abortion. He did not favor standard exceptions on abortion in cases of rape and incest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Governor/Bob_McDonnell_Abortion.htm|title=Bob McDonnell on Abortion|publisher=Ontheissues.org|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> As a state legislator, he had been the lead sponsor for legislation to ban [[late-term abortion|partial birth abortions]], as well as for legislation requiring [[parental consent]] for minors' abortions, and informed consent for women seeking abortions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richmondmagazine.com/?articleID=8820ca41c0c677283494ebf538a97bbf|title=News and Features|publisher=Richmond Magazine|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref>

===Energy===
McDonnell advocated making Virginia the energy capital of the East Coast.<ref name="bobmcdonnell.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues/issue_cardcheck#Making%20Virginia%20the%20Energy%E2%80%A6|title=McDonnell for Governor &#124; Issues|publisher=Bobmcdonnell.com|accessdate=March 4, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311045046/http://www.bobmcdonnell.com/index.php/issues/issue_cardcheck#Making%20Virginia%20the%20Energy%E2%80%A6|archive-date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> He supported [[Offshore drilling on the US Atlantic coast|drilling for oil]] off of the coast of Virginia while simultaneously developing new technologies for [[wind energy|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[biomass]], and other [[renewable energy]] resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/40441792.html|title=McDonnell Asks Candidates to Support Offshore Drilling|publisher=Whsv.com|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> He also intended to expand investments in renewable energy sources and incentivize green job creation.<ref name="bobmcdonnell.com" />

===Gun rights===
According to [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns]], McDonnell sent personal letters to the governors of the other 49 states urging them to follow his state in [[gun show loophole|closing loopholes]] that allowed mentally unstable people to purchase guns. After the [[Virginia Tech shooting]] in 2007, Virginia made this issue a top priority. McDonnell wrote in his letter: "I believe that we can all work together to help prevent these acts from occurring again anywhere in our Nation. I write to ask for your support in providing critical information to the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]]."

However, McDonnell campaigned as a [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] advocate. He held an "A" rating from the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] Political Victory Fund and won their endorsement.<ref>[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/14/nra-endorses-mcdonnell/ NRA endorses McDonnell for Va. governor] Washington Times. September 14, 2009.</ref>

===Gay rights===
McDonnell opposed [[same-sex marriage]]. He advocated a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/mcdonnell-opposes-gay-marriage-despite-poll-showing-split/2011/05/10/AFIy0lhG_blog.html|title=McDonnell: Gay marriage ban was "the right decision"|date=May 10, 2011|last=Kumar|first=Anita|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

===Marijuana===
McDonnell opposed legalizing [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. He later signed a bill that criminalized the use of [[synthetic cannabis]]. It was approved unanimously in both the house and the senate by both political parties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Julian |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2011/03/va-gov-signs-bill-criminalizing-synthetic-marijuana |title=Va. gov. signs bill criminalizing synthetic marijuana &#124; HamptonRoads.com &#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=March 24, 2011 |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2012/01/medical_marijuana_bill_goes_before_virginia_house.php |title=Medical Marijuana Bill Goes Before Virginia House Committee &#124; Marijuana and Cannabis News |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=January 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}</ref>

===Transportation===
McDonnell's campaign also turned to transportation, a major issue in heavily congested areas of Virginia, advocating issuing $3 billion in transportation bonds that had been approved by the Virginia General Assembly in 2007, but not funded with a revenue source, modernizing the Virginia Department of Transportation, and encouraging public-private partnerships to improve infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/28/AR2009072802412.html |title=Virginia's Transportation Mess |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> He supported widening [[Interstate 66|I-66]] inside the Beltway, improving I-95, and finishing the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Metrorail to Dulles Airport]] project.

===Transparency===
McDonnell criticized Governor Tim Kaine for not disclosing his full schedule, and for making out-of-state political appearances as Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. McDonnell stated, "The citizens must be certain that the governor is attending to the duties for which he was elected. The governor is Virginia's chief executive, and represents the commonwealth at all times."<ref name=sched /> However, in March 2010, McDonnell received similar criticism for disclosing very few meetings or political appearances on his publicly released schedule.<ref name=sched>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/06/AR2010030602505.html?wprss=rss_metro/va|title=McDonnell's public schedule omissions draw complaints|work=The Washington Post|page=C1|date=March 7, 2010|first=Anita|last=Kumar}}</ref>

===Thesis===
McDonnell's 1989 thesis for [[Regent University]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/McDonnell_thesis_082909.pdf | work=The Washington Post|title=The Republican Party's Vision for the Family: The Compelling Issue of The Decade|year=1989}}</ref> was a 93-page document titled ''The Republican Party's Vision for the Family: The Compelling Issue of The Decade.'' The document explored the rise in the numbers of divorces and [[illegitimate birth]]s, and examined public policies that may have contributed to that increase and proposed solutions. It gained attention in the campaign because it outlined a 15-point conservative agenda, including 10 points McDonnell pursued during his years in the General Assembly, according to press analysis.<ref name="WP02">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/29/AR2009082902434.html?hpid=topnews "'89 Thesis A Different Side of McDonnell: Va. GOP Candidate Wrote on Women, Marriage and Gays"] by Amy Gardner, ''The Washington Post'', August 30, 2009. Retrieved 8/30/09.</ref>

The agenda included opposition to [[abortion]], support for [[school vouchers]] and [[covenant marriage]], and tax policies that favored heterosexual families.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/29/AR2009082902434_2.html?sid=ST2009082902758|title=Va.

McDonnell also "criticized a [[Griswold v. Connecticut|landmark 1965 Supreme Court decision]]" which legalized the use of contraceptives, writing that "man's basic nature is inclined towards evil, and when the exercise of liberty takes the shape of pornography, drug abuse, or homosexuality, the government must restrain, punish, and deter."

McDonnell responded to the article, stating "Virginians will judge me on my 18-year record as a legislator and attorney general and the specific plans I have laid out for our future – not on a decades-old academic paper I wrote as a student during the [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] and haven't thought about in years."<ref name="WP02" />

''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that McDonnell maintained: "Like everybody, my views on many issues have changed as I have gotten older." McDonnell said that his evolved position on family policy was best represented by his 1995 welfare reform legislation where he "worked to include child day care in the bill so women would have greater freedom to work."<ref name="WP02" />

===Campaign organization and financial support===
McDonnell's campaign headquarters was located in Richmond. His campaign finance report for September 15, 2009, indicated that he had nearly 1,500 more new donors than the Deeds campaign had total donors, a total of 6,239 donors, and 4,946 of them were new.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kumar |first=Anita |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2009/09/mcdonnell_xx_million_in_july-a.html |title=Virginia Politics Blog – McDonnell: $2.9 Million in July–August|work=The Washington Post|date=September 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}</ref> During the campaign, McDonnell's largest individual donor was former coal magnate [[Richard Baxter Gilliam]], who was also McDonnell's fifth largest overall donor after the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_donors/5666?end_year=2009&start_year=2008&lookup_type=year&filing_period=all |title=Virginia Public Access Project; Bob McDonnell |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref> McDonnell received over $1.5 million from the energy and natural resources sector, including $622,198 from coal mining interests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vpap.org/candidates/profile/money_in_industry1/5666?end_year=2009&start_year=2008&lookup_type=year&filing_period=all |title=Virginia Public Access Project; Bob McDonnell |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref>

The McDonnell For Governor campaign printed a variety of bumper stickers appealing to many interest groups, including "Women for McDonnell," "Sportsmen for McDonnell," and "Independents for McDonnell." Some appealed to the diverse minority groups throughout the Commonwealth. Some featured the mascots of select public universities such as the [[University of Virginia]], [[Virginia Tech]], [[James Madison University]], [[Virginia Military Institute]], and [[Old Dominion University]]. "Irish for McDonnell" stickers were printed for the select Virginia residents who attended the [[University of Notre Dame]] as well. His road-side billboard varied with geographic location, describing him as "Tidewater's Own," "Northern Virginia's Own" and "Fairfax's Own."<ref name="Kumar">{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2009/08/post_293.html|title=Virginia Notebook: Where Is McDonnell From?|last=Kumar|first=Anita|date=August 13, 2009|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="bluecommonwealth.com" /><ref name="McCartney" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tooconservative.com/?p=4803|title="Fairfax's Own" Bob McDonnell|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> It was suspected that McDonnell failed to comply with gift disclosure requirements over a $15,000 gift that a major campaign donor, Jonnie Williams Sr., made to cover the cost of catering for his daughter's wedding.

==== Death sentence for Teresa Lewis ====
In a decision that drew controversy, McDonnell declined to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment in the case of [[Teresa Lewis]], who was executed on September 23, 2010. She was the first woman executed in Virginia since 1912. Calls had been made for leniency, citing her below average mental capacity.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2017362,00.html|title=Virginia Woman Faces Execution amid Calls for Leniency|publisher=TIME|date=September 10, 2010|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Abortion===
In 2012, national attention was focused on a bill before the Virginia state legislature, controlled by Republicans, to require a trans-vaginal [[ultrasound]] for any woman contemplating an abortion in Virginia. McDonnell initially supported the bill, but backed off after public protests. He persuaded the legislators to pass instead a slightly watered-down version requiring a less invasive abdominal ultrasound before an abortion and exempting women who were pregnant as a result of rape or incest, provided they reported it to the police. The redrafted bill was opposed by [[pro-choice]] groups and a minority in the legislature, but McDonnell signed it into law on March 7, 2012. McDonnell was called "Governor Vagina", "Governor Ultrasound", and other similar pejorative monikers by legislators opposing the controversial bill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Virginia Gov.

===Voting rights restoration for felons===

===Transportation===
On April 30, 2010, McDonnell authorized issuing $493 million in transportation bonds in May 2010 and an additional $1.493 billion over the five years to finance previously approved transportation projects. The bonds were a part of a transportation package enacted three years previously, but had not been issued while Republican State Delegate [[Robert G. Marshall#Regional tax authorities|Robert Marshall]] filed a lawsuit challenging their constitutionality while certain transportation notes issued during the [[Jim Gilmore|Gilmore Administration]] had not yet been paid off. Critics noted that Virginia lacked a revenue source to [[amortize]] the bonds.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bonds to fund VDOT projects|work=The Washington Post|page=B6|date=May 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/BOND01_20100430-223005/341364|archive-url=https://archive.today/20100502234046/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/state_regional_govtpolitics/article/BOND01_20100430-223005/341364|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 2, 2010|title=McDonnell Authorizes Sale of Transportation Bonds|work=Richmond Times Dispatch|first=Tyler|last=Whitley|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> On December 9, 2010, McDonnell announced a revised transportation funding plan which included both $1.8 billion in bonds that had been approved in 2007, as well as an additional $1.1 billion which he proposed to pay back from future federal transportation funds. He also proposed to spend $150 million of the 2009–2010 budget surplus and $250 million in reserves to protect against gasoline tax revenue shortfalls.<ref>{{cite news|title=McDonnell Outlines Transportation Plans|author=Anita Kumar and Rosalind S.

On May 10, 2010, McDonnell filed an application with the [[Federal Highway Administration]] seeking permission to collect tolls on [[Interstate 95]] near the North Carolina border. The highway had been constructed with taxpayer funds, 90% from the federal government and 10% from Virginia gasoline taxes. However, Virginia claimed that they did not have sufficient revenues to maintain I-95 at a safe level and proposed the toll to raise a projected $30 to $60 million annually. McDonnell asked the Federal Highway Administration to authorize the toll under its "Interstate System Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.virginia.gov/news/viewRelease.cfm?id=163 |title=Governor Files Application to Toll Interstate 95 Near North Carolina Border |publisher=Governor's Office |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513091645/http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=163 |archive-date=May 13, 2010  }}</ref>

In 2008, the federal government and the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] had reached an agreement for federal funding of $1.5 billion in capital improvements contingent on [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and the [[District of Columbia]] pledging to develop dedicated funding for the Metro system. WMATA was created by an [[interstate compact]], a kind of agreement between states similar to a treaty or contract which must also be approved by the U.S. Congress, and founded in 1967 with a board of directors whose members are appointed by each local jurisdiction in its service area, including four from Virginia appointed by the [[Northern Virginia Transportation Commission]] (NVTC). In June 2010, McDonnell threatened to withhold Virginia's WMATA funding unless the composition of WMATA's board was modified to allow Virginia's governor to appoint two of the seats.

===Health care===
In April 2010, McDonnell signed a bill seeking to nullify the insurance purchase requirement in the then proposed federal [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care legislation]].

===Education===
In Virginia, public schools are funded from both local real estate taxes as well as state general funds under a formula that attempts to assure minimum statewide standards called "The Standards of Quality". Virginia also earmarks revenues from its state lottery for education. Outgoing Governor Tim Kaine proposed $11.4 billion for K-12 education in the 2010–2012 budget.<ref name=edbudget>{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/governorrecommendation.pdf|work=The Washington Post|title=K-12 Education|accessdate=June 6, 2010}}</ref> On February 17, 2010, McDonnell proposed $268.8 million in cuts.<ref name=edbudget/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/02/post_595.html|title=After Weeks of Pressure, McDonnell Releases Budget Cut Proposals|first=Anita|last=Kumar|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=June 6, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> McDonnell's cuts included changing the formula for measuring the ability of localities to pay for education, reducing funding for technology expenditures, and reducing funding under the Standards of Quality.<ref name=edbudget/>

Because K-12 education comprised 37% of the general fund budget, critics noted that McDonnell's proposal to fund transportation bonds from the general fund would have resulted in further education cuts in future years. McDonnell disagreed, saying he could lean heavily on growth in revenues rather than pulling from existing money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivianwatts.com/views-budget.htm|title=Vivian's Views on Budget and Taxes|publisher=Del.

===Budget===
On December 18, 2009, outgoing Governor Kaine proposed $76.8 billion of expenditures for adoption by the incoming state legislature. Kaine's budget proposed to rationalize state revenues by increasing the income tax while lowering property taxes and other fees. As incoming governor, McDonnell refused to publicly recommend any modifications to Kaine's budget and instead worked with the House of Delegates to bring Kaine's plan up for a quick vote and defeat. Privately, McDonnell advocated cutting $300 million from health programs, $730 million from K-12 education, changing the state retirement system, and requiring 10 days of furloughs for state employees, to offset budgetary shortfalls for 2010–2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/16/AR2010021605819.html|title=In private, Virginia governor pushes deep budget cuts|date=February 17, 2010|work=Washinigton Post|first=Anita|last=Kumar|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> On February 17, 2010, after political pressure, McDonnell publicly released his proposed cuts.<ref name=edbudget/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbc12.com/Global/story.asp?S=12000608|work=NBC12|title=Gov.

====Liquor sales====
In August 2010, McDonnell embarked on a promotional tour advocating legislation to sell [[Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control|Virginia's liquor stores]] to private owners. McDonnell held eight town hall meetings around the state to discuss the plan.<ref name=wp1023>{{cite news|title=No Va. special session on liquor|date=October 23, 2010|page=B1|author=Rosalind Helderman and Anita Kumar|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> He argued that retail alcohol sales is not an appropriate state activity and proposed that any sales proceeds could be used to finance transportation needs. Opponents noted that the liquor stores generate $248 million per year for Virginia's general fund.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Va. liquor profits set a high bar for McDonnell privatization plan |first=Rosalind |last=Helderman |date=August 5, 2010|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=December 26, 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093006508.html}}</ref>

On September 8, 2010, McDonnell presented his plan for auctioning liquor licenses to his government reform commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/37114205/Proposed-ABC-Privatization-Model-96|title=Proposed ABC Privatization Model|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}</ref> He proposed tripling the number of stores selling liquor to 1,000, with the licenses to operate these new stores being auctioned. According to the ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', "Of the 1,000 licenses, 600 would be available to big retailers, whose lawyers and lobbyists helped craft the governor's proposal. An additional 150 licenses would be reserved for package stores, with 250 for small retailers, such as convenience-store operators."<ref name=liquortd/> McDonnell estimated that winning bidders would pay $265 million for the licenses, and that the state could receive $33 million from selling existing state-owned liquor store properties. In addition, $160 million would be collected in wholesale license fees. To make up from the annual loss of general fund revenues from the current state-owned stores, McDonnell proposed a $17.50 per gallon excise tax (which is above the national average and above that charged in neighboring states) and to charge an annual fee of $500 to $2,000 to each store license holder, imposing a new 1% gross receipts tax on wholesalers of liquor, and a 2.5% tax on restaurants and bars that chose to purchase alcohol from wholesalers instead of retail outlets. Just before the presentation, McDonnell dropped his proposed 1.5% fee on all restaurants and retail establishments that was in earlier drafts of his plan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090306173.html?sid=ST2010090400391|title=Virginia may add to fees on alcohol|first=Anita|last=Kumar|work=The Washington Post|page=A1|date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name=wp99>{{Cite news|title=McDonnell unveils plan to privatize liquor sales|author=Anita Kumar and Rosalind Helderman|work=The Washington Post|page=B1|date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> McDonnell proposed to call a special session of the Virginia legislature in November 2010 to consider the proposal.<ref name=wp99/><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/09/abc_special_session_will_be_in.html |first=Anita |last=Kumar|title=Legislator says ABC special session will be in November|date=September 4, 2010 |work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

The plan drew immediate opposition from conservative lawmakers as a "tax increase". It was also opposed by the Virginia Retail Federation,<ref name=liquortd/> the Virginia Beer Wholesalers Association, and the Virginia Wine Wholesalers Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/09/beer_wine_and_more_democrats_o.html|title=Updated: Beer and wine wholesalers oppose McDonnell's ABC privatization plan |first=Anita |last=Kumar |date=September 16, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2010 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> The Baptist General Association of Virginia and the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy opposed the plan out of concerns that it would increase alcohol consumption.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rural Va. communities' long liquor runs could come to a halt|first=Anita|last=Kumar|work=The Washington Post|date=November 27, 2010 |page=B1}}</ref> The plan was endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/09/fraternal_order_of_police_endo.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Fraternal Order of Police endorses McDonnell liquor privatization|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> the Virginia Transportation Construction Industry, and the Virginia Retail Merchants Association and the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.<ref name=liquortd>{{Cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/sep/11/abcc11-ar-499842/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100913080521/http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2010/sep/11/abcc11-ar-499842/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2010 |title=Virginia retailers split on ABC privatization |first=Jeff |last=Shapiro |date=September 11, 2010 |accessdate=September 12, 2010 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch }}</ref>

On the eve of McDonnell taking the plan to the restructuring commission for their endorsement, ''The Washington Post'' reported that he modified it by dropping the restaurant tax and certain other proposed fees. He also proposed to set aside over 100 licenses for companies that employ less than 50 people in order to help small family owned stores, and wanted to give small businesses several years to pay off their auction bids. The ''Post'' suggested that "he might call off plans for a November special session" of the General Assembly.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/30/AR2010093006508.html |title=To woo more support, McDonnell alters liquor privatization plan|date=September 30, 2010|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=McDonnell alters liquor-sale proposal: Plan could be more palatable to restaurant owners, conservatives|date=October 1, 2010|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|work=The Washington Post|page=B1}}</ref> On October 4, the Malek commission voted 22 to 3 to endorse McDonnell's modified plan.<ref name=wp105>{{cite news|title=McDonnell vows trims to make liquor plan work|work=The Washington Post|first=Anita|last=Kumar|date=October 5, 2010|page=B1|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/04/AR2010100407102.html}}</ref> The Commission proposed a number of cost savings in government operations to offset the projected $47 million annual revenue loss from selling the ABC liquor stores.<ref name=wp105/>

In October 2010, McDonnell's modified plan drew criticism from Republican members of the House of Delegates, including Del. Thomas D. Gear who chaired the House subcommittee that considered the proposal, and Del. Timothy D. Hugo, chairman of the House Republican caucus. Concerns heightened when Phil Cox, who headed McDonnell's political action committee, threatened to withhold campaign funds from Republican delegates who failed to support the modified plan. According to ''The Washington Post'', "Delegates have privately complained that the plan was developed with too little input from legislators and too much from lobbyists for retail and alcohol interests."<ref name=wp1014>{{cite news|title=Liquor Proposal Causing Discord in Virginia GOP|author=Anita Kumar and Rosalind S.

McDonnell's working group of Republican legislators, wholesalers, distillers, and retailers sought to develop a compromise designed to win adoption by the legislature.<ref name=wp1023/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2010/10/mcdonnell-wont-call-soecial-session-privatizing-liquor-sales?cid=rltd|title=McDonnell Won't Call Special Session on Privatizing Liquor Sales|date=October 22, 2010|first=Julian|last=Walker|work=The Virginian-Pilot|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

On November 23, 2010, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee released a report which found that the McDonnell proposal had overstated the expected proceeds of liquor store sales and licenses. In response, McDonnell's spokesman said that he was committed to privatization and was considering alternative plans. McDonnell hired a consultant at a cost of $75,000 to formulate a new privatization plan prior to the legislative session in January 2011. The auditors found that McDonnell's proposal would have increased the retail price of distilled spirits 11 to 26 percent, which in turn would have led to a drop in liquor sales that could have resulted in a loss of as much as $15.4 million in sales tax revenues.<ref>{{cite news|title=McDonnell Plan on Liquor Stores Off by Millions|work=The Washington Post|first=Anita|last=Kumar|date=November 24, 2010|page=B1}}</ref>

In what ''The Washington Post'' described as "the biggest legislative defeat of his tenure", both houses of the Virginia General Assembly refused to hold hearings on McDonnell's plan during the 2011 legislative session. Both the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-controlled Senate killed the bill implementing McDonnell's proposal without a vote. McDonnell's director of policy, Eric Finkbeiner told the ''Post'', "Whether we do it this year, next year or the year after, it's going to get done in this administration."<ref>{{cite news|title=McDonnell's Bid to Privatize Liquor Stores is Rejected|author=Anita Kumar and Rosalind S. Helderman|work=The Washington Post|date=February 9, 2011|page=B1}}</ref>

===Job creation===
McDonnell amended the budget to increase the incentives that a governor was able to provide employers to relocate to or remain in Virginia. He campaigned to have [[Northrop Grumman]] move its 300-job headquarters to Virginia, but stated that the renewal of Virginia's computer outsourcing contract was not linked to the relocation decision.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2010/01/mcdonnell-northrop-grumman-move-it-dispute-not-linked|title=McDonnell: Northrop Grumman Move, IT Dispute Not Linked|author=Olympia Meola and Jeff E.

However, McDonnell was disappointed that Secretary Gates did not meet with him to discuss the issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/09/look_whos_not_coming_to_breakf.html|title=Look Who's Not Coming to Breakfast: Defense Secretary Gates|date=September 27, 2010|first=Rosalind|last=Helderman|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref> McDonnell was later included in a meeting between Gates and Virginia's congressional delegation on November 23, 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Va.

===Redistricting===
McDonnell played a significant role in the redistricting conducted in response to the 2010 census. In a special session of the General Assembly, the redistricting of both the House of Delegates and the State Senate were passed in single bill that was approved by the House with an 86 to 8 vote and the Senate with a 22 to 18 vote.<ref name=redist>{{cite news|title=VA.

Because the Democrats lacked the 2/3 majority necessary to override the veto, the State Senate had to adopt a new plan. At first, Senate Majority Leader Richard L. Saslaw promised to merely readopt the vetoed redistricting map, but then began negotiations with the governor's office about a new plan.<ref name=redist/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/politics/senate-opens-bipartisan-negotiations-on-redistricting/2011/04/25/AFrmp8kE_story.html#pagebreak|title=Senate Opens Bipartisan Negotiations on Redistricting|work=The Washington Post|first=Rosalind S.|last=Helderman|date=April 25, 2011|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> Republican members of the House and Senate criticized the Governor for overturning the timetable for approval of new districts prior to the 2011 elections.<ref name=redist/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/lawmakers-return-monday-to-consider-governors-veto-of-virginia-redistricting-legislation/2011/04/24/AFRSznbE_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713212121/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/lawmakers-return-monday-to-consider-governors-veto-of-virginia-redistricting-legislation/2011/04/24/AFRSznbE_story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 13, 2019|title=Lawmakers Return Monday to Consider Governor's Veto of Virginia Redistricting Legislation|date=April 24, 2011|work=The Washington Post|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}</ref> After lengthy negotiations, on April 28, both houses passed a revised set of district maps and McDonnell announced that he would sign the revised bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=720|title=Statement of Governor Bob McDonnell on Passage of Redistricting Legislation|publisher=State of Virginia|accessdate=May 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927124300/http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=720|archive-date=September 27, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Executive mansion spending===
In June 2013, McDonnell and his wife were the subject of a critical article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' detailing their improper spending at the [[Executive Mansion (Virginia)|Executive Mansion]], for items such as energy drinks, dog food, and a "detox cleanse". Following the report, a McDonnell spokesman explained that energy drinks were a standard part of their breakfast routine.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/mansion-spending-records-indicate-improper-billing-by-virginia-governor-and-his-family/2013/06/16/6008bfdc-c240-11e2-8c3b-0b5e9247e8ca_story.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Mansion Spending Records Indicate Improper Billing by Virginia Governor and His Family|last=Vozzella|first=Laura|date=June 16, 2013|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>
