=== Tenure ===
Before taking office as mayor, Booker sued the James administration, seeking to terminate cut-rate land deals favoring two redevelopment agencies that had contributed to James's campaigns and listed James as a member of their advisory boards. Booker argued that the state's "[[Pay to play#In politics|pay-to-play]]" laws had been violated and that the land deals would cost the city more than $15 million in lost revenue. Specifically, Booker referenced a parcel at Broad and South Streets that would generate only $87,000 under the proposed land deals yet was valued at $3.7 million under then-current market rates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/nyregion/19newark.htm|work=The New York Times|title=Booker Says Newark Mayor Is 'Giving Away Our Land'|last=Cave|first=Damien|date=April 19, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> On June 20, 2006, Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in favor of Booker.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Katie|url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/essex/index.ssf?/base/news-2/1150866745162770.xml&coll=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910025612/http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/essex/index.ssf?/base/news-2/1150866745162770.xml&coll=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 10, 2012|title=Booker wins fight on city land sales|date=June 21, 2006|website=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}</ref>

In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey investigators foiled a plot to assassinate Booker led by [[Bloods]] gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. The motive for the plot was unclear, but was described variously as a response to the acrimonious campaign<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Richard G.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/nyregion/06booker.html|title=Threat to Newark's Mayor-Elect Leads to 24-Hour Police Guard|date=June 5, 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 23, 2020}}</ref> and to Booker's campaign promises to take a harder line on crime.<ref name="nytimes.com" />

In April 2018 after the FBI raided the hotel room and offices of Trump's personal attorney, [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], Booker, along with [[Chris Coons]], [[Lindsey Graham]], and [[Thom Tillis]], introduced new legislation to "limit President Trump's ability to fire special counsel [[Robert Mueller]]."

If negative, the special counsel would be reinstated. At the same time, according to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', the bill would "codify regulations" that a special counsel could be fired by only a senior Justice Department official, while having to provide reasons in writing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carney|first1=Jordain|title=Senators to introduce new bipartisan bill to protect Mueller|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/382615-senators-to-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-protect-mueller|website=The Hill|date=April 11, 2018|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref>

=== Book ===
In 2016, Booker wrote an autobiography, ''United: Thoughts on Finding Common Ground and Advancing the Common Good''.

In an article in ''HuffPost'', [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]] said of the book:
{{quote|If there is anything that Booker repeatedly returns to in United, it is that the myopia of contemporary politics leads citizens astray, and leaves them vulnerable to ignoring issues of tangible importance. "I believe that this broken system, which afflicts us all, will be repaired" writes Booker near the end of the book. To repeat an earlier point, what sets Senator Booker’s work apart from that of similar political books is that it seeks to elevate discourse rather than bring down opponents of the opposite partisan persuasion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yanklowitz |first=Shmuly |title=Standing Together In the Era of National Division: Review of United by Cory Booker
