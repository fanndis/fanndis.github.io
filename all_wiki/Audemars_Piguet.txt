== History ==

=== Early history ===
Jules Louis Audemars and Edward Auguste Piguet knew each other in their childhood, but were not re-connected until 1874 when they were in their early twenties.<ref name=":3" /> In 1875, they formed partnership and began their business.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":8" /> In 1881, ''Audemars Piguet & Cie'' was officially founded, and was based in [[Le Brassus]], a village inside the [[Vallée de Joux]] in [[Switzerland]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name=":15" />[[File:Audemars 2385.jpg|thumb|Audemars Piguet Royal Oak [[chronograph]]]]Both Audemars and Piguet were previously watchmakers. Audemars created complex watch [[Movement (clockwork)|movements]] for other watch manufacturers such as [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany Co.]] to use.<ref name=":15" /> Piguet specialized in the regulation of watch movements. Once partnered, they split the responsibilities while operating their own company: Audemars was in charge of production and technical aspects while Piguet focused on sales and management.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.govbergwatches.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-audemars-piguet/#|title=A History of Audemars Piguet {{!}} AP Watches|date=2015-06-15|work=Govberg Jewelers|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bucherer.co.uk/editorial/audemars-piguet-a-brand-history/|title=Audemars Piguet: A Brand History {{!}} Editorial {{!}} The Watch Gallery|date=2013-03-04|work=Editorial|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

The second-generation company leaders included Paul Louis Audemars and Paul Edward Piguet, and the third generation included Jacques Louis Audemars and Paulette Piguet.<ref name=":5" />

=== Recent development ===
In the 1970s, Audemars Piguet rose to an important position in watchmaking industry, especially after introducing the Royal Oak collection.<ref name=":3" />

The fourth-generation company leaders are both from the Audemars family, including Jasmine Audemars and Olivier Frank Edward Audemars.<ref name=":5" /> Currently, the company is an active member of the [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH]], and produces around 40,000 timepieces annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhs.swiss/eng/watch_brands.html?letter=A|title=Our brands|website=Federation of the Swiss watch industry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/francois-henry-bennahmias-there-are-some-great-years-ahead/|title=François-Henry Bennahmias: "There are some great years ahead" – FHH Journal|website=journal.hautehorlogerie.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/fashion/franois-henry-bennahmias-watches-audemars-piguet.html|title=At Audemars Piguet, Sales Go Beyond the Showroom|last=Garrahan|first=Rachel|date=2017-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Environmental rating ===

There are concerns over the lack of transparency in manufacturing activities and the sourcing of precious raw materials such as [[gold]], which is a [[Environmental impact of mining|major cause of environmental issues]] such as [[pollution]], [[soil degradation]] and [[deforestation]].<ref name=":44" /><ref name=":45" /> The situation is especially serious in the [[developing countries]] which are top producers of gold, such as [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[South Africa]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/aug/15/developing-countries-high-price-global-mineral-boom|title=How developing countries are paying a high price for the global mineral boom|last1=Vidal|first1=John|date=2015-08-15|work=The Observer|access-date=2019-02-02|last2=Guest|first2=graphic by Pete|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/6996-China-needs-to-get-to-grips-with-its-gold-mining-pollution-crisis|title=China needs to get to grips with its gold mining pollution crisis|website=www.chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://born2invest.com/articles/mining-in-russia-an-economic-boost-or-an-environmental-threat/|title=Mining in Russia: An economic boost or an environmental threat?|last=Einhorn|first=Dom|date=2015-02-09|website=Born2Invest|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mining.com/south-africa-has-failed-to-protect-locals-from-gold-mine-pollution-harvard-report/|title=South Africa has failed to protect locals from gold mine pollution: Harvard report|date=2016-10-12|website=MINING.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref> It is estimated that the watch and jewelry sector uses over 50% of world's annual gold production (over 2,000 [[ton]]s), but in most cases the watch companies are not able to or are unwilling to demonstrate where their raw materials come from and if the material suppliers use [[eco-friendly]] sourcing technologies.<ref name=":44" />

They are characterized by [[oval]] cases as well as domed sapphire crystal. The off-centred watch dial is notable with a view of the [[balance wheel]]. Audemars Piguet claims that their calibre 4104 is reversed to allow more components to be seen on the dial. All of the Millenary watches share the case and a unique [[Damaskeening]] or Côtes de Genève across the movement dial.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.audemarspiguet.com/en/watch-collection/millenary/|title=Audemars Piguet - Swiss Luxury Watches|website=Audemars Piguet - Le Brassus|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref>

=== Jules Audemars ===
Named after one of the founders, the Jules Audemars collection takes cues from more traditional Audemars Piguet designs. In 1875, Jules Audemars created about 20 very complex movements, which he later used as collateral when he and Edward Piguet founded ''Audemars Piguet & Cie'' in 1881.<ref name=":15" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audemarspiguet.com/en/watch-collection/jules-audemars/|title=Jules Audemars|website=Audemars Piguet - Le Brassus|archive-date=2017-10-13|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> These movements marked the beginning of Audemars Piguet. All the watches in this collection have circular shape, some of which also contain [[complication (horology)|complications]] such as [[tourbillon]], [[minute repeater]], and [[perpetual calendar]].<ref name=":2" />
