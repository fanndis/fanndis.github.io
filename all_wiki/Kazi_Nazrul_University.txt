== History ==
There was a demand for a university in the area from a long time. The setting up of Kazi Nazrul University was primarily intended at responding to these local-material needs of democratizing higher education, outside of urban-metropolitan centers of cultural dominance. Professor Anuradha Mukhopadhyay, the first Vice Chancellor, assumed office on 3 December 2012 at the Asansol Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA) building. On 10 January 2013, the Hon'ble Chief Minister of [[West Bengal]] Smt. [[Mamata Banerjee]] laid the foundation stone of Kazi Nazrul University on its own campus, close to the birthplace of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] at [[Churulia]], 31 kilometres away from the city of [[Asansol]].<ref name=KNU>{{cite web |title=Chronicle of KNU |url=http://www.knu.ac.in/AboutUs_home.aspx |accessdate=8 January 2020}}</ref>
