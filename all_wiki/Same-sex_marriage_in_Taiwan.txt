On 24 May 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] ruled that the marriage law was unconstitutional, and that the constitutional right to equality and freedom of marriage guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry under the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]].

In May 2015, the [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] of [[Kaohsiung]] announced a plan to allow same-sex couples to mark their partners in civil documents for reference purposes, although it would not be applicable to the healthcare sector. This policy of "partnership registrations" ({{lang-zh|同性伴侶註記}}),{{efn|[[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]]: {{transl|zh|tóngxìng bànlǚ zhù jì}}<br/>[[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]: {{transl|zh|tông-sèng phōaⁿ-lī chù kì}}<br/>[[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]]: {{transl|zh|thùng-sin phân-lí chu ki}}<br/>[[Matsu dialect|Matsu]]: {{transl|zh|dùng-séng puâng-lṳ̄ cuó gé}}}} went into force on May 20.

Same-sex marriage was legalized in [[Taiwan]] on May 24, 2019.

==Same-sex marriage==
===Early history===
In 2003, the [[Executive Yuan]] proposed legislation granting [[Same-sex marriage|marriages to same-sex couples]], but the bill was rejected in 2006 and was not passed into law because of majority opposition from legislators, which included both DPP and KMT members of the Legislative Yuan.

In August 2012, two women participated in what the media called Taiwan's first same-sex marriage ceremony.<ref name=budhist /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/13/world/asia/taiwan-buddhist-same-sex-wedding/index.html |title=Two Buddhist brides wed in Taiwan |work=[[CNN]] |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 May 2019 |first=Alexix |last=Lai |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411211939/https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/13/world/asia/taiwan-buddhist-same-sex-wedding/index.html |archive-date=11 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Around the same time, President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], Chairman of the governing [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), restated his respect for LGBT rights but said public support was needed before the government could approve a same-sex marriage law.<ref name=budhist>{{cite news|url = https://sg.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-stage-first-same-sex-buddhist-wedding-061917131.html|title = Taiwan to stage first same-sex Buddhist wedding|via = [[Agence France-Presse|AFP News]]|first = Benjamin|last = Yeh|date = 11 July 2012|accessdate = 19 May 2019|work = [[Yahoo!

On 25 October 2013, a petition-initiated bill to revise the Civil Code to allow for same-sex couples to be eligible for marriage was introduced by 23 lawmakers from the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]]. It was immediately referred to the Yuan's Judicial Committee for review and possible first reading.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/CHIN-02-311013.html|title = Taiwan lawmakers push marriage equality bill|author = Dennis Engbarth, Inter Press Service|publisher = Asia Times|date = Oct 31, 2013|access-date = November 4, 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103121307/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/CHIN-02-311013.html|archive-date = November 3, 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>

On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the Civil Code which would have legalized same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee. If the amendment had passed the committee stage it would have then been voted on at the plenary session of the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2015. The amendment, called the marriage equality amendment, would have inserted neutral terms into the Civil Code replacing ones that implied heterosexual marriage, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. It would have also allowed same-sex couples to adopt children.

On 28 June 2015, a senior Ministry of Justice official stated same-sex marriage would remain illegal in Taiwan "for now". Deputy Minister of Justice Chen Ming-tang said "...in Taiwan, the issue of legalizing same-sex marriage remains extremely controversial...so we should not consider it for now". He added that while the Ministry of Justice opposed measures that would legalize same-sex marriages outright, it would support a more gradual approach, including offering better protection to same-sex couples under current laws, such as their rights to equal medical treatment and taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/06/28/439416/Same-sex-marriage.htm|title=Same-sex marriage won't be legal in Taiwan 'for now,' says Justice Ministry|date=28 June 2015|work=The China Post|access-date=8 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709174635/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/06/28/439416/Same-sex-marriage.htm|archive-date=9 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===2016 new administration and parliament===
The [[Elections in Taiwan|Taiwanese election]] held in January 2016 resulted in a big win for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP). The DPP [[List of leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party|chairperson]] [[Tsai Ing-wen]] won the [[2016 Taiwanese presidential election|presidential election]], and the party took the parliamentary majority in the [[2016 Taiwanese legislative election|legislative election]]. The DPP is considered as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] party and majority of members support the legalisation of same-sex marriage.

On 23 February 2016, the Referendum Review Committee rejected a proposal put forward by the Faith and Hope League on the grounds that it failed to meet requirements. The proposal would have amended the Civil Code by stating that husband and wife relationships, consanguinity and the principles of human relations cannot be amended unless the public agrees via a referendum. Had it been approved, the legalization of same-sex marriage would have only been possible through a referendum. The committee voted 10-1 against the proposal. Chairman of the committee, Wang Kao-cheng, said it was rejected for two reasons: one, that the proposed was not a law, a legislative principle, important policy or constitutional amendment and therefore does not meet the requirement of the ''Referendum Act'' ({{lang-zh|公民投票法}}); and two, the proposal was about revising several provisions of the Civil Code, which does not meet the law's requirement that a referendum should be about a single issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/02/24/2003640103 |title=Anti-same-sex marriage referendum turned down |work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=24 February 2016 |access-date=25 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224083929/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/02/24/2003640103 |archive-date=24 February 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 2017, the Taipei Administrative Court ruled that same-sex couples cannot marry until the Civil Code is amended or until 24 May 2019, when the Constitutional Court ruling goes into effect.<ref>[https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3334529 Taipei court rejects another lesbian union] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507221638/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3334529 |date=2018-05-07 }}, ''Taiwan News'', 5 January 2018</ref>

===2018 referendums===
{{Main|2018 Taiwanese referendum}}
[[File:Same sex marriage opponents in 2017 Taipei Summer Universiade 2017-08-19.jpg|thumb|right|Opponents of same-sex marriage campaigning in Taipei in 2017]]
In February 2018, a group opposed to same-sex marriage, the Alliance for Next Generation's Happiness, proposed holding a referendum on the issue of same-sex marriage, which required collecting about 280,000 signatures (1.5% of eligible voters) for the initiative to be presented to the voters.<ref>[http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201802090038.aspx Group proposes referendum for special law for same-sex couples] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210180100/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201802090038.aspx |date=2018-02-10 }} ''Focus Taiwan News Channel'', 9 February 2018</ref> Firstly, however, the group had to collect 1,879 valid signatures. This would then enable them to proceed with collecting the 280,000 signatures. By April 2018, the group had collected 3,100 signatures, and the Central Election Commission (CEC) validated the signatures later that month.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://newbloommag.net/2018/04/18/anti-gay-referendum-threshold/ |title=REFERENDUM AGAINST GAY MARRIAGE REACHES NECESSARY THRESHOLD |access-date=2018-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502141212/https://newbloommag.net/2018/04/18/anti-gay-referendum-threshold/ |archive-date=2018-05-02 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="referendum">[http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201804180011.aspx CEC passes review of same-sex marriage referendum proposals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502211001/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201804180011.aspx |date=2018-05-02 }}, ''Focus Taiwan News Channel'', 18 April 2018</ref>

The group wanted the three following questions to be presented to Taiwanese voters:<ref name="referendum"/>
*"Do you agree with using means other than the marriage regulations in the Civil Code to protect the rights of two people of the same gender to build a permanent life together?"
*"Do you agree that the marriage regulations in the Civil Code should define marriage as between a man and a woman?"
*"Do you agree that during the elementary and junior high school stage, the Ministry of Education and schools at all levels should not implement same-sex education as stipulated in the Gender Equity Education Act's implementation rules?"

LGBT activist [[Chi Chia-wei]] described the referendum proposal as "clearly a violation of the Constitution".<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2018/04/26/2003691973 CEC’s passage of anti-LGBT referendum proposals causes controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508053955/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2018/04/26/2003691973 |date=2018-05-08 }}, ''Taipei Times'', 26 April 2018</ref>

*"Do you agree that the Civil Code marriage regulations should be used to guarantee the rights of same sex couples to get married?"
*"Do you agree that gender equity education as defined in 'the Gender Equity Education Act' should be taught at all stages of the national curriculum and that such education should cover courses on emotional education, sex education and gay and lesbian education?"

The referendum proposals were also approved by the CEC, and a public vote was held on 24 November 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201810090026.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181101015358/http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201810090026.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 November 2018|title=CEC approves 7 referendums alongside local elections|website=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=9 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201810160023.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181101014449/http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201810160023.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 November 2018|title=CEC approves 2 more referendum proposals, making 9 in total|website=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=16 October 2018}}</ref> On 24 November, Taiwanese voters approved the three initiatives launched by the Alliance for Next Generation's Happiness and rejected the two pro-LGBT initiatives, by wide margins.

On 20 February 2019, the [[Executive Yuan]] published a draft bill, entitled ''Act for Implementation of J.Y. Interpretation No. 748'', which allows two persons of the same sex to create a "permanent union of intimate and exclusive nature for the committed purpose of managing a life together to fulfill the equal protection of the freedom of marriage". It covers topics such as inheritance rights, medical rights, and adoption of the biological children of their partner. The draft bill also sets penalties for adultery and bigamy, similar to opposite-sex marriages. The bill does not amend the existing marriage laws in the Civil Code, but rather creates a separate law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=57960|title=快訊】同婚專法草案名稱《司法院釋字第748號解釋施行法》 同性伴侶可結婚、繼承|work=Up Media|last=Wang|first=Yizhen|date=20 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221000548/https://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=57960|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="focus">{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902200031.aspx|title=Cabinet rolls out historic draft bill to legalize same-sex marriage|work=Focus Taiwan News Channel|last1=Chuan|first1=Ku|last2=Yen|first2=William|date=20 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220212132/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902200031.aspx|archive-date=20 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt/taiwan-government-to-unveil-draft-same-sex-marriage-law-idUSKCN1Q91XO|title=Taiwan government to unveil draft same-sex marriage law|work=Reuters|first1=Yimou|last1=Lee|first2=William|last2=Maclean|date=20 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220191119/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt/taiwan-government-to-unveil-draft-same-sex-marriage-law-idUSKCN1Q91XO|archive-date=20 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The bill was approved by the Executive Yuan on 21 February 2019 and then sent to the [[Legislative Yuan]] for passage, before taking effect on 24 May.<ref>{{cite web |title=Taiwan cabinet OKs bill on same-sex marriage |url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20190222_15/ |publisher=NHK WORLD |accessdate=23 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222042737/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20190222_15/ |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-unveils-long-awaited-gay-marriage-bill|title=Taiwan unveils long-awaited gay marriage bill|work=AFP|date=21 February 2019|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221125827/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-unveils-long-awaited-gay-marriage-bill|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902210012.aspx|title=Cabinet OKs bill to legalize same-sex marriage|work=Focus Taiwan News Channel|last1=Ku|first1=Chuan|last2=Evelyn|first2=Kao|date=21 February 2019|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221125110/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902210012.aspx|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt/taiwan-unveils-asias-first-draft-law-on-same-sex-marriage-idUSKCN1QA0I2?il=0|title=Taiwan unveils Asia's first draft law on same-sex marriage|work=Reuters|first=Yimou|last=Lee|date=21 February 2019|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221224121/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt/taiwan-unveils-asias-first-draft-law-on-same-sex-marriage-idUSKCN1QA0I2?il=0|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was well received by LGBT groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3642783|title=Equality group thanks Taiwan Cabinet for a draft bill set to legalize same sex marriage|website=Taiwan News|date=21 February 2019|author=Yang, Sophie|access-date=22 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325152029/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3642783|archive-date=25 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> but denounced by conservative organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3642917|title=Conservative groups in Taiwan denounce draft same-sex marriage bill|date=21 February 2019|website=Taiwan News|author=Drillsma, Ryan|access-date=22 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074131/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3642917|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> NPP legislator [[Freddy Lim]] presented his own bill to legalize same-sex marriage on 21 February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/02/22/2003710201|title=Marriage Equality: NPP presents its own marriage bill|work=Taipei Times|first1=Peng|last1=Wan-hsin|first2=Sherry|last2=Hsiao|date=22 February 2019|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190221222132/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2019/02/22/2003710201|archive-date=21 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Ministry of Justice has stated that the draft bill would be subject to further amendments, including on issues such as [[transnational marriage]]s (which it does not address) and [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproduction]]. Another difference between same-sex and opposite-sex marriages would be the minimum required age. Currently, women can get married at 16 and men at 18. Under the proposed law, same-sex couples would be able to get married from the age of 18, but would require parental consent if under 20.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902210017.aspx|title = Draft gay marriage bill to be further amended: Justice Ministry|work = [[Focus Taiwan|Focus Taiwan News Channel]]|date = 21 February 2019|first1 = Yeh|last1 = Su-ping|first2 = Ku|last2 = Chuan|first3 = Liu|last3 = Shih-yi|first4 = Evelyn|last4 = Kao|accessdate = 18 May 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085814/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201902210017.aspx|archive-date = 27 March 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>

On 14 March, the Legislative Yuan voted to send a draft bill that would limit the use of the words "marriage" and "spouse" to heterosexual couples to a second reading, where the bill would be reviewed together with same-sex marriage bill. The bill, entitled ''The Enforcement Act of Referendum No. 12'', was proposed by KMT legislator [[Lai Shyh-bao]]. The bill was originally drafted by anti-LGBT campaigners and offered very limited rights. It would have allowed two adults of the same sex to register as one family. It also limited how much one partner could inherit from another. The NPP attempted to block the bill, but failed to secure enough votes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201903150014.aspx|first1 = Wang|last1 = Yang-yu|first2 = Chen|last2 = Chun-hua|first3 = Chung|last3 = Yu-chen|title = Competing same-sex marriage bill proceeds to second reading|date = 15 March 2019|accessdate = 18 May 2019|work = [[Focus Taiwan|Focus Taiwan News Channel]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190327090140/http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201903150014.aspx|archive-date = 27 March 2019|url-status = live}}</ref> Same-sex families and rights groups in Taiwan protested outside the Legislative Yuan and urged the opposition party lawmaker to withdraw what they called a "homophobic" draft bill.<ref>{{cite news|title = Taiwan's LGBT families protest 'homophobic' bill|url = https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwans-lgbt-families-protest-homophobic-bill/|date = 15 March 2019|accessdate = 18 May 2019|first = Rik|last = Glauert|work = [[Gay Star News]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190327094017/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwans-lgbt-families-protest-homophobic-bill/|archive-date = 27 March 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>

===Adoption===
On May 17, 2019, the DPP-controlled [[Legislative Yuan]] approved the same-sex marriage bill.<ref name=":0" /> This made Taiwan the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.<ref name = Telegraph-17May2019 /> The KMT caucus opposed the bill but allowed a free vote; subsequently, seven KMT legislators broke with their caucus to vote in favor. Articles 1-4 of the bill, submitted by the [[Executive Yuan]] and approved by the Legislative Yuan, allow same-sex couples to form an "exclusive permanent union" and apply for a "marriage registration" with government agencies, and refers to the Judicial Yuan ruling to enforce its definition of marriage. Other articles in the bill also specify that married same-sex couples can jointly adopt a biological child of one of the spouses. All 27 articles of the bill were approved, mostly by the DPP and NPP caucuses. The bill was signed into law by President [[Tsai Ing-wen]] on 22 May, and took effect on 24 May 2019.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:制定司法院釋字第七四八號解釋施行法 |url=https://www.president.gov.tw/Page/294/46606/%E5%88%B6%E5%AE%9A%E5%8F%B8%E6%B3%95%E9%99%A2%E9%87%8B%E5%AD%97%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%83%E5%9B%9B%E5%85%AB%E8%99%9F%E8%A7%A3%E9%87%8B%E6%96%BD%E8%A1%8C%E6%B3%95- |publisher=中華民國總統府 |accessdate=22 May 2019 |language=zh-tw}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwan-ready-for-first-same-sex-marriages-in-asia/|title=Taiwan ready for first same-sex marriages in Asia|date= 23 May 2019|accessdate= 23 May 2019|work=[[Gay Star News]]|first=Rik|last=Glauert|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523152727/https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwan-ready-for-first-same-sex-marriages-in-asia/|archive-date= 23 May 2019|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3708500|title=Taiwan's new same-sex marriage law to be enacted on May 24|work=Taiwan News|first=George|last=Liao|date=22 May 2019|accessdate=24 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523222022/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3708500|archive-date= 23 May 2019|url-status = live}}</ref>
