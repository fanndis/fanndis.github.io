With a population of 470,907,<ref name="population" /> Gdańsk is the capital and largest city of the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]] and one of the most prominent cities within the cultural and geographical region of [[Kashubia]]. It is Poland's principal [[port|seaport]] and the centre of the country's fourth-largest [[metropolitan area]].<ref name="lvhmzm">{{cite web|url=http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=gamelan&geo=-173&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&pt=a&va=&srt=pnan |title=Poland – largest cities (per geographical entity) |publisher=World Gazetteer |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226221438/http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&men=gcis&lng=en&des=gamelan&geo=-173&srt=npan&col=abcdefghinoq&msz=1500&pt=a&va=&srt=pnan |archivedate=26 December 2008 }}</ref>

The city is situated on the southern edge of [[Gdańsk Bay]] on the [[Baltic Sea]], in a [[conurbation]] with the city of [[Gdynia]], the [[resort town]] of [[Sopot]], and suburban communities; these form a metropolitan area called the [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] (''Trójmiasto''), with a population approaching 1.4&nbsp;million. Gdańsk lies at the mouth of the [[Motława]] River, connected to the [[Leniwka]], a branch in the delta of the nearby [[Vistula]] River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]]. Together with the nearby port of [[Gdynia]], Gdańsk is also a notable industrial centre.

The city's history is complex, with periods of Polish, [[Prussia]]n and German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a [[City-state|free city state]]. In the early-modern age, Gdańsk was a [[Royal city in Poland|royal city of Poland]]. It was considered the wealthiest and the largest city of Poland, before the 18th century rapid growth of Warsaw. In the late [[Middle Ages]] it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town and, in the 14th and 15th centuries, a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].

In the [[interwar period]], owing to its multi-ethnic make-up and history, Gdańsk lay in a disputed region between [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and Germany, which became known as the [[Polish Corridor]]. The city's ambiguous [[Free City of Danzig|political status]] was exploited by Germany, [[Causes of World War II#Danzig crisis|furthering tension]] between the two countries, which would ultimately culminate in the [[Invasion of Poland]] and the [[Battle of Westerplatte|first clash]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]] just outside the city limits, followed by the [[Intelligenzaktion Pommern|ethnic cleansing and executions of Polish population]] and ultimately [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|flight and expulsion of the German-speaking majority of the city's population in 1945]].

In the 1980s, Gdańsk was the birthplace of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement, which played a major role in bringing an end to [[Communism|communist]] rule in Poland and helped precipitate the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the dissolution of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

Gdańsk is home to the [[University of Gdańsk]], [[Gdańsk University of Technology]], the [[National Museum, Gdańsk|National Museum]], the [[Gdańsk Shakespeare Theatre]], the [[Museum of World War II in Gdańsk|Museum of the Second World War]], the [[Polish Baltic Philharmonic]] and the [[European Solidarity Centre]]. The city also hosts [[St. Dominic's Fair]], which dates back to 1260,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/saint-dominics-fair-is-760-years-old-14619 |title=Saint Dominic's Fair is 760 years old! |access-date=5 August 2020}}</ref> and is regarded as one of the biggest trade and cultural events in Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pap.pl/en/news-/news,621550,millions-at-gdansks-st-dominics-fair.html |website=www.pap.pl |title=Millions at Gdansk's St. Dominic's Fair |date=21 August 2016 |access-date=30 December 2016 |others=Article copied to [https://polska.pl/economy/investments-projects/millions-gdansks-st-dominics-fair/ polska.pl]}}</ref> Gdańsk has also topped rankings for the quality of life, safety and living standards worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings.jsp|title=Quality of Life Index by City 2019 Mid-Year|website=www.numbeo.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trojmiasto.wyborcza.pl/trojmiasto/7,35612,24341452,gdansk-najlepiej-ocenionym-polskim-miastem-w-miedzynarodowym.html?disableRedirects=true|title=Wyborcza.pl|website=trojmiasto.wyborcza.pl}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.ug.edu.pl/media/aktualnosci/85193/gdansk_high_quality_life_index|title=Gdańsk high in Quality of Life Index|website=en.ug.edu.pl}}</ref>

In Polish the modern name of the city is pronounced {{IPA-pl|ɡdaj̃sk||Pl-Gdańsk.ogg}}. In English (where the [[Polish alphabet|diacritic]] over the "n" is frequently omitted) the usual pronunciation is {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|d|æ|n|s|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|s|k}}. The German name, ''Danzig'', is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈdantsɪç||De-Danzig.ogg}}.

The city's [[Latin]] name may be given as either ''Gedania'', ''Gedanum'' or ''Dantiscum''; the variety of Latin names reflects the mixed influence of the city's Polish, German and Kashubian heritage. Other former spellings of the name include ''Dantzig'', ''Dantsic'' and ''Dantzic''.

===Ceremonial names===
On special occasions the city is also referred to as "The Royal Polish City of Gdańsk" (Polish ''Królewskie Polskie Miasto Gdańsk'', Latin ''Regia Civitas Polonica Gedanensis'', Kashubian ''Królewsczi Polsczi Gard Gduńsk'').<ref>Gdańsk, in: Kazimierz Rymut, ''Nazwy Miast Polski'', [[Ossolineum]], Wrocław 1987</ref><ref>Hubert Gurnowicz, ''Gdańsk'', in: ''Nazwy must Pomorza Gdańskiego'', [[Ossolineum]], Wrocław 1978</ref><ref>''Baedeker's Northern Germany'', [[Baedeker|Karl Baedeker Publishing]], Leipzig 1904</ref> In the [[Kashubian language]] the city is called {{lang|csb|Gduńsk}}. Although some Kashubians may also use the name "Our Capital City Gduńsk" (''Nasz Stoleczny Gard Gduńsk'') or "The Kashubian Capital City Gduńsk" (''Stoleczny Kaszëbsczi Gard Gduńsk''), the cultural and historical connections between the city and the region of Kashubia are debatable and use of such names rises controversy among Kashubians.

The first written record thought to refer to Gdańsk is the ''vita'' of [[Adalbert (Archbishop of Magdeburg)|Saint Adalbert]]. Written in 999, it describes how in 997 Saint [[Adalbert of Prague]] baptised the inhabitants of ''urbs Gyddannyzc'', "which separated the great realm of the duke [i.e. [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Boleslaw the Brave]] of Poland] from the sea."<ref name=Loew24>Loew, Peter Oliver: Danzig.

The site was ruled as a [[Duke|duchy]] of Poland by the [[Samborides]].

In 1215, the ducal stronghold became the centre of a [[Pomeranian duchies and dukes#Duchy of Pomerelia|Pomerelian splinter duchy]]. At that time the area of the later city included various villages.

Poland threatened to intervene, and the Brandenburgians left the town. Subsequently, the city was taken by Danish princes in 1301. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were hired by the Polish nobles to drive out the Danes.

After a series of [[Polish–Teutonic War|Polish-Teutonic Wars]], in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)]] the Order had to acknowledge that it would hold Pomerelia as a [[fief]] from the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]]. Although it left the legal basis of the Order's possession of the province in some doubt, the city thrived as a result of increased exports of grain (especially wheat), timber, potash, tar, and other goods of forestry from Prussia and Poland via the [[Vistula]] River [[trade route|trading routes]], although after its capture, the Teutonic Knights tried to actively reduce the economic significance of the town.

In 1440, the city participated in the foundation of the [[Prussian Confederation]] which was an organisation opposed to the rule of the Teutonic Knights. The organisation in its complaint of 1453 mentioned repeated cases in which the Teutonic Knights imprisoned or murdered local patricians and mayors without a court verdict.<ref>Karol Górski, ''Związek Pruski i poddanie się Prus Polsce: zbiór tekstów źródłowych'', Instytut Zachodni, Poznań, 1949, p. 16, 18 (in Polish)</ref> Upon the request of the organisation King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]] reincorporated the territory to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1454.<ref>Górski, p. 51, 56</ref> This led to the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466)|Thirteen Years' War]] between Poland and the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] (1454–1466).

Gaining free and privileged access to Polish markets, the seaport prospered while simultaneously trading with the other Hanseatic cities. After the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]] between Poland and the Teutonic Order the warfare ended permanently. After the [[Union of Lublin]] between Poland and Lithuania in 1569 the city continued to enjoy a large degree of internal autonomy (cf. [[Danzig law]]). Being the largest and one of the most influential cities of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights during the [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] period in Poland.

In 1569 a [[Vistula delta Mennonites|Mennonite Church]] was founded here.

In the 1575 election of a king to the Polish throne, Danzig supported [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] in his struggle against [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]]. It was the latter who eventually became monarch but the city, encouraged by the secret support of [[Denmark]] and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]], shut its gates against Stephen. After the [[Siege of Danzig (1577)]], lasting six months, the city's army of 5,000 mercenaries was utterly defeated in a field battle on 16 December 1577. However, since Stephen's armies were unable to take the city by force, a compromise was reached: [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]] confirmed the city's special status and her [[Danzig law]] privileges granted by earlier [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish kings]]. The city recognised him as ruler of Poland and paid the enormous sum of 200,000 [[Guilder|guldens]] in gold as payoff ("apology").

Around 1640, [[Johannes Hevelius]] established his [[:pl:Obserwatorium Astronomiczne Jana Heweliusza w Gdańsku|astronomical observatory]] in the [[Old Town (Gdańsk)|Old Town]]. Polish King [[John III Sobieski]] regularly visited Hevelius numerous times.

In addition, a number of [[Scottish people|Scots]] took refuge or migrated to and received citizenship in the city. During the [[Protestant Reformation]], most German-speaking inhabitants adopted [[Lutheranism]]. Due to the special status of the city and significance within the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], the city inhabitants largely became bi-cultural sharing both Polish and German culture and were strongly attached to the traditions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.<ref name=Chwalba>Historia Polski 1795–1815 [[Andrzej Chwalba]] Kraków 2000, page 441</ref>

The city suffered a [[The plague during the Great Northern War|last great plague]] and a slow economic decline due to the wars of the 18th century. As a stronghold of [[Stanisław Leszczyński]]'s supporters during the [[War of the Polish Succession]], it was taken by the Russians after the [[Siege of Danzig (1734)|Siege of Danzig]] in 1734.

The [[Danzig Research Society]] (in German {{lang|de|Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Danzig}}) founded in 1743 was one of the first of its kind.

===Prussia and Germany===

Danzig was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1793,<ref name="lonelyplanet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/poland/pomerania/gdansk/history|title=History of Gdańsk – Lonely Planet Travel Information|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|work=lonelyplanet.com}}</ref> in the [[Second Partition of Poland]].

During the [[Napoleon]]ic era the city became a [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|free city]] from 1807 to 1814.

In 1815, after France's defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it again became part of Prussia<ref name="lonelyplanet.com"/> and became the capital of {{lang|de|[[Danzig (region)|Regierungsbezirk Danzig]]}} within the province of [[West Prussia]]. The city's longest serving president was Robert von Blumenthal, who held office from 1841, through the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolutions of 1848]], until 1863. With the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871 under Prussian [[hegemony]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] and remained so until 1919, after Germany's defeat in [[World War&nbsp;I]].

===Inter-war years and World War II===
{{main|Free City of Danzig}}

When Poland regained its independence after [[World War I]] with access to the sea as promised by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] on the basis of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s "[[Fourteen Points]]" (point 13 called for "an independent Polish state", "which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea"), the Poles hoped the city's harbour would also become part of Poland.

However, in the end – since Germans formed a majority in the city, with Poles being a minority (in the 1923 census 7,896 people out of 335,921 gave Polish, Kashubian or [[Masurian dialect|Masurian]] as their native language)<ref>{{cite book|title=Ergebnisse der Volks- und Berufszählung vom 1. November 1923 in der Freien Stadt Danzig|publisher=Verlag des Statistischen Landesamtes der Freien Stadt Danzig|year=1926|language=German}}. Polish estimates of the Polish minority during the interwar era, however, range from 37,000 to 100,000 (9%–34%). Studia historica Slavo-Germanica, Tomy 18–20page 220 Uniwersytet Adama Mickiewicza w Poznaniu. Instytut Historii Wydawnictwo Naukowe imienia. Adama Mickiewicza, 1994.</ref> – the city was not placed under Polish sovereignty. Instead, in accordance with the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Treaty]], it became the [[Free City of Danzig]] (German: {{lang|de|Freie Stadt Danzig}}), an independent quasi-state under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] with its external affairs largely under Polish control – without, however, any public vote to legitimize Germany's loss of the city. Poland's rights also included free use of the harbour, a Polish post office, a Polish garrison in Westerplatte district, and customs union with Poland. This arrangement was inspired by the history of the city, which for hundreds of years was part of Poland, with which it shared economic interests, thanks to which it flourished, and within which it enjoyed wide autonomy.<ref>Maria Wardzyńska, ''Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion'', [[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]], Warszawa, 2009, p. 36-37 (in Polish)</ref> This led to a considerable tension between the local German administration and the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. The Free City had its own constitution, [[national anthem]], [[Volkstag|parliament]], and government ({{lang|de|Senat}}). It issued its own stamps as well as its currency, the [[Danzig gulden]].

With the growth of [[Nazism]] among Germans, [[Anti-Polish sentiment]] increased and both [[Germanisation]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]] policies intensified, in the 1930s the rights of local Poles were commonly violated and limited by the local administration.<ref>Wardzyńska, p. 37</ref> Polish children were refused admission to public Polish-language schools, premises were not allowed to be rented to Polish schools and preschools.<ref name=mw40>Wardzyńska, p. 40</ref> Due to such policies, only 8 Polish-language public schools existed in the city, and Poles managed to organize 7 more private Polish schools.<ref name=mw40/> In 1937, Poles who sent their children to private Polish schools were demanded to transfer children to German schools, under threat of police intervention, and attacks were carried out on Polish schools and Polish youth.<ref name=mw40/> German militias carried out numerous beatings of Polish activists, scouts and even mailmen, as "punishment" for distributing the Polish press.<ref name=mw41>Wardzyńska, p. 41</ref> German students attacked and expelled Polish students from the technical university.<ref name=mw41/> Dozens of Polish surnames were forcibly Germanized,<ref name=mw41/> while Polish symbols that reminded that for centuries Gdańsk was part of Poland were removed from the city's landmarks, such as the [[Artus Court]] and the [[Neptune's Fountain, Gdańsk|Neptune's Fountain]].<ref name=mw42>Wardzyńska, p. 42</ref> From 1937, the employment of Poles by German companies was prohibited, and already employed Poles were fired, the use of Polish in public places was banned and Poles were not allowed to enter several restaurants, in particular those owned by Germans.<ref name=mw42/> In 1939, before the German [[invasion of Poland]] and outbreak of [[World War II]], local Polish railwaymen were victims of beatings, and after the invasion, they were also imprisoned and murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Wardzyńska, p. 39-40, 85</ref>

In the early 1930s, the local [[Nazi Party]] capitalised on pro-German sentiments and in 1933 garnered 50% of vote in the parliament. Thereafter, the Nazis under [[Gauleiter]] [[Albert Forster]] achieved dominance in the city government, which was still nominally overseen by the League of Nations' [[High Commissioner]]. [[NSDAP|The German government]] officially demanded the return of Danzig to Germany along with an extraterritorial (meaning under German [[jurisdiction]]) highway through the area of the [[Polish Corridor]] for land-based access from the rest of Germany. Hitler used the issue of the status of the city as a pretext for attacking Poland and in May 1939, during a high level meeting of German military officials explained to them: "It is not Danzig that is at stake. For us it is a matter of expanding our [[Lebensraum]] in the east", adding that there will be no repeat of the Czech situation, and Germany will attack Poland at first opportunity, after isolating the country from its Western Allies.<ref>''The history of the German resistance, 1933–1945'' Peter Hoffmann page 37 McGill-Queen's University Press 1996</ref><ref>''Hitler'' Joachim C.

The German attack began in Danzig, with a bombardment of Polish positions at [[Westerplatte]] by the German battleship {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}, and the landing of German infantry on the peninsula. Outnumbered Polish defenders at Westerplatte [[Battle of Westerplatte|resisted]] for seven days before running out of ammunition. Meanwhile, after a fierce day-long [[Defence of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|fight]] (1 September 1939), defenders of the Polish Post office were tried and executed then buried on the spot in the Danzig quarter of [[Zaspa]] in October 1939. In 1998 a German court overturned their conviction and sentence.

Boosted by heavy investment in the development of its port and three major shipyards for Soviet ambitions in the [[Baltic region]], Gdańsk became the major shipping and industrial centre of the [[People's Republic of Poland]].

In December 1970, Gdańsk was the scene of [[Polish 1970 protests|anti-regime demonstrations]], which led to the downfall of Poland's communist leader [[Władysław Gomułka]]. During the demonstrations in Gdańsk and Gdynia, military as well as the police opened fire on the demonstrators causing several dozen deaths. Ten years later, in August 1980, [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] was the birthplace of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union movement.

In September 1981, to deter Solidarity, Soviet Union launched [[Exercise Zapad-81]], the largest military exercise in history, during which amphibious landings were conducted near Gdańsk. Meanwhile, the Solidarity held its first national congress in [[Hala Olivia]], Gdańsk when more than 800 deputies participated. Its opposition to the Communist regime led to the end of Communist Party rule in 1989, and sparked a series of protests that overthrew the Communist regimes of the former [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. Solidarity's leader, [[Lech Wałęsa]], became [[President of Poland]] in 1990. In 2014 the [[European Solidarity Centre]], a museum and library devoted to the history of the movement, opened in Gdańsk.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/trojmiasto/w-gdansku-otwarto-europejskie-centrum-solidarnosci |title=W Gdańsku otwarto Europejskie Centrum Solidarności |publisher=[[Onet.pl]] |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2015 |language=pl }}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In January 2019, the Mayor of Gdańsk, [[Paweł Adamowicz]], was assassinated by a man who had just been released from prison for violent crimes; the man claimed after stabbing the mayor in the abdomen, near the heart that the mayor's political party had been responsible for imprisoning him.

Gdańsk has a climate with both oceanic and continental influences. According to some categorizations, it has an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb),<ref>"[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=5121&cityname=Gdansk%2C+Pomeranian+Voivodeship%2C+Poland&units= Gdansk]". ''Weatherbase.com''. Retrieved 14 February 2018.</ref> while others classify it as belonging to the [[continental climate]] zone (Dfb).<ref>"[https://www.britannica.com/media/full/276210/206711 Köppen climate classification]". ''Britannica''. Retrieved 14 February 2018</ref> It actually depends on whether the mean reference temperature for the coldest winter month is set at {{convert|-3|C|F}} or {{convert|0|C|F}}. Gdańsk's dry winters and the precipitation maximum in summer are indicators of continentality. However seasonal extremes are less pronounced than those in inland Poland.

The city has moderately cold and cloudy winters with mean temperature in January and February near or below {{convert|0|C|F}} and mild summers with frequent showers and thunderstorms. Average temperatures range from {{convert|-1.0|to|17.2|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and average monthly rainfall varies {{convert|17.9|to|66.7|mm|in|0}} per month with a rather low annual total of {{convert|507.3|mm|in|0}}. In general, it is damp, variable, and mild.

The seasons are clearly differentiated. Spring starts in March and is initially cold and windy, later becoming pleasantly warm and often very sunny. Summer, which begins in June, is predominantly warm but hot at times with temperature reaching as high as {{convert|30|to|35|C|F|0}} at least couple times a year with plenty of sunshine interspersed with heavy rain. Gdańsk averages 1,700 hours of sunshine per year. July and August are the warmest months. Autumn comes in September and is at first warm and usually sunny, turning cold, damp, and foggy in November. Winter lasts from December to March and includes periods of snow. January and February are the coldest months with the temperature sometimes dropping as low as {{convert|-15|C|0|abbr=on}}.

==Economy==
The industrial sections of the city are dominated by shipbuilding, petrochemical, and chemical industries, and food processing. The share of high-tech sectors such as electronics, telecommunications, IT engineering, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals is on the rise.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[Amber]] processing is also an important part of the local economy, as the majority of the world's amber deposits lie along the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast. The [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]], including Gdańsk, is also a major tourist destination in the summer, as millions of Poles and other European tourists flock to the beaches of the Baltic coastline.

The city has some buildings surviving from the time of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Most [[tourist attraction]]s are located along or near Ulica Długa (''Long Street'') and Długi Targ (''Long Market''), a pedestrian thoroughfare surrounded by buildings reconstructed in historical (primarily during the 17th century) style and flanked at both ends by elaborate [[city gate]]s. This part of the city is sometimes referred to as the Royal Route, since it was once the former path of processions for visiting Kings of Poland.

==Politics and local government==
{{Main|Politics of Gdańsk}}
<!--[[File:Gdańsk 69 Baltic Philharmonic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Polish Baltic Philharmonic]] on the [[Motława]] river]]struck out to reduce image flood-->
Contemporary Gdańsk is the capital of the province called [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]] and is one of the major centres of economic and administrative life in Poland. Many important agencies of the state and local government levels have their main offices here: the Provincial Administration Office, the Provincial Government, the Ministerial Agency of the State Treasury, the Agency for Consumer and Competition Protection, the National Insurance regional office, the Court of Appeals, and the High Administrative Court.

===Regional centre===
[[Gdańsk Voivodeship]] was extended in 1999 to include most of former [[Słupsk Voivodeship]], the western part of [[Elbląg Voivodeship]] and [[Chojnice County]] from [[Bydgoszcz Voivodeship]] to form the new [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]].
The area of the region was thus extended from {{convert|7394|to|18293|km²|0|abbr=out}} and the population rose from 1,333,800 (1980) to 2,198,000 (2000). By 1998, [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] constituted an [[absolute majority]] of the population; almost half of the inhabitants of the new region live in the centre.

===Municipal government===
Legislative power in Gdańsk is vested in a unicameral Gdańsk [[City council]] (Rada Miasta), which comprises 34 members. Council members are elected directly every four years. Like most legislative bodies, the City Council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.

The end of [[World War II]] is a significant break in continuity with regard to the inhabitants of Gdańsk.

German citizens began to flee en masse as the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced, composed of both spontaneous flights driven by rumors of [[Soviet war crimes|Soviet atrocities]], and organised evacuation starting in the summer of 1944 which continued into the spring of 1945.<ref name=Kacowicz100101>Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, ''Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study'', Lexington Books, 2007, pp.100,101 {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}} [https://www.google.com/books?id=ovck_g0xwX0C&pg=PA103&dq=expulsion+germans+poland&lr=&as_brr=3#PPA100,M1]</ref> Approximately 1% (100,000) of the German civilian population residing east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]] perished in the fighting prior to the surrender in May 1945.<ref>Spieler, Silke. ed.

The settlers can be grouped according to their background:
*Poles that had been freed from [[forced labor in Nazi Germany]]<ref name=Cordell168/><ref name=Hoffmann142/>
*[[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|Repatriates]]: Poles expelled from the areas east of the new Polish-Soviet border. This included assimilated minorities such as [[Armenians in Poland|the Polish-Armenian community]]<ref name=Cordell168/><ref name=Hoffmann142>[https://books.google.de/books?id=Js8XWnqR6HMC&pg=PA140&dq=vertreibung+polen&lr=&sig=ACfU3U3NdOJdTE4UOsjN6kQyponjdFIP8A#PPA142,M1 Dierk Hoffmann, Michael Schwartz, ''Geglückte Integration?'', p.142]</ref>
*[[Cassubians]] relocating from nearby villages and small towns
*Settlers from central Poland migrating voluntarily<ref name=Cordell168/>
*non-Poles forcibly resettled during the [[Operation Vistula]] in 1947. Large numbers of Ukrainians were forced to move from south-eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation aimed at dispersing, and therefore assimilating, those Ukrainians who had not been expelled eastward already, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Białystok were also pressured into relocating to the formerly German areas for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt by the Polish authorities to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians and [[Lemkos]],<ref>Thum, p.129</ref> and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form.
