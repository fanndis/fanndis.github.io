He was the [[Romanian Communist Party#General Secretaries (1921–1989)|general secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] from 1965 to 1989, and the second and last [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist leader]] of Romania. He was also the country's head of state from 1967, serving as President of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] and from 1974 concurrently as [[President of Romania|President of the Republic]], until his overthrow and execution in the [[Romanian Revolution]] in December 1989, part of a series of [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] uprisings in [[Eastern Europe]] that year.

Born in 1918 in [[Scornicești]], [[Olt County]], Ceaușescu was a member of the Romanian Communist youth movement. Ceaușescu rose up through the ranks of [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]'s Socialist government and, upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death in 1965, he succeeded to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party as general secretary.<ref>Behr, E. (1991). ''Kiss the hand you cannot bite: the rise and fall of the Ceaușescus''. London: Hamish Hamilton.</ref>

Upon his rise to power, he eased [[Censorship in Communist Romania|press censorship]] and openly condemned the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in his [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|speech on 21 August 1968]], which resulted in a surge in popularity. However, the resulting period of stability was very brief as his government very soon became severely [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and was considered the most repressive in the [[Eastern Bloc]] at the time. His [[secret police]], the [[Securitate]], was responsible for [[mass surveillance]] as well as [[Securitate#Method|severe repression]] and human rights abuses within the country, and he suppressed and controlled the media and press, implementing methods that were among the harshest, most restrictive and brutal in the world. Economic mismanagement due to failed oil ventures during the 1970s led to skyrocketing foreign debts for Romania. In 1982, he exported much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in an effort to repay them. The shortages that followed drastically lowered living standards, leading to [[1980s austerity policy in Romania|heavy rationing of food, water, oil, heat, electricity, medicine and other necessities]]. [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|His cult of personality]] experienced unprecedented elevation, followed by extensive [[nepotism]] and the intense deterioration of foreign relations, even with the [[Soviet Union]].

As anti-government protesters demonstrated in [[Timișoara]] in December 1989, he perceived the demonstrations as a political threat and ordered military forces to open fire on 17 December, causing many deaths and injuries. The revelation that Ceaușescu was responsible resulted in a massive spread of rioting and civil unrest across the country.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolae-Ceausescu |title=Nicolae Ceaușescu – president of Romania |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}</ref> The demonstrations, which reached Bucharest, became known as the [[Romanian Revolution]]—the only violent overthrow of a communist government in the turn of the [[Revolutions of 1989]].<ref>Ratesh, N.

Capital punishment was abolished shortly thereafter.

==Early life and career==
[[File:008.Portret Nicolae Ceausescu. (1936).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arrested in 1936 when he was 18 years old, Ceaușescu was imprisoned for two years at [[Doftana Prison]] for Communist activities.]]

Ceaușescu was born in the small village of [[Scornicești]], [[Olt County]] on {{OldStyleDate|8 February|1918|26 January|}}, being the third of nine children of a poor peasant family (see [[Ceaușescu family]]). There is a birth certificate showing he was actually born on {{OldStyleDate|5 February|1918|23 January}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gandul.ro/stiri/unul-dintre-cele-mai-bine-pazite-secrete-inainte-de-1989-data-reala-a-nasterii-lui-nicolae-ceausescu-foto-13786598|title=Unul dintre cele mai bine păzite secrete înainte de 1989: data reală a nașterii lui Nicolae Ceaușescu.

He worked in the workshop of Alexandru Săndulescu, a shoemaker who was an active member in the then-illegal Communist Party.<ref name=":0" /> Ceaușescu was soon involved in the Communist Party activities (becoming a member in early 1932), but as a teenager he was given only small tasks.<ref name=":0" /> He was first arrested in 1933, at the age of 15, for street fighting during a strike and again, in 1934, first for collecting signatures on a petition protesting the trial of railway workers and twice more for other similar activities.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.ceausescu.org/ceausescu_texts/ceausescu_chronology.htm|title=www.ceausescu.org – the leading infosource on the web about Ceausescu and his era!|access-date=12 April 2016}}</ref> By the mid-1930s, he had been in missions in Bucharest, [[Craiova]], [[Câmpulung]] and [[Râmnicu Vâlcea]], being arrested several times.<ref name="Gruia43">Gruia, p. 43</ref>

[[File:N. Ceauşescu şi alţi deţinuţi politici în lagărul de la Tg. Jiu.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu (second from the left) as a political prisoner at the Târgu Jiu concentration camp in 1943]]
Soon after being freed, he was arrested again and sentenced for "conspiracy against social order", spending the time during the war in prisons and [[Internment|internment camp]]s: [[Jilava]] (1940), [[Caransebeș]] (1942), [[Văcăreşti prison|Văcărești]] (1943), and Târgu Jiu (1943).<ref name="Gruia43" /> In 1943, he was transferred to [[Târgu Jiu]] [[Internment|internment camp]], where he shared a cell with [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], becoming his protégé. Enticed with substantial bribes, the camp authorities gave the Communist prisoners much freedom in running their cell block, provided they did not attempt to break out of prison.<ref>Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 pages 180–181.</ref> At Târgu Jiu, Gheorghiu-Dej ran "self-criticism sessions" where various Party members had to confess before the other Party members to misunderstanding the dogma of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin as interpreted by Gheorghiu-Dej; journalist [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]] claimed that Ceaușescu's role in these "self-criticism sessions" was that of the enforcer, the young man allegedly beating those Party members who refused to go with or were insufficiently enthusiastic about the "self-criticism" sessions.<ref name="Behr, Edward pages 181-186">Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 pages 181–186.</ref> These "self-criticism sessions" not only helped to cement Gheorghiu-Dej's control over the Party, but also endeared his protégé Ceaușescu to him.<ref name="Behr, Edward pages 181-186" /> It was Ceaușescu's time at Târgu Jiu that marked the beginning of his rise to power.  After [[World War II]], when Romania was beginning to fall under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, Ceaușescu served as secretary of the [[Union of Communist Youth]] (1944–1945).<ref name="autogenerated3" />

[[File:1944soviet1.png|thumb|Ceaușescu and other Communists at a public meeting in [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]], welcoming the Red Army as it entered Bucharest on 30 August 1944]]
After the Communists seized power in Romania in 1947, he headed the ministry of agriculture, then served as deputy minister of the armed forces under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, becoming a major-general. In 1952, Gheorghiu-Dej brought him onto the [[Central Committee]] months after the party's "Muscovite faction" led by [[Ana Pauker]] had been purged. In the late 1940s-early 1950s, the Party had been divided into the "home communists" headed by Gheorghiu-Dej who remained inside Romania prior to 1944 and the "Muscovites" who had gone into exile in the Soviet Union. With the partial exception of Poland, where the [[Polish October]] crisis of 1956 brought to power the previously imprisoned "home communist" [[Władysław Gomułka]], Romania was the only Eastern European nation where the "home communists" triumphed over the "Muscovites". In the rest of the Soviet bloc, there were a series of purges in this period that led to the "home communists" being executed or imprisoned. Like his patron Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceaușescu was a "home communist" who benefited from the fall of the "Muscovites" in 1952. In 1954, Ceaușescu became a full member of the Politburo and eventually rose to occupy the second-highest position in the party hierarchy.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

==Leadership of Romania==
When Gheorghiu-Dej died on 19 March 1965, Ceaușescu was not the obvious successor despite his closeness to the longtime leader. However, widespread infighting by older and more connected officials made the Politburo turn to Ceaușescu as a compromise candidate.<ref name="Revolution1989" /> He was elected general secretary on 22 March 1965, three days after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.

One of his first acts was to change the name of the party from the Romanian Workers' Party back to the [[Communist Party of Romania]] and to declare the country a [[socialist republic]], rather than a [[people's republic]]. In 1967, he consolidated his power by becoming president of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]], making him ''de jure'' head of state. His political apparatus sent many thousands of political opponents to prison or psychiatric hospitals.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

[[File:Ceausescu.jpg|thumb|left|Ceaușescu with [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1965.]]
Initially, Ceaușescu became a popular figure, both in Romania and in the West, because of his independent foreign policy, which challenged the authority of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1960s, he eased press censorship and ended Romania's active participation in the Warsaw Pact, but Romania formally remained a member. He refused to take part in the [[Prague Spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by Warsaw Pact forces and even actively and openly condemned that action in his [[Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968|21 August 1968 speech]]. He travelled to [[Prague]] a week before the invasion to offer moral support to his Czechoslovak counterpart, [[Alexander Dubček]]. Although the Soviet Union largely tolerated Ceaușescu's recalcitrance, his seeming independence from Moscow earned Romania a maverick status within the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name=Revolution1989/>

Ceaușescu's main aim as leader was to make Romania a world power, and all of his economic, foreign and demographic policies were meant to achieve Ceaușescu's ultimate goal: turning Romania into one of the world's great powers.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe In the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 355.</ref> In October 1966, Ceaușescu [[Decree 770|banned abortion and contraception]] and brought in one of the world's harshest anti-abortion laws,<ref>Crampton, Richard Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After, London: Routledge, 1997 page 355.</ref> leading to a large spike in the number of Romanian infants abandoned to deplorable conditions in the [[Romanian orphans|country's orphanages]].

[[File:Indira Gandhi & Nicolae Ceauşescu.jpg|thumb|right|Ceaușescu with [[Indira Gandhi]] during his visit to [[India]] in 1969.]]
During the following years Ceaușescu pursued an open policy towards the United States and [[Western Europe]]. Romania was the first Warsaw Pact country to recognize [[West Germany]], the first to join the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the first to receive a US President, [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907041-1,00.html|title=Rumania: Enfant Terrible|work=Time |date=2 April 1973 | access-date=20 May 2010}}</ref> In 1971, Romania became a member of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].

A series of official visits to Western countries (including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Spain and Australia) helped Ceaușescu to present himself as a reforming Communist, pursuing an independent foreign policy within the Soviet Bloc. He also became eager to be seen as an enlightened international statesman, able to mediate in international conflicts, and to gain international respect for Romania.<ref>{{cite book|title=The EU and Romania: accession and beyond|author=David Phinnemore|publisher=Federal Trust for Education and Research |location=London, UK|year=2006|isbn=1-903403-79-0|page=13}}</ref> Ceaușescu negotiated in international affairs, such as the opening of US relations with China in 1969 and the visit of [[Egypt]]ian president [[Anwar Sadat]] to Israel in 1977. Also Romania was the only country in the world to maintain normal diplomatic relations with both [[Israel]] and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]. In 1980, Romania participated in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]] with its other Soviet bloc allies, but in 1984 was one of the few Communist countries to participate in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] when most of the Eastern Bloc's nations boycotted this event.<ref>{{cite book|title=Romania versus the United States: diplomacy of the absurd, 1985–1989|authors=Roger Kirk, Mircea Răceanu|publisher=Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Georgetown University, 1994|isbn=0-312-12059-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/romaniaversusuni00kirk/page/81 81]|url=https://archive.org/details/romaniaversusuni00kirk/page/81|date=15 July 1994}}</ref>

===1966 decree===
In 1966, in an attempt to boost the country's population, Ceaușescu made [[abortion]] illegal and introduced [[Decree 770]] in order to reverse the Romanian population's low birth and fertility rates. Mothers of at least five children were entitled to receive significant benefits, while mothers of at least ten children were declared "heroine mothers" by the Romanian state. Few women ever sought to receive this status. Instead, the average Romanian family had two to three children during this period (see [[Demographics of Romania]]).<ref>[http://www.country-studies.com/romania/demographic-policy.html Romania's Demographic Policy, U.S. Library of Congress country study] for details see Gail Kligman. 1998. ''The Politics of Duplicity. Controlling Reproduction in Ceausescu's Romania.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.</ref>

The government targeted rising [[divorce]] rates, and made divorce more difficult—it was decreed that marriages could only be dissolved in exceptional cases. By the late 1960s, the population began to swell. In turn, a new problem was created, child abandonment, which swelled the orphanage population (see [[Cighid]]). Many of the children in these orphanages were rejected due to mental and physical deficiencies. The subsequent generation of children is known as ''generația nefericită'' (generation unfortunate) in Romania.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

Measures to encourage reproduction included financial motivations for families who bore children, guaranteed maternity leave, and childcare support for mothers who returned to work, work protection for women, and extensive access to medical control in all stages of pregnancy, as well as after it. Medical control was seen as one of the most productive effects of the law, since all women who became pregnant were under the care of a qualified medical practitioner, even in rural areas. In some cases, if a woman was unable to visit a medical office, a doctor would visit her home.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9C0CE5DA103AF93BA35751C0A966958260 "Upheaval in the East: Romania's AIDS Babies: A Legacy of Neglect,"] 8 February 1990, ''The New York Times''.</ref>

[[File:CeausescuKim1971.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu meeting with North Korean President [[Kim Il-sung]] in 1971]]

Ceaușescu visited [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]] and [[North Vietnam]] in 1971. He took great interest in the idea of total national transformation as embodied in the programmes of North Korea's ''[[Juche]]'' and China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. He was also inspired by the [[personality cult]]s of [[Kim Il-sung's cult of personality|North Korea]]'s [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Mao Zedong's cult of personality|China]]'s [[Mao Zedong]]. Journalist Edward Behr claimed that Ceaușescu admired both Mao and Kim as leaders who not only totally dominated their nations, but had also used totalitarian methods coupled with significant ultra-nationalism mixed in with communism in order to transform both China and North Korea into major world powers.<ref name="Behr, Edward page 195">Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 page 195.</ref> Furthermore, that Kim and even more so Mao had broken free of Soviet control were additional sources of admiration for Ceaușescu. According to Behr, Elena Ceaușescu allegedly bonded with Mao's wife, [[Jiang Qing]].<ref name="Behr, Edward page 195"/> The British journalist wrote that the possibility that what Ceaușescu had seen in both China and North Korea were "vast [[Potemkin village]]s for the hoodwinking of gullible foreign guests" was something that never seemed to have crossed his mind.<ref name="Behr, Edward page 195"/> Shortly after returning home, he began to emulate North Korea's system. North Korean books on ''Juche'' were translated into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and widely distributed inside the country.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Post|first=Jerrold M.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OqIaBQAAQBAJ&q=Juche+Romanian&pg=PA103|title=Narcissism and Politics: Dreams of Glory|date=24 November 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-00872-4|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OqIaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA103&q=Juche+Romanian#v=snippet&q=Juche%20Romanian&f=false 103]|language=en}}</ref>

On 6 July 1971, he delivered a speech before the Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. This quasi-[[Maoism|Maoist]] speech, which came to be known as the [[July Theses]], contained seventeen proposals. Among these were: continuous growth in the "leading role" of the Party; improvement of Party education and of mass political action; youth participation on large construction projects as part of their "patriotic work"; an intensification of political-ideological education in schools and universities, as well as in children's, youth and student organizations; and an expansion of political propaganda, orienting radio and television shows to this end, as well as publishing houses, theatres and cinemas, opera, ballet, artists' unions, promoting a "militant, revolutionary" character in artistic productions. The [[De-Stalinization in Romania|liberalization of 1965]] was condemned and an index of banned books and authors was re-established.

The Theses heralded the beginning of a "mini cultural revolution" in Romania, launching a [[Neo-Stalinism|Neo-Stalinist]] offensive against cultural autonomy, reaffirming an ideological basis for literature that, in theory, the Party had hardly abandoned. Although presented in terms of "Socialist Humanism", the Theses in fact marked a return to the strict guidelines of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]], and attacks on non-compliant intellectuals. Strict ideological conformity in the humanities and social sciences was demanded. Competence and aesthetics were to be replaced by ideology; professionals were to be replaced by [[Agitprop|agitators]]; and culture was once again to become an instrument for political-ideological propaganda and hardline measures.{{cn|date=July 2020}} In a 1972 speech, Ceaușescu stated he wanted " a certain blending of party and state activities...in the long run we shall witness an ever closer blending of the activities of the party, state and other social bodies. In practice, a number of joint party-state organizations were founded such as the Council for Socialist Education and Culture, which had no precise counterpart in any of the other communist states of Eastern Europe, and the Romanian Communist Party was embedded into the daily life of the nation in a way that it never had been before. In 1974, the party programme of the Romanian Communist Party announced that structural changes in society were insufficient to create a full socialist consciousness in the people, and that a full socialist consciousness could only come about if the entire population was made aware of socialist values that guided society. The Communist Party was to be the agency that would so "enlighten" the population and in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton "...the party would merge state and society, the individual and the collective, and would promote 'the ever more organic participation of party members in the entire social life'".<ref>Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe In the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 pages 354–355.</ref>

=== President of the Socialist Republic of Romania ===
[[File:Flag of Chairman of Councils of State and of Ministers of Romania.svg|thumb|Standard as President of Romania]]
In 1974, Ceaușescu converted his post of president of the State Council to a full-fledged [[President of Romania|executive presidency]]. He was first elected to this post [[1974 Romanian presidential election|in 1974]], and would be reelected every five years until 1989.

Although Ceaușescu had been nominal head of state since 1967, he had merely been first among equals on the State Council, deriving his real power coming from his status as party leader. The new post, however, made him the nation's top decision-maker both in name and in fact. He was empowered to carry out those functions of the State Council that did not require [[plenum (meeting)|plenums]]. He also appointed and dismissed the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general whenever the legislature was not in session. In practice, from 1974 onward Ceaușescu frequently ruled by decree.<ref>Grosescu, R. (2004). "The Political Regrouping of Romanian Nomenklatura during the 1989 Revolution". ''Romanian Journal of Society and Politics'', 4(1), 97–123.</ref> Over time, he usurped many powers and functions that nominally were vested in the State Council as a whole.<ref name=cs>{{csref|country=romania|author=Sergiu Verona|section=Government and Politics}}</ref>

Effectively, Ceaușescu now held all governing power in the nation; virtually all party and state institutions were subordinated to his will. The principles of democratic centralism, combined with the legislature's infrequent sessions (it sat in full session only twice a year) meant that for all intents and purposes, his decisions had the force of law.

===Oil embargo, strike and foreign relations===
Starting with the [[1973 oil crisis|1973–74 Arab oil embargo]] against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s, which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants.{{cn|date=July 2020}} Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran, and then to sell all of the refined oil at a profit on the Rotterdam spot market.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 356">Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 page 356.</ref> As Romania lacked the money to build the necessary oil refining plants and Ceaușescu chose to spend the windfall from the high oil prices on aid to the Third World in an attempt to buy Romania international influence, Ceaușescu borrowed heavily from Western banks on the assumption that when the loans came due, the profits from the sales of the refined oil would be more than enough to pay off the loans.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 356" /> A major problem with Ceaușescu's oil-refining plan which led to Romania taking enormous loans was the low productivity of Romanian workers, which meant that the oil-refining plants were finished years behind schedule.{{cn|date=July 2020}} [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|The 1977 earthquake]] which destroyed much of Bucharest also led to delays in the oil plan.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 356" /> By the time the oil refining plants were finished in the early 1980s, a slump in oil prices had set in, leading to major financial problems for Romania.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 356" />

[[File:Ceausescu and Carter 2.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu with [[Jimmy Carter]] during a visit in Washington, D.C. in 1978]]
In August 1977 over 30,000 miners went on strike in the [[Jiu River]] valley complaining of low pay and poor working conditions.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355" /> The [[Jiu Valley miners' strike of 1977|Jiu valley miners' strike]] was the most significant expression of opposition to Ceaușescu's rule prior to the late 1980s. The striking miners were inspired by similar strikes along Poland's Baltic coast in December 1970, and just as in Poland in 1970, the striking Romanian miners demanded face-to-face negotiations with their nation's leader.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355" /> When Ceaușescu appeared before the miners on the third day of the strike, he was greeted (in the words of the British historian Richard Crampton) "... once again ''á la polonaise'', with cries of 'Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!'".<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355" /> Ceaușescu ultimately negotiated a compromise solution to the strike.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355" /> In the years after the strike,a number of its leaders died of accidents and "premature disease". Rumors emerged that ''Securitate'' had doctors give the strike leaders 5-minute chest X-rays to ensure the development of cancer.<ref name="Crampton, Richard page 355" />

He continued to follow an independent policy in foreign relations—for example, in 1984, Romania was one of few communist states (notably including the People's Republic of China, and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) to take part in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, despite a Soviet-led boycott.

[[File:Mugabe76Romania.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu in a meeting with [[Robert Mugabe]] in 1979]]
Also, the Socialist Republic of Romania was the first of the [[Eastern bloc]] nations to have official relations with the [[Western bloc]] and the [[European Community]]: an agreement including Romania in the Community's Generalised System of Preferences was signed in 1974 and an Agreement on Industrial Products was signed in 1980. On 4 April 1975, Ceaușescu visited Japan and met with [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]]
In June 1978, Ceaușescu made a state visit to the UK where a £200m licensing agreement was signed between the Romanian government and [[British Aerospace]] for the production of more than eighty [[BAC One-Eleven]] aircraft. The deal was said at the time to be the biggest between two countries involving a civil aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|title=Britain and Romania sign £200m plane deal|last=Spainer|first=David|date=16 June 1978|work=The Times|page=1|location=London}}</ref>  This was the first state visit by a Communist head of state to the UK, and Ceausescu was given a knighthood by the Queen, which was revoked on the day before his death in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/five-controversial-state-visits-to-the-uk-10748635|title=Nine controversial state visits to the UK|date=4 June 2019|website=news.sky.com|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/goodwin-mugabe-mussolini-ceausescu-disgraced|title=Goodwin joins Mugabe, Mussolini and Ceausescu in gang of disgraced figures|date=31 January 2012|website=www.theguardian.com|access-date=20 May 2020}}</ref> Similarly, in 1983, [[Vice President of the United States]] [[George H.

===Pacepa defection===
In 1978, [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], a senior member of the Romanian political police ([[Securitate]], State Security), defected to the United States. A three-star general, he was the highest ranking defector from the [[Eastern Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. His defection was a powerful blow against the administration, forcing Ceaușescu to overhaul the architecture of the Security. Pacepa's 1986 book, ''Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief'' ({{ISBN|0-89526-570-2}}), claims to expose details of Ceaușescu's government activities, such as massive spying on American industry and elaborate efforts to rally Western political support.

===Foreign debt===
{{main|1980s austerity policy in Romania}}
[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|left|By the 1980s, the Ceaușescus had developed a [[Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality|personality cult]]. ]]
Ceaușescu's political independence from the Soviet Union and his protest against the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]] drew the interest of Western powers, whose governments briefly believed that he was an anti-Soviet maverick and hoped to create a schism in the Warsaw Pact by funding him. Ceaușescu did not realise that the funding was not always favorable. Ceaușescu was able to borrow heavily (more than $13&nbsp;billion) from the West to finance economic development programs, but these loans ultimately devastated the country's finances.  He also secured a deal for cheap oil from [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]], but that deal fell through after the Shah was [[Iranian Revolution|overthrown]].

In an attempt to correct this, Ceaușescu decided to repay Romania's [[foreign debt]]s. He organised a referendum and managed to change the constitution, adding a clause that barred Romania from taking foreign loans in the future. According to official results, the referendum yielded a nearly unanimous "yes" vote.<ref>Mungiu‐Pippidi, A. (2001). "The Return of Populism‐The 2000 Romanian Elections". ''[[Government and Opposition]]'', 36(2), 230–252.</ref>

In the 1980s, Ceaușescu ordered the export of much of the country's agricultural and industrial production in order to repay its debts. The resulting domestic shortages made the everyday lives of Romanians a fight for survival as food rationing was introduced and heating, gas and electricity blackouts became the rule. During the 1980s, there was a steady decrease in the Romanian population's living standards, especially in the availability and quality of food and general goods in shops. During this time, all regional radio stations were closed, and television was limited to a single channel broadcasting for only two hours a day.

The debt was fully paid in the summer of 1989, shortly before Ceaușescu was overthrown.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

===1984 failed coup d'état attempt===
A tentative [[coup d'état]] planned in October 1984 failed when the military unit assigned to carry out the plan was sent to harvest maize instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ceauşescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965–1989|first=Dennis|last=Deletant|page=351|isbn=978-1563246333|publisher=M.E.Sharpe|year=1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmmilITRkxYC&pg=PA351}}</ref>

===Romani Rights===
During the Ceaușescu regime, the [[Romani people|Romani]] were largely neglected. This can be seen, perhaps most blatantly, with a motion from the [[Romanian Communist Party|Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers Party]], which largely laid the foundation for the Ceaușescu regime's policies regarding the rights of ethnic minorities. The motion ignored the Romani entirely.<ref name="books.openedition.org">{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/ceup/1554|title=The Roma in Romanian History|first=Viorel|last=Achim|date=23 January 2013|publisher=Central European University Press|pages=189–202|access-date=29 August 2019|via=OpenEdition Books}}</ref>

Under the regime, the Romani were excluded in the list of "co-inhabiting nationalities" drafted by the regime, and lacked any representation in government as an ethnic group. This was the case even after representation increased for other minorities such as [[Hungarians]] and [[Germans]]. Ceaușescu largely wished to conjure away the living conditions of the Romani, which were ignored by his predecessors and put in place as early as the regime of [[Ion Antonescu]].<ref name="books.openedition.org"/>

The result of the neglect of the Romani, who had long been a highly vulnerable ethnic minority group across Europe, left the majority of Romani people in Romania in significant poverty and at risk to hate-crimes. Such conditions have lasted into modern-day Romania with the policies of several subsequent presidents.

==Revolution and death ==
{{Main|Romanian Revolution}}
[[File:Ceausescu, Nicolae.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu in 1988]]
In November 1989, the XIVth Congress of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) saw Ceaușescu, then aged 71, re-elected for another five years as leader of the PCR. During the Congress, Ceaușescu made a speech denouncing the anti-Communist revolutions happening throughout the rest of Eastern Europe. The following month, Ceaușescu's government itself collapsed after a series of violent events in [[Timișoara]] and [[Bucharest]].

===Timișoara===
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2018}}

Demonstrations in the city of Timișoara were triggered by the government-sponsored attempt to evict [[László Tőkés]], an ethnic Hungarian pastor, accused by the government of inciting [[ethnic hatred]]. Members of his ethnic Hungarian [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] surrounded his apartment in a show of support.

Romanian students spontaneously joined the demonstration, which soon lost nearly all connection to its initial cause and became a more general anti-government demonstration. Regular military forces, police, and the Securitate fired on demonstrators on 17 December 1989, killing and injuring men, women, and children.

On 18 December 1989, Ceaușescu departed for a state visit to [[Iran]], leaving the duty of crushing the Timișoara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Upon his return to Romania on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building), in which he spoke about the events at Timișoara in terms of an "interference of foreign forces in Romania's internal affairs" and an "external aggression on Romania's sovereignty."

The country, which had little to no information of the events transpiring in Timișoara from the national media, learned about the revolt from radio stations (such as [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]) and by word of mouth. On the next day, 21 December, Ceaușescu staged a [[Ceausescu's final speech|mass meeting in Bucharest]]. Official media presented it as a "spontaneous movement of support for Ceaușescu", emulating the [[Ceausescu's speech of 21 August 1968|1968 meeting]] in which he had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.

===Overthrow===
====Speech on 21 December====
{{Main|Ceaușescu's final speech}}
The mass meeting of 21 December, held in what is now [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Revolution Square]], began like many of Ceaușescu's speeches over the years.  He spoke of the achievements of the "Socialist revolution" and Romania's "multi-laterally developed Socialist society."  He also blamed the Timișoara riots on "fascist agitators who want to destroy socialism."<ref>Text of Speech in Revolution Square, 21 December 1989</ref>

However, Ceaușescu had misjudged the crowd's mood.  Roughly eight minutes into his speech, several people began jeering and booing, and others began chanting "[[Timișoara]]!" He tried to silence them by raising his right hand and calling for the crowd's attention before order was temporarily restored, then proceeded to announce social benefit reforms that included raising the national minimum wage by 200 [[Romanian lei|lei]] per month to a total of 2,200 per month by 1 January.  Images of Ceaușescu's facial expression as the crowd began to boo and heckle him were among the most widely broadcast of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=978-0-375-42532-5|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>

Failing to control the crowd, the Ceaușescus finally took cover inside the building that housed the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party. The rest of the day saw an open revolt of Bucharest's population, which had assembled in University Square and confronted the police and army at barricades. The rioters, however, were no match for the military apparatus concentrated in Bucharest, which cleared the streets by midnight and arrested hundreds of people in the process.

====Flight on 22 December====
By the morning of 22 December, the [[rebellion]] had already spread to all major cities across the country. The suspicious death of [[Vasile Milea]], Ceaușescu's [[defence minister]], later confirmed as a suicide (he tried to incapacitate himself with a flesh wound but a bullet severed his artery),<ref>Marcau, Flavius Cristian, [http://www.utgjiu.ro/revista/lit/pdf/2013-04/16_Flavius%20Cristian%20Marcau%20-%20Revolution%20of%201989%20-%20Milea%60s%20suicide.pdf "Revolution of 1989: Milea's Suicide"], University of Târgu Jiu, Letter and Social Science Series, Issue 4, 2013, Retrieved 27 February 2016.</ref> was announced by the media. Immediately thereafter, Ceaușescu presided over the CPEx (Political Executive Committee) meeting and assumed the leadership of the army.
Believing that Milea had been murdered, rank-and-file soldiers switched sides to the revolution almost ''en masse''.  The commanders wrote off Ceaușescu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the government. Ceaușescu made a last desperate attempt to address the crowd gathered in front of the Central Committee building, but the people in the square began throwing stones and other projectiles at him, forcing him to take refuge in the building once more.  He, Elena and four others managed to get to the roof and escape by helicopter, only seconds ahead of a group of demonstrators who had followed them there.<ref name=Revolution1989/> The [[Romanian Communist Party]] disappeared soon afterwards; unlike its kindred parties in the former Soviet bloc, it has never been revived.

During the course of the revolution, the Western press{{who?|date=January 2020}} published estimates of the number of people killed by [[Securitate]] forces in an attempt to quell Ceaușescu and support the rebellion{{fact?|date=January 2020}}. The count increased rapidly until an estimated 64,000 fatalities were widely reported across front pages.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Narcissism and politics : dreams of glory|last=M.|first=Post, Jerrold|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781107008724|location=New York, NY|pages=106|oclc=878953196}}</ref> The Hungarian military attaché expressed doubt regarding these figures, pointing out the unfeasible logistics of killing such a large number of people in such a short period of time. After Ceaușescu's death, hospitals across the country reported a death toll of fewer than 1,000, and probably much lower than that.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aubin|first=Stephen P|title=Distorting defense: Network news and national security|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|page=158|isbn=978-0-275-96303-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YH5rPgWvzUC&q=revolution+romania+1989+death+toll&pg=PA158|access-date=28 June 2008}}</ref>

===Death===
{{main|Trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu}}
[[File:Grave of Nicolae Ceausescu - Ghencea Civil Cemetery - Bucharest - Romania.jpg|thumb|Ceaușescu's original grave, [[Ghencea Cemetery]], Bucharest (photographed in 2007)]]
[[File:Ceaușescu Grave.jpg|thumb|The current resting place of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu at Ghencea Cemetery (photographed in 2018). Note that Elena Ceaușescu's year of birth is incorrectly recorded as 1919; her actual year of birth is 1916.]]
Ceaușescu and his wife Elena fled the capital with [[Emil Bobu]] and [[Manea Mănescu]] and flew by helicopter to Ceaușescu's [[Snagov]] residence, from which they fled again, this time to [[Târgoviște]]. They abandoned the helicopter near Târgoviște, having been ordered to land by the army, which by that time had restricted flying in Romania's airspace. The Ceaușescus were held by the police while the policemen listened to the radio. They were eventually turned over to the army.

On Christmas Day, 25 December 1989, the Ceaușescus were tried before a court convened in a small room on orders of the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]], Romania's provisional government. They faced charges including illegal gathering of wealth and [[genocide]]. Ceaușescu repeatedly denied the court's authority to try him, and asserted he was still legally the President of Romania. At the end of the quick [[show trial]], the Ceaușescus were found guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. A soldier standing guard in the proceedings was ordered to take the Ceaușescus out the back one by one and shoot them, but the Ceaușescus demanded to die together. The soldiers agreed to this and began to tie their hands behind their backs, which the Ceaușescus protested against, but were powerless to prevent.

The Ceaușescus were executed by a gathering of soldiers: Captain Ionel Boeru, Sergeant-Major Georghin Octavian and Dorin-Marian Cîrlan,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6967099.ece|newspaper=The Times|location=London|title=Ceausescu looked in my eyes and he knew that he was going to die|first=Roger|last=Boyes|date=24 December 2009|access-date=20 May 2010|url-access=subscription }}</ref> while reportedly hundreds of others also volunteered. Before his sentence was carried out, Nicolae Ceaușescu sang "[[The Internationale]]" whilst being led up against the wall. The firing squad began shooting as soon as the two were in position against a wall.

Later that day, the execution was also shown on Romanian television.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Der Diktator und sein Henker|url=https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/ceausescus-scharfrichter-der-diktator-und-sein-henker-3293070.html|access-date=2020-10-03|website=stern.de|language=de}}</ref> The hasty show trial and the images of the dead Ceaușescus were videotaped and the footage released in numerous Western countries two days after the execution.

The manner in which the trial was conducted has been widely criticised inside and outside Romania. However, [[Ion Iliescu]], Romania's provisional president, said in 2009 that the trial was "quite shameful, but necessary" in order to end the state of near-anarchy that had gripped the country in the three days since the Ceaușescus fled Bucharest.<ref name=dem25dec>{{cite news|last=Demian|first=Sinziana|title=In Romania, Ceausescu's death haunts Christmas|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/091224/romania-nicolae-elena-ceausescu|access-date=30 March 2013|newspaper=Global Post|date=25 December 2009|location=Cluj Napoca}}</ref> Similarly, [[Victor Stănculescu]], who had been defence minister before going over to the revolution, said, in 2009, that the alternative would have been seeing the Ceaușescus [[Lynching|lynched]] on the streets of Bucharest.<ref name=bbc25dec>{{cite news|title=Ceausescu execution 'avoided mob lynching'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8430213.stm|access-date=30 March 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=25 December 2009}}</ref>

The Ceaușescus were the last people to be executed in Romania before the abolition of [[Capital punishment in Romania|capital punishment]] on 7 January 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdep.ro/pls/legis/legis_pck.htp_act_text?idt=11033|title=DECRET-LEGE nr.6 din 7 ianuarie 1990 pentru abolirea pedepsei cu moartea, pentru modificarea şi abrogarea unor prevederi din Codul penal şi alte acte normative|access-date=12 April 2016|language=ro}}</ref>

Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu were originally buried in simple graves at [[Ghencea Cemetery]], in Bucharest, on opposite sides of a path; their graves were often decorated with flowers and symbols of communist rule. In April 2007, their son, [[Valentin Ceaușescu]], lost an appeal for an investigation into whether the graves were genuine. Upon his death in 1996, the youngest son, [[Nicu Ceaușescu|Nicu]], was buried nearby in the same cemetery.<ref name=osb21jul/> According to the ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'',<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', 25 January 2005</ref> requests were made by the Ceaușescus' daughter, [[Zoia Ceaușescu|Zoia]], and by supporters of their political views, to move their remains to mausoleums or to purpose-built churches. These demands were denied by the government.

==Ceaușescu's policies==
{{see also|National Communism in Romania}}
While the term ''Ceaușism'' became widely used inside Romania,{{cn|date=July 2020}} usually as a pejorative, it never achieved status in [[academia]]. This can be explained by the largely crude and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] character of the dogma. Ceaușescu attempted to [[Revisionism (Marxism)|include his views]] in mainstream [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, to which he added his belief in a "multilaterally developed Socialist society" as a necessary stage between the [[Marxism-Leninism|Leninist]] concepts of [[Socialist mode of production|Socialist]] and [[Communist society|Communist societies]] (a critical view reveals that the main reason for the interval is the [[Withering away of the state|disappearance of the State]] and Party structures in Communism).{{cn|date=July 2020}} A Romanian Encyclopedic Dictionary entry in 1978 underlines the concept as "a new, superior, stage in the Socialist development of Romania [...] begun by the 1971–1975 Five-Year Plan, prolonged over several [succeeding and projected] Five-Year Plans".<ref>''Mic Dicționar Enciclopedic''</ref>

Ceaușism's main trait was a form of [[Romanian nationalism]],<ref>Geran Pilon, Chapter III, ''Communism with a Nationalist Face'', pp. 60–66; Tănase, p. 24</ref> one which arguably propelled Ceaușescu to power in 1965, and probably accounted for the Party leadership under [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] choosing him over the more orthodox [[Gheorghe Apostol]]. Although he had previously been a careful supporter of the official lines, Ceaușescu came to embody Romanian society's wish for independence after what many considered years of Soviet directives and purges, during and after the [[SovRom]] fiasco. He carried this nationalist option inside the Party, manipulating it against the nominated successor Apostol. This nationalist policy had more timid precedents:<ref name="autogenerated1">Geran Pilon, p.60</ref> for example, Gheorghiu-Dej had overseen the withdrawal of the [[Red Army]] in 1958.

[[File:Moldovan workers during Ceausescu visit (1972). (14549532742).jpg|thumb|Moldovan workers during Ceaușescu's visit to [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Moldavia]] in 1972]]
It had also engineered the publishing of several works that subverted the Russian and Soviet image, no longer glossing over traditional points of tension with Russia and the Soviet Union (even alluding to an "unlawful" Soviet presence in Bessarabia). In the final years of Gheorghiu-Dej's rule, more problems were openly discussed, with the publication of a collection of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings that dealt with Romanian topics, showing Marx's previously censored, politically uncomfortable views of Russia.

Ceaușescu was prepared to take a more decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society,<ref>Tănase, p.23</ref> which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceaușescu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the [[Prague Spring]] by [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. After a visit from [[Charles de Gaulle]] earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceaușescu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the ''[[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]]'' created on the spur of the moment, in order to meet the perceived threat.<ref>Geran Pilon, p.62</ref> President Richard Nixon was invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a communist country after the start of the Cold War.

[[Alexander Dubček]]'s version of ''[[Socialism with a human face]]'' was never suited to Romanian Communist goals.{{cn|date=July 2020}} Ceaușescu found himself briefly aligned with Dubček's [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. The latter friendship was to last until Tito's death in 1980, with Ceaușescu adapting the [[Titoism|Titoist]] doctrine of "independent Socialist development" to suit his own objectives.{{cn|date=July 2020}} Romania proclaimed itself a "Socialist" (in place of "People's") Republic to show that it was fulfilling Marxist goals without Moscow's oversight.

The system's nationalist traits grew and progressively blended with [[North Korea]]n ''[[Juche]]'' and [[China|Chinese]] [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideals.{{cn|date=July 2020}} In 1971, the Party, which had already been completely purged of internal opposition (with the possible exception of [[Gheorghe Gaston Marin]]),<ref name="autogenerated1" /> approved the ''[[July Theses]]'', expressing Ceaușescu's disdain of Western models as a whole, and the reevaluation of the recent liberalisation as ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''. The 1974 XIth Party Congress tightened the Party's grip on Romanian culture, guiding it towards Ceaușescu's nationalist principles.<ref name="autogenerated2">Geran Pilon, p.61</ref> Notably, it demanded that Romanian historians refer to [[Dacians]] as having "an unorganised State", part of a political continuum that culminated in the Socialist Republic.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> The government continued its cultural dialogue with ancient forms, with Ceaușescu connecting his cult of personality to figures such as [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea cel Bătrân]] (lit. "Mircea the Elder", whom he styled "Mircea the Great") and [[Mihai Viteazul]] (Michael the Brave). It also started adding Dacian or [[Imperial Rome|Roman]] versions to the names of cities and towns (''Drobeta'' to [[Turnu Severin]], ''Napoca'' to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]).<ref>Geran Pilon, pp. 61–63</ref> Although Ceaușescu maintained an independent, "national Communist" course, his absolute control over the country, as well as the intensity of the personality cult surrounding him, led many non-Romanian observers to describe his rule as one of the closest things to an old-style Stalinist regime. The last edition of the [[Country Studies|Country Study]] on Romania, for instance, referred to the PCR's "Stalinist repression of individual liberties."<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ro0010%29</ref> A new generation of committed supporters on the outside confirmed the administration's character. Ceaușescu probably never emphasized that his policies constituted a paradigm for theorists of [[National Bolshevism]] such as [[Jean-François Thiriart]], but there was a publicised connection between him and [[Iosif Constantin Drăgan]], an [[Iron Guard]]ist Romanian-Italian émigré millionaire (Drăgan was already committed to a Dacian [[Protochronism]] that largely echoed the official cultural policy).

Nicolae Ceaușescu had a major influence on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-[[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] dictator [[Ion Antonescu]]. Although Antonescu's image was never a fully official myth in Ceaușescu's time, after his overthrow politicians such as [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Magyar minority]] in Romania had several unusual aspects: not only was it a vitriolic argument between two officially [[Socialist state]]s, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the [[Iron Curtain]], appealed to the [[Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism,<ref>Geran Pilon, p.63</ref> and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.

The strong opposition to Ceaușescu on all forms of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]'' placed Ceaușescu at odds with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. He was very displeased when other Warsaw Pact countries decided to try their own versions of Gorbachev's reforms. In particular, he was incensed when [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]]'s leaders opted for a power-sharing arrangement with the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union. He even went as far as to call for a Warsaw Pact invasion of Poland—a significant reversal, considering how violently he opposed the invasion of Czechoslovakia 20 years earlier. For his part, Gorbachev made no secret of his distaste for Ceaușescu, whom he called "the Romanian [[führer]]." At a meeting between the two, Gorbachev upbraided Ceaușescu for his inflexible attitude. "You are running a dictatorship here," the Soviet leader warned.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

In November 1989, at the XIVth and last congress of the PCR, Ceaușescu condemned the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and asked for the annulment of its consequences. In effect, this amounted to a demand for the return of Bessarabia (most of which was then a Soviet republic and since 1991 has been independent [[Moldova]]) and northern [[Bukovina]], both of which had been [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviet Union]] in 1940 and again at the end of World War II.

===Non-aligned policy feats===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0529-029, Berlin, Tagung Warschauer Pakt, Gruppenfoto.jpg|thumb|[[Warsaw Pact]] leaders in 1987 from left to right: [[Gustáv Husák|Husák]] of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Todor Zhivkov|Zhivkov]] of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] of [[East Germany]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] of the [[Soviet Union]], Ceaușescu, [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] of [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[János Kádár|Kádár]] of [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]]]

Ceaușescu's Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country that retained diplomatic relations with Israel and did not sever diplomatic relations after Israel's pre-emptive strike against [[Egypt]] at the start of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Ceaușescu made efforts to act as a mediator between the [[PLO]] and [[Israel]].

Similarly, Romania was the only Eastern Bloc country to attend the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]], which had been [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] by the Soviets and the rest of their allies in response to the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|U.S.-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.

Ceaușescu's Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] country that did not sever diplomatic relations with [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Chile]] after [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Augusto Pinochet's coup]].<ref>Valenzuela, J. Samuel and Arturo Valenzuela (eds.), ''Military Rule in Chile: Dictatorship and Oppositions'', p. 321</ref>

Nicolae Ceaușescu was a close ally and personal friend of [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|dictator]] [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaïre]]. Relations were in fact not just state-to-state, but party-to-party between their respective [[One-party state|political machineries]], the [[Popular Movement of the Revolution|MPR]] and the [[Romanian Communist Party|PCR]]. Many believe that Ceaușescu's death played a role in influencing Mobutu to "democratise" Zaïre in 1990.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+zr0173) Relations with the Socialist World] [[Library of Congress Country Study]] on Zaire (Former), Library of Congress Call Number DT644 .Z3425 1994.

Ceaușescu reduced the size of the [[Romanian People's Army]] by 5%, for which he organized a [[Romanian military referendum, 1986|mock referendum]].<ref name=DD>[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=ro011986 Rumänien, 23. November 1986 : Verkleinerung des Heeres, Senkung der Rüstungsausgaben um 5%] Direct Democracy</ref> In line with his policy of keeping a facade of "popular democracy" he also ordered large rallies for peace to be held.

====Bessarabia====
In August 1976, Nicolae Ceaușescu was the first high-level Romanian visitor to [[Bessarabia]] since World War II. In December 1976, at one of his meetings in Bucharest, [[Ivan Bodiul]] said that "the good relationship was initiated by Ceaușescu's visit to Soviet Moldova".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/53-1-68.shtml|title=Romanian-Moldavian SSR relations, by Patrick Moore and the Romanian Section}}</ref>

===Personality cult and totalitarianism===
[[File:TimbruNicolaeCeausescu.png|thumb|Stamp commemorating the 70th birthday (and 55 years of political activity) of Nicolae Ceaușescu, 1988]]
{{main|Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality}}
Ceaușescu created a pervasive [[Cult of personality|personality cult]], giving himself such titles as "[[Conducător]]" ("Leader") and "Geniul din Carpați" ("The Genius of the Carpathians"), with inspiration from [[Proletarian Culture]] ([[Proletkult]]). After his election as President of Romania, he even had a [[Kings of Romania|king]]-like [[sceptre]] made for himself.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2019}} 

The most important day of the year during Ceaușescu's rule was his birthday, 26 January – a day which saw Romanian media saturated with praise for him. According to historian [[Victor Sebestyen]], it was one of the few days of the year when the average Romanian put on a happy face, since appearing miserable on this day was too risky to contemplate.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

Such excesses prompted painter [[Salvador Dalí]] to send a congratulatory telegram to the Romanian president, in which he sarcastically congratulated Ceaușescu on his "introducing the presidential sceptre". The Communist Party daily ''[[Scînteia]]'' published the message, unaware that it was a work of satire. To lessen the chance of further treason after Pacepa's defection, Ceaușescu also invested his wife Elena and other members of his family with important positions in the government. This led Romanians to joke that Ceaușescu was creating "[[socialism in one country|socialism in one family]]".{{Cn|date=March 2020}}

Not surprisingly, Ceaușescu was greatly concerned about his public image. For years, nearly all official photographs of him showed him in his late 40s. Romanian state television was under strict orders to portray him in the best possible light.<ref name=Revolution1989/> Additionally, producers had to take great care to make sure that Ceaușescu's height (he was only {{convert|1.68|m}} tall<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|title=Un Ceauşescu pe care nu îl ştiaţi: creţ, cu ochii "blonzi" şi nasul borcănat|language=ro|publisher=Realitatea.net|date=3 August 2011|access-date=22 July 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726194246/http://www.realitatea.net/un-ceausescu-pe-care-nu-il-stiati-cret-cu-ochii-blonzi-si-nasul-borcanat_858565.html|archive-date=26 July 2014}}</ref>) was never emphasized on screen. Consequences for breaking these rules were severe; one producer showed footage of Ceaușescu blinking and stuttering, and was banned for three months.<ref name=Revolution1989/>

As part of a propaganda ploy arranged by the Ceaușescus through the consular cultural attachés of Romanian embassies,{{cn|date=July 2020}} they managed to receive orders and titles from numerous states and institutions. France granted Nicolae Ceaușescu the [[Legion of Honour]]. In 1978 he became a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB) in the [[UK]],<ref>[[List of honorary British Knights]]</ref> a title of which he was stripped in 1989. Elena Ceaușescu was arranged to be "elected" to membership of a science academy in the U.S.

To execute a massive redevelopment project during the rule of Nicolae Ceausescu, the government conducted extensive demolition of churches and many other historic structures in Romania. According to Alexandru Budistenu, former chief architect of Bucharest, "The sight of a church bothered Ceausescu.  It didn't matter if they demolished or moved it, as long as it was no longer in sight." Nevertheless, a project organized by Romanian engineer Eugeniu Iordachescu was able to move many historic structures to less-prominent sites and save them.<ref>Smith, Harrison.

==Legacy==
Ceaușescu had a mixed reputation among international leaders of his time. In his memoir ''The Artful Albanian'', Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]] remarked "As if Ceausescu and company are to bring down imperialism! If the world waits for the Ceausescus to do such a thing, imperialism will live for tens of thousands of years..."<ref>Enver Hoxha (1986) The Artful Albanian, (Chatto & Windus, London)</ref> However Libyan leader [[Muammar Gadaffi]] had an opposite interpretation saying, "My brother! You are my brother for the rest of my life!".<ref>Muammar Gaddafi, as quoted in Lt. General Ion Mihai Pacepa (1987) Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief (Regnery Gateway, p. 101)</ref> Ceaușescu even received praise from anti-communists with the leader of Iran [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] saying "I would like to salute [Ceaușescu's] intransigent patriotism and ferocious will for independence. A veritable amity links me to him."<ref>Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, Réponse à l'Histoire (Albin Michel, 1979), p. 190</ref>

He directed the construction of the [[Palace of the Parliament]] in Bucharest, which broke ground in June 1984. It was previously called The House of the People and The People's House. The building of the Palace of the Parliament was the most extreme expression of the [[Systematization (Romania)|systematization]] program imposed by Nicolae Ceaușescu upon Romania. The systematization was a program of [[urban planning]] carried out by Ceaușescu. The main architect of the building was [[Anca Petrescu]] (1949-2013), who began her work on this building when she was 28 years old. The building was completed in 1997, after Ceaușescu's death in 1989. Since 2004 the [[Romanian Senate]] has been headquartered in the Parliamentary Palace and was originally housed in the former building of the Central Committee of the [[Romanian Communist Party]]. The building has 1,100 rooms and is the largest civilian government building in the world as measured by volume in one continuous structure. (There are private sector buildings, mainly for the construction of aircraft that have more continuous volume in one building, such as the [[Boeing Everett Factory]] in Everett, Washington; see the [[List of largest buildings#Largest usable volume]].) Much of the building remains empty, being larger than the Parliament needs, though Parliament shares it with three museums and an international conference center.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/05/travel/ceausescu-trail-bucharest-romania/index.html?hpt=hp_c5 |title=Palace of the damned dictator: On the trail of Ceausescu in Bucharest |work=CNN |first=John |last=Malathronas |date=5 December 2014 |access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref> It is also the heaviest building in the world, being constructed of  700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze, a million square feet of marble, and large amounts of crystal and wood.<ref name=heavy>{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-building/ |title=Heaviest building |work=Guinness World Records |access-date=12 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The heaviest building in the world |url=https://www.viacapitalevendu.com/blogue/en/heaviest-building-world/ |work=Via Capitale |language=en |date=1 November 2018 |access-date=12 August 2020 }}</ref>

[[File:019.Vacanta-pentrecuta-in-Moldova-1976 (1).jpg|thumb|His successor, [[Ion Iliescu]], and Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1976]]
Nicolae and [[Elena Ceaușescu]] had three children: [[Valentin Ceaușescu]] (born 1948), a nuclear physicist; [[Zoia Ceaușescu]] (1949–2006), a mathematician; and [[Nicu Ceaușescu]] (1951–1996), a physicist.

Praising the "crimes" of totalitarian governments and denigrating their victims is forbidden by law in Romania; this includes the Ceaușescu era. Dinel Staicu was fined 25,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] (approx. 9,000 United States dollars) for praising Ceaușescu and displaying his pictures on his private television channel (''3TV Oltenia'').<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220071037/http://www.cna.ro/comunicare/comunic/2006/c0207.html |date=20 December 2007 |title=Official communique of the National Board of the Audio-Visual }}, originally at [http://www.cna.ro/comunicare/comunic/2006/c0207.html cna.org] but now removed, accessible through web.archive.org</ref> Nevertheless, according to opinion polls held in 2010, 41% of Romanians would vote for Ceaușescu<ref>{{cite web|author=John Horvath |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/33/33094/1.html |title=Ceausescu – Back from the Dead |publisher=Telepolis |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="balkanalysis.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/ |title=In Romania, Opinion Polls Show Nostalgia for Communism |publisher=Balkanalysis |date=27 December 2011 |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref> and 63% think that their lives were better before 1989.<ref name="balkanalysis.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Noul_Partid_Comunist_Roman-_Pionierii_0_367163711.html |title=Noul Partid Comunist Român, condus de un șofer de taxi |publisher=Adevarul |access-date=28 December 2012}}</ref> In 2014, the percentage of those who would vote for Ceaușescu reached 46%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Social/SONDAJ%2B66%2Bdintre%2Bromanii%2Bintervievati%2Bl-ar%2Bvota%2Bacum%2Bpe%2BNicolae%2B|title=SONDAJ. 46% dintre românii intervievaţi l-ar vota acum pe Nicolae Ceauşescu la prezidenţiale|work=DIGI24.ro|access-date=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821180553/http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Social/SONDAJ+66+dintre+romanii+intervievati+l-ar+vota+acum+pe+Nicolae+|archive-date=21 August 2016}}</ref> On 27 December 2018, a poll was conducted where 64% of people had a good opinion of Ceaușescu.<ref>https://transylvanianow.com/ceausescu-still-most-beloved-president-of-romania/</ref>

==Honours and awards==
Ceaușescu was made a knight of the Danish [[Order of the Elephant]], but this appointment was revoked on 23 December 1989 by the queen of Denmark, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]].

Ceaușescu was likewise stripped of his honorary [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] (Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath) status by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] on the day before his execution. Queen Elizabeth II also returned the insignia of the [[Order of the Star of the Socialist Republic of Romania]] that Ceaușescu had bestowed upon her in 1978.<ref>The Official Website of the British Monarchy: [http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Honours.aspx "Queen and Honours"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116034858/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/Honours.aspx |date=16 January 2013 }}, retrieved on 13 October 2010.</ref>

On his 70th birthday in 1988, Ceaușescu was decorated with the [[Karl Marx Order|Karl-Marx-Order]] by then [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) chief [[Erich Honecker]]; through this he was honoured for his rejection of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms.
