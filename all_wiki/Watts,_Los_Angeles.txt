'''Watts''' is a neighborhood in southern [[Los Angeles, California]]. It is located within the [[South Los Angeles]] region, bordering the cities of [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]] and [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] to the east and southeast, respectively, and the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Willowbrook, California|Willowbrook]] to the south.

Founded in the late nineteenth century as a [[ranching]] community, the arrival of the [[railroads]] and the construction of [[Watts Station]] saw the rapid development of Watts as an independent city, but in 1926 was consolidated with Los Angeles. By the 1940s, Watts transformed into a primarily [[working class]] [[African-American neighborhood]], but from the 1960s developed a reputation as a low-income, high-crime area, following the [[Watts riots]] and the increasing influence of [[Gang|street gangs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/watts/crime/|title=Watts|website=Mapping L.A.}}</ref> Watts has become a predominantly [[Hispanic]] neighborhood with a significant African American minority,{{r|AP 2020-08-10}} and remains one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Los Angeles despite falling crime rates since the 1990s. Notable civic activities by residents of Watts include the "Toys for Watts" [[toy drive]], the Watts [[Christmas parade]], and the "Watts Summer Games" athletic tournament, as well as a local [[theatre]] and a dance company, in an effort to improve the neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawattstimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2204:the-beautiful-color-of-watts-lynn-manning-s-gift-for-theatre-thrives-at-the-watts-village-theater-company&catid=23:community&Itemid=118 |title=The Beautiful Color of Watts; Lynn Manning's gift for theatre thrives at the Watts Village Theater Company |date=February 27, 2014 |first=Shonassee |last=Shaver |work=L.A.

Watts is noted internationally for the landmark [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]], which are a [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] and also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Los Angeles, California|National Register of Historic Places]]. The neighborhood has also been featured or referenced in numerous forms of media, particularly [[West Coast hip-hop]] music, and [[movies]] and [[television shows]] set in Los Angeles.

==History==
[[File:Watts-1912.jpg|thumb|left|Looking east on Main Street (later 103rd Street) towards the Pacific Electric Railway depot, right of center, and various businesses. Photograph dated July, 1912.]]

The area now known as Watts is located on the 1843 [[Rancho La Tajauta]] Mexican land grant. As on all [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]], the principal vocation at that time was grazing and beef production.<ref name=MaryEllen>{{cite book |first=MaryEllen Bell |last=Ray |title=The City of Watts, California: 1907 to 1926 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Rising Publications |year=1985}}</ref>

With the influx of European American settlers into Southern California in the 1870s, La Tajuata land was sold off and subdivided for smaller farms and homes, including a {{cvt|220|acre |ha|adj=mid}} parcel purchased by Charles H. Watts in 1886 for alfalfa and livestock farming. In those days each Tajuata farm had an [[artesian well]].

The arrival of the railroad spurred the settlement and development of the area. Most of the first residents were the [[traqueros]], Mexican and Mexican American rail workers who constructed and maintained the new rail lines.<ref>{{cite book |title=East Los Angeles: A History of a Barrio |url=https://archive.org/details/eastlosangeleshi0000romo |url-access=registration |first=Ricardo |last=Romo |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1983 |page=[https://archive.org/details/eastlosangeleshi0000romo/page/69 69]}}</ref>

With this new growth, Watts was incorporated as a separate city, taking its name from the first railroad station, [[Watts Station]] that had been built in 1904 on {{cvt|10|acre |ha}} 10 acres of land donated by the Watts family. The city voted to merge with Los Angeles in 1926.<ref name=MaryEllen/>

Watts did not become predominantly black until the 1940s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rothstein-segregated-housing-20170820-story.html|title=Why Los Angeles is still a segregated city after all these years|date= August 20, 2017|access-date=20 August 2017|newspaper=[[LA Times]]|first=Richard |last=Rothstein}}</ref> Before then, there were some [[African Americans|African American]] residents, many of whom were Pullman car porters and cooks. Schoolroom photos from 1909 and 1911 show only two or three black faces among the 30 or so children pictured. By 1914, a black realtor, Charles C. Leake, was doing business in the area.<ref name=MaryEllen/> [[Restrictive covenant|Racially restrictive covenants]] prevented blacks from living in any other neighborhoods outside of [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue District]] and Watts.<ref>{{Cite book

World War II brought the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]], tens of thousands of African American migrants, mostly from Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Texas, who left segregated Southern states in search of better opportunities in California. During World War II, the city built several large housing projects (including [[Nickerson Gardens]], [[Jordan Downs]] and [[Imperial Courts]]) for the thousands of new workers in war industries. By the early 1960s, these projects had become nearly 100 percent black, as [[white flight|whites moved on to new suburbs]] outside the central city. As industrial jobs disappeared from the area, the projects housed many more poor families than they had traditionally.

Longstanding resentment by Los Angeles's working class black community over discriminatory treatment by police and inadequate public services (especially schools and hospitals) exploded on August 11, 1965, into what were commonly known as the [[Watts riots]].{{r|AP 2020-08-10}} The event that precipitated the disturbances, the arrest of a black youth by the [[California Highway Patrol]] on drunk-driving charges, actually occurred outside Watts. Mobs did the most property damage in Watts in the turmoil.

Watts suffered further in the 1970s, as [[gang]]s gained strength and raised the level of violence in the neighborhood. Between 1989 and 2005, police reported more than 500 homicides in Watts, most of them gang-related and tied to wars over control of the lucrative illicit market created by illegal drugs. Four of Watts's influential gangs‚Äî Watts Cirkle City [[Pirus|Piru]], [[Grape Street Watts Crips (gang)|Grape Street Watts Crips]], [[Bounty Hunter Bloods|Bounty Hunter Watts Bloods]], and [[P Jay Crips|PJ Watts Crips]]‚Äîformed a Peace Treaty agreement, known as the [[Watts truce]] on April 26, 1992.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|last=Chang |first=Jeff |title=Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwaXZpD11ukC&q=masjid+al+rasul+truce&pg=PA365 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=978-1-4299-0269-4 |page=365 }}</ref> Key hallmarks of the pact continue to influence life in Watts to date, with colors and territory having little to do with gang-related crime.

Beginning in the 1980s, those African Americans who could leave Watts moved to other suburban locations in the [[Antelope Valley]], the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]], [[the San Gabriel Valley]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. The black population in Watts has been increasingly replaced by other demographic groups, primarily Hispanic immigrants of Mexican and Central American ancestry, as well as by a median proportion of Ethiopian and Indian ancestry. This demographic change accelerated after the 1992 riots.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In addition, there has been a net migration of African Americans out of California to return to the South in a [[New Great Migration]]. From 1995 to 2000, California was a net loser of African-American residents. With new jobs, Southern states have attracted the most black college graduates since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf |first=William H. |last=Frey |title=The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965‚Äì2000 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |date=May 2004 |pages=1 & 4 |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428042235/http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf |archive-date=April 28, 2008 }}</ref>

Neighborhood leaders have begun a strategy to overcome Watts's reputation as a violence-prone and impoverished area. Special promotion has been given to the museums and art galleries in the area surrounding [[Watts Towers]]. This sculptural and architectural landmark has attracted many artists and professionals to the area. ''[[I Build the Tower]]'', a feature-length documentary film about the Watts Towers and their creator, [[Simon Rodia]], provides a history of Watts from the 1920s to the present and a record of the activities of the Watts Towers Arts Center. Watts is one of several Los Angeles neighborhoods with a high concentration of convicted felons.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-76959815/ | archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121006015957/http://touch.latimes.com/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-10-06 |title=Unknown |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> In 2000, singer and actor [[Tyrese Gibson]] chartered a foundation to build a community center in Watts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fuoco|first=Christina|title=Tyrese Biography|work=Musician Biographies|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003084/Tyrese.html|date=2006-06-23|access-date=2008-12-14}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Watts neighborhood, Los Angeles, California.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Watts as delineated by the ''Los Angeles Times'']]

The [[Mapping L.A.]] project of the ''Los Angeles Times'' states as follows:

The neighborhood's irregular street boundaries follow the Los Angeles [[city limits]] on the north and east, except for a small patch of [[Los Angeles County]] territory surrounding Ritter Elementary School, between 108th Street and [[Imperial Highway]], which the ''Times'' includes in Watts.<ref name="Mapping L.A.: South L.A.">{{cite web |url= http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/region/south-la/ |title=Mapping L.A.: "South L.A." |work=Los Angeles Times |year=2015 |accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=ThomasGuide>{{cite book |title=[[Thomas Guide]] |year=2006 |page=704}}</ref>

The southern boundary runs east-west on Imperial Highway, the eastern line is north-south on [[Alameda Street]] and the western line is north-south on [[Central Avenue (Los Angeles)|Central Avenue]] to 103rd Street. Ted Watkins Park and other county areas are excluded. Thence the line is Success Avenue between [[Century Boulevard]] and 92nd Street.<ref name="Mapping L.A.: South L.A."/><ref name="ThomasGuide"/>

Watts is flanked on the north by [[Florence-Graham, California|Florence-Firestone]], on the east by [[South Gate, California|South Gate]], on the southeast by [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]], on the south by [[Willowbrook, California|Willowbrook]] and on the north and west by [[Green Meadows, Los Angeles|Green Meadows]].<ref name="Mapping L.A.: South L.A."/>

==Population==
A total of 36,815 people lived in Watts's 2.12 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census‚Äîaveraging 17,346 people per square mile, among the highest [[population density|population densities]] in Los Angeles. Population was estimated at 41,028 in 2008. The median age was 21, making Watts the Los Angeles neighborhood with the youngest population.

[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] made up 61.6% of the population, [[Black people|blacks]] 37.1%, [[non-Hispanic whites]] 0.5%, [[Asian people#United States|Asian]] 0.2%, and others 0.5%. Mexico and El Salvador were the most common places of birth for the 34% of the residents who were born abroad, an average percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city or county as a whole.<ref name=MappingLAWatts/>

The $25,161 median household income in 2008 dollars was considered low for the city and county. The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less was high, compared to the county at large.

Watts received its first library service in 1913 when temporary space was designated in the city hall for a library. In 1914 the library moved into a newly built [[Carnegie library]]. Los Angeles annexed Watts in 1926, so the library became the Watts Branch of the Los Angeles library system. In 1957 voters approved a library branch bond, and a {{convert|3600|sqft|sqm}} Watts Branch opened in 1960. In 1991 the [[Los Angeles City Council]] approved a measure, backed by the Friends of the Watts Branch Library, the 15th District Council Office, and the Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) of the City of Los Angeles, to build a new library as a part of the {{convert|1.3|acre|ha}} Watts Civic Center. $1.3 million from Proposition 1, the branch library facility bond issue of 1989, funded the construction of the new Watts library. On June 25, 1996 the city council voted to name the library after Alma Reaves Woods, a woman in the community who encouraged reading and library usage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-26/news/mn-18685_1_library-commission|title=Council Lifts Policy, Names Watts Library for Volunteer|date=June 26, 1996|first=JODI |last=WILGOREN|access-date=2 April 2018|newspaper=[[LA Times]]}}</ref> James C.

On January 22, 2012, the popular cycling event called CicLAvia took place in south L.A.'s Central-Alameda neighborhood to the Watts Towers. Volunteers were excited to hold an event close to the CicLAvia events in downtown L.A. The event was meant to encourage civic engagement. Throughout the group of volunteers the diversity was large. Cyclists took photos for a "crowd-source" map made up of photos and recordings by the cyclists.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/22/local/la-me-bicycle-map-20120123 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Jason | last=Song | title=Bicyclists tour Watts on a CicLAvia ride | date=January 22, 2012}}</ref>
