== Background ==
A [[Real estate bubble|house price bubble]] is defined as a period of speculative purchases, where investors demonstrate willingness to pay a high price today because they believe that it will be as high (or higher) tomorrow.<ref>Stiglitz, J.E. (1990). “Symposium on bubbles”. In: Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol. 4 No. 2, pp. 13-18</ref> A 2016 study found evidence of a bubble in the New Zealand housing market from 2003, which stalled in 2007/8 with the impacts of the global financial crisis. A second bubble appeared in 2013, and until 2015 there were no notable spillover effects to other regions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greenaway-McGrevy|first=R.|date=2015|title=Hot property in New Zealand: Empirical evidence of housing bubbles in the metropolitan centres|journal=New Zealand Economic Papers|volume=50|issue=1|pages=88–113|doi=10.1080/00779954.2015.1065903|hdl=2292/25259|hdl-access=free}}</ref> However, from 2015 onwards, rapid price growth is evident across smaller centres.

[[Housing in New Zealand]] has been strongly shaped by [[Colonisation of New Zealand|colonisation]], post-war state intervention and economic and financial reforms since the 1980s.

The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour Government]] (elected in 1984) rapidly introduced policies of economic deregulation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-11|title=Government and market liberalisation

In 1989 Parliament passed the Reserve Bank Act, which emphasised keeping a lid on inflation and on interest rates, which in turn reduced the costs of borrowing for fixed assets such as houses. In the same year, tax exemptions for pension, insurance and other similar investments were abolished, but not for real estate. Two years later, the [[Resource Management Act]] (RMA) replaced a raft of regional-planning laws. Some regard the RMA as an obstacle to building affordable housing.<ref name="newsroom">

The potential for extra housing supply to both respond to higher house prices and then soften the growth was ripped out by the effects of the RMA and council funding mechanisms.

=== Social impacts of the affordability crisis ===
{{See also|Homelessness in New Zealand}}
Unaffordable housing has produced profound impacts on New Zealand society. Between 1986 and 2013, home ownership dropped from 74% to 65%.<ref>Statistics New Zealand (2015). Dwelling and tenure type tables for Auckland from 2013 Census.</ref>

The most recent statistics on homelessness, from the [[2013 census of New Zealand|2013 Census]], showed that 1% of the population were living in severe housing deprivation. Of this population 71% are temporarily resident in severely crowded private dwellings, 19% live in commercial dwellings or marae, and 10% live on the street or in a car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago613529.html|title=3 June 2016, Homelessness accelerates between censuses|last=Otago|first=University of|website=University of Otago|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Between 2017 and 2019, the waiting list for public housing doubled, reaching a record 12,500 in August 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/115412063/public-housing-waitlist-at-new-high-with-12644-households-waiting-months-for-housing|title=Public housing waitlist at new high with 12,644 households waiting months for housing|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In 2018, a report found that emergency housing providers were turning away 80-90% of those seeking assistance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11992371|title=Homeless crisis: 80 per cent to 90 per cent of homeless people turned away from emergency housing|last=derek.cheng@nzme.co.nz|first=Derek Cheng Derek Cheng is a political reporter for the New Zealand Herald|date=2018-02-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>

The substantial growth of property prices over recent decades has significantly influenced the distribution of wealth in New Zealand. The 2019 Rich List showed that eight of the top 25 wealthiest people made their money from property, and 16 of the 20 new additions to the list also became wealthy through property investment. Rising prices have been attributed to various factors including deregulation, immigration and politics, with considerable debate over how to address the issue due to its large size relative to the economy.

== Policy responses ==
Policies to address the housing affordability crisis cover land use and planning regulation, state housing provision, rules on ownership and investment, and financial regulation.

=== National government, 2008 - 2017 ===
==== Special Housing Areas ====
In 2013, the government passed the Housing Accord and Special Housing Areas Act 2013, introducing Special Housing Areas (SHAs) to increase land supply in urban areas. Within designated SHAs, developments larger than 14 dwellings were required to allocate 10% of housing at 'affordable' prices. Affordability was defined as 75% of the region's median house price, or a price at which households earning up to 120% of median household income would spend no more than 30% of gross income on rent or mortgage repayments. Research showed that little evidence for the effectiveness of this policy to improve affordability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=Mario A.|last2=Sánchez|first2=Gonzalo E.|last3=Bucaram|first3=Santiago|date=2019-03-16|title=Price effects of the special housing areas in Auckland|journal=New Zealand Economic Papers|volume=0|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/00779954.2019.1588916|issn=0077-9954}}</ref> The act was not extended beyond 2019, after generating disappointing results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/111223329/government-will-not-extend-special-housing-areas-law-beyond-september|title=Government will not extend special housing areas law beyond September|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

From 2016, the housing development planned by Fletcher Building on a designated Special Housing Area at [[Ōtuataua and Ihumātao|Ihumātao]] was opposed by protesters, who set up a camp at the site. Opponents contended that the land was confiscated during the Waikato War in 1863, in breach of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]]. In 2017 the United Nations recommended that the New Zealand Government review the designation of Ihumātao as a Special Housing Area, drawing attention to potential breaches of human rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2019/08/12/ihumatao-breaching-human-rights-obligations.html|title=Ihumātao: NZ breaching human rights obligations - The University of Auckland|website=www.auckland.ac.nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> In 2019, after protestors were served an eviction notice and police presence escalated, the prime minister announced that no development would take place at Ihumātao while the government attempted to broker a solution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/rnz/pm-blocks-building-ihumatao|title=PM blocks building at Ihumatao|date=2019-07-26|website=Otago Daily Times Online News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

==== Bright-line test ====
In October 2015 the government introduced a bright-line test to reduce speculative investment. This test applies to all property acquired after the law was introduced, and taxes capital gains at the same level as the seller's income tax rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/273847/govt-to-tighten-tax-on-capital-gains|title=Govt to tighten tax on capital gains|date=2015-05-17|website=RNZ|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

==== Loan-to-value restrictions ====
The loan-to-value ratio measures how much a bank lends for a property, compared to the property's total value. Loan-to-value (LVR) restrictions were first introduced in 2013 by the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]. The restrictions comprised a 'speed limit' on the proportion of high-LVR loans that banks can issue, and a threshold defining high-LVR loans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/faqs/loan-to-value-ratio-restrictions-faqs|title=Loan-to-value ratio restrictions FAQs - Reserve Bank of New Zealand|website=www.rbnz.govt.nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

Initial LVR restrictions in October 2013 restricted banks to no more than 10% of loans beyond 80% LVR. In 2015, the restrictions were revised to target price inflation in Auckland, easing the restrictions to 15% over 80% LVR for non-Auckland loans, and increasing to 5% over 70% LVR for investor purchases in Auckland. In 2016 the restrictions tightened further on Auckland investors, to 5% over 60% LVR.

Since 2018, LVR restrictions gradually reduced to 20% over 80% for owner-occupiers, and 5% over 70% for investors. In April 2020 the Reserve Bank lifted restrictions on mortgage borrowing in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], to ensure that the LVR rules did not unduly affect lenders or borrowers as part of the mortgage deferral scheme introduced in response to the pandemic<ref>{{Cite web|title=Reserve Bank removes LVR restrictions for 12 months - Reserve Bank of New Zealand|url=https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2020/04/reserve-bank-removes-lvr-restrictions-for-12-months|website=www.rbnz.govt.nz|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>.

The Reserve Bank has suggested that the targeted restriction for Auckland properties in 2015 may have contributed to price inflation in other regions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interest.co.nz/property/99810/reserve-bank-has-undertaken-review-loan-value-ratio-lvr-restrictions-and-found-they|title=The Reserve Bank has undertaken a review of the loan to value ratio (LVR) restrictions and found they have been effective in improving financial stability but have 'an efficiency cost'|date=2019-05-22|website=interest.co.nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

==== National Policy Statement on Urban Development capacity (NPS-UDC) ====
The NPS-UDC is planned to be replaced by the National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD), which the government consulted on in 2019.

The purpose of the NPS-UDC, introduced in 2016, was to ensure that sufficient development capacity was provided by local authorities, to meet demand for land for housing and commercial use. The NPS-UDC provided targeted measures for high-growth areas.

=== Labour-New Zealand First coalition government, 2017 - present ===
==== Foreign ownership ban ====
In August 2018, a law was passed a ban non-resident foreigners from buying existing homes,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-newzealand-politics-housing-idUKKBN1L00KO|title=New Zealand passes ban on foreign homebuyers into law|date=2018-08-15|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en}}</ref> delivering on the New Zealand First Party's election promise. The law allows non-residents to own up to 60% of units in new-build apartment blocks, however, they are not permitted to buy existing homes. Immigration remains a topic of controversy in regards to housing affordability, and has been cited by the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand|Reserve Bank]] and others as a factor in rising house prices. Annual net migration as of 2017 was approximately 70,000, compared with an average of 15,000 in the previous 25 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11804750|title=Three things that could burst bubble|author=Mark Lister|date=2017-02-21|publisher=New Zealand Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/89854233/net-migration-hits-71000-as-kiwis-turn-their-back-on-living-overseas|title=Net migration hits 71,000 as Kiwis turn their back on living overseas|author=Hamish Rutherford|date=2017-02-27|publisher=Stuff.co.nz/Business Day}}</ref> However the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]] has refuted this, saying that New Zealanders returning from overseas make up much of the inflows, and that there was a need to allow in "skilled migrants required to ramp up housing supply".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11691145|title=Migrants not to blame for Auckland's house prices, study finds|author=Isaac Davidson|date=2016-08-10|publisher=New Zealand Herald}}</ref> In 2015 it was reported that Auckland had over 33,000 "ghost" properties that were registered as unoccupied, many of them believed to be owned by absentee foreigners.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.noted.co.nz/money/money-property/running-on-empty-the-ghost-homes-in-aucklands-housing-crisis|title=Running on empty: The 'ghost homes' in Auckland's housing crisis|author=Joanna Wane|date=2017-09-17|publisher=Metro Magazine}}</ref>

==== Extension of bright-line test ====
The bright-line test introduced under the previous administration was extended to five years, to reduce incentives for speculative investment. The five-year rule applies to properties purchased after March 2018, and the main family home is exempt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzlaw.co.nz/news/bright-line-test-period-extended/|title=Bright-line test period extended{{!}} NZ LAW|website=nzlaw.co.nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Changes in legal ownership for a property can count as a disposal, and 'reset the clock' on the five-year limit, even if the property is substantively owned and controlled by the same person.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503458&objectid=12120519|title=Tax matters : Beware the bright line property test|date=2018-09-10|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>

==== State housing construction ====
In December 2017, the Sixth Labour Government stopped the sale of [[Housing New Zealand]] properties,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/100039478/government-announces-end-to-state-home-sell-off|title=Government announces end to state home selloff|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> and committed to expanding the supply of public housing.

==== KiwiBuild ====
[[KiwiBuild]] was the flagship housing policy of the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand]], proposing to deliver 100,000 houses in ten years to address the affordability crisis. The scheme planned to boost housing supply by giving property developers more incentives to deliver affordable homes rapidly. This included the Land for Housing programme, which acquired vacant land, on-selling to developers, with conditions of making 20% of dwellings available for public housing and delivering 40% 'affordable' housing according to KiwiBuild criteria. The scheme also purchased properties off-the-plans from developers, to sell to eligible buyers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kiwibuild.govt.nz/about/development-partners/information-for-property-developers|title=Information for property developers {{!}} KiwiBuild|website=www.kiwibuild.govt.nz|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> Construction sector capacity to deliver KiwiBuild's targets was identified as a challenge, and the government introduced a KiwiBuild Shortage List, allowing accredited construction employers to accelerate the immigration process for construction workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzil.co.nz/kiwibuild-visa-replaced-with-new-kiwibuild-skills-shortage-list/|title=Kiwibuild visa replaced with new Kiwibuild skills shortage list|last=admin|date=2018-06-28|website=NZ Immigration Law|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

Criticism of the policy highlighted that the prices of KiwiBuild homes remained out of reach for many, with 'affordable' properties costing upward of NZD$500,000 in Auckland, and NZD$300,000-500,000 across the rest of the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/02/doubts-over-kiwibuild-s-affordability.html|title=Doubts over KiwiBuild's affordability|date=2018-02-25|work=Newshub|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en}}</ref> By September 2019, only 258 houses had been delivered by the scheme, well below the targets.<ref name="Newshub">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2019/09/labour-s-flagship-policy-where-did-kiwibuild-go-wrong.html|title=Labour's flagship policy: Where did KiwiBuild go wrong?|date=2019-04-09|work=Newshub|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en}}</ref> The uptake also showed that the Kiwibuild homes did not attract buyers, with unsold homes released onto the private market in some regions.<ref name="Newshub"/>

===== KiwiBuild reset =====
A 'reset' of KiwiBuild was released in 2019, following the reshuffle of ministerial responsibilities for housing and appointment of Dr. [[Megan Woods]] as Minister for Housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/113821469/pm-takes-housing-off-phil-twyford-in-first-major-reshuffle|title=PM takes housing off Phil Twyford in first major reshuffle|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The revised policy dropped the target to build 100,000 houses in ten years and introduced rent-to-buy and shared equity options to improve affordability. The requirement for first-home buyers to hold their Kiwibuild homes for at least three years was reduced to one year.

==== National Policy Statement on Urban Development (NPS-UD) ====
The NPS-UD was [https://www.mfe.govt.nz/consultations/nps-urbandevelopment consulted on in October 2019], to replace and expand on the 2016 NPS-UDC. The NPS-UD has a similar purpose to its predecessor, to enable growth in new areas by removing unnecessary restrictions, targeted to high-growth areas.

The [https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/towns-and-cities/planning-successful-cities-discussion-document-proposed-national discussion document] included a range of requirements for councils, including:
* New objectives for Future Development Strategies, to ensure that growth is coordinated and responsive to demand
* Allow growth through intensification and greenfield development, in a way that contributes to a quality urban environment
* Develop and maintain evidence base on demand and prices for housing and land
* Ensure planning is co-ordinated across urban areas, taking into account issues of concern for iwi and hapū

The NPS-UD is planned for implementation by mid-2020.

== Alternative solutions considered ==
=== Tax reform ===
==== Capital gains tax ====
There is currently no [[Taxation in New Zealand|tax]] on capital gains from property investment in New Zealand. The bright-line test introduced in 2015 and extended in 2018 aims to tax capital gains on property, however the main family home, estates, or properties sold through relationship settlements are exempt.

In late 2017, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Government]] established the [[Tax Working Group]], an advisory group to examine improvements to the fairness and balance of the tax system. The group published its report in February 2019, recommending a tax on capital gains that applies to gains and most losses related to all types of land and improvements, except for the main family home.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report|title=Future of Tax: Final Report|website=taxworkinggroup.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> This tax would apply to rental and second homes, business assets, land and shares. Following robust public and media debate, the government abandoned their plan to introduce the capital gains tax, citing a lack of consensus within government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/112010254/government-to-make-statement-on-capital-gains-tax|title=Capital gains tax abandoned by Government|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref>

==== Land value tax ====
Land value taxation has been suggested by a series of commentators, including Dr. Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interest.co.nz/news/89662/auckland-universitys-ryan-greenaway-mcgrevy-extols-virtues-land-tax-how-one-would-hit|title=Auckland University's Ryan Greenaway-McGrevy extols the virtues of a land tax & how one would hit both landbankers and wealthy foreigners buying NZ land|date=2017-09-04|website=interest.co.nz|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> economist Shamubeel Eaqub and Bernard Hickey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/03/21/98119?slug=why-a-land-tax-is-the-best-tax-reform|title=Why a land tax is the best tax reform|date=2018-03-22|website=Newsroom|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>

=== Land use reform ===
In September 2015, the [[New Zealand Productivity Commission]] released a comprehensive report on [https://www.productivity.govt.nz/assets/Documents/6a110935ad/using-land-for-housing-final-report-v2.pdf Using land for housing], commissioned by the government to review local council processes for providing land for housing, with a focus on fast-growing areas. According to the report, insufficient supply of developable brownfield and greenfield land was a major contributor to house price growth between 2000 and 2015. It proposed reform in a range of areas:

# Lifting restrictive planning controls in areas with spare capacity on existing infrastructure networks
# More effective cost-recovery of infrastructure costs
# Greater use of cost-benefit analysis for land use rules
# Granting local urban development authorities (UDAs) more power to develop housing
# Powers for central government to intervene to ensure sufficient development capacity is released, if councils are unable to release land (this was implemented through the 2016 [https://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/towns-and-cities/national-policy-statement-urban-development-capacity National Policy Statement on Urban Development Capacity]).

=== Financial regulation ===
==== Debt-to-income limits ====
In 2017 the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] published a consultation paper on debt-to-income limits, as a tool to restrict credit growth and mitigate the risk of mortgage defaults during an economic downturn. High levels of private debt present a significant macro-economic risk. It reduces household consumption by diverting a large proportion of income to servicing debts and also makes households vulnerable to economic shocks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/economy/public-finance/Debt-and-macroeconomic-stability.pdf|title=Debt and Macroeconomic Stability|last=OECD|date=2012|website=OECD Economics Department Policy Note No 16|access-date=1 November 2019}}</ref>

== Potential effects of bubble burst ==
According to investment manager Brian Gaynor in 2012, a 10% drop in house prices would wipe out $60 billion of New Zealanders' personal wealth, which would exceed the losses from the 1987 sharemarket crash.<ref name="gaynor" /> [[Steve Keen]], one of the few economists to forecast the [[Great Recession]], warned in mid-2017 that New Zealand would be one of many nations to experience a private debt meltdown involving housing, and that "the bubble will burst in the next one to two years".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/sunday/audio/201845436/steve-keen-the-coming-crash|title=Steve Keen: The coming crash|author=Wallace Chapman|date=2017-05-28|publisher=RNZ}}</ref> A report published by [[Goldman Sachs]] predicted that New Zealand had a 40% chance of a "housing bust" over the same period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/330910/nz-at-40-percent-risk-of-housing-bust-goldman-sachs|title=NZ at 40% risk of housing bust - Goldman Sachs|date=2017-05-16|publisher=RNZ News}}</ref> Financial commentator Bernard Hickey has described New Zealand's property market as "[[too big to fail]]", and supports a [[deposit insurance]] scheme in the event of a banking collapse caused by a property crash.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pro.newsroom.co.nz/articles/482-the-problem-of-moral-hazard-in-our-too-big-to-fail-property-market|title=The problem of moral hazard in our 'Too Big To Fail' property market|author=Bernard Hickey|date=2014-04-28|publisher=Newsroom.co.nz}}</ref>
