'''Ripon Grammar School''' is a co-educational, boarding and day, selective [[grammar school]] in [[Ripon]], [[North Yorkshire]], England. It has been named top-performing state school in the north for eight years running by ''The Sunday Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-secondary-schools-in-the-north-0fsw3qbpr|title=Best secondary schools in the North|first=Alastair|last=McCall|accessdate=29 November 2020|work=The Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/17272650.ripon-grammar-school-best-north-sixth-year-running/|title=School is 'best in the North' for sixth year running|work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> It is one of the best-performing schools in the [[North of England]]; in 2011, 91% of pupils gained the equivalent of 5 or more GCSEs at grade C or above, including English and Maths; the figure has been over 84% consistently since at least 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/09/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/815_4215.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ripon Grammar School | date=15 January 2009}}</ref>  The school was graded "Outstanding" in its 2012 [[Ofsted]] report and is listed in the top 50 schools in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/121694|title=Find an inspection report|first=Ofsted Communications Team.|last=enquiries@ofsted.gov.uk|date=5 November 2010|website=www.ofsted.gov.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317081242/http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/121694|archivedate=17 March 2014}}</ref><ref>http://rankings.ft.com/secondary-schools/secondary-schools-2012?sortcol=23261&sortdir=asc&search=&fields=23031|23081|23101|23111|23221|23261|23271{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 2017, the school's boarding was rated 'Outstanding' by Ofsted.<ref>https://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/documents/OfstedBoardingReport2017.pdf</ref> As a state school, it does not charge fees for pupils to attend, but they must pass an entrance test at 11+ or 13+. There is no selection test for entry into sixth form as pupils are admitted on the basis of their GCSE grades. The majority of students continue their education at Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge.

==Admission==
It is a selective school, one of the very few in the North of England ([[Penrith, Cumbria]] has the most northern grammar schools).

==History==
The school is believed to have been founded in [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] times, but the first documentary proof of a school in the town is dated 1348 when Ricardum le Chamberlayn, who is described as 'the former master of the Schoolhouse' was one of 138 people who failed to appear before the Court of the King's Bench. It is suggested that he was involved in a mass disturbance, perhaps a riot.<ref name="auto3">{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/10721815.history-lessons/|title=History lessons|newspaper=The Northern Echo|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref> The medieval school, which was connected to a collegiate church in Ripon, was given land by benefactors but, in order to protect the school from the seizing of land by Henry VIII, priests told the king's commissioners the land had nothing to do with the church and the school was saved. However, in 1550, when the authorities discovered the chicanery that had occurred, the Duchy of Lancaster seized the lands and the future of the school was in doubt.<ref name="auto3"/> Queen Mary, the only child of Henry VIII and his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, looked kindly on the school and signed a royal charter which established the Free Grammar School of Queen Mary at Ripon, granted the school's ten governors the disputed land.<ref name="auto3"/> The re-founding in 1555 during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] is regarded as the foundation of the modern Ripon Grammar School.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Originally a boys' school, the school merged with Ripon Girls' School to become [[coeducational]] in 1962.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Although most pupils are day pupils from the surrounding area and Ripon itself, there are boys' and girls' [[boarding house]]s, School House and Johnson House, which accommodate 100 pupils.

===Motto===
The school motto is the [[Old English language|Old English]] phrase ''Giorne ymb lare ymb diowatdomas'' ("Eager to learn and to serve").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/|title=Welcome to Ripon Grammar School's website|first=Edward |last=Robertson |date=|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014160846/http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/|archivedate=14 October 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/121/121694.pdf Ripon Grammar School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630152817/http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/121/121694.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }} [[Ofsted]] report</ref>

===Traditions===
In December, RGS holds its annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in Ripon Cathedral, where student choirs and orchestras perform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/school-community-comes-together-for-christmas-choral-celebration-509/|title=School community comes together for Christmas choral celebration|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref>
In July, students, staff, governors and local dignitaries gather for the annual Commemoration Service at Ripon Cathedral to commemorate the school's founders and give thanks at the end of the school year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/end-of-year-rgs-celebrates-and-gives-thanks-420/|title=End of year: RGS celebrates and gives thanks|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref>

The son of the first Marquis of Ripon, Earl de Grey, founded the exhibitions to universities, which are still presented to the school in the form of major and minor De Grey Awards at Speech Day every year.

There is an Old Riponians' Association Winter Reunion every year, when past pupils return to the school to challenge current students in a series of sports fixtures including rugby, hockey, football and netball.

Sixth form students organise a series of Charity Week events every year, including concerts, pantomimes, quizzes and dance competitions, raising around £15,000 for chosen charities annually.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/2019/01/31/students-raise-15397-for-saint-michaels-hospice/|title=Students raise £15,397 for Saint Michael's Hospice|date=31 January 2019|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref> Recent charities which have benefited include St Michael's Hospice in Harrogate, Surfers Against Sewage and the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.

==Sport==
The school offers a wide range of sporting activities including swimming, tennis, rugby, cricket, climbing, netball, hockey and football. The U18 rugby team have won the Yorkshire championships three times running, most recently in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northyorkshire/18373908.three-cups-row-successful-school-rugby-team/|title=Three Yorkshire Cups in a row for successful school rugby team|work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/congratulations-to-our-yorkshire-cup-triple-champs-577/|title=Congratulations to our Yorkshire Cup triple champs|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> The U-13 cricket team won the Yorkshire Cup in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/cricket-legend-congratulates-rgss-yorkshire-champions-421/|title=Cricket legend congratulates RGS's Yorkshire champions|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> The U-18s girls' hockey team were State Boarding National Champions in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/rgs-girls-crowned-national-hockey-champions-290/|title=RGS girls crowned national hockey champions|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> The U-18s girls' netball team were awarded the National State Boarding Schools Championship trophy in 2019.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/sport/17554693.talented-netballers-crowned-national-champions/|title=Talented netballers are crowned national champions|work=Darlington and Stockton Times|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> RGS swimmers have made it to the national finals of the English Secondary Schools championships both in 2019 and 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/rgs-girls-among-fastest-swimmers-in-the-country-478/|title=RGS girls among fastest swimmers in the country|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref> A number of riders from the school's Equestrian Society have reached the national finals of the NSEA equestrian championships at Hickstead Arena.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/2019/05/07/horse-riders-from-ripon-grammar-school-reach-finals-of-a-national-schools-equestrian-competition/|title=Horse riders from Ripon Grammar School reach finals of a national schools’ equestrian competition|date=7 May 2019|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref>

==Boarding==
It is the only state-maintained boarding school in Yorkshire. After the Duchy of Lancaster seized its land in 1550, Queen Mary intervened to save the school, signing a royal charter in 1555 establishing the Free Grammar School of Queen Mary in Ripon. The founding charter stated the school was to be free of charge to local pupils. Due to the size and scale of rural North Yorkshire, and to overcome the lack of money, boarding was introduced for children in outlying villages and farms, but the school soon came to rely on the income and in the 1880s was plunged into financial uncertainty when wealthy families removed their boys from the school because of a rumour involving the headmaster and a local woman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/10721815.history-lessons/|title=History lessons|work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/homes/homesandgardens/10783868.home-away/|title=Home and away|work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref>
There are two boarding houses, School House for boys and Johnson House for girls, which house 100 students. Whereas opting to board may once have been a way to secure a place, that is no longer the case. Parents now commit for five years from Y7.<ref name="auto"/>

==Academic==
The school is consistently among the top performing schools both regionally and nationally. In 2019 Schools minister Nick Gibb wrote to the headmaster to congratulate the school for being in the top two per cent of state-funded mainstream schools for progress to GCSEs. He congratulated staff and students on their latest results and said: "Thank you for your work in continuing the drive towards higher academic standards."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northyorkshire/17662410.nick-gibb-congratulates-ripon-grammar-school-pupils-latest-gcses/|title=Minister congratulates pupils for latest GCSE results|work=The Northern Echo|accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, more than 76% of all A-level grades achieved were at A*-B, with 14 students achieving a clean sweep of A*s. Nearly half of all grades awarded were at A*-A. At GCSE in the same year, 92% of grades were 9–5 and 62% 9-7s.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/school/121694/ripon-grammar-school/secondary|title=Ripon Grammar School – GOV.UK|website=Find and compare schools in England|accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2018 and 2017, 76% and 79.1% of A-level grades were at A*-B and 64% of GCSE grades were 9-7/A*-A.<ref name="auto1"/>

Ripon Grammar School has been placed in the top 5% of schools nationally for the progress students make in sixth form.<ref name="auto2"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/2020/09/30/ripon-grammar-in-top-5-of-schools-nationally-for-student-progress/|title=Ripon Grammar in top 5% of schools nationally for student progress|date=30 September 2020|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref> The majority of students from lower years progress to the sixth form but the school also admits around 50 students every year from other local schools and further afield, with admission based on GCSE results.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/events/ripon-grammar-school-sixth-form-open-evening/|title=Ripon Grammar School Sixth Form open evening|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref> While academic outcomes are outstanding, the school encourages sixth formers to take on leadership roles and develop wider skills through enrichment activities encompassing everything from charity work and volunteering to sport, music, drama and business enterprise. There are also a wide range of student-led sixth form societies. Alongside A-levels, students can undertake an extended project qualification (EPQ).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northyorkshire/18291474.ripon-colour-dash-set-raise-thousands-charity/|title=Ripon Colour Dash set to raise thousands for charity|date=9 March 2020|accessdate=25 November 2020|newspaper=The Northern Echo}}</ref>

==Houses==
Every student is a member of one of four houses. In 1906, Porteus and Hutton houses – each named after a famous ex-pupil – and De Grey – named after a family of benefactors – were founded. School House, for boarders, was added in 1928. 
Every year, students take part in a series of points-based inter-house competitions, which include sport, debating and singing, traditionally a source of pride for pupils of respective houses. Each student is given a house badge of the house they represent, to be worn on the lapel of their blazer, during their time at school. 
Hutton House is named after former Archbishop of Canterbury Matthew Hutton, who joined Ripon Grammar School in 1701.
Porteus House is named after writer, preacher and Bishop of London Beilby Porteus, a keen supporter of the movement to abolish slavery, who joined Ripon Grammar School in 1744.
De Grey House is named after Earl de Grey, the son of the first marquis of Ripon, and a generous benefactor of the school.
School House was added in 1928 for boarding students but the membership has broadened to accommodate day pupils as well as boarders.

==Clubs and societies==
RGS is home to a wide range of clubs and societies, including a Computer Coding Club, Equestrian Society, Wordsmiths Writing Club, Eco-committee, Debating Society, Quiz Club, Science and Engineering Club, Biology Club, Feminism Society, Astronomy Club, Medicine Club and Politics Society. Most clubs are student-led, although some, such as computer coding, are led by experts in their field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripongrammar.co.uk/news/computer-expert-cliff-gives-rgs-students-the-edge-498/|title=Computer expert Cliff gives RGS students the edge|publisher=Ripon Grammar School|accessdate=22 November 2020}}</ref>

==Music and drama==
The school has a purpose-built music block which includes a bespoke recording studio and Apple Mac computer suite. The school's wide range of ensembles include the chamber orchestra, chamber choir and big band. Recent musical productions include Anything Goes, Les Misérables, Billy Elliott and Little Shop of Horrors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/2020/03/16/little-shop-of-horrors-by-ripon-grammar-school/|title=Little Shop of Horrors by Ripon Grammar School|date=16 March 2020|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northyorkshire/18288682.big-effort-little-shop-horrors-shows/|title=A big effort for Little Shop of Horrors shows|newspaper=The Northern Echo|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2018, 100 singers from the school's five choirs recorded a Christmas album in Ripon Cathedral, where they regularly perform.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/local/northyorkshire/17219387.ripon-grammar-schools-choirs-join-forces-record-christmas-album/|title=School's choirs join forces to record Christmas album|newspaper=The Northern Echo|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref>

The annual school production is the highlight of the year. Productions in recent years include Murder on the Nile and An Inspector Calls. 
The junior drama club meets weekly for workshop activities and improvisations and puts on a major production in the summer term. Productions have included Peter Pan, The Jungle Book and Scrooge.

There is a House drama competition every year, with each House putting on a short play, directed and produced by senior students, with students of all ages taking part.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harrogateadvertiser.co.uk/news/pupils-shine-stage-contest-spotlight-188713|title=Pupils shine in stage contest spotlight|newspaper=Harrogate Advertiser|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref>

To force a ballot, petitions had to be successfully raised. These were allowed from December 1998, and Ripon was the only one out of 39 resulting in a ballot. The cost of administration of these petitions and the one ballot was £437,000. The huge cost of administration came from education officials having to write individually to registered parents at feeder primary schools. In the year of the ballot – 1999/2000 – £216,283 was spent on the petition procedure's administration. The vote was allowed by the [[School Standards and Framework Act 1998]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
