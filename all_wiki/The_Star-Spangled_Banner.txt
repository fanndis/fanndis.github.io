"'''The Star-Spangled Banner'''" is the [[national anthem]] of the [[United States]]. The lyrics come from the "'''Defence of Fort M'Henry'''",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.100010457 |title=Defence of Fort M'Henry &#124; Library of Congress |website=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> a [[poem]] written on September 14, 1814, by 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet [[Francis Scott Key]] after witnessing the bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]] by British ships of the [[Royal Navy]] in [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]] during the [[Battle of Baltimore]] in the [[War of 1812]]. Key was inspired by the large [[U.S. flag]], with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|Star-Spangled Banner]], flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.

The poem was set to the tune of a popular [[Music of the United Kingdom|British]] song written by [[John Stafford Smith]] for the [[Anacreontic Society]], a men's social club in London. "[[To Anacreon in Heaven]]" (or "The Anacreontic Song"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. This setting, renamed "The Star-Spangled Banner", soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a [[range (music)|range]] of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four [[stanza]]s, only the first is commonly sung today.

"The Star-Spangled Banner" was recognized for official use by the [[United States Navy]] in 1889, and by U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[resolution (law)|resolution]] on March 3, 1931 ({{USStat|46|1508}}, codified at {{UnitedStatesCode|36|301}}), which was signed by President [[Herbert Hoover]].

Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. "[[Hail, Columbia]]" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", whose melody is identical to "[[God Save the Queen]]", the United Kingdom's national anthem,<ref>{{cite web

==Early history==

===Francis Scott Key's lyrics===
[[File:KeysSSB.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Scott Key]]'s original manuscript copy of his "Defence of Fort M'Henry" poem. It is now on display at the [[Maryland Historical Society]].]]

On September 3, 1814, following the [[Burning of Washington]] and the [[Raid on Alexandria]], Francis Scott Key and [[John Stuart Skinner]] set sail from [[Baltimore]] aboard the ship {{HMS|Minden}}, a [[cartel ship]] flying a [[White flag|flag of truce]] on a mission approved by [[James Madison|President James Madison]]. Their objective was to secure an exchange of prisoners, one of whom was [[William Beanes]], the elderly and popular town physician of [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland|Upper Marlboro]] and a friend of Key's who had been captured in his home. Beanes was accused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers. Key and Skinner boarded the British [[flagship]] {{HMS|Tonnant}} on September 7 and spoke with Major General [[Robert Ross (British Army officer)|Robert Ross]] and Vice Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans. At first, Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes but relented after Key and Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising Beanes and other Americans for their kind treatment.

Because Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for [[Battle of Baltimore|the attack on Baltimore]], they were held captive until after the battle, first aboard {{HMS|Surprise|1812|6}} and later back on HMS ''Minden''. After the bombardment, certain British gunboats attempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of it, but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington, the city's last line of defense.

[[File:Ft. Henry bombardement 1814.jpg|thumb|left|An artist's rendering of the battle at [[Fort McHenry]]]]

During the rainy night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the [[fortress|fort]]'s smaller "storm flag" continued to fly, but once the shell and [[Congreve rocket]]<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/5/hh5l.htm British Rockets] at the US National Park Service, Fort McHenry National Monument, and Historic Shrine. Retrieved February 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403151259/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/5/hh5l.htm |date=April 3, 2014 }}</ref> barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the larger flag had been raised.

During the bombardment, {{HMS|Terror|1813|6}} and [[HMS Starr (1805)|HMS ''Meteor'']] provided some of the "bombs bursting in air".

[[File:Star Spangled Banner Flag on display at the Smithsonian's National Museum of History and Technology, around 1964.jpg|upright|thumb|The 15-star, 15-stripe "[[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|Star-Spangled Banner]]" that inspired the poem]]

Key was inspired by the U.S. victory and the sight of the large [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag, with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, had been made by [[Mary Pickersgill|Mary Young Pickersgill]] together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|Star-Spangled Banner]] and is today on display in the [[National Museum of American History]], a treasure of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It was restored in 1914 by [[Amelia Fowler]], and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.

Aboard the ship the next day, Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. At twilight on September 16, he and Skinner were released in Baltimore. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying, and titled it "Defence of Fort M'Henry". It was first published nationally in ''[[Analectic Magazine|The Analectic Magazine]]''.<ref>{{Cite web| title = John Wiley & Sons: 200 Years of Publishing – Birth of the New American Literature: 1807–1826| accessdate = April 27, 2018| url = https://www.wiley.com/legacy/about/grolierexhibit/theme02.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 4| pages = 433–434| title = Defence of Fort M'Henry| journal = The Analectic Magazine.| date = November 1814| hdl = 2027/umn.31951000925404p}}</ref>

Much of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of "[[The Anacreontic Song]]". The song, known as "When the Warrior Returns",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potw.org/archive/potw340.html |title=When the Warrior Returns – Key |website=Potw.org |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> was written in honor of [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[Charles Stewart (1778–1869)|Charles Stewart]] on their return from the [[First Barbary War]].

Absent elaboration by Francis Scott Key prior to his death in 1843, some have speculated more recently about the meaning of phrases or verses, particularly the phrase "the hireling and slave" from the third stanza. According to British historian [[Robin Blackburn]], the phrase allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks organized as the [[Corps of Colonial Marines]], who had been liberated by the British and demanded to be placed in the battle line "where they might expect to meet their former masters."<ref>{{cite book|first=Robin|last=Blackburn|title=The Overthrdow of Colonial Slavery, 1776–1848|year=1988|pages=288–290}}</ref> Mark Clague, a professor of [[musicology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], argues that the "middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of 1812" and "in no way glorifies or celebrates [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]."<ref name="Clague">{{cite news|author=Mark Clague |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/31/opinions/star-spangled-banner-criticisms-opinion-clague/index.html |title='Star-Spangled Banner' critics miss the point |website=CNN.com |date=August 31, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> Clague writes that "For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines were traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection."<ref name="Clague"/> This harshly [[Anti-British sentiment|anti-British]] nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in [[sheet music]] in World War I, when the British and the U.S. were allies.<ref name="Clague"/> Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of ''[[The Intercept]]'' that the song is a "celebration of slavery,"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/08/28/colin-kaepernick-is-righter-than-you-know-the-national-anthem-is-a-celebration-of-slavery |title=Colin Kaepernick Is Righter Than You Know: The National Anthem Is a Celebration of Slavery |website=Theintercept.com |date=August 28, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref> Clague argues that the American forces at the battle consisted of a mixed group of White Americans and African Americans, and that "the term “freemen,” whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/arts/music/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem.html?_r=0|title=Is the National Anthem Racist?

Others suggest that "Key may have intended the phrase as a reference to the Royal Navy's practice of [[impressment]] which had been a major factor in the outbreak of the war, or as a semi-metaphorical jab at the British army as a whole (which included many foreign-born soldiers [mercenaries])."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/2016/08/29/star-spangled-banner-and-slavery/ |title='The Star-Spangled Banner' and Slavery |website=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref>

Key gave the poem to his brother-in-law Joseph H. Nicholson who saw<!-- disputed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k24n5JVaFFY --> that the words fit the popular melody "[[The Anacreontic Song]]", by English composer [[John Stafford Smith]]. This was the official song of the [[Anacreontic Society]], an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known [[broadside (music)|broadside]] printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.

On September 20, both the ''Baltimore Patriot'' and ''The American'' printed the song, with the note "Tune: Anacreon in Heaven". The song quickly became popular, with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title "The Star Spangled Banner", although it was originally called "Defence of Fort M'Henry". Thomas Carr's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from "The Anacreontic Song".<ref>Clague, Mark, and Jamie Vander Broek.

University of Michigan, 2014. 4.</ref> The song's popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor [[Ferdinand Durang]] sang it at Captain McCauley's [[tavern]]. [[Washington Irving]], then editor of the ''[[Analectic Magazine]]'' in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.

By the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] tasked the [[U.S. Bureau of Education]] with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were [[Walter Damrosch]], [[Will Earhart]], Arnold J. Gantvoort, [[Oscar Sonneck]] and [[John Philip Sousa]]. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at [[Carnegie Hall]] on December 5, 1917, in a program that included [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''Carillon'' and [[Gabriel Pierné]]'s ''The Children's Crusade''. The concert was put on by the [[Oratorio Society of New York]] and conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oratoriosocietyofny.org/FeaturesArchive/StarSpangledBanner.html |title=Oratorio Society of New York – Star Spangled Banner |website=Oratoriosocietyofny.org |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821104152/http://www.oratoriosocietyofny.org/FeaturesArchive/StarSpangledBanner.html |archive-date=August 21, 2016 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/201101T20.html |title=Standardization Manuscript for "The Star Spangled Banner" &#124; Antiques Roadshow |publisher=[[PBS]] |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2017}}</ref>

The song gained popularity throughout the [[19th century]] and bands played it during public events, such as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations.

A plaque displayed at [[Fort Meade (South Dakota)|Fort Meade]], [[South Dakota]], claims that the idea of making "The Star Spangled Banner" the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892.  Colonel Caleb Carlton, post commander, established the tradition that the song be played "at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts." Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who "promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia." Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Daniel S. Lamont]] issued an order that it "be played at every Army post every evening at retreat."<ref>Plaque, Fort Meade, erected 1976 by the Fort Meade V.A.

Professional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and [[Lip sync|lip-synced]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it.

Two especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the United States [[September 11 attacks]]. On September 12, 2001, [[Elizabeth II]], [[Elizabeth II|the queen of the United Kingdom]], broke with tradition and allowed the [[Band of the Coldstream Guards]] to perform the anthem at [[Buckingham Palace]], [[London]], at the ceremonial [[Changing of the guards|Changing of the Guard]], as a gesture of support for Britain's ally.<ref>Graves, David (September 14, 2001) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1340465/Palace-breaks-with-tradition-in-musical-tribute.html "Palace breaks with tradition in musical tribute"].

===200th anniversary celebrations===
The 200th anniversary of the "Star-Spangled Banner" occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10–16 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by [[John Williams]] and participation of President [[Barack Obama]] on [[Defenders Day|Defender's Day]], September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/francis-scott-keys-anthem-keeps-askinghave-we-survived-as-a-nation/2014/09/11/4061854c-39b3-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html|title=Francis Scott Key's anthem keeps asking: Have we survived as a nation?|author=Michael E.

The first [[popular music]] performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] singer and guitarist [[José Feliciano]]. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, [[blues]]-style rendition of the song<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

The response from many in the [[Vietnam War]]-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the "Star-Spangled Banner" heard in the years since.<ref>Jose Feliciano [http://josefeliciano.com/index.php?page=anthem Personal account about the anthem performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008220235/http://josefeliciano.com/index.php?page=anthem |date=October 8, 2015 }}</ref> One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was in the news again when U.S. athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] lifted controversial [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|raised fists at the 1968 Olympics]] while the "Star-Spangled Banner" played at a [[Olympic medal|medal ceremony]]. Another famous instrumental interpretation is [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s version, which was a set-list staple from autumn 1968 until his death in September 1970, including a famous rendition at the [[Woodstock]] [[music festival]] in 1969. Incorporating [[Reverberation|sonic effects]] to emphasize the "rockets' red glare", and "bombs bursting in air", it became a late-1960s emblem.

[[Marvin Gaye]] gave a [[Soul music|soul]]-influenced performance at the [[1983 NBA All-Star Game]] and [[Whitney Houston]] gave a soulful rendition before [[Super Bowl XXV]] in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with [[José Feliciano]], the only times the national anthem has been on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]). In 1993, Kiss did an instrumental rock version as the closing track on their album, ''Alive III''. [[Roseanne Barr]] gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a [[San Diego Padres]] baseball game at [[Jack Murphy Stadium]] on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward, she mocked ballplayers by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a [[Jockstrap|protective cup]]. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. president, [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-28/local/me-537_1_roseanne-barr |title=Roseanne Is Sorry – but Not That Sorry |author=Letofsky, Irv |date=July 28, 1990 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 14, 2012}}</ref> [[Sufjan Stevens]] has frequently performed the "Star-Spangled Banner" in live sets, replacing the optimism in the end of the first verse with a new coda that alludes to the divisive state of the nation today. [[David Lee Roth]] both referenced parts of the anthem and played part of a hard rock rendition of the anthem on his song, "[[Yankee Rose (song)|Yankee Rose]]" on his 1986 solo album, ''[[Eat 'Em and Smile]]''. [[Steven Tyler]] also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the [[Indianapolis 500]], to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the [[AFC Championship Game]]) with [[a cappella]] renditions of the song with changed lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/01/23/steven-tyler-national-anthem/ |title=AOL Radio – Listen to Free Online Radio – Free Internet Radio Stations and Music Playlists |publisher=Spinner.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> In 2016, [[Aretha Franklin]] performed a rendition before the nationally-televised [[Lions–Vikings rivalry|Minnesota Vikings-Detroit Lions]] [[American football on Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day game]] lasting more than four minutes and featuring a host of improvisations.

Critics likened her rendition to a jazzy "sexed-up" version of the anthem, which was considered highly inappropriate, with her performance compared to that of [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s iconic performance of [[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]. Fergie later apologized for her performance of the song, stating that <nowiki>''I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn'</nowiki>t strike the intended tone".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43125698|title=Fergie apologises for national anthem|date=February 20, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=October 1, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

A version of [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] and [[Brad Whitford]] playing part of the song can be heard at the end of their version of "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]" on the ''[[Rockin' the Joint]]'' album. The band [[Boston (band)|Boston]] gave an [[instrumental rock]] rendition of the anthem on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Boston album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album. The band [[Crush 40]] made a version of the song as opening track from the album ''[[Thrill of the Feel]]'' (2000).

In March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the [[National Anthem Project]], was launched after a [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris Interactive]] poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tnap.org/factsheet.html |title=Harris Interactive poll on "The Star-Spangled Banner" |publisher=Tnap.org |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112200114/http://www.tnap.org/factsheet.html |archivedate=January 12, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

==Lyrics==
<div>{{poemquote|
O say can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected now shines in the stream:
'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country, should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war's desolation.
Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: '[[In God we trust|In God is our trust]].'
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!<ref>Francis Scott Key, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html ''The Star Spangled Banner''] (lyrics), 1814, [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]] [[National Anthem Project]] (archived from [http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html the original] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126153519/http://www.thenationalanthemproject.org/lyrics.html |date=January 26, 2013 }} on 2013-01-26).</ref>}}</div>

When our land is illumined with Liberty's smile,
If a foe from within strike a blow at her glory,
Down, down with the traitor that dares to defile
The flag of her stars and the page of her story!
By the millions unchained, who our birthright have gained,
We will keep her bright blazon forever unstained!
And the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave
While the land of the free is the home of the brave.}}

==Customs and federal law==
[[File:Star Spangled Banner Plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque detailing how the custom of standing during the U.S. national anthem came about in Tacoma, Washington, on October 18, 1893, in the Bostwick building]]
When the U.S. national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should [[salute]] during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not if the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between "those in uniform" and "members of the Armed Forces and veterans" who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After [[9/11]], the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the national anthem became nearly universal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=56&page=380,36:171 |date=June 22, 1942 |title=Public Laws, June 22, 1942}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=77th Congress, 2nd session|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=56&page=1077|website=uscode.house.gov|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Public law, July 7, 1976|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=90&page=812|website=uscode.house.gov|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}</ref>

Since 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code {{usc|36|301}}) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.<ref>{{cite web|author=Duane Streufert |url=http://www.usflag.org/uscode36.html#171 |title=A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America&nbsp;– United States Code |publisher=USFlag.org |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t33t36+1643+6++%28%29%20%20A |title=U.S. Code |publisher=Uscode.house.gov |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529113624/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t33t36+1643+6++()%20%20A |archivedate=May 29, 2012 |df= }}</ref>

==Translations==
As a result of [[immigration to the United States]] and the incorporation of non-English speaking people into the country, the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages. In 1861, it was translated into German.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.rbc.as.113160/enlarge.html?page=1&size=640&from=pageturner ''Das Star-Spangled Banner''], [[Library of congress|US Library of Congress]].

===1968 Olympics Black Power salute===
{{Main|1968 Olympics Black Power salute}}
The 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a [[Demonstration (political)|political demonstration]] conducted by [[African-American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]] during their medal ceremony at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in the [[Estadio Olímpico Universitario|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Mexico City]]. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the [[200 metres at the Olympics|200-meter]] running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner". Each athlete [[Raised fist|raised a black-gloved fist]], and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist [[Peter Norman]] all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, ''Silent Gesture'', Smith stated that the gesture was not a "[[Black Power]]" salute, but a "[[human rights]] salute". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html |work=The Sunday Times |location=London |last=Lewis |first=Richard |date=October 8, 2006 |title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 |accessdate=November 9, 2008 }}</ref>

===2016 protests===
{{main|U.S. national anthem protests (2016–present)}}

Protests against police brutality and racism by kneeling on one knee during the national anthem began in the [[National Football League]] after [[San Francisco 49ers]] [[quarterback]] [[Colin Kaepernick]] knelt during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to [[police brutality in the United States]], before his team's third [[National Football League preseason|preseason]] game of [[2016 NFL season|2016]]. Kaepernick sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.<ref name="SB">{{cite web|last1=Sandritter|first1=Mark|title=A timeline of Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest and the NFL players who joined him|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl|publisher=SB Nation|accessdate=September 20, 2016|date=September 11, 2016}}</ref> In particular, protests focus on the discussion of slavery in the third verse of the anthem, in which the song condemns slaves that had joined the British in an effort to earn their freedom.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Woolf |first1=Christopher |title=Historians disagree on whether 'The Star-Spangled Banner' is racist |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-08-30/historians-disagree-whether-star-spangled-banner-racist |accessdate=1 August 2020 |publisher=The World |date=30 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Jason |title=Star-Spangled Bigotry: The Hidden Racist History of the National Anthem |url=https://www.theroot.com/star-spangled-bigotry-the-hidden-racist-history-of-the-1790855893 |accessdate=1 August 2020 |work=The Root |language=en-us}}</ref>

===NAACP call to remove the national anthem===
In November 2017, the California Chapter of the [[NAACP]] called on Congress to remove "The Star-Spangled Banner" as the national anthem. Alice Huffman, California [[NAACP]] president said: "it's racist; it doesn't represent our community, it's anti-black."<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-anthem-lyrics-california-naacp-star-spangled-banner |title= National anthem lyrics prompt California NAACP to call for replacing song |access-date= November 8, 2017 }}</ref> The third stanza of the anthem, which is rarely sung and few know, contains the words, "No refuge could save the hireling and slave, From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:", which [[#slave|some interpret as racist]]. The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of their announcement.
