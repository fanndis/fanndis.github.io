The '''Chamber of Deputies''' ({{lang-pt|Câmara dos Deputados}}) is a federal legislative body and the [[lower house]] of the [[National Congress of Brazil]]. The chamber comprises 513 deputies, who are elected by [[proportional representation]] to serve four-year terms. The current President of the Chamber is the Deputy [[Rodrigo Maia]] ([[Democrats (Brazil)|DEM]]-[[Rio de Janeiro (state)|RJ]]), who was reelected on February 1, 2019.

== Legislatures ==
The legislatures are counted from the first meeting of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate, on 6 May 1826, in the imperial era (the Chamber of Deputies met for preparatory sessions from 29 April 1826 to elect its officers and conduct other preliminary business, but the Legislature was formally opened on 6 May). The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate were created by Brazil's first [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]], the Constitution of the [[Empire of Brazil]], adopted in 1824. The numbering of the legislatures is continuous and counts all bicameral legislatures elected since the adoption of the 1824 Constitution including the imperial General Assembly and the republican National Congress. The previous constituent and legislative assembly of the Empire of Brazil, a unicameral national assembly convened in 1823 and dissolved by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] before the Constitution was adopted, is not counted. The inauguration of a new composition of Chamber of Deputies for a four-year term of office marks the start of a new Legislature.

In the imperial era the national legislature was named ''General Assembly''. It was made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Senators were elected for life and the Senate was a permanent institution, whereas the Chamber of Deputies, unless dissolved earlier, was elected every four years. When Brazil became a republic and a federal state, the model of a bicameral legislature was retained at the federal level, but the parliament was renamed ''National Congress''. The National Congress is made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Both houses have fixed terms and cannot be dissolved earlier. Under Brazil's present Constitution, adopted in 1988, senators are elected to eight-year terms and deputies are elected every four years.

Each Brazilian state (and the Federal District) is represented in the Senate by three senators.

Elections to the Senate are held every four years, with either a third or two thirds of the seats up for election.

The number of deputies elected is proportional to the size of the population of the respective state (or of the Federal District) as of 1994. However, no delegation can be made up of less than eight or more than seventy seats. Thus the least populous state elects eight federal deputies and the most populous elects seventy. These restrictions favour the smaller states at the expense of the more populous states and so the size of the delegations is not exactly proportional to population.

Elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held every four years, with all seats up for election.

* 21st Legislature (1890–1891), discharged the role of Constituent Congress (1890–1891). The act that summoned the elections for the Constituent Congress and that empowered it to draft a Constitution already established that the Congress would be made up of two Houses, an elected Senate with equal representation for the Brazilian States, and a Chamber of Deputies, each State having a number of deputies proportional to the size of its population. During the drafting of the Constitution, the Congress was to meet in joint session. The Congress was required to adopt a Constitution that conformed to the republican form of government, and that preserved the recently declared Federal model of the State.

* 38th Legislature (1946–1950), discharged the role of National Constituent Assembly (1946).
* 39th Legislature (1951–1954)
* 40th Legislature (1955–1958)
* 41st Legislature (1959–1962)
* 42nd Legislature (1963–1967), already under the Military Regime instituted by the 1964 military coup, the legislature discharged the role of Constituent Congress (1966–1967), under a decree of the military government (AI-4, Fourth Institutional Act), that commissioned the drafting of a new Constitution. The Constitution was voted under duress.

'''Legislatures elected under the Military Regime'''
* 43rd Legislature (1967–1970)
* 44th Legislature (1971–1975)
* 45th Legislature (1975–1979)
* 46th Legislature (1979–1983)
* 47th Legislature (1983–1987). The Chamber of Deputies was elected under the process of gradual return to democracy. During that legislature, the last military President handed over power to the first civilian Administration, still elected indirectly, by means of an Electoral College. The 1985 Electoral College, however, was placed under no duress, and elected the Opposition candidates for president and vice president. After the inauguration of the civilian Administration, the 47th Legislature passed a Constitutional Amendment,<ref>Constitutional Amendment 26, of 27 November 1985</ref> empowering the next Legislature, that would convene in February 1987 after the 1986 legislative elections, to discharge the role of National Constituent Assembly, empowered to adopt a new Constitution to replace the one inherited from the Military Regime.

'''Legislatures elected after the restoration of civilian government ("New Republic")'''
* 48th Legislature (1987–1991), discharged the role of National Constituent Assembly (1987–1988).

* 50th Legislature (1995–1999)
* 51st Legislature (1999–2003)
* 52nd Legislature (2003–2007)

* 55th Legislature (2015–2019)
* 56th Legislature (2019–2023)

==Federal representation==
The number of seats per state is distributed according to the number of inhabitants per state, according to the official measurement taken by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] through a [[census]] held each 10 years. The Brazilian population is represented by one deputy for each 362,013 inhabitants on average, but this proportionality is limited by having a minimum of eight members and a maximum of seventy members per state, these criteria being subject to an [[apportionment paradox]].

Therefore, states with 3,258,117 inhabitants upwards have 9 to 70 deputies. Following this scenario for example the city of [[São Paulo]] with its 11,253,503 inhabitants<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/sinopse/index.php?dados=21&uf=35|title=IBGE Censo 2010|author=|date=|website=www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> is represented by 31 deputies of the total members of the state and the rest of the state with its 28,670,588 inhabitants are represented by 39 MPs (Member of Parliament).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/MP|title=MP|author=|date=|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>

There is a distorted representation of the Brazilian states in congress, having some groups of deputies representing on average more than the proportion of the population of the state, and others representing less. That proportionality means that [[Roraima]] is represented by a deputy for every 51,000 inhabitants and, at the other extreme, São Paulo is represented by one deputy for every 585,000 inhabitants. This difference is reflected in the representation of the states in the Brazilian Congress, where some states are over-represented, such as Roraima, with 681% of the population represented by their congressmen, and other states are under represented, such as the state of São Paulo, with 63% of the population represented by their congressmen. The proportionality is calculated through the division of the percentage of deputies of a state in the chamber by the percentage of the population of such state in the nation. The population of the state of São Paulo, for instance, elects only 70 deputies to the Chamber, because of the maximum limits of 70 congressmen by state, but it should have 40 more seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://congressoemfoco.uol.com.br/noticias/gasto-com-deputados-se-aproxima-de-r-1-bilhao/|title=Gasto com deputados caminha para R$ 1 bilhão|author=|date=|website=uol.com.br|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>

=== Standing committees ===
{{update|section|date =March 2017}}
On March 6 of 2012, was defined division of committees between parties. The President's House, Marco Maia, believes that the proportionality between the parties / blocs must take into account the data of the last election. Thus, PT and PMDB, with the highest benches, were three committees (the PT made the choice first). DEM and PSDB, the two largest opposition, were two commissions each.<ref name="comissoes_permanente">{{citation|quote=defines the distribution of the standing committees | publisher = G1 | first = Nathalia | last = Finch | date = March 6, 2012 }}</ref> On the other hand, PSD, most harmed by this decision, filed a lawsuit in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] (STF) trying to reverse this decision.<ref>{{citation|quote=going to have the Supreme Command of committees in the House | publisher = G1| first = Deborah | last = Santos | date = February 27, 2012 }}</ref>

The chair of the committee, was defined as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.camara.leg.br/camaranoticias/noticias/POLITICA/526818-ELEITOS-OS-PRESIDENTES-DAS-25-COMISSOES-PERMANENTES-DA-CAMARA.html|title=Eleitos os presidentes das 25 comissões da Câmara|publisher=Portal da Câmara dos Deputados|language=pt|date=23 March 2017|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>
