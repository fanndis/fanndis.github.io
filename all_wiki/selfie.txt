A '''selfie ''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|f|i|}})<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/selfie?q=selfie| title=selfie noun - Pronunciation - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com| work=oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}</ref> is a [[self-portrait]] [[photograph]], typically taken with a [[digital camera]] or [[smartphone]], which may be held in the hand or supported by a [[selfie stick]]. Selfies are often shared on [[social media]], via [[social networking service]]s such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Snapchat]], and [[Instagram]].

They are often casual in nature (or made to appear casual). "Selfie" typically refers to self-portrait photos taken with the [[camera]] held at arm's length, as opposed to those taken by using a [[self-timer]] or remote. A selfie, however, may include multiple subjects. As long as the photo is being taken by one of the subjects featured, it is considered a selfie.

In 1839, [[Robert Cornelius]], an American pioneer in photography, produced a [[daguerreotype]] of himself which ended up as one of the first photographs of a person. Because the process was slow, he was able to uncover the lens, run into the shot for a minute or more, and then replace the lens cap.<ref name="pdr">{{cite web|title=Robert Cornelius' Self-Portrait: The First Ever 'Selfie' (1839)|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/robert-cornelius-self-portrait-the-first-ever-selfie-1839/|website=Public Domain Review|publisher=Open Knowledge Foundation|access-date=10 August 2014|date=2013-11-19}}</ref> He recorded on the back "The first light picture ever taken. 1839."<ref name="pdr" /><ref name="loc">{{cite web|title=Robert Cornelius, self-portrait; believed to be the earliest extant American portrait photo|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2004664436/|work=Prints & Photographs Online Catalog|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref> A copy of his "first selfie" graces his tombstone at [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In 1900, the debut of the portable [[Kodak Brownie]] [[box camera]] led to [[Self-portrait#Photo-portraits|photographic self-portraiture]] becoming a more widespread technique. The method was usually by mirror and stabilizing the [[camera]] either on a nearby object or on a tripod while framing via a viewfinder at the top of the box.<ref name="Beginners Guide To Understanding And Using A Brownie Box Camera">{{cite web|url=http://www.brownie-camera.com/articles/petelutz/article.shtml |title=Beginners Guide To Understanding And Using A Brownie Box Camera}}</ref> [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], at the age of 13, was one of the first teenagers to take her own picture using a mirror to send to a friend in 1914.

It was very hard as my hands were trembling."<ref name="Alexander Palace Time Machine">{{cite web|url=http://www.alexanderpalace.org/palace/adiaries.html |title=Diaries and Letters – Letters of Grand Duchess Anastasia}}</ref>

During the 1970s, photographic self-portraiture flourished when affordable [[instant camera]]s birthed a new medium of self-expression, capturing uncharacteristically personal insight into otherwise conservative individuals<ref name="Warhol: self portraits">{{cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/collection/art/selfportraits/ |title=warhol: self portraits |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20160515140318/http://www.warhol.org/collection/art/selfportraits/ |archive-date=15 May 2016  }}</ref> and allowing amateurs to learn photography with immediate results.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/24/-sp-stevie-nicks-self-portrait-gallery |title=Stevie Nicks self-portraits shown for the first time: 'I never thought anyone would ever see these pictures' | newspaper=The Guardian | location=London | date=25 September 2014}}</ref> This practice transitioned naturally across to [[digital camera]]s as they supplanted film cameras around the turn of the millennium.

===Japanese selfie culture===
{{See also|Japanese mobile phone culture|Purikura}}

The modern selfie has origins in Japanese [[kawaii]] (cute) culture, which involves an obsession with beautifying self-representation in photographic forms, particularly among females.<ref name="Pan">{{cite book |last1=Pan |first1=Lu |title=Aestheticizing Public Space: Street Visual Politics in East Asian Cities |date=2015 |publisher=Intellect Books |isbn=9781783204533 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rJbzCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA107}}</ref> By the 1990s, self-photography developed into a major preoccupation among Japanese schoolgirls, who took photos with friends and exchanged copies that could be pasted into kawaii albums. This inspired a young photographer, [[Hiromix]] (Hiromi Toshikawa), to publish a photo diary album called ''Seventeen Girl Days'', which included a number of self-posing photos. One of these was a pioneering selfie that was shot while holding the camera in front of herself. She rose to fame in Japan when her album received recognition from camera manufacturer [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] in 1995.<ref name="Miller">{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Laura |chapter=10.

Perhaps the first [[front-facing camera]] on a hand-held device was the [[Game Boy Camera]], released in Japan in February 1998. The Game Boy Camera was an attachment for [[Game Boy]]. The 180°-swivel camera was specifically marketed to allow users to take self-portraits.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nintendo Game Boy Camera|url=http://www.nintendo.com/gb/gb_camera/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980530121628/http://www.nintendo.com/gb/gb_camera/index.html|archive-date=May 30, 1998|access-date=August 15, 2020|website=Nintendo Game Boy Camera}}</ref>

===International popularization===
Outside of East Asia, the concept of uploading group self-taken photographs to the [[Internet]], albeit with a [[disposable camera]] instead of a [[smartphone]], dates back to a [[webpage]] created by Australians in September 2001, including photos taken in the late 1990s (captured by the Internet Archive in April 2004).<ref name="bogon.8m.com SelfPix">{{cite web|url=http://bogon.8m.com/outabout/selfpix1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413003020/http://bogon.8m.com/outabout/selfpix1.htm |archive-date=13 April 2004 |title=bogon.8m.com SelfPix}}</ref><ref name="bogon.8m.com Out & About">{{cite web|url=http://bogon.8m.com/outabout/pictures.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011011110543/http://bogon.8m.com/outabout/pictures.htm |archive-date=11 October 2001 |title=bogon.8m.com Out & About}}</ref><ref name="bogon.8m.com Bogons">{{cite web|url=http://bogon.8m.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010928215649/http://bogon.8m.com/ |archive-date=28 September 2001 |title=bogon.8m.com Bogons}}</ref>

On 13 September 2002, the first known use of the word ''selfie'' in any paper or electronic medium appeared in an Australian internet forum – [[Karl Kruszelnicki]]'s 'Dr Karl Self-Serve Science Forum' – in a post by Nathan Hope.<ref>{{cite web|title=A brief history of the selfie|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/08/12/4065062.htm|work=ABC Science blog|publisher=ABC Online|access-date=30 June 2015|date=2014-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2013 is...|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/11/word-of-the-year-2013-winner/|work=OxfordWords blog|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|access-date=30 November 2013}}</ref> Although Hope later dismissed the notion that he coined the term, describing it as "something that was just common slang at the time, used to describe a picture of yourself", he wrote the following: "''Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer [sic] and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.''"

The [[Sony Ericsson Z1010]] [[mobile phone]], released in late 2003, introduced to Western markets the concept of a front-facing camera, which could be used for selfies and [[video call]]s.<ref name="nerdeky">{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdeky.com/history/sony-ericsson-z1010-%E2%80%93-world%E2%80%99s-first-phone-front-facing-camera|title=Sony Ericsson Z1010 – World's First Phone with a Front-Facing Camera |publisher=nerdeky.com|access-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022103947/http://www.nerdeky.com/history/sony-ericsson-z1010-%E2%80%93-world%E2%80%99s-first-phone-front-facing-camera|archive-date=22 October 2015}}</ref> These cameras became common on mobile devices, such as the [[iPhone 4]] (2010).<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/15/selfie-history-infographic_n_4101645.html|title=A Brief History of the Selfie|date=15 October 2013|work=Huffington Post|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The iPhone 4, which adopted the front-facing camera feature from earlier Japanese and Korean phones, helped popularize the selfie internationally, outside of East Asia.<ref name="Pan"/>

In 2011, the [[Instagram]] photo-sharing and [[social networking service]] introduced auto filters, allowing users to easily alter their photos.<ref name=":1" /> In 2013, the word ''selfie'' was added to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].<ref name=":1" />

==Popularity==
Although the widespread use of the term is fairly new, photos in the selfie genre have existed for much longer. Selfie culture became popular in Japan and then other East Asian countries in the 1990s, starting with [[purikura]] booths and then [[front-facing camera|front-facing]] [[camera phones]]. However, it was not until the 2000s that selfie culture was popularized outside of East Asia.<ref name="Pan"/>

In the early 2000s, before Facebook became the dominant online social network, self-taken photographs were particularly common on [[MySpace]]. However, writer Kate Losse recounts that between 2006 and 2009 (when Facebook became more popular than MySpace), the "MySpace pic" (typically "an amateurish, flash-blinded self-portrait, often taken in front of a bathroom mirror") became an indication of bad taste for users of the newer Facebook social network.  In 2009 in the [[image hosting service|image hosting]] and [[video hosting service|video hosting]] website [[Flickr]], Flickr users used 'selfies' to describe seemingly endless self-portraits posted by teenagers.<ref>{{Citation |author=Horatia Harrod |date=22 March 2009 |title=The world's photo Album |publisher= [[Sunday Telegraph]] |page= 18|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/5048643/Flickr-the-worlds-photo-album.html |access-date=20 November 2013 |location=London}}</ref> According to Losse, improvements in design—especially the front-facing camera of the [[iPhone 4]] (2010), mobile photo apps such as Instagram and [[Snapchat]] led to the resurgence of selfies in the early 2010s.<ref name="Loss">Kate Losse.

Social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat encourage people to take selfies with features like Geofilters, hashtag linking of related topics, and picture stories. Geofilters allow people to take selfies with overlays that can be comedic, altering your selfie image with the ability to show where you are located.

In 2011, a [[crested black macaque]] pressed a trigger on a wildlife photographer's camera, set up in an [[Indonesia]]n jungle for that specific purpose; when the camera was later recovered it was found to contain hundreds of selfies, including one of a grinning female macaque.

The app shows a feed of public photos of everyone's selfies and from the people they follow. The app does not allow users to comment and users can only respond with selfies. The app soon gained popularity among teenagers.

In describing the popularity of the "foot selfie", a photograph taken of one's feet while sunbathing at exotic locations, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that it could be "2014's social media pose to beat".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-selfie-feet-660461|title=The New Selfie: Feet|last=Jenson|first=Wendy|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=31 December 2013|access-date=2 April 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Bangladeshi women are taking Selfie at the wedding ceremony (01).jpg|thumb|Taking selfies is common at wedding ceremonies.]]
[[File:DICKSON T J.jpg|thumb|Diagonal selfie taken on a camping trip.]]

The appeal of selfies comes from how easy they are to create and share, and the control they give people over how they present themselves. Many selfies are intended to present a flattering image of the person, especially to friends whom the photographer expects to be supportive.<ref name="Adewunmi" /><ref name="McHugh" /> Those selfies would be taken on trips, during activities that are considered interesting or as a group selfie with interesting or attractive people. However, a 2013 study of Facebook users found that posting photos of oneself correlates with lower levels of social support from and intimacy with Facebook friends (except for those marked as Close Friends).<ref>Houghton, David and Joinson, Adam and Caldwell, Nigel and Marder, Ben (2013) [http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1723/ ''Tagger's delight? Disclosure and liking in Facebook: the effects of sharing photographs amongst multiple known social circles'']. Discussion Paper. University of Birmingham, Birmingham.</ref> The lead author of the study suggests that "those who frequently post photographs on Facebook risk damaging real-life relationships."<ref>[http://www.hw.ac.uk/news-events/news/sharing-photographs-facebook-could-damage-13069.htm Sharing photographs on Facebook could damage relationships, new research shows]. News & events, Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh. 9 August 2013.</ref> The photo messaging application [[Snapchat]] is also largely used to send selfies. Some users of Snapchat choose to send intentionally-unattractive selfies to their friends for [[comedic]] purposes.

Posting intentionally unattractive selfies has also become common in the early 2010s—in part for their humor value, but in some cases also to explore issues of [[body image]] or as a reaction against the perceived narcissism or over-sexualization of typical selfies.<ref name="Hills">{{cite news|last=Hills|first=Rachel|title=Ugly Is the New Pretty: How Unattractive Selfies Took Over the Internet|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/03/ugly-is-the-new-pretty-a-rise-in-gross-selfies.html|access-date=6 April 2013|newspaper=New York Magazine|date=29 March 2013}}</ref>

The practice of taking selfies has been criticised not only for being narcissistic, preventing assessment and appreciation of what is happening in the present, but also for being mindlessly conformist behaviour, when everyone does what everyone else is doing, "like that scene in ''[[The Life of Brian]] –'' where the crowd gathers outside Brian's window and enthusiastically chants in unison: 'Yes, we're all individuals! ... Yes, we are all different!{{'"}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/how-selfies-hijacked-our-sense-of-self-20160330-gnuppq|title=How selfies hijacked our sense of self|last=Ireland|first=Judith|date=1 April 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref> However, this has been disproved by more nuanced and detailed analyses of the genre.<ref>{{Cite book|doi=10.1108/9781787543577|title=Selfies: Why We Love (and Hate) Them|date=5 April 2018|publisher=Emerald Publishing Limited|isbn=9781787437173|editor-last=Tiidenberg|editor-first=Katrin}}</ref>

===Gender roles, sexuality, and privacy===
Selfies are popular among both genders; however, sociologist Ben Agger describes the trend of selfies as "the [[male gaze]] gone [[viral phenomenon|viral]]", and sociologist and women's studies professor [[Gail Dines]] links it to the rise of "porn culture" and the idea that sexual attractiveness is the only way in which a woman can make herself visible.<ref name="Murphy">{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Meghan|title=Putting selfies under a feminist lens|url=https://www.straight.com/life/368086/putting-selfies-under-feminist-lens|access-date=6 April 2013|newspaper=Georgia Straight|date=3 April 2013}}</ref> Feminist writer Megan Murphy has pointed out that posting images publicly or sharing them with others who do so may have a dramatic effect in the case of revenge porn, where ex-lovers post sexually explicit photographs or nude selfies to exact revenge or humiliate their former lovers.<ref name="Murphy" /> Nonetheless, some feminists view selfies as a subversive form of self-expression that narrates one's own view of desirability. In this sense, selfies can be positive and offer a way of actively asserting [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]].<ref>Simmons, Rachel.

In 2013 in the blog ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]'', author [[Erin Gloria Ryan]] criticized selfies, believing that the images they often portray, as well as the fact that they are usually posted to social media with the intent of getting positive comments and "likes", reinforce the "notion that the most valuable thing [a young woman] has to offer the world is her looks."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Erin Gloria|title=Selfies Aren't Empowering.

Research shows that there is a particular difference between perspectives of youngsters and adults.

Many [[Celebrity|celebrities]] – especially [[sex symbol]]s – post selfies for their followers on social media, and provocative or otherwise interesting celebrity selfies are the subject of regular press coverage. Some commentators, such as [[Emma Barnett]] of ''[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]]'', have argued that sexy celebrity selfies (and sexy non-celebrity selfies) can be empowering to the selfie-takers but harmful to women in general as they promote viewing women as [[sex object]]s.<ref>Barnett, Emma (19 August 2013) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10251845/Why-sexy-girl-pictures-online-are-more-harmful-than-lads-mags.html Why sexy girl pictures online are more harmful than lads' mags].

Devices for holding smartphones or compact cameras called [[selfie stick]]s are often used when taking group selfies, as they allow a wider, more panoramic image capture.

Another option for taking selfies from a distance beyond one's arm is a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]. Selfies made with a drone are also called '''dronies'''. The concept of taking a dronie first entered the mainstream in 2014 and coincided with a relatively sudden increase in the availability of relatively cheap, camera bearing [[multicopter]] drones.<ref name="tel">{{cite news|title=The 'selfie' is dead.

First, Farace, van Laer, de Ruyter, and Wetzels<ref>Farace, S., van Laer, T., de Ruyter, K., & Wetzels, M. (2017). "Assessing the effect of narrative transportation, portrayed action, and photographic style on the likelihood to comment on posted selfies." ''European Journal of Marketing''. {{ssrn|2638273}}. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2638273}}.</ref> describe three photography techniques with which people are more likely to engage: first-person perspective, action, and person rather than 'just' selfies and adaptation into artfulness.

According to a study performed by Nicola Bruno and Marco Bertamini at the [[University of Parma]], selfies by non-professional photographers show a slight bias for showing the left cheek of the selfie-taker.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martinez |first1=Luis M. |last2=Bruno |first2=Nicola |last3=Bertamini |first3=Marco |title=Self-Portraits: Smartphones Reveal a Side Bias in Non-Artists |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=e55141 |year=2013 |pmid=23405117 |pmc=3566189 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055141 }}</ref> This is similar to observations of portraits by professional painters from many historical periods and styles,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonora |first1=M |last2=Wieckowsk |first2=M R |last3=Chinopoulos |first3=C |last4=Kepp |first4=O |last5=Kroemer |first5=G |last6=Galluzzi |first6=L |last7=Pinton |first7=P |title=Molecular mechanisms of cell death: central implication of ATP synthase in mitochondrial permeability transition |journal=Oncogene |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1608 |year=2015 |pmid=25790189 |doi=10.1038/onc.2014.462 |doi-access=free }}</ref> indicating that the left cheek bias may be rooted in asymmetries of brain lateralization that are well documented within [[cognitive neuroscience]]. In a second study, the same group tested if selfie takers without training in photography spontaneously adhere to widely prescribed rules of photographic composition, such as the [[rule of thirds]]. It seems that they do not, suggesting that these rules may be conventional rather than hardwired in the brain's perceptual preferences.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bruno |first1=Nicola |last2=Gabriele |first2=Valentina |last3=Bertamini |first3=Marco |last4=Tasso |first4=Tiziana |title='Selfies' Reveal Systematic Deviations from Known Principles of Photographic Composition |journal=Art & Perception |volume=2 |issue=1–2 |year=2014 |pages=45–58 |doi=10.1163/22134913-00002027 }}</ref>

A 2016 study examining the relationship between personality and selfie-posting behaviors suggests that extroversion and social exhibitionism positively predict frequency of selfie posting, whereas self-esteem is generally unrelated to selfie-posting behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sorokowska |first1=Agnieszka |last2=Oleszkiewicz |first2=Anna |last3=Frackowiak |first3=Tomasz |last4=Pisanski |first4=Katarzyna |last5=Chmiel |first5=Anna |last6=Sorokowski |first6=Piotr |title=Selfies and personality: Who posts self-portrait photographs? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=90 |year=2016 |pages=119–23 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.10.037 }}</ref>

According to Professor Amanda du Preez, there are least three types of selfie pictures documenting death, selfies unknowingly taken before death, where the taker's death is almost witnessed, or where the taker stands by while someone else dies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/the-deadly-selfie-game-the-thrill-to-end-all-thrills-59266 |title=The deadly selfie game – the thrill to end all thrills  |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |author=Amanda du Preez |date=17 May 2016 |access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>

== Facial distortion effect ==
Because they are typically taken much closer to the subject's face than a conventional photograph, phone selfies tend to distort the subject's face. When conventional photographers take head shots, they typically use a narrower lens (or zoom in) and stand at a normal distance, instead of getting physically closer to the subject's face. Front-facing cell phone cameras, on the other hand, feature wide-angle lenses and are held closer to the face, since the human arm is only so long.  This results in [[perspective distortion (photography)|extension distortion]], where objects closer to the camera appear much larger than they actually are. Though this distortion has a slimming effect, it also exaggerates the auto-photographer's nose and chin, since those parts are closer to the camera than the rest of the face.

A study published by the [[American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery]] has found that selfies have altered people's perception of their faces to the point where they increased the demand for [[rhinoplasty|rhinoplasties]] (nose jobs). Forty-two percent of surgeons surveyed have noticed that patients are seeking surgeries to improve their appearance in photographs, especially selfies taken at close distance.<ref name="CBS Distortion">{{cite web |last1=Welch |first1=Ashley |title=Selfies distort faces like a 'funhouse mirror,' study finds |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/selfies-distort-faces-30-percent-like-funhouse-mirror-study-finds/ |website=CBS.com |publisher=CBS News |access-date=13 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref> Another study found that selfies taken at a distance of 12 inches (30&nbsp;cm) can exaggerate nasal size by as much as 30%, and recommends that people take pictures from a standard distance of 5 feet (1.5 meters) to minimize perspective distortion.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web |last1=Crist |first1=Carolyn |title=Selfies distort the face, plastic surgeons warn |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-selfies-plastic-surgery/selfies-distort-the-face-plastic-surgeons-warn-idUSKCN1GJ2P5 |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |access-date=13 July 2018}}</ref>
