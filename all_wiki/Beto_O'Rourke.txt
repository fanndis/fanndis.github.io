'''Robert Francis''' "'''Beto'''" '''O'Rourke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|t|oʊ|_|oʊ|ˈ|r|ɔːr|k}}; born September 26, 1972) is an American politician who represented [[Texas's 16th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 2013 to 2019. O'Rourke is most notable for his [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|2018]] campaign for [[United States Senate]], in which he lost to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Ted Cruz]]. He sought the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic nomination]] for [[President of the United States]].

O'Rourke was born into a local political family in [[El Paso, Texas]], and is a graduate of [[Woodberry Forest School]] and [[Columbia University]].<ref name="WP2" /> While studying at Columbia, O'Rourke began a brief music career as [[Bassist|bass guitarist]] in the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Foss (band)|Foss]]. After his college graduation, he returned to El Paso and began a business career. In 2005, he was elected to the El Paso City Council, serving until 2011. O'Rourke was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives [[2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Texas|in 2012]] after defeating eight-term incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Silvestre Reyes]] in the [[Primary election|primary]].

After being re-elected to the House in 2014 and 2016, O'Rourke declined to seek re-election in 2018. Instead, he sought the U.S. Senate seat held by Cruz, running a competitive campaign that drew national attention. O'Rourke set a record for most votes ever cast for a Democrat in Texas history. On March 14, 2019, O'Rourke announced his campaign for President of the United States in the [[2020 United States presidential election]]. He suspended his campaign on November 1, 2019, before the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|primaries]] began.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/us/politics/beto-orourke-drops-out.html|title=Beto O'Rourke Is Dropping Out of the Presidential Race|last=Burns|first=Alexander|date=2019-11-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

He was a supporter of a redevelopment plan for a depressed area of El Paso's business district with a high vacancy rate, which was also supported by Mayor [[John Cook (Texas politician)|John Cook]] and fellow City Councilwoman Susie Byrd.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.texasobserver.org/2483-eminent-disaster-a-cabal-of-politicians-and-profiteers-targets-an-el-paso-barrio/ |title=Eminent Disaster |last=Welsome |first=Eileen |work=[[Texas Observer]]}}</ref> The initiative faced opposition from a small group of small businesses and [[Chicano]] activists who did not want the part of the [[El Segundo Barrio]] neighborhood to be, in their words, "[[gentrification|gentrified]]", as well as potential use of [[eminent domain]] to override reluctant property owners. Eminent domain remained a moot issue, for it was never adopted. Despite the redevelopment plan predating O'Rourke's joining the city council, and despite many city council members having supported it (including O'Rourke's predecessor Anthony Cobos), the opponents focused on O'Rourke's support for it, due to Mayor Cook requesting advice and investment from a successful local real-estate developer who was also O'Rourke's father-in-law. O'Rourke responded with an on-foot campaign to residents of the neighborhood and was met with support as well as some cynicism.<ref name=benson/> An activist initiated a recall campaign against O'Rourke (which O'Rourke won) and a few downtown property owners filed two ethics complaints against him; these were determined to be unfounded and dismissed.

In September 2016, three bills that were attached as amendments to H.R. 5620 (or the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016) were approved unanimously with bipartisan support in the House. The first, the Vet Connect Act of 2016 (H.R. 5162), would allow a veteran's entire medical record to be shared with a community provider, without explicit written consent, with a pilot of the program then being tried in El Paso. The Ask Veterans Act (H.R. 1319) would have a non-government contractor conduct an annual survey on behalf of the secretary of Veterans Affairs in order to determine veterans' experiences with hospital care and medical services at VA facilities, the results of which would be publicly accessible. O'Rourke developed this idea from feedback from veterans at town hall meetings. The Get Vets a Doc Now Act (H.R. 5501) would allow the VA to provide conditional job offers to [[Residency (medicine)|resident doctors]] two years before the completion of their programs, in an effort to recruit doctors to fill the shortage of 43,000 clinicians.<ref name="Sanchez">{{cite web |last1=Sanchez |first1=Sara |title=O'Rourke's proposals to aid veterans pass House |url=https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/military/2016/09/14/orourkes-proposals-aid-veterans-pass-house/90375378/ |website=El Paso Times |access-date=November 21, 2018 |language=en |date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>
