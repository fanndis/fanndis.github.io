The '''Economic Club of New York''' is a U.S. nonprofit and non-partisan membership organization dedicated to promoting the study and discussion of social, economic and political questions.

== History ==
The Economic Club of New York was founded in 1907 by J. W. Beatson, Secretary of the National Economic League in Boston, and four business leaders from New York City. Its founders sought to follow the successful example of the Economic Clubs of Boston, Providence, Worcester, Portland, Springfield, and New Haven with the aim of bringing business people and others together for discussions of economic, social and other public issues in a non-partisan forum.<ref>{{cite web

The Economic Club previously banned women from both membership and attending any events. In 1970, they called Fortune magazine to send someone to cover their annual black tie event, and balked when Fortune wanted to send their long-time reporter (and future editor) [[Carol Loomis]]. The club's director said he did not want "any frivolous little Smith girls looking for a free dinner and the chance to spend an evening with 1,200 men in black tie." Loomis still went, and later sued them, but as it was and remains a private club, she lost the case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carol Loomis, Editor for Warren Buffett, Leaves Job After 60 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/04/business/media/carol-loomis-editor-for-warren-buffett-leaves-job-after-60-years.html |accessdate=10 June 2020 |publisher=The New York Times |date=July 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Operation==
The main activity of the Economic Club of New York is to regularly host prestigious guest speakers at its member (and their guests)-only dinners and luncheons. However, these presentations are open to the news media to help foster public discussion of issues important to the general public as well those in business and public life. 
These speaker programs are the focal point of large dinner meetings, or occasionally luncheons, in the ballroom of a major hotel in Manhattan. The format is geared to serious discussion. There is no entertainment, no presentations, and no extraneous business. The focus is on the Guest of Honor and the speaking program. 
As defined by the Club's founders, the issues for discussion were ones of "live and practical interest" and speakers were to be of national reputation.<ref>{{cite web

==Speakers==
The Club has been host to more than 1,200 speakers and the stature, caliber, and variety of speakers has become a guiding principle. The audiences have heard from current, and past presidents of the United States including [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[William H. Taft]], [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H.W. Bush]], and [[Donald Trump]]. Among the many distinguished foreign leaders to address the Club have been [[Winston Churchill]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Yitzak Rabin]], [[Corizon Aquino]], and [[Zhu Rongji]].<ref name=Guests>{{cite web

Other Guests of Honor have included central bankers, justices of the Supreme Court, secretaries general of the United Nations, governors and heads of international business enterprises, as well as many key cabinet members, military leaders, ambassadors, and scientists.<ref name=Guests/>

Presentations are followed by a questions period in which Club members, selected in advance and seated on the dais, will query the speaker. There are no constraints placed on what speakers may say during their presentation. Questioners are not constrained either.

Club speakers often use the platform to put forth their agendas to members and the media. On December 14, 1962 then-President John F. Kennedy made his famous remarks calling for a sharp cut in tax rates and reform of the tax system in order to grow the economy. In part, he said:

<blockquote>In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now. The experience of a number of European countries and Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus.<ref>{{cite web
