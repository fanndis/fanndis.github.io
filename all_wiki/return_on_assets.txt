The '''return on assets''' ('''ROA''') shows the percentage of how [[Profit (accounting)|profitable]] a company's [[asset]]s are in generating [[revenue]].

ROA can be computed as below:

:<math>\mathrm{ROA} = \frac{\mbox{Net Income}}{\mbox{Average Total Assets}}</math><ref name="isbn0-618-73661-1">{{cite book |author1=Susan V. Crosson |author2=Belverd E. Needles, Jr. |author3=Belverd E. Needles |author4=Powers, Marian |title=Principles of accounting |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=2008 |page=209 |isbn=0-618-73661-1}}</ref>

This number tells you what the company can do with what it has, ''i.e.'' how many dollars of earnings they derive from each dollar of assets they control. It's a useful number for comparing competing companies in the same industry. The number will vary widely across different industries. Return on assets gives an indication of the [[capital intensity]] of the company, which will depend on the industry; companies that require large initial investments will generally have lower return on assets. ROAs over 5% are generally considered good.
