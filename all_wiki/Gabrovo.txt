'''Gabrovo''' ({{lang-bg|Габрово}} {{IPA-bg|ˈɡabrovo|}}) is [[List of cities and towns in Bulgaria|a town]] in central northern [[Bulgaria]], the [[Local government|administrative]] centre of [[Gabrovo Province]].

It is situated at the foot of the central [[Balkan Mountains]], in the [[valley]] of the [[Yantra River]], and is known as an international capital of humour and satire (see [[Gabrovo humour]]), as well as noted for its [[Bulgarian National Revival]] [[architecture]]. Gabrovo is also known as the longest town in Bulgaria, stretching over 25&nbsp;km<ref name=Bulgaria>{{cite book|title=Bulgaria (Other Places Travel Guide)|date=2012|publisher=Other Places Publishing|isbn=9780982261996|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ8vWih-rqwC&q=Gabrovo+25+km&pg=PA135}}</ref> along the Yantra, yet reaching only {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} in width at places. The [[geographic center of Bulgaria]] - [[Uzana (Bulgaria)|Uzana]] is located near the town.

==Name==
[[File:Ratscho Kowatscha Statue, Gabrovo.jpg|thumb|Statue of Racho Kowatscha]]
According to the most widespread [[legend]], Gabrovo was founded by a [[blacksmith]] called Racho,<ref name=Bulgaria2>{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Annie|title=Bulgaria|date=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841621555|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HgYB6dFSTwC&q=gabrovo+Racho&pg=PA157}}</ref>  close to whose [[fireplace]] a [[hornbeam]] rose, so the settlement acquired its name, from the Slavic word ''gabar'' ("[[hornbeam]]") + the Slavic suffix ''-ovo''.


==History==
The area around Gabrovo, inhabited since the [[Neolithic]], gained [[economic]] importance after [[Veliko Tarnovo]] became [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in the 12th century. [[Artisan|Craftsmanship]] and [[trade]] prospered due to the proximity to both the capital and the [[Balkan]] passes. [[Medieval]] Gabrovo was a small pass village of about 100 houses.

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion of the [[Balkans]] in the 14th century, the demographic position of Gabrovo changed significantly, as it was the only settlement in a considerably large geographic area and an attractive place for [[Bulgarians]] fleeing from the conquered capital and neighbouring fortresses. It turned from a village into a small town (''palanka'') and began to develop as an economic, cultural and spiritual centre.

The [[priest]]s are going to throw a wooden cross in [[Yantra (river)|Yantra]]. Believers will then jump into the icy waters to "save" the cross.]]

During [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]], the rich tradesmen spent plenty of resources for the small town's public planning.  The first Bulgarian secular school, the [[Aprilov National High School]], was founded in Gabrovo in 1835 with the aid of [[Vasil Aprilov]] and [[Nikolay Palauzov]]. Gabrovo was officially proclaimed a [[town]] by the Ottoman authority in May 1860. In the 1870s [[Felix Kanitz]] said that Gabrovo is "a big workshop" and that it is a "city that lives from the water," referring to widely used water power. The glory of the goods of Gabrovo became known throughout the Ottoman Empire, and beyond that, in [[Bucharest]] even nowadays there is a street named "Gabroveni".

Shortly before and after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878, Gabrovo developed as a centre of [[Industrial sector|industry]] on the basis of its economic traditions. Joint-stock companies emerged, [[factories]] were constructed and connections to the large [[stock exchange]]s were created, prompting some to label the town "The Bulgarian [[Manchester]]".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/223244/Gabrovo Gabrovo] in Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>

==Population==
Gabrovo saw its most rapid growth in the post-[[World War II]] years, when its population was doubled. Following general population trends in Bulgaria, the number of citizens started declining after the fall of Communism in the country. People started emigrating abroad or to the capital of [[Sofia]]. Currently, Gabrovo is more than 20,000 people short of its peak, achieved in the period 1985-1991 when the number of the residents exceeded 80,000.<ref name="pop1992"/> The following table presents the change of the population after the liberation of the country in 1887.  According to Census 2011, {{As of|2011|02|lc=on}}, the population of the town was 58,950 inhabitants.<ref name="cities census 2011">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 National Statistical Institute - Main Towns Census 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408064046/http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/pagebg2.php?p2=36&sp2=37&SSPP2=45 |date=2011-04-08 }}</ref>
