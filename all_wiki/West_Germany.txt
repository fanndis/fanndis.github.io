'''West Germany''' is the common English name for the '''Federal Republic of Germany''' ('''FRG'''; {{lang-de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}}, '''BRD'''; {{audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}), retrospectively designated the '''Bonn Republic''',<ref>''The Bonn Republic&nbsp;— West German democracy, 1945–1990,'' Anthony James Nicholls, Longman, 1997</ref> in the period between its formation on 23 May 1949 and [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990. During this [[Cold War]] period, the western portion of Germany was part of the [[Western Bloc]]. The FRG was created during the [[Allied occupation of Germany]] after [[World War II]], established from eleven [[states of Germany|states]] formed in the three Allied zones of occupation held by the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Its provisional capital was the city of [[Bonn]].

At the onset of the Cold War, Europe was divided between the Western and Eastern blocs. Germany was {{lang|la|de facto}} divided into two countries and two special territories, the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] and a divided Berlin. Initially, the FRG claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany, identifying as the sole democratically reorganised continuation of the 1871–1945 [[German Reich]]. It took the line that the German Democratic Republic (GDR), commonly referred to as [[East Germany]], was an illegally constituted [[puppet state]] controlled by the [[Soviet Union]]. Although the GDR did hold regular elections, these were neither free nor fair, and West Germany considered them illegitimate.

Three southwestern states of West Germany merged to form [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952, and the Saarland joined the FRG in 1957. In addition to the resulting ten states, [[West Berlin]] was considered an unofficial {{lang|la|de facto}} eleventh state. While legally not part of the FRG, as Berlin was under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], West Berlin politically aligned with West Germany and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

The foundation for the influential position held by Germany today was laid during the economic miracle of the 1950s (''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''), when West Germany rose from the enormous destruction wrought by [[World War II]] to become the world's third-largest economy. The first chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who remained in office until 1963, worked for a full alignment with [[NATO]] rather than neutrality, and secured membership in the military alliance. Adenauer was also a proponent of agreements that developed into the present-day [[European Union]]. When the [[Group of Seven|G6]] was established in 1975, there was no serious debate as to whether West Germany would become a member.

Following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989]], symbolised by the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|opening]] of the [[Berlin Wall]], both territories took action to achieve [[German reunification]]. East Germany voted to dissolve and accede to the FRG in 1990. Its [[New states of Germany|five post-war states]] ({{lang|de|Länder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin, which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the FRG on 3 October 1990, raising the total number of states from ten to sixteen, and ending the division of Germany. The reunited Germany is considered the successor of West Germany and not a new state, as the process was essentially a voluntary act of accession: West Germany was enlarged to include the additional states of East Germany, which had ceased to exist. The expanded FRG retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances such as the [[United Nations]], NATO, [[OECD]], and the [[European Economic Community]].

==Naming conventions==
The official name of West Germany, adopted in 1949 and unchanged since, is {{lang|de|Bundesrepublik Deutschland}} (Federal Republic of Germany).

In East Germany, the terms {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} (West Germany) or {{lang|de|westdeutsche Bundesrepublik}} (West German Federal Republic) were preferred during the 1950s and 1960s. This changed under its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|1968 constitution]], when the idea of a single German nation was abandoned by East Germany. As a result, it officially considered West Germans and West Berliners as foreigners. The initialism ''[[BRD (Germany)|BRD]]'' (FRG in English) began to prevail in East German usage in the early 1970s, beginning in the newspaper {{lang|de|[[Neues Deutschland]]}}. Other [[Eastern Bloc]] nations soon followed suit.

In 1965 the West German [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Minister of All-German Affairs]] [[Erich Mende]] had issued the "Directives for the Appellation of Germany", recommending avoiding the initialism BRD. On 31 May 1974, the heads of West German federal and state governments recommended always using the full name in official publications. From then on, West German sources avoided the abbreviated form, with the exception of left-leaning organizations which embraced it. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] had agreed to refuse to use the initialism.<ref>See in general: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»"], in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag&nbsp;– Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.), No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)</ref>

The [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code of West Germany was DE (for ''Deutschland'', Germany), which has remained the country code of Germany after reunification. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the most widely used country codes, and the DE code is notably used as a country identifier, extending the postal code and as the Internet's country code top-level domain [[.de]]. The less widely used [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] country code of West Germany was DEU, which has remained the country code of reunified Germany. The now deleted codes for East Germany, on the other hand, were DD in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and DDR in ISO 3166-1 alpha-3.

The colloquial term ''West Germany'' or its equivalent was used in many languages. {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} was also a widespread colloquial form used in German-speaking countries, usually without political overtones.

[[Bremen (state)|Bremen]] was an American [[Enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the British zone. Berlin was a four-power area within the Soviet zone.]]

On 4–11 February 1945 leaders from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[Soviet Union]] held the [[Yalta Conference]] where future arrangements regarding post-war Europe and [[Pacific War|Allied strategy against Japan in the Pacific]] were negotiated. They agreed that the boundaries of Germany as at 31 December 1937 would be chosen as demarcating German national territory from German occupied territory; all German annexations after 1937 were automatically null.  Subsequently, and into the 1970s, the West German state was to maintain that these 1937 boundaries continued to be 'valid in international law'; although the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that East Prussia and Silesia must be transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union in any Peace agreement. The conference agreed that post-war Germany, minus these transfers, would be divided into [[Allied-occupied Germany|four occupation zones]]: a French Zone in the far west; a British Zone in the northwest; an American Zone in the south; and a Soviet Zone in the East. Berlin was separately divided into four zones. These divisions were not intended to dismember Germany, only to designate zones of administration.

By the subsequent [[Potsdam Agreement]], the four Allied Powers asserted joint sovereignty over "Germany as a whole", defined as the totality of the territory within the occupation zones. Former German areas east of the rivers [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] and outside of 'Germany as a whole' were separated from German sovereignty in July 1945 and transferred from Soviet military occupation to Polish and Soviet (in the case of the territory of Kaliningrad) civil administration, their Polish and Soviet status to be confirmed at a final Peace Treaty.  Following wartime commitments by the Allies to the governments-in-exile of Czechoslovakia and Poland, the Potsdam Protocols also agreed to the 'orderly and humane' transfer to Germany as a whole of the ethnic German populations in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Eight million German expellees and refugees eventually settled in West Germany. Between 1946 and 1949, three of the occupation zones began to merge. First, the British and American zones were combined into the quasi-state of [[Bizone|Bizonia]]. Soon afterwards, the French zone was included into [[Bizone|Trizonia]]. Conversely, the Russian zone became [[East Germany]]. At the same time, new federal states ({{lang|de|Länder}}) were formed in the Allied zones; replacing the geography of pre-Nazi German states such as the [[Free State of Prussia]] and the [[Republic of Baden]], which had derived ultimately from former independent German kingdoms and principalities.

In the dominant post-war narrative of West Germany, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime was characterised as having been a 'criminal' state,{{sfnp|Collings|2015|p=xxiv}} illegal and illegitimate from the outset; while the [[Weimar Republic]] was characterised as having been a 'failed' state,{{sfnp|Collings|2015|p=xv}} whose inherent institutional and constitutional flaws had been exploited by Hitler in his illegal seizure of dictatorial powers. Consequently, following the death of Hitler in 1945 and the subsequent capitulation of the German Armed Forces, the national political, judicial, administrative, and constitutional instruments of both Nazi Germany and the Weimar Republic were understood as entirely defunct, such that a new West Germany could be established in a condition of constitutional nullity.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|title=How a constitution can safeguard democracy:The German Experience|author=Jutta Limbach|publisher=Goethe-Institut|accessdate=7 December 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220115032/https://www.law.hku.hk/ccpl/Docs/JuttaLimbach.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, the new West Germany asserted its fundamental continuity with the 'overall' German state that was held to have embodied the unified German people since the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] of 1848, and which from 1871 had been represented within the [[German Reich]]; albeit that this overall state had become effectively dormant long before 8 May 1945.

In 1949 with the continuation and aggravation of the Cold War (witness the [[Berlin Blockade#Start of the Berlin Airlift|Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–49), the two German states that were originated in the Western Allied and the Soviet Zones became known internationally as West Germany and East Germany. Commonly known in English as [[East Germany]], the former [[Soviet occupation zone]], eventually became the ''[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'' or ''GDR''. In 1990 West Germany and East Germany jointly signed the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] (also known as the "Two-plus-Four Agreement"); by which transitional status of Germany following [[World War II]] was definitively ended and the Four Allied powers relinquished their joint residual sovereign authority for Germany as a whole including the area of West Berlin which had officially remained under Allied occupation for the purposes of international and GDR law (a status that the Western countries applied to Berlin as a whole despite the Soviets declaring the end of occupation of East Berlin unilaterally many decades before). The Two-plus-Four Agreement also saw the two parts of Germany confirm their post-war external boundaries as final and irreversible (including the 1945 transfer of former German lands east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]]), and the Allied Powers confirmed their consent to German Reunification.  From 3 October 1990, after the reformation of the GDR's {{lang|de|Länder}}, the East German states [[German reunification|joined the Federal Republic]].

With territories and frontiers that coincided largely with the ones of old [[Middle Ages]] [[East Francia]] and the 19th-century [[Napoleon]]ic [[Confederation of the Rhine]], the Federal Republic of Germany, founded on 23 May 1949, under the terms of the [[Bonn–Paris conventions]] it obtained "the full authority of a sovereign state" on 5 May 1955 (although "full sovereignty" was not obtained until the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Agreement]] in 1990).{{refn |name=Sovereignty |group=lower-alpha |Detlef Junker of the {{lang|de|[[Heidelberg University]]}} states "In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.' If this was intended as a statement of fact, it must be conceded that it was partly fiction and, if interpreted as wishful thinking, it was a promise that went unfulfilled until 1990.

West Germany became a focus of the [[Cold War]] with its juxtaposition to East Germany, a member of the subsequently founded [[Warsaw Pact]]. The former capital, [[Berlin]], had been divided into four sectors, with the Western Allies joining their sectors to form [[West Berlin]], while the Soviets held [[East Berlin]]. West Berlin was completely surrounded by East German territory and had suffered a Soviet blockade in 1948–49, which was overcome by the [[Berlin Blockade#Start of the Berlin Airlift|Berlin airlift]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078072-0004, Konrad Adenauer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Konrad Adenauer]]]]
The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 led to U.S. calls to rearm West Germany to help defend [[Western Europe]] from the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat. Germany's partners in the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] proposed to establish a [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community|European Defence Community]] (EDC), with an integrated army, navy and air force, composed of the armed forces of its member states. The West German military would be subject to complete EDC control, but the other EDC member states ([[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]) would cooperate in the EDC while maintaining independent control of their own armed forces.

Though the EDC treaty was signed (May 1952), it never entered into force. France's [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] rejected it on the grounds that it threatened national sovereignty, and when the [[National Assembly (France)|French National Assembly]] refused to ratify it (August 1954), the treaty died. The French Gaullists and communists had killed the French government's proposal. Then other means had to be found to allow West German rearmament. In response, at the [[London and Paris Conferences]], the [[Treaty of Brussels|Brussels Treaty]] was modified to include West Germany, and to form the [[Western European Union]] (WEU). West Germany was to be permitted to rearm (an idea many Germans rejected), and have full sovereign control of its military, called the {{lang|de|[[Bundeswehr]]}}. The WEU, however, would regulate the size of the armed forces permitted to each of its member states. Also, the German constitution prohibited any military action, except in the case of an external attack against Germany or its allies ({{lang|de|Bündnisfall}}). Also, Germans could reject military service on grounds of conscience, and serve for civil purposes instead.<ref>John A. Reed Jr, ''Germany and NATO'' (National Defense University, 1987) [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a264257.pdf Online].</ref>

The three Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] retained occupation powers in Berlin and certain responsibilities for Germany as a whole. Under the new arrangements, the Allies stationed troops within West Germany for NATO defense, pursuant to stationing and status-of-forces agreements. With the exception of 55,000 French troops, Allied forces were under NATO's joint defense command. (France withdrew from the collective military command structure of NATO in 1966.)

===Reforms during the 1960s===
[[Konrad Adenauer]] was 73 years old when he became chancellor in 1949, and for this reason he was initially reckoned as a caretaker. However, he stayed in power for 14 years. The grand old man of German postwar politics had to be dragged—almost literally—out of office in 1963.<ref>William Glenn Gray,  "Adenauer, Erhard, and the Uses of Prosperity." ''German Politics and Society'' 25.2 (2007): 86–103.</ref>

{{Main|Spiegel affair}}
In October 1962 the weekly news magazine {{lang|de|[[Der Spiegel]]}} published an analysis of the West German military defence. The conclusion was that there were several weaknesses in the system. Ten days after publication, the offices of {{lang|de|Der Spiegel}} in Hamburg were raided by the police and quantities of documents were seized. Chancellor Adenauer proclaimed in the {{lang|de|Bundestag}} that the article was tantamount to high treason and that the authors would be prosecuted. The editor/owner of the magazine, [[Rudolf Augstein]] spent some time in jail before the public outcry over the breaking of laws on freedom of the press became too loud to be ignored. The FDP members of Adenauer's cabinet resigned from the government, demanding the resignation of [[Franz Josef Strauss]], Defence Minister, who had decidedly overstepped his competence during the crisis. Adenauer was still wounded by his brief run for president, and this episode damaged his reputation even further. He announced that he would step down in the fall of 1963. His successor was to be Ludwig Erhard.<ref>Alfred C. Mierzejewski, ''Ludwig Erhard: A Biography'' (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2005) p 179. [https://www.questia.com/library/120073119/ludwig-erhard-a-biography Online]</ref>

In the early 1960s the rate of economic growth slowed down significantly. In 1962 growth rate was 4.7% and the following year, 2.0%. After a brief recovery, the growth rate slowed again into a recession, with no growth in 1967.

A new coalition was formed to deal with this problem. Erhard stepped down in 1966 and was succeeded by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]]. He led a [[grand coalition]] between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new [[German Emergency Acts|emergency acts]]: the grand coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required for their ratification. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as [[freedom of movement]] to be limited in case of a state of emergency.

[[File:Rudi.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rudi Dutschke]], student leader]]
During the time leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], the rising [[West German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|Notstand der Demokratie}} ("Democracy in Crisis") and members of the Campaign against Nuclear Armament.  A key event in the development of open democratic debate occurred in 1967, when the [[List of monarchs of Persia|Shah of Iran]], [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], visited West Berlin. Several thousand demonstrators gathered outside the Opera House where he was to attend a special performance. Supporters of the Shah (later known as {{lang|de|Jubelperser}}), armed with staves and bricks attacked the protesters while the police stood by and watched. A demonstration in the centre was being forcibly dispersed when a bystander named [[Shooting of Benno Ohnesorg|Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head and killed by a plainclothes policeman. (It has now been established that the policeman, Kurras, was a paid spy of the East German security forces.) Protest demonstrations continued, and calls for more active opposition by some groups of students were made, which was declared by the press, especially the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild]]-Zeitung}} newspaper, as a massive disruption to life in Berlin, in a massive campaign against the protesters. Protests against the [[Vietnam War|US intervention in Vietnam]], mingled with anger over the vigour with which demonstrations were repressed led to mounting militance among the students at the universities in Berlin. One of the most prominent campaigners was a young man from East Germany called [[Rudi Dutschke]] who also criticised the forms of capitalism that were to be seen in West Berlin. Just before Easter 1968, a young man tried to kill Dutschke as he bicycled to the student union, seriously injuring him. All over West Germany, thousands demonstrated against the Springer newspapers which were seen as the prime cause of the violence against students. Trucks carrying newspapers were set on fire and windows in office buildings broken.<ref>Kraushaar, Frankfurter Schule und Studentenbewegung, Vol. 2 Rogner und Bernhard, 1998 Dokument Nr. 193, p. 356</ref>

In the wakes of these demonstrations, in which the question of America's role in Vietnam began to play a bigger role, came a desire among the students to find out more about the role of the parent-generation in the Nazi era. The proceedings of the [[Nuremberg trials|War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg]] had been widely publicised in Germany but until a new generation of teachers, educated with the findings of historical studies, could begin to reveal the truth about the war and the crimes committed in the name of the German people. One courageous attorney, [[Fritz Bauer]] patiently gathered evidence on the guards of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|{{lang|de|Auschwitz|nocat=y}} concentration camp]] and about twenty were put on trial in Frankfurt in 1963. Daily newspaper reports and visits by school classes to the proceedings revealed to the German public the nature of the concentration camp system and it became evident that [[The Holocaust|the {{lang|he-Latn|Shoah|nocat=y}}]] was of vastly greater dimensions than the German population had believed. (The term "Holocaust" for the systematic mass-murder of Jews first came into use in 1979, when a 1978 [[Holocaust (miniseries)|American mini-series with that name]] was shown on West German television.) The processes set in motion by the Auschwitz trial reverberated decades later.

The calling in question of the actions and policies of government led to a new climate of debate. The issues of emancipation, colonialism, environmentalism and grass roots democracy were discussed at all levels of society. In 1979 the environmental party, the Greens, reached the 5% limit required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] provincial election. Also of great significance was the steady growth of a [[Feminism in Germany|feminist movement]] in which women demonstrated for equal rights. Until 1977 a married woman had to have the permission of her husband if she wanted to take on a job or open a bank account.<ref>Reconciliation Policy in Germany 1998–2008, Construing the 'Problem' of the Incompatibility of Paid Employment and Care Work, by Cornelius Grebe; pg 92: ''"However, the 1977 reform of marriage and family law by Social Democrats and Liberals formally gave women the right to take up employment without their spouses' permission. This marked the legal end of the 'housewife marriage' and a transition to the ideal of 'marriage in partnership'."''

[[File:RAF-Logo.svg|thumb|upright|Logo of the [[Red Army Faction]] ]]
Anger over the treatment of demonstrators following the death of Benno Ohnesorg and the attack on Rudi Dutschke, coupled with growing frustration over the lack of success in achieving their aims led to growing militance among students and their supporters. In May 1968, three young people set fire to two department stores in Frankfurt; they were brought to trial and made very clear to the court that they regarded their action as a legitimate act in what they described as the "struggle against imperialism".<ref>Kraushaar op.cit</ref> The student movement began to split into different factions, ranging from the unattached liberals to the [[Maoism|Maoists]] and supporters of direct action in every form—the anarchists. Several groups set as their objective the aim of radicalising the industrial workers and taking an example from activities in Italy of the [[Red Brigades]] ({{lang|de|Brigate Rosse}}), many students went to work in the factories, but with little or no success. The most notorious of the underground groups was the [[Red Army Faction]] which began by making bank raids to finance their activities and eventually went underground having killed a number of policemen, several bystanders and eventually two prominent West Germans, whom they had taken captive in order to force the release of prisoners sympathetic to their ideas. In the 1990s attacks were still being committed under the name "RAF". The last action took place in 1993 and the group announced it was giving up its activities in 1998. Evidence that the groups had been infiltrated by German Intelligence undercover agents has since emerged, partly through the insistence of the son of one of their prominent victims, the State Counsel Buback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |title=RAF: Gefangen in der Geschichte |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508122346/http://www.zeit.de/2011/32/Buback-Tragoedie |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Willy Brandt===
{{main|Willy Brandt}}
In the 1969 election, the SPD—headed by [[Willy Brandt]]—gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP.<ref>Hélène Miard-Delacroixm ''Willy Brandt: Life of a Statesman'' (2016)</ref> Although Chancellor for only just over four years, Willy Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period. Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality. Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany's eastern neighbours, a policy opposed by the CDU. The issue of improving relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister, Walther Scheel (FDP) negotiated agreements with all three countries. (Moscow Agreement, August 1970, Warsaw Agreement, December 1970, Four Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany, signed in December 1972.)<ref>Informationen zur Politische Bildung Heft 258, p. 32</ref> These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led, in the long-term to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union's control over Eastern Europe. Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974, after [[Günter Guillaume]], a senior member of his staff, was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. Brandt's contributions to world peace led to his nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971.
==== The Chancellor of Domestic Reform ====
Although Brandt is perhaps best known for his achievements in foreign policy, his government oversaw the implementation of a broad range of social reforms, and was known as a "Kanzler der inneren Reformen" ('Chancellor of domestic reform').<ref name="Radice">Radice; Radice (1986). ''Socialists in the Recession: the Search for Solidarity''.</ref> According to the historian [[David Childs]], "Brandt was anxious that his government should be a reforming administration and a number of reforms were embarked upon".<ref name="Childs">Childs, David (1992). Germany in the Twentieth Century</ref> Within a few years, the education budget rose from 16 billion to 50 billion DM, while one out of every three DM spent by the new government was devoted to welfare purposes. As noted by the journalist and historian [[Marion Dönhoff]],

"People were seized by a completely new feeling about life. A mania for large scale reforms spread like wildfire, affecting schools, universities, the administration, family legislation. In the autumn of 1970 Jürgen Wischnewski of the SPD declared, 'Every week more than three plans for reform come up for decision in cabinet and in the Assembly.'"<ref name="Dönhoff">Dönhoff, Marion (1982).

===== Health =====
In the field of health care, various measures were introduced to improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief,<ref name="Dönhoff" /> while a contributory medical service for 23 million panel patients was introduced.<ref name="Dönhoff" /> Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution,<ref name="Prittie" /> while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out,<ref name="Radice" /> as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment.<ref name="Flora" /> The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the wage level (1970)<ref name="Flora" /> and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced.<ref name="spiegel.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42953833.html |title=DER SPIEGEL 16/1972 – Anders als zu Kaisers und zu Katzers Zeiten |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128182039/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42953833.html |archive-date=28 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued.<ref name="aei.pitt_a">{{cite web|title=Report on the Development of the Social Situation in the Community in 1971|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/9805/1/9805.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022540/http://aei.pitt.edu/9805/1/9805.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017|website=Aei.pitt.edu}}</ref> That same year, compulsory health insurance was extended to the self-employed.<ref>{{harvp|Tomka|2004|p=64}}</ref> In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhS8y2tRf6YC&pg=PA369|title=Psychotherapy in the Third Reich: The GÃ¶ring Institute|first=Geoffrey|last=Cocks|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Transaction Publishers|via=Google Books|isbn=9781412832366}}</ref>

Pupils, students and children in kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme,<ref name="Flora" /> which benefited 11 million children.<ref name="Dönhoff" /> Free medical checkups were introduced that same year,<ref name="hdg.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/DasGeteilteDeutschland/KontinuitaetUndWandel/SozialLiberaleKoalition/innereReformen.html |title=Innere Reformen |publisher=Hdg.de |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005900/http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/DasGeteilteDeutschland/KontinuitaetUndWandel/SozialLiberaleKoalition/innereReformen.html |archive-date=28 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> while the Farmers' Sickness Insurance Law (1972) introduced compulsory sickness insurance for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance.<ref name="Flora" /> Participation in employer's health insurance was extended to four million employees.<ref name="spiegel.de" /> A Development Law of December 1970 made it possible for all employees voluntarily to become members of the statutory sickness insurance. The level of income for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their sickness insurance from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of sickness insurance benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.<ref name="TheEvolution" />

The Hospital Financing Law (1972) secured the supply of hospitals and reduced the cost of hospital care, "defined the financing of hospital investment as a public responsibility, single states to issue plans for hospital development, and the federal government to bear the cost of hospital investment covered in the plans, rates for hospital care thus based on running costs alone, hospitals to ensure that public subsidies together with insurance fund payments for patients cover total costs".<ref name="Flora" /> The Benefit Improvement Law (1973) made entitlement to hospital care legally binding (entitlements already enjoyed in practice), abolished time limits for hospital care, introduced entitlement to household assistance under specific conditions, and also introduced entitlement to leave of absence from work and cash benefits in the event of a child's illness.<ref name="Flora" /> In 1971, to encourage the growth of registered family holiday centres, the Federal Government granted subsidies for the building and appointing of 28 of these centres at a total cost of 8 million DM.<ref name="aei.pitt_a" /> Free preliminary investigations were introduced for 2.5 million children up until the age of 4 for the early detection and correction of developmental disorders, and health research was expanded. Federal grants were increased, especially for the Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg, while a Federal Institute for Sport Science was set up, together with the Institute for Social Medicine and Epidemiology in Berlin. In addition, funding for new rehabilitation facilities was increased.<ref name="archive.org" />

===== Pensions =====
The Pension Reform Law (1972) guaranteed all retirees a minimum pension regardless of their contributions<ref name="willy-brandt.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.willy-brandt.org/bwbs_biografie/The_first_policy_statement_B403.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724201622/http://www.willy-brandt.org/bwbs_biografie/The_first_policy_statement_B403.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |title=August 1970: The first policy statement |publisher=Bundeskanzler-Willy-Brandt-Stiftung |date=28 October 1969 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings.<ref name="Flora" /> The 1972 pension reforms improved eligibility conditions and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population.<ref name="autogenerated6">Mares, Isabela (2006). ''Taxation, Wage Bargaining, and Unemployment''.</ref> The income replacement rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a "retirement window" ranging between 63 and 65 for employees who had worked for at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65.<ref>{{harvp|Silvia|Stolpe|2007}}</ref> The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the pension benefit fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum wage benefit.<ref>{{harvp|Williamson|Pampel|2002}}</ref> According to one study, the 1972 pension reform "enhanced" the reduction of poverty in old age.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/hellenicObservatory/pdf/pensions_conference/Hinrichs.pdf |title=The Politics of Pension Reform in Germany |publisher=London School of Economics |accessdate=17 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407083756/http://www.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/research/hellenicObservatory/pdf/pensions_conference/Hinrichs.pdf |archive-date=7 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Voluntary retirement at 63 with no deductions in the level of benefits was introduced,<ref name="autogenerated6" /> together with the index-linking of war victim's pensions to wage increases.<ref name="Radice" /> Guaranteed minimum pension benefits for all West Germans were introduced,<ref name="socsci" /> along with automatic pension increases for war widows (1970).<ref name="hdg.de" /> Fixed minimum rates for women in receipt of very low pensions were also introduced, together with equal treatment for war widows.<ref name="MyLife">Brandt, Willy (1992).

===== Education =====
In education, the Brandt Administration sought to widen educational opportunities for all West Germans. The government presided over an increase in the number of teachers,<ref name="Dönhoff" /> generous public stipends were introduced for students to cover their living costs,<ref name="Sinn" /> and West German universities were converted from elite schools into mass institutions.<ref name="Sinn" /> The school leaving age was raised to 16,<ref name="Lane">{{harvp|Lane|1985}}</ref> and spending on research and education was increased by nearly 300% between 1970 and 1974.<ref name="Lane" /> Working through a planning committee set up for the "joint task" of university development, the Federal Government started to make investment costs in 1971.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4W0vBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA240|title=State & Government in the Federal Republic of Germany: The Executive at Work|first=N.|last=Johnson|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Elsevier|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483293011}}</ref> Fees for higher or further education were abolished,<ref name="Radice" /> while a considerable increase in the number of higher education institutions took place.<ref name="Radice" /> A much needed school and college construction program was carried out,<ref name="Radice" /> together with the introduction of postgraduate support for highly qualified graduates, providing them with the opportunity to earn their doctorates or undertake research studies.<ref name="Winkler_Sager">{{harvp|Winkler|2007}}</ref> A law on individual promotion of vocational training came into force in October 1971, which provided for financial grants for attendance at further general or technical teaching establishments from the second year of studies at higher technical schools, academies and higher education establishments, training centres of second degree, or certain courses of television teaching. Grants were also made in certain cases for attendance at training centres located outside the Federal Republic.<ref name="aei.pitt_a" />
[[File:2010-06-05-lueneburg-by-RalfR-02.jpg|thumb|A school in [[Lüneburg]] with an extension built in the 1970s]]
The education budget was doubled from 3% to 6%, while an expansion of secondary education took place. The number of university students went up from 100,000 to 650,000, 30,000 more places were created in the schools, and an additional 1,000 million marks was allocated for new school buildings. In addition, the provision of scholarships was expanded, with the 1970 programme providing for, in the words of one observer, "5,000 new scholarships for graduates, and double that number were being awarded three years later".<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Grants were introduced for pupils from lower income groups to stay on at school, together with grants for those going into any kind of higher or further education.<ref name="Winkler_Sager" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gew.de/Binaries/Binary37514/GEW_fzs_UN_Opinion.pdf|title=404 : GEW – Die Bildungsgewerkschaft|author=GEW – Die Bildungsgewerkschaft|date=10 June 2015|work=gew.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805140952/http://www.gew.de/Binaries/Binary37514/GEW_fzs_UN_Opinion.pdf|archivedate=5 August 2013}}</ref> Increases were also made in educational allowances,<ref name="Flora" /> as well as spending on science.<ref name="Wilsford" /> In 1972, the government allocated 2.1 million DM in grants to promote marriage and family education.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> Under the Approbationsordnung (medical education profession act) of 1970, the subject of psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy at German universities became a compulsory subject for medical students,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Köllner |first= V. |title= [Education in Psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy in the German Federal Republic] |journal= Ther Umsch |volume= 52 |issue= 2 |pages= 118–122 |language= German |pmid= 7892672 |date= February 1995}}</ref> and that same year education of clinical and biomedical engineers was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIeQhdrW2VMC&pg=PA67|title=Clinical Engineering Handbook|first=Joseph F.|last=Dyro|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Academic Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780122265709}}</ref> The Brandt Administration also introduced enabling legislation for the introduction of comprehensives, but left it to the Lander "to introduce them at their discretion". While the more left-wing Lander "rapidly began to do so", other Lander found "all sorts of pretexts for delaying the scheme". By the mid-1980s, Berlin had 25 comprehensives while Bavaria only had 1, and in most Lander comprehensives were still viewed as "merely experimental".<ref>{{harvp|Ardagh|1996}}</ref>

===== Housing =====
In the field of housing, various measures were carried out to benefit householders, such as in improving the rights of tenants and increasing rental assistance. According to the Rent Subsidies Act (Wohngeldgesetz) of 1970, "low-income tenants and owners of accommodations are supported with rents and burdens subsidies".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEhDAQAAIAAJ&q=1970|title=Social security, how it works in the Federal Republic of Germany|first=Rolf|last=Neuhaus|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung|via=Google Books}}</ref> The determination of the income of families taken into consideration for housing allowances was simplified,<ref name="aei.pitt.edu">{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/32294/ |title=Expose sur l'evolution de la situation sociale dans le Communaute en 1970 (joint au Quatrieme rapport general sur l'activite des Communautes) = Report on the development of the social situation in the Community in 1970 (annex to the Fourth general report on the activities of the Community).

In addition, the income limits for eligibility for social housing were raised and adapted in order of general income trends.<ref name="archive.org" />

A loose form of rent regulation was introduced under the name of "Vergleichmieten" ('comparable rents'),<ref>{{harvp|Power|2002}}</ref> together with the provision of "for family-friendly housing" freight or rent subsidies to owners of apartments or houses whose ceiling had been adapted to increased expenses or incomes (1970).<ref name="digam.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.digam.net/dokument.php?ID=9019&PHPSESSID=23da32f4275c4cbefc5d9395393ba4cf |archive-url=http://langzeitarchivierung.bib-bvb.de/wayback/20140527191818/http%3A//www.digam.net/dokument.php?ID%3D9019 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 May 2014 |title=Digitales Archiv Marburg – Das DigAM Projekt |publisher=Digam.net |date=28 October 1969 |accessdate=14 November 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In addition, a law for the creation of property for workers was passed, under which a married worker would normally keep up to 95% of his pay, and graded tax remission for married wage-earners applied up to a wage of 48,000 marks, which indicated the economic prosperity of West Germany at that time.<ref name="Prittie" /> The Town Planning Act (1971) encouraged the preservation of historical heritage and helped open up the way to the future of many German cities,<ref name="MyLife" /> while the Urban Renewal Act (1971) helped the states to restore their inner cities and to develop new neighbourhoods.<ref>{{harvp|Kommers|1997|p=93}}</ref> In addition, Guidelines of December 1972 on the usage of federal funds in assisting social housing construction laid down that a certain standard needed to be observed when building homes for severely handicapped persons.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/36404/1/A2595.pdf |title=Comparative study on the Rehabilitation of Handicapped Persons in the Countries of the Community |website=Aei.pitt.edu |accessdate=17 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194423/http://aei.pitt.edu/36404/1/A2595.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Second Housing Allowance Law of December 1970 simplified the administration of housing allowances and extended entitlements, increased the income limit to 9,600 DM per year plus 2,400 DM for each family member, raised the general deduction on income to determine reckonable income from 15% to 20%, allowance rates listed in tables replacing complicated calculation procedure based on "bearable rent burdens".<ref name="Flora" /> The Housing Construction Modification Law (1971) increased the income-limit for access to low rent apartments under the social housing programme from 9,000 DM to 12,000 DM per annum plus 3,000 DM (instead of 2,400) for each family member. The law also introduced special subsidies to reduce the debt burden for builders not surpassing the regular income-limit by more than 40%. Under a 1973 law, the limits were increased to 1,000 DM plus 9,000 DM and 4,200 DM for additional family members.<ref name="Flora" /> The Rent Improvement Law (1971) strengthened the position of tenants. Under this legislation, notice was to be ruled illegal "where appropriate substitute accommodation not available; landlords obliged to specify reasons for notice",<ref name="Flora" /> whilst the Eviction Protection Law (1971) established tenant protection against rent rises and notice. The notice was only lawful if in the "justified interest of the landlord". Under this law, higher rents were not recognised as "justified interest".<ref name="Flora" /> The Second Eviction Protection Law (1972) made the tenant protection introduced under the Eviction Protection Law of 1971 permanent. Under this new law, the notice was only lawful where the landlord proved justified personal interest in the apartment. In addition, rent increases were only lawful if not above normal comparable rents in the same area.<ref name="Flora" />

Directives on the housing of foreign workers came into force in April 1971. These directives imposed certain requirements for space, hygiene, safety, and amenities in the accommodation offered by employers. That same year, the Federal Government granted a sum of 17 million DM to the Länder for the improvement and modernization of housing built before 21 June 1948.<ref name="aei.pitt_a" /> In addition, according to a 1971 regulation of the Board of the Federal Labour Office, "construction of workers' hostels qualified for government financial support under certain conditions".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdRx7qLF8KIC&pg=PA58|title=Muslims in the West: From Sojourners to Citizens|first=Yvonne Yazbeck|last=Haddad|date=11 April 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780198033752}}</ref> The "German Council for town development", which was set up by virtue of Article 89 of a law to foster urban building, was partly aimed at planning a favourable environment for families (such as the provision of playgrounds). In 1971, the Federal Labour Office made available DM 425 million in the form of loans to provide 157 293 beds in 2 494 hostels. A year later, the Federal Government (Bund), the Lander and the Federal Labour Office promoted the construction of dwellings for migrant workers. They set aside 10 million DM for this purpose, which allowed the financing of 1650 family dwellings that year.<ref name="aei.pitt" />

Development measures were begun in 1972 with federal financial aid granted to the Lander for improvement measures relating to towns and villages, and in the 1972 budget, DM 50 million was earmarked, i.e. a third of the total cost of some 300 schemes. A council for urban development was formed in May 1972 with the purpose of promoting future work and measures in the field of urban renovation.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> In 1973, the government provided assistance of DM 28 million for the modernisation of old dwellings.<ref name="aei.pitt_b" /> New rules were introduced regarding improvements in the law relating to rented property, and control of the rise in rents and protection against cancellation of leases also safeguarded the rights of migrant workers in the sphere of housing.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> A law of July 1973 fixed the fundamental and minimum requirements regarding workers' dwellings, mainly concerning space, ventilation and lighting, protection against damp, heat and noise, power and heating facilities and sanitary installations.<ref name="aei.pitt_b" />

===== Civil rights and animal protection =====
In regards to civil rights, the Brandt Administration introduced a broad range of socially liberal reforms aimed at making West Germany a more open society.

Legislation aimed at safeguarding consumers was also implemented under the Brandt Administration. The consumer's right of withdrawal in case of hire purchase was strengthened in March 1974,<ref name="sophienschule.de" /> and fixed prices for branded products were abolished by law in January that same year, which meant that manufacturers' recommended prices were not binding for retailers.<ref name="sophienschule.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.sophienschule.de/comenius/timeline/index_files/Ger74economy.htm |title=Germany'74 – Economy |publisher=Sophienschule.de |date=20 December 1974 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212819/http://www.sophienschule.de/comenius/timeline/index_files/Ger74economy.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, a progressive anticartel law was passed.<ref name="Binder" /> A 1969 law on explosive materials was supplemented by two orders; the first (made in November 1969) establishing a committee of experts for explosive materials, while the second order (made the following month) included details for the implementation of the law on explosive materials.

A law on explosives (Sprengstoffgesetz) was the subject of two application ordinances (on 17 November 1970 and 24 August 1971) and a general regulatory provision (19 May 1971), which covered respectively the application of the law to nationals of EC Member States, the duty of employers to notify in time the inspection authorities of detonation plans, the interpretation of the purpose and field of application of the law, authorizations for transport of explosives, and control and recognition of training courses on work with explosives.<ref name="aei.pitt_a" /> Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for Protection against Aircraft Noise of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air-traffic-system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called "Lärmschutzzonen" (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet air craft, and the law also authorised the Federal Department of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the "Bundesrat", the representation of the German Federal States.<ref>{{cite web|author=Theodor M.

===== Workers' rights =====
In terms of working conditions, a number of reforms were introduced aimed at strengthening the rights of workers both at home and in the workplace. The Sickness Act of 1970 provided equal treatment of workers and employees in the event of incapacity for work,<ref name="bpb.de"/> while maternity leave was increased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digam.net/dokument0625.html?ID=9020|title=Digitales Archiv Marburg – Das DigAM Projekt|work=digam.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006121730/http://digam.net/dokument0625.html?ID=9020|archivedate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Legislation was introduced in 1970 which ensured continued payment of wages for workers disabled by illness.<ref name="willy-brandt.org"/> In 1970 all employees unit for work (with the exception of women in receipt of maternity benefits and temporarily and inconsiderably employed persons) were provided with an unconditional legal claim against their employer to continued payment of their gross wage for a period of 6 weeks, as also in the case of spa treatment approved by an Insurance Fund, the Fund bearing the full cost thereof. Previously, payment of employer's supplement and sick pay were only made from the day on which the doctor certified unfitness for work.<ref name="Surveyof" /> In 1972, an Act on Agency Work was passed which sought to prevent works agencies from providing job placement services and aimed to provide job minimum protection for employees in agency work.<ref>{{harvp|Schiek|2006}}</ref> A law on the hiring out of manpower, passed in October 1972, contained provisions to stipulate prior authorization for the hiring out of manpower, to draw a distinction between the system governing workers hired out and the placing of workers, to regulate and improve the rights of hired out workers pertaining to working conditions and social insurance, and provide for more severe penalties and fines to be imposed on offenders.<ref name="aei.pitt" />

Improvements were also made in income and work conditions for home workers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=907 |title=GHDI – Document |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |date=24 September 1973 |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814074840/http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=907 |archive-date=14 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> accident insurance was extended to non-working adults,<ref name="socsci" /> and the Border Zone Assistance Act (1971) increased levels of assistance to the declining zonal peripheral area.<ref>{{harvp|Scheffer|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=H8bOCZReMTMC&pg=PA555 555–556]}}</ref> The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniknet.de/daly_de.0.html?year=1973&month=12 |title=Dezember 1973 – Regierung Uruguay Parteien Zeitungen "El Popular" "Cronica" Verband – chroniknet – Schlagzeilen, Ereignisse, Fotos mit Geschichte, Community |publisher=Chroniknet.de |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225953/http://www.chroniknet.de/daly_de.0.html?year=1973&month=12 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90&nbsp;dB( A) may be exceeded at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal noise protection devices.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> A matching fund program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.<ref name="Binder"/>

A ministerial order of January 1970 extended protection in cases of partial unemployment to home workers, while an ordinance of August 1970 fixed the conditions of health necessary for service in the merchant navy. A general provision of October 1970 determined in detail the circumstances in which the competent authority must take action on the basis of the act on the technical means of work. The requirement also stipulated the extent to which the technical standards established by national and international organisations can be regarded as "rules of the art".<ref name="aei.pitt.edu"/> In a directive of 10 November 1970, the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs recommended to the higher authorities for work protection of the "Lander" to bring in the directive published, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour, by the German Engineers' Association on the evaluation of work station noise in relation to loss of hearing, in order to improve safeguards for workers against the noises in question. In September 1971, an ordinance was published concerning dangerous working materials; safeguarding persons using these materials against the dangers involved. In August 1971, a law came into force directed at reducing atmospheric pollution from lead compounds in four-stroke engine fuels. As a safeguard against radiation, a decree on the system of authorisations for medicaments treated with ionizing radiation or containing radioactive substances, in its version of 8 August 1967, was remodelled by a new Decree of 10 May 1971 which added some radionuclides to the list of medicaments which doctors in private practice were authorized to use.

By a decree of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its designated tasks included the promotion of industrial protection, accident prevention on the journey to and from work and accident prevention in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research. A regulation was issued in 1972 which permitted for the first time the employment of women as drivers of trams, omnibuses and lorries, while further regulations laid down new provisions for lifts and work with compressed air.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> The Factory Constitution Law (1971) strengthened the rights of individual employees "to be informed and to be heard on matters concerning their place of work". The Works Council was provided with greater authority while trade unions were given the right of entry into the factory "provided they informed the employer of their intention to do so",<ref name="Childs"/> while a law was passed to encourage wider share ownership by workers and other rank-and-file employees.<ref name="Childs"/> The Industrial Relations Law (1972) and the Personnel Representation Act (1974) broadened the rights of employees in matters which immediately affected their places of work, while also improving the possibilities for codetermination on operations committees, together with access of trade unions to companies.<ref name="willy-brandt.org"/>

The Works Constitution Act of 1972 required in cases of collective dismissal at an establishment normally employing more than twenty employees that management and the works council must negotiate a social plan that stipulates compensation for workers who lose their jobs. In cases where the two parties could not agree on a social plan, the law provided for binding arbitration.<ref>{{harvp|Abraham|Houseman|1994}}</ref> In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights on issues such as working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and short-time work.<ref>{{harvp|Thelen|1991|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=BokmF9j1hx0C&pg=PA100 100]}}</ref> Legislation was passed which acknowledged for the first time the presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils.<ref name="autogenerated8">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/MXQU1P,0,0,Informationen_zur_politischen |title=IZPB &#124; bpb |language=de |publisher=Bpb.de |accessdate=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131074330/http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/MXQU1P,0,0,Informationen_zur_politischen |archive-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A law of January 1972 on the organization of labour in enterprises significantly extended the works council's right of cooperation and co-management in the matter of vocational training. That same year, the Safety Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany was transformed into a public Federal Agency (Bundesanstalt) with significantly enlarged powers, in the context of which special emphasis would be placed on its new task of promoting and coordinating research in the area of accident prevention.<ref name="aei.pitt" /> New provisions were introduced for the rehabilitation of severely disabled people ("Schwerbehinderte") and accident victims.<ref name="MyLife" /> The Severely Disabled Persons Act of April 1974 obliged all employers with more than fifteen employees to ensure that 6% of their workforce consisted of people officially recognised as being severely handicapped. Employers who failed to do so were assessed 100 DM per month for every job falling before the required quota. These compensatory payments were used to "subsidise the adaptation of workplaces to the requirements of those who were severely handicapped".<ref name="Walker"/>

A law passed in January 1974, designed to protect members of the supervisory boards of companies who are undergoing training, was aimed at ensuring that the representatives of young workers and youthful members of works councils still undergoing training could perform their duties with greater independence and without fear of disadvantageous consequences for their future careers. On request, workers' representatives on completion of their training courses had to have an employment relationship of unlimited duration.<ref name="aei.pitt_c" /> In the field of transport, the Municipal Transportation Finance Law of 1971 established federal guidelines for subsidies to municipal governments,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr38/f10_uts.html|title=When will Japan Choose Light Rail Transit?|work=jrtr.net|access-date=13 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052336/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr38/f10_uts.html|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> while the Federal Transport Plan of 1973 provided a framework for all transport, including public transport.<ref>{{harvp|Banister|2002}}</ref> In addition, the Severely Handicapped Persons Act of April 1974 extended the welfare and promotional obligations of the employer, and provided a right to extra holiday consisting of six working days.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===== Environmental protection =====
A federal environmental programme was established in 1971,<ref>{{harvp|Schäfers|1998}}</ref> and in 1972 laws were passed to regulate garbage elimination and air pollution via emission.{{sfnp|Glatzer|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWtQkfScAEC&pg=PA230 230]}} Matching grants covering 90% of infrastructure development were allocated to local communities, which led to a dramatic increase in the number of public swimming pools and other facilities of consumptive infrastructure throughout West Germany.<ref name="Sinn" /> In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways.<ref name="Binder" /> In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q83kxhOsgxYC&pg=PA140|title=Industry and Politics in West Germany: Toward the Third Republic|first=Peter J.|last=Katzenstein|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Cornell University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=0801495954}}</ref> and in 1972 DDT was banned.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UksBuLkuKsC&pg=PA131|title=Nature Of The Miracle Years: Conservation in West Germany, 1945–1975|first=Sandra|last=Chaney|date=15 July 2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9780857458414}}</ref> The Federal Immissions Control Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.<ref>Federal Republic of Germany: Spatial Development and Problems by Peter Schöller, Willi Walter Puls, and Hanns Jürgen Buchholz</ref>

===== Economy =====
Under the Brandt Administration, West Germany attained a lower rate of inflation than in other industrialised countries at that time,<ref name="Prittie"/> while a rise in the standard of living took place, helped by the floating and revaluation of the mark.<ref name="Prittie"/> This was characterised by the real incomes of employees increasing more sharply than incomes from entrepreneurial work, with the proportion of employees' incomes in the overall national income rising from 65% to 70% between 1969 and 1973, while the proportion of income from entrepreneurial work and property fell over that same period from just under 35% to 30%.<ref name="autogenerated7"/> In addition, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty (based on various definitions) fell between 1969 and 1973.<ref name="Flora"/><!--&pg=PA54(?)--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/germany/|title=Germany – Chartbook of Economic Inequality|website=Chartbookofeconomicinequality.com\accessdate=2017-04-17|access-date=13 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206223338/https://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/germany/|archive-date=6 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> According to one estimate, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty fell from 9.7% to 8.9% between 1969 and 1973, and from 20.2% to 14.0% according to another estimate.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvKFDAAAQBAJ&q=poverty%20germany%201969-1973&pg=PA95|title=Cities in Transition: New Challenges, New Responsibilities|first1=B.|last1=Blanke|first2=R.|last2=Smith|date=18 August 1999|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|isbn=9780333982273}}</ref> According to another estimate, the percentage of West Germans living in poverty during this period fell from 2.7% to 1.4%.{{sfnp|Glatzer|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWtQkfScAEC&pg=PA209 209]}}

===Helmut Schmidt===
Finance Minister [[Helmut Schmidt]] (SPD) formed a coalition and he served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], a leading FDP official, became Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the European Community (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Max Otte |author2=Jürgen Greve |year=2000 |title=A rising middle power?: German foreign policy in transformation, 1989–1999 }}</ref> Mounting external problems forced Schmidt to concentrate on foreign policy and limited the domestic reforms that he could carry out.  The USSR upgraded its intermediate-range missiles, which Schmidt complained was an unacceptable threat to the balance of nuclear power, because it increased the likelihood of political coercion and required a western response.  NATO respond in the form of its twin-track policy.  The domestic reverberations were serious inside the SDP, and undermined its coalition with the FDP.<ref>Frank Fischer,  "Von Der 'Regierung Der Inneren Reformen' zum 'Krisenmanagement': Das Verhältnis Zwischen Innen- und Aussenpolitik in der Sozial-Liberalen Ära 1969–1982".

''Political Studies'' 36.3 (1988): 397–412.</ref>

===Helmut Kohl===
In October 1982 the SPD–FDP coalition fell apart when the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, due to the entry into the Bundestag of the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]], who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987 the Kohl–Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. Kohl's CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, slipped from 48.8% of the vote in 1983 to 44.3%. The SPD fell to 37%; long-time SPD Chairman Brandt subsequently resigned in April 1987 and was succeeded by [[Hans-Jochen Vogel]]. The FDP's share rose from 7% to 9.1%, its best showing since 1980. The Greens' share rose to 8.3% from their 1983 share of 5.6%.

===Reunification===
{{Main|German reunification}}

With the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communism]] in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, symbolised by the opening of the [[Berlin Wall]], there was a rapid move towards [[German reunification]]; and [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|a final settlement of the post-war special status of Germany]]. Following democratic elections, East Germany declared its accession to the Federal Republic subject to the terms of the Unification Treaty between the two states; and then both West Germany and East Germany radically amended their respective constitutions in accordance with that Treaty's provisions. East Germany then dissolved itself, and its five post-war states ({{lang|de|Länder}}) were reconstituted, along with the reunited Berlin which ended its special status and formed an additional {{lang|de|Land}}. They formally joined the Federal Republic on 3 October 1990, raising the number of states from 10 to 16, ending the division of Germany. The expanded Federal Republic retained West Germany's political culture and continued its existing memberships in international organisations, as well as its Western foreign policy alignment and affiliation to Western alliances like NATO and the European Union.

The official German reunification ceremony on 3 October 1990 was held at the [[Reichstag building|{{lang|de|Reichstag|nocat=y}} building]], including [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (since 1949)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]], [[President of Germany|President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] and many others. One day later, the parliament of the united Germany would assemble in an act of symbolism in the Reichstag building.

However, at that time, the role of Berlin had not yet been decided upon. Only after a fierce debate, considered by many as one of the most memorable sessions of [[parliament]], the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}} concluded on 20 June 1991, with quite a slim majority, that both government and parliament should move to [[Berlin]] from [[Bonn]].

==Economic miracle==
The West German {{lang|de|[[Wirtschaftswunder]]}} ("economic miracle", coined by ''[[The Times]]'') began in 1950. This improvement was sustained by the currency reform of 1948 which replaced the {{lang|de|[[Reichsmark]]}} with the {{lang|de|[[Deutsche Mark]]}} and halted rampant inflation. The Allied dismantling of the West German coal and steel industry finally ended in 1950.

As demand for consumer goods increased after World War II, the resulting shortage helped overcome lingering resistance to the purchase of German products. At the time Germany had a large pool of skilled and cheap labour, partly as a result of the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe, which affected up to 16.5 million Germans. This helped Germany to more than double the value of its exports during the war. Apart from these factors, hard work and long hours at full capacity among the population and in the late 1950s and 1960s extra labour supplied by thousands of {{lang|de|[[Gastarbeiter]]}} ("guest workers") provided a vital base for the economic upturn. This would have implications later on for successive German governments as they tried to assimilate this group of workers.<ref>[[David H Childs]] and Jeffrey Johnson, West Germany: Politics And Society, Croom Helm, 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519121934/https://books.google.com/books?id=PJUOAAAAQAAJ&dq=West+Germany+-+politics+and+society&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=Ga1ab-mhef&sig=SQ_14UMa9GfjbECQA7pXF0RSe_Y&hl=en&ei=eO7uSouhMof6-Abkt8juCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=19 May 2016 }}</ref>

With the dropping of Allied reparations, the freeing of German intellectual property and the impact of the [[Marshall Plan]] stimulus, West Germany developed one of the strongest economies in the world, almost as strong as before the Second World War. The East German economy showed a certain growth, but not as much as in West Germany, partly because of continued reparations to the USSR.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The fading miracle : four decades of market economy in Germany |last=Giersch |first=Herbert |date=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-35351-3 |location=Cambridge [England] |oclc=24065456}}</ref>

In 1952, West Germany became part of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which would later evolve into the [[European Union]]. On 5 May 1955 West Germany was declared to have the "authority of a sovereign state".<ref name="Sovereignty" group="lower-alpha"/> The [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[Military of France|French]] and [[Military of the United States|U.S. militaries]] remained in the country, just as the [[Red Army|Soviet Army]] remained in East Germany. Four days after obtaining the "authority of a sovereign state" in 1955, West Germany joined NATO. The UK and the USA retained an especially strong presence in West Germany, acting as a deterrent in case of a Soviet invasion. In 1976 West Germany became one of the founding nations of the [[G8|Group of Six]] (G6). In 1973, West Germany—home to roughly 1.26% of the world's population—featured the world's [[list of regions by past GDP (PPP)|fourth largest GDP]] of 944 billion (5.9% of the world total). In 1987 the FRG held a 7.4% share of total world production.

==Position towards East Germany==
{{See also|German reunification}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F031406-0017, Erfurt, Treffen Willy Brandt mit Willi Stoph.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Brandt]] and [[Willi Stoph]] in [[Erfurt]], 1970, the first time a Chancellor met a GDR prime minister]]

The official position of West Germany concerning East Germany at the outset was that the West German government was the only democratically elected, and therefore the only legitimate, representative of the German people. According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], any country (with the exception of the USSR) that recognised the authorities of the [[German Democratic Republic]] would not have diplomatic relations with West Germany.

In the early 1970s, Willy Brandt's policy of "{{lang|de|Neue [[Ostpolitik]]}}" led to a form of mutual recognition between East and West Germany. The [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) helped to normalise relations between East and West Germany and led to both German states joining the [[United Nations]]. The Hallstein Doctrine was relinquished, and West Germany ceased to claim an [[exclusive mandate]] for Germany as a whole.

Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognise the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; while at the same time acknowledging that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.  By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant "Germany as whole".<ref>{{citation|first=Peter E |last=Quint|title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |year=1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press|page= 14}}</ref> The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].

This assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;{{sfnp|Kommers|2012|p=308}}
: "... the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany. Such recognition has not only never been formally pronounced by the Federal Republic of Germany but on the contrary repeatedly explicitly rejected. If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its détente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic."<ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The West German Constitution ({{lang|de|Grundgesetz}}, "Basic Law") provided two articles for the unification with other parts of Germany:

* Article 23 provided the possibility for other parts of Germany to join the Federal Republic (under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany).
* Article 146 provided the possibility for unification of all parts of Germany under a new constitution.

After the peaceful revolution of 1989 in East Germany, the Volkskammer of the GDR on 23 August 1990 declared the accession of East Germany to the Federal Republic under Article 23 of the Basic Law; and so initiated the process of reunification, to come into effect on 3 October 1990. Nevertheless, the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms and conditions; including fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former GDR and the Federal Republic now recognising each another as separate sovereign states in international law.{{sfnp|Kommers|2012|p=309}} This treaty was then voted into effect on 20 September 1990 by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR and the re-establishment of {{lang|de|[[New states of Germany|Länder]]}} on the territory of East Germany; and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic. Amongst these amendments was the repeal of the very Article 23 in respect of which the GDR had nominally declared its postdated accession to the Federal Republic.

The two German states entered into a [[monetary union|currency]] and [[customs union]] in July 1990, and on 3 October 1990, the [[German Democratic Republic]] dissolved and the re-established [[New states of Germany|five East German {{lang|de|Länder|nocat=y}}]] (as well as a unified Berlin) joined the Federal Republic of Germany, bringing an end to the East–West divide.

==Politics==
Political life in West Germany was remarkably stable and orderly. The [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] era (1949–63) was followed by a brief period under [[Ludwig Erhard]] (1963–66) who, in turn, was replaced by [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] (1966–69). All governments between 1949 and 1966 were formed by the united caucus of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian-Democratic Union]] (CDU) and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), either alone or in coalition with the smaller [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) or other right-wing parties.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F038505-0006, Bonn, Amtsantritt Kabinett Brandt bei Heinemann.jpg|thumb|upright|The Brandt cabinet of 1969 on the steps of President Heinemanns's residence in Bonn, the [[Villa Hammerschmidt]] ]]
Kiesinger's 1966–69 "Grand Coalition" was between West Germany's two largest parties, the CDU/CSU and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). This was important for the introduction of new emergency acts—the Grand Coalition gave the ruling parties the two-thirds majority of votes required to see them in. These controversial acts allowed basic constitutional rights such as freedom of movement to be limited in case of a [[state of emergency]].

Leading up to the passing of the laws, there was fierce opposition to them, above all by the FDP, the rising [[German student movement]], a group calling itself {{lang|de|[[Notstand der Demokratie]]}} ("Democracy in a State of Emergency") and the [[trade union|labour unions]]. Demonstrations and protests grew in number, and in 1967 the student [[Benno Ohnesorg]] was shot in the head by a policeman. The press, especially the [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] {{lang|de|[[Bild-Zeitung]]}} newspaper, launched a campaign against the protesters.

By 1968 a stronger desire to confront the [[Nazism|Nazi]] past had come into being. In the 1970s [[environmentalism]] and anti-nationalism became fundamental values among left-wing Germans. As a result, in 1979 [[Alliance '90/The Greens|the Greens]] were able to reach the 5% minimum required to obtain parliamentary seats in the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]] state election, and with the foundation of the national party in 1980 developed into one of the most politically successful green movements in the world.

Another result of the unrest in the 1960s was the founding of the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF). The RAF was active from 1968, carrying out a succession of terrorist attacks in West Germany during the 1970s. Even in the 1990s, attacks were still being committed under the name ''RAF''. The last action took place in 1993, and in 1998 the group announced it was ceasing activities.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F074398-0021 Kohl (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helmut Kohl]] in 1987]]
In the 1969 election, the SPD gained enough votes to form a coalition government with the FDP. SPD leader and Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] remained head of government until May 1974, when he resigned after the [[Guillaume Affair]], in which a senior member of his staff was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service, the {{lang|de|[[Stasi]]}}. However the affair is widely considered to have been merely a trigger for Brandt's resignation, not a fundamental cause. Instead, Brandt, dogged by scandal relating to alcohol and depression<ref>[http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html Talk by Hans-Jochen Vogel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901014759/http://www.bwbs.de/Beitraege/130.html |date=1 September 2009 }} on 21 October 2002</ref><ref>Gregor Schöllgen: ''Willy Brandt. Die Biographie.'' Propyläen, Berlin 2001. {{ISBN|3-549-07142-6}}</ref> as well as the economic fallout of the [[1973 oil crisis]], almost seems simply to have had enough. As Brandt himself later said, "I was exhausted, for reasons which had nothing to do with the process going on at the time".<ref>quoted in: Gregor Schöllgen. [http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all ''Der Kanzler und sein Spion.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113174538/http://www.zeit.de/2003/40/P-Schreiber?page=all |date=13 January 2009 }} In: ''[[Die Zeit]]'' 2003, Vol. 40, 25 September 2003</ref>

Finance Minister Helmut Schmidt (SPD) then formed a government, continuing the SPD–FDP coalition. He served as Chancellor from 1974 to 1982. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a leading FDP official, was Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister in the same years. Schmidt, a strong supporter of the [[European Community]] (EC) and the Atlantic alliance, emphasized his commitment to "the political unification of Europe in partnership with the USA".

The goals of SPD and FDP however drifted apart in the late 1970s and early 1980s. On 1 October 1982 the FDP joined forces with the CDU/CSU to elect CDU Chairman [[Helmut Kohl]] as Chancellor in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. Following national elections in March 1983, Kohl emerged in firm control of both the government and the CDU. The CDU/CSU fell just short of an absolute majority, because of the entry into the Bundestag of the Greens, who received 5.6% of the vote.

In January 1987 the Kohl–Genscher government was returned to office, but the FDP and the Greens gained at the expense of the larger parties. The Social Democrats concluded that not only were the Greens unlikely to form a coalition, but also that such a coalition would be far from a majority. Neither condition changed until 1998.

===Denazification===
{{See also|Denazification|List of companies involved in the Holocaust}}
In 1951 several laws were passed, ending the denazification. As a result, many people with a former Nazi past ended up again in the political apparatus of West Germany. West German President [[Walter Scheel]] and Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] were both former members of the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1957, 77% of the [[Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection|West German Ministry of Justice]]'s senior officials were former Nazi Party members.<ref>{{cite news |title=Germany's post-war justice ministry was infested with Nazis protecting former comrades, study reveals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 October 2016 |access-date=23 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190123223605/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/10/germanys-post-war-justice-ministry-was-infested-with-nazis-prote/ |archive-date=23 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Konrad Adenauer's State Secretary [[Hans Globke]] had played a major role in drafting anti-semitic [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] in Nazi Germany.<ref>Tetens, T.H.

==Culture==
In many aspects, German culture continued in spite of the dictatorship and wartime. Old and new forms coexisted next to each other, and the American influence, already strong in the 1920s, grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Sport===
[[File:Stamp football WC 1974 deutsche bundespost.jpg|thumb|Postage stamps commemorating the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] held in West Germany]]

In the 20th century, [[association football]] became the largest sport in Germany. The [[Germany national football team]], established in 1900, continued its tradition based in the Federal Republic of Germany, winning the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] in a stunning upset dubbed the [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|miracle of Bern]]. Earlier, the German team was not considered part of the international top. The [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] was held in West German cities and West Berlin. After having been beaten by their East German counterparts in the first round, the team of the [[German Football Association]] won the cup again, defeating the [[Netherlands]] 2–1 in the final. With the process of unification in full swing in the summer of 1990, the Germans won a third World Cup, with players that had been capped for East Germany not yet permitted to contribute. European championships have been won too, in 1972, 1980 and 1996.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After both [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games of 1936]] had been held in Germany, [[Munich]] was selected to host the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. These were also the first summer games in which the East Germans showed up with the separate flag and anthem of the GDR. Since the 1950s, [[Germany at the Olympics]] had been represented by a united team led by the pre-war German NOC officials as the IOC had denied East German demands for a separate team.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The 800-page ''"Doping in Germany from 1950 to today"'' study details how the West German government helped fund a wide-scale [[Doping in sport|doping]] programme.<ref>{{cite news |title=Report: West Germany systematically doped athletes |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2013/08/03/report-west-germany-systematically-doped-athletes-olympics/2615323/ |work=USA Today |date=3 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Study Says West Germany Engaged in Sports Doping |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/sports/west-germany-engaged-in-sports-doping-in-1970s-study-says.html |work=The New York Times |date=8 August 2013}}</ref> West Germany encouraged and covered up a culture of doping across many sports for decades.<ref>{{cite news |title=Report exposes decades of West German doping |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20130805-doping-rife-among-west-german-athletes-decades-says-report |work=France 24 |date=5 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=West Germany cultivated doping culture among athletes: report |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/west-germany-cultivated-doping-culture-among-athletes-report-1.1363590 |work=CBC News |date=5 August 2013}}</ref>

As in 1957, when the Saarland acceded, East German sport organisations ceased to exist in late 1990 as their subdivisions and their members joined their Western counterparts. Thus, the present German organisations and teams in football, Olympics and elsewhere are identical to those that had been informally called "West German" before 1991. The only differences were a larger membership and a different name used by some foreigners. These organisations and teams in turn mostly continued the traditions of those that represented Germany before the Second World War, and even the First World War, thus providing a century-old continuity despite political changes. On the other hand, the separate East German teams and organisations were founded in the 1950s; they were an episode lasting less than four decades, yet quite successful in that time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As of 2012, West Germany have played a record 43 matches at the European Championships.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=2013 Guinness World Records Limited|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257 257]|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/257}}</ref>

===Literary scene===
Besides the interest in the older generation of writers, new authors emerged on the background of the experiences of war and after war period. [[Wolfgang Borchert]], a former soldier who died young in 1947, is one of the best known representatives of the {{lang|de|[[Trümmerliteratur]]}}. [[Heinrich Böll]] is considered an observer of the young Federal Republic from the 1950s to the 1970s, and caused some political controversies because of his increasingly critical view on society.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} The [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] (and its [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]]) soon developed into a regarded institution. Exemplary for West Germany's literature are – among others – [[Siegfried Lenz]] (with ''[[The German Lesson]]'') and [[Günter Grass]] (with ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' and ''[[The Flounder]]'').

==Geographical distribution of government==

In West Germany, most of the political agencies and buildings were located in Bonn, while the [[DAX|German Stock Market]] was located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which became the economic center. The judicial branch of both the German [[Federal Constitutional Court]] ({{lang|de|Bundesverfassungsgericht}}) and the highest Court of Appeals, were located in [[Karlsruhe]].

The West German government was known to be much more [[Decentralization|decentralised]] than its [[state socialism|state socialist]] East German counterpart, the former being a [[federal state]] and the latter a [[unitary state|unitary one]]. Whilst East Germany was divided into 15 administrative districts ({{lang|de|Bezirke}}), which were merely local branches of the national government, West Germany was divided into states ({{lang|de|Länder}}) with independently elected state parliaments and control of the {{lang|de|[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]}}, the second legislative chamber of the Federal Government.

==Present geographical and political terminology==
Today, [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is often considered to be [[Western Germany]] in geographical terms. When distinguishing between former West Germany and former East Germany as parts of present-day unified Germany, it has become most common to refer to the {{lang|de|Alte Bundesländer}} (old states) and the {{lang|de|Neue Bundesländer}} (new states), although {{lang|de|Westdeutschland}} and {{lang|de|Ostdeutschland}} are still heard as well.
