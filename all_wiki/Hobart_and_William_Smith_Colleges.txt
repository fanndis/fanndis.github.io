'''Hobart and William Smith Colleges''' are [[Private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]]s in [[Geneva, New York]]. They trace their origins to Geneva Academy established in 1797. The colleges offer the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts]] in [[teaching]].

The colleges were originally separate institutions &ndash; Hobart College for men and William Smith College for women &ndash; that shared close bonds and a contiguous campus.  In 1943, William Smith College was elevated from its original status as a department of Hobart College to an independent college and the two colleges established a joint corporate identity. They are officially chartered as "Hobart and William Smith Colleges" and informally referred to as "HWS" or "the Colleges." Although united in one corporation with many shared resources and overlapping organization, they have each retained their own traditions.

==History==

Hobart and William Smith Colleges, private colleges in Geneva, New York, began on the western frontier as the Geneva Academy.  After some setbacks and disagreement among trustees, the academy suspended operations in 1817. By the time Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]], of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New York]], first visited the city of Geneva in 1818, the doors of Geneva Academy had just closed. Yet, Geneva was a bustling [[Upstate New York]] city on the main land and stage coach route to the West. Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status. Roughly following this plan, Geneva Academy reopened as '''Geneva College''' in 1822 with conditional grant funds made available from [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in [[New York City]]. Geneva College was renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, Bishop Hobart.

William Smith College was founded in 1908, originally as William Smith College for Women. Its namesake and founder was a wealthy local nurseryman, benefactor of the arts and sciences, and philanthropist. The school arose from negotiations between William Smith, who sought to establish a women's college, and Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson, who sought to redirect Smith's philanthropy towards Hobart College. Smith, however, was intent on establishing a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college, which, when realized, coincidentally gave Hobart access to new facilities and professors. The two student bodies were educated separately in the early years, even though William Smith College was a department of Hobart College for organizational purposes until 1943. That year, after a gradual relaxation of academic separation, William Smith College was formally recognized as an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. Both colleges were reflected in a new, joint corporate identity.

==Early history and growth==

===Geneva Academy===
Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a small frontier settlement. It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva.<ref name="schoolhouse">{{cite web|url=http://history.rays-place.com/ny/geneva-4.htm

In 1809, the trustees of the academy appointed Rev. Andrew Wilson, formerly of the [[University of Glasgow]] in Scotland as head of the school.<ref name="schoolhouse"/> He remained until 1812 when Ransom Hubell, a graduate of [[Union College]], was made principal.<ref name="schoolhouse"/>

===Geneva College===
The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825, and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College.<ref name="schoolhouse"/> Rev. J. Adams was president of the college as of 1827.

The "English Course," as it was known, was a radical departure from long established educational usage and represented the beginning of the college work pattern found today.<ref name="charter"/>

===Geneva Medical College===
[[File:Geneva medical college lg.jpg|thumb|Geneva Medical College]]
{{Main|Geneva Medical College}}

Geneva Medical College was founded on September 15, 1834, as a separate department (college) of Geneva College. The medical school was founded by [[Edward Cutbush]], who also served as the first dean for the school.<ref name="charter"/>

===Elizabeth Blackwell===
[[File:P12b9.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Elizabeth Blackwell<br>Class of 1849]]

In an era when the prevailing conventional wisdom was no woman could withstand the intellectual and emotional rigors of a medical education, [[Elizabeth Blackwell (doctor)|Elizabeth Blackwell]], (1821–1910) applied to and was rejected – or simply ignored – by 29 medical schools before being admitted in 1847 to the Medical Institution of Geneva College.<ref name="liz"/>

The medical faculty, largely opposed to her admission but seemingly unwilling to take responsibility for the decision, decided to submit the matter to a vote of the students. The men of the College voted to admit her.<ref name="lizzie">{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_35.html
|title=Changing the Face of Medicine – Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell |access-date=June 5, 2010|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>

Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the top of her class to become the first woman doctor in the Northern hemisphere.<ref name="liz"/> "The occasion marked the culmination of years of trial and disappointment for Miss Blackwell, and was a key event in the struggle for the emancipation of women in the nineteenth century in America."<ref name="liz">{{cite web|url=http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031212033218/http://academic.hws.edu/library/archives/pdfs/tripp.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 12, 2003|title=Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell's Graduation – An Eyewitness Account by Margaret Munro De Lancey|access-date=June 5, 2010|publisher=Hobart and William Smith Colleges}}</ref>

Blackwell went on to found the [[Lower Manhattan Hospital|New York Infirmary for Women and Children]] and had a role in the creation of its medical college.<ref name="liz"/> She then returned to her native England and helped found the [[National Health Society]] and taught at the first college of medicine for women to be established there.

===Hobart College===
The school was known as Geneva College until 1852, when it was renamed in memory of its most forceful advocate and founder, Bishop Hobart, to Hobart Free College. In 1860, the name was shortened to Hobart College.<ref name="charter"/>

[[File:Bishop hobart.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bishop Hobart.]]

Hobart College of the 19th century was the first American institution of higher learning to establish a three-year "English Course" of study to educate young men destined for such practical occupations as "journalism, agriculture, merchandise, mechanism, and manufacturing", while at the same time maintaining a traditional four-year "classical course" for those intending to enter "the learned professions."  It also was the first college in America to have a dean of the college.

Notable 19th-century alumni included [[Albert J. Myer|Albert James Myer]], Class of 1847, a military officer assigned to run the [[United States Weather Bureau]] at its inception, was a founding member of the [[International Meteorological Organization]], and helped birth the [[U.S. Signal Corps]], and for whom [[Fort Myer, Virginia]], is named; General [[Edward S. Bragg|E. S. Bragg]] of the Class of 1848, colonel of the Sixth Wisconsin Regiment and a brigadier general in command of the [[Iron Brigade]] who served one term in Congress and later was ambassador to [[Mexico]] and consul general of the U.S. in [[Cuba]]; two other 1848 graduates, [[Clarence A. Seward]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.samueleells.org/SewardScholarships/SewardScholarshipAbout/ClarenceASeward/tabid/67/Default.aspx|title= A Brief History of Clarence A.

Griffith, who were assistant secretary of state and builder of the first national railroad across the [[Mississippi River]], respectively; and [[Charles J. Folger]], Class of 1836, a [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] in the 1880s.

Until the mid-20th century, Hobart was strongly affiliated with the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] and produced many of its clergy. While this affiliation continues to the present, the last Episcopal clergyman to serve as President of Hobart (1956–1966) was Louis Melbourne Hirshson. Since then, the president of the colleges has been a layperson.

During [[World War II]], Hobart College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name="navalyearbooks-v-12">{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/yearbooks.htm |title=Naval Training and Education Yearbooks in the Navy Department Library |publisher=Department of the Navy |access-date=September 25, 2011 |year=2011}}</ref>

===Founding of William Smith College===
Toward the end of the 19th century, Hobart College was on the brink of bankruptcy. It was through the presidency of Langdon Stewardson the college obtained a new donor, nurseryman William Smith.  Smith had built the Smith Opera House in downtown Geneva and the Smith Observatory on his property when he became interested in founding a college for women, a plan he pursued to the point of breaking ground before realizing it was beyond his means. As publicized in The College Signal on October 7, 1903, "William Smith, a millionaire nurseryman, will found and endow a college for women at Geneva, N. Y., to be known as the William Smith College for Women The institution will be in the most beautiful section. One building is to cost $150,000. Mr. Smith maintains the Smith observatory there."<ref>"The College Signal" (Semi-monthly published by the Students of the Massachusetts Agricultural College) Vol. XIV. October 7, 1903. p. 21.</ref> In 1903, Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson learned of Smith's interest and, for two years, attempted to convince him to make Hobart College the object of his philanthropy. With enrollments down and its resources strained, Hobart's future depended upon an infusion of new funds.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:William Smith -- founder of William Smith College.jpg|thumb|right|William Smith.]] -->
Unable to convince Smith to provide direct assistance to Hobart, President Stewardson redirected the negotiations toward founding a coordinate institution for women, a plan that appealed to the [[philanthropist]]. On December 13, 1906, he formalized his intentions; two years later William Smith School for Women – a coordinate, nonsectarian women's college – enrolled its first class of 18 students. That charter class grew to 20 members before its graduation in 1912.

In addition, Smith's gift made possible construction of the Smith Hall of Science, to be used by both colleges, and permitted the hiring, also in 1908, of three new faculty members who would teach in areas previously unavailable in the curriculum: biology, sociology, and psychology.

===World War II===
Between 1943 and 1945, Hobart College trained almost 1,000 men in the U.S. Navy's [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]], many of whom returned to complete their college educations when the post-World War II GI Bill swelled the enrollments of American colleges and universities. In 1948, three of those veterans – [[William Scandling|William F. Scandling]], Harry W. Anderson, and W. P. Laughlin – took over operation of the Hobart dining hall. Their fledgling business was expanded the next year to include William Smith College; after their graduation, in 1949, it grew to serve other colleges and universities across the country, eventually becoming [[Saga Corporation]], a nationwide provider of institutional food services.

==Campus==

===Layout===

[[File:Stjohnschapel7.jpg|thumb|right| St. John's Chapel, designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]]]

Hobart and William Smith Colleges' campus is situated on {{convert|170|acre|km2}} in [[Geneva, New York]], along the shore of [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]], the largest of the [[Finger Lakes]]. The campus is notable for the style of Jacobean architecture represented by many of its buildings, notably Coxe Hall, which houses the President's Office and other administrative departments. In contrast, the earliest buildings and the chapel are Gothic in style.

[[File:Dem1908.jpg|thumb|left| Hobart Quadrangle (1908)]] '''The Quad''', the core of the Hobart campus, was formed by the construction of Medbery, Coxe, and Demarest. Several years later, Arthur Nash, a Hobart professor, designed Williams Hall, which would be constructed in the gap between Medbery and Coxe. The Quad is formed to the east by Trinity and Geneva Hall, the two original College buildings, and to the south by the Science compound, and Napier Hall. [[Geneva Hall and Trinity Hall, Hobart & William Smith College|Geneva Hall (1822) and Trinity Hall (1837)]] were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> In 2016, the schools announced they were going solar by building two solar farms to create enough electricity for about 50 percent of HWS' needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/07/03/hobart-william-smith-solar-farms/86597722/|title=Hobart and William Smith Colleges go solar|access-date=2016-07-05}}</ref>

[[File:Hws coxe hall.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Coxe Hall, fronting the Hobart Quad.  The building, named for Bishop Arthur Cleveland Coxe, is an example of [[Jacobean architecture]].]]

'''The Hill''' (or William Smith Hill) is a prominent feature of the historic William Smith campus. Located at the top of a large sloping hill to the West of Seneca Lake and the Hobart Quad, the Hill houses three historic William Smith dorms, and one built in the 1960s (Comstock, Miller, Blackwell, and Hirshson Houses). At its peak resides William Smith's all female dorms. The Hill was the site originally conceived for William Smith College. Unveiled in 2008 for the William Smith Centennial is a statue of the college's founder and benefactor, William Smith.

A 15 million dollar expansion of the Scandling Campus Center was completed in autumn 2008.  This renovation added over 17,000 additional square feet, including an expanded cafe, a new post office, and more meeting areas. In 2016 the Gearan Center for Performing Arts was completed at a cost of 28 million dollars; the largest project in the history of the colleges.

===Key buildings===

'''Coxe Hall''', serves as the main administrative hub of campus. Constructed in 1901, the building is named after Bishop Arthur Clevland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, and houses the president's office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing, which was added in the 1920s. Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school. The building was designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] Architects.

'''Gearan Center for the Performing Arts,''' named in honor of President Mark D Gearan and Mary Herlihy Gearan, was in 2016.  It includes a lobby that links three flexible performance and rehearsal spaces for theater, music and dance. Also included are faculty offices, practice and recital rooms and a film screening room.

'''Scandling Campus Center''', named after [[William F. Scandling|William F. Scandling '49]], renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).

'''Gulick Hall''', was built in 1951 as part of the post-war "mini-boom" that also included the construction of the Hobart "mini-quad" dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th-century Hobart College president). Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar.  Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 prior to its renovation in 1992.

[[File:Mh1955a.jpg|thumb|left| Medbery Hall in 1955]]

'''Stern Hall''', named for the lead donor, Herbert J. Stern '58, was completed in 2004. It houses the departments of economics, political science, anthropology & sociology, environmental studies and Asian languages and cultures.

'''Smith Hall''', built in 1907, originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments.  It is now home to the Dean's Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments.  Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.

'''Williams Hall''', completed in 1907, housed the first campus gymnasium and, after the construction of Bristol gymnasium, served several other lives as campus post office, book store, IT services and location of the Music Department.

'''Demarest Hall''', connected to St. John's Chapel by St. Mark's Tower, houses the departments of Religious Studies and English and Comparative Literature as well as the Women's Studies Program.  Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Elizabeth Blackwell (once used as study area and library, the space is now used for classrooms in the absence of more intentional planning for classroom space),  Demarest was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s son, Richard M. Upjohn. (Upjohn's grandson, [[Hobart Upjohn]] would design several of the college's buildings as well). Demarest served as the college's library until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s. In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the college's growing number of volumes. Today, it also houses the Fisher Center for the Study of Gender and Justice, an intellectual center led by such scholar faculty as Dunbar Moodie (Sociology), and Betty Bayer (Women's Studies).

[[File:Dem1919.jpg|thumb|left| Demarest Hall, 1919]]

'''Trinity Hall''' built in 1837, was the second of the colleges' buildings. Trinity Hall was designed by college president Benjamin Hale, who taught architecture. Trinity served as a dormitory and a library, but it was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century. It presently is home to the Salisbury Center for Career Services.

[[File:Merritt2.jpg|thumb|right| Merrit Hall, Chemistry Dept.]]

'''Merrit Hall''', completed in 1879, was built on the ruins of the old medical college. Merrit was the first science building on campus and housed the chemistry labs. Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building. On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times. Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith. Today Merrit Hall houses a lecture hall and faculty offices.
'''St. John's Chapel''', designed by [[Richard Upjohn]] the architect of [[Trinity Church (New York City)|Trinity Church]] in New York City, served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original campus chapel. In the 1960s, St. John's was connected to Demarest Hall by St. Marks Tower.

'''Houghton House''', the mansion, known for its Victorian elements, is home to the Art and Architecture departments. The country mansion was built, in the 1880s by [[William J. King]]. It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family's summer home. Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion's interior to the present classical decor in 1913.  The family's "town home" is 624 S. Main Street and is now the Sigma Phi fraternity. Helen Vail's heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a woman's dormitory. After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center. The building is now home to the Davis Art Gallery, with lecture rooms, multiple faculty offices, and architecture studios on the top floor.

'''Katherine D. Elliot Hall''', was constructed in 2006. The "Elliot" houses {{convert|14600|sqft|m2}} contains art classrooms; offices; studios for painting, photography, and printing; and wood and metal shops.

[[File:Wh1909c.jpg|thumb|right| Williams Hall, 1909. Old College Gymnasium.]]

'''Goldstein Family Carriage House''', was built by William J. King in 1882 and was renovated in 2006 to house a digital imaging lab and a photo studio with a darkroom for black-and-white photography.

'''Warren Hunting Smith Library''', in the center of the campus, houses 385,000 volumes, 12,000 periodicals, and more than 8,000 VHS and DVD videos.  In 1997, the library underwent a major renovation, undergoing several improvements, such as the addition of multimedia centers, and the addition to its south side of the L. Thomas Melly Academic Center, a spacious, modern location for "round the clock" study.

'''Napier Hall''', attached to the Rosenberg Hall, houses several classrooms and was completed in 1994.

'''Rosenberg Hall''', named for Henry A. Rosenberg (Hobart '52), is an annex of Lansing and Eaton Hall, the original science buildings. Rosenberg houses many labs and offices.

'''Lansing Hall''', built in 1954, is home to Sciences and Mathematics. The building is named for John Ernest Lansing, Professor of Chemistry (1905–1948), who twice served as acting president.

'''Eaton Hall''', is named for [[Elon Howard Eaton]], Professor of Biology (1908–1935). Eaton, one of New York's outstanding ornithologists, was one of the professors brought to campus with William Smith grant funds. Eaton Hall is a part of the science complex at the south end of the Hobart Quad, which consists of Lansing, Rosenberg, and Napier.

===Dormitories===

====Men's dorms====
[[File:GenevaHall1896.jpg|thumb|right| Geneva Hall, 1896 Class Day]]

'''Geneva Hall''', built in 1822, is the college's first building, and the cornerstone site designated by the School's founder, Bishop [[John Henry Hobart]]. The building is one of the oldest academic building in continuous use, having served as a dormitory, among other uses, since its completion. The building has inscribed into its quoins, and alongside the perimeter of its facade, plaques which list the graduates of classes dating back to the 19th century.

'''The Mini Quad''', consisting of three buildings, Durfee, Hale, and Bartlett, houses about 150 Hobart students.  Since the 2006 academic year, the dorms have become coeducational, with at least one floor housing William Smith Students.

'''Hale Hall''' is named for Benjamin Hale, president of Hobart College from 1836 to 1858.

'''Bartlett Hall''' was named after the Reverend Murray Bartlett, who served as fourteenth president of Hobart College from 1919 to 1936

'''Durfee Hall''' was named after [[William Pitt Durfee]], who from 1884 to 1929 served as Professor of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Department. He was the first dean of a liberal arts college and served as acting president of the Colleges four times.

====Women's dorms====

'''Blackwell House''' was designed and built in 1860 by [[Richard Upjohn]] as a residence for William Douglass, who served as a trustee of Hobart College. The house was purchased in 1908 as the first William Smith dormitory. The house still houses William Smith students and is known for its grand Victorian features from fireplaces, to chandeliers, to large old windows. Though rarely recognized as such, the house is named for Elizabeth Blackwell, an early graduate of what became the Colleges.

[[File:BlackwellHouse.jpg|thumb|left| Historic Blackwell House]]

'''Comstock House''' was designed by [[Richard Upjohn]]'s grandson, Hobart Upjohn, in 1932.  Comstock is a women's dormitory named for Anna Botsford Comstock, friend of William Smith and the first woman to be named a member of the Board of Trustees.

'''Miller House''' was William Smith College's second dormitory. Miller was designed by Arthur Nash, professor and grandson of Arthur Cleveland Coxe. Nash also designed Smith Hall and Williams Hall. This house honors Elizabeth Smith Miller, a leader in the women's movement.

'''Hirshson House''', completed in 1962, was named for the president of the colleges, Louis Melbourne Hirshson, the last Episcopal clergy person to serve in that capacity. The building is home to William Smith students.

====Coed dorms====

[[File:Mh1955c.jpg|thumb|Medbery Hall, 1955|alt=]]

'''Medbery Hall''' is an original Hobart College dorm dating from the 1900. Medbery defines the right side of the Hobart Quadrangle. Designed by [[Clinton and Russell]] architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarity in their Jacobean Gothic style. Medbery is adorned with a recognizable Flemish roofline. Medbery was designed without long hallways "conductive to rioting" and mischief, such as rolling a cannonball down the hallway. Such mischief was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls.

'''Jackson, Potter, Rees''', together known as JPR for short (and once dubbed "superdorm"), the three identical buildings create their own quad in the south end of campus. The dorms were built in 1966 and are named after various historical figures of Hobart College. The complex houses about 230 first-year and upper class Hobart and William Smith students. The building was completely renovated in 2005 to include quad living spaces (two double bed rooms connected by a common living room) and open lounge spaces and lounges on every floor.

'''Jackson Hall''' is named for Abner Jackson, president of the Hobart in the middle of the 19th century.  Jackson would go on to become president of [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] in Connecticut, where he would be the principal designer of its present campus.

'''Rees Hall''' is named for Major James Rees, an early settler and landowner in Geneva and an acquaintance of George Washington.

'''Potter Hall''' is named for John Milton Potter, President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1942 to 1947.

'''The Village at Odell's Pond''' is a collection of apartment style dorms available to upperclassmen at the colleges. The units have either four or five bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.

'''Emerson Hall''' was built in 1969.  The rooms are designed as suites, with two doubles and two singles and a common living room and bathroom.

'''Caird Hall''' was built, along with deCordova, in 2005. The dorm has provisions for singles, doubles, and quads, and is often desired by students due to the separate temperature controls in each room.  The ground floor hosts a lounge area with both gaming and fitness equipment for students.

'''deCordova Hall''' was built, along with Caird, in 2005. The dorm has provisions for singles, doubles, and quads, and is often desired by students due to the separate temperature controls in each room.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}  The ground floor has a lounge area for students, as well as the deCordova cafe.

The surrounding ecosystem plays a major role in the Colleges' curriculum and acquisitions.  The Colleges own the {{convert|108|acre|km2|adj=on}} Hanley Biological Field Station and Preserve on neighboring [[Cayuga Lake]] and hosts the [[Finger Lakes Institute]], a non-profit institute focusing on education and ecological preservation for the Finger Lakes area.

On Seneca Lake one will find the ''William Scandling'', a Hobart and William Smith {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} research vessel used to monitor lake conditions and in the conduct of student and faculty research.

The Colleges also own and operate [[WEOS]]-FM and [[WHWS-LP]], public radio stations broadcasting throughout the Finger Lakes and worldwide, on the web.

==Academics==
Hobart and William Smith Colleges offer the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], and [[Master of Arts in Teaching]].

==Coordinate system==
Founded as two separate colleges, Hobart for men in 1822 and William Smith for women in 1908, Hobart and William Smith Colleges preserve their own identities while benefiting from a shared campus, faculty, administration and curriculum. The Colleges welcome students of all gender identities.
 
The two colleges combined gradually. In 1922, the first joint commencement was held, though baccalaureate services remained separate until 1942. By then, coeducational classes had become the norm, and the curriculum centered on the idea of an across-the-board education, encouraging students and faculty to consider their studies from several points of view.
In 1943, during the administration of President John Milton Potter, William Smith College was elevated from its original status as a department of Hobart College to that of an independent college, on equal footing with Hobart.
Today, Hobart and William Smith students retain their own deans, athletic departments and student governments. Each college celebrates its history through a series of time-honored traditions beginning when each student matriculates and lasting through graduation. The Colleges celebrate their position as one of the few remaining coordinate systems in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.hws.edu/about/coordinate-heritage/ |title=Hobart and William Smith Colleges |publisher=.hws.edu |access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>

;History
Originally known as the Hobart Deacons, Hobart's athletic teams became known as the "Statesmen" in 1936, following the football team's season opener against [[Amherst College]]. The morning after the game, ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the team as "the statesmen from Geneva," and the name stuck. The nickname for William Smith's athletic teams comes from a contest held in 1982. Several names were submitted, but "[[Heron]]s" was selected because of the strong and graceful birds that lived at nearby Odell's Pond. These ominous birds frequently flew over the athletic fields as the teams were practicing.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

While the Hobart Crew team has won gold in every event they have entered since the inception of rowing as a Liberty League Sport, they failed to win the team championships only once (2004.) The eventual champions, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, were known for having a large team and only able to defeat the Statesmen by securing a win in the 2nd Varsity 8+ – the only event that Hobart did not have an entry. However, over the past few seasons Hobart has fielded one of the most dominant 2nd Varsity 8's in school history.  The Crew Team took part in the '''Henley Royal Regatta''' in '''Henley, England''' in the summer of 2011, as well as the summer of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.row2k.com/henley/features.cfm?ID=1216&site=henley#.VZ2gM_lViko|title=Henley Thursday: Making the Most of Chances|website=row2k.com}}</ref>
