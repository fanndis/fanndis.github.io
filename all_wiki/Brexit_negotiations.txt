{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}

During 2017, 2018 and 2019, representatives of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[European Union]] negotiated terms for [[Brexit]], the planned withdrawal of the UK from the EU. These negotiations arose following the decision of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to invoke [[Withdrawal from the European Union#Procedure|Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]], following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|UK's EU membership referendum]] on 23 June 2016.

The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017, when the United Kingdom [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|served the withdrawal notice under Article 50]]. Withdrawal was then planned to occur on 29 March 2019, two years after the date of notification, as specified by Article 50.

Negotiations formally opened on 19 June 2017, when [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], the UK's [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]], arrived in Brussels to meet with [[Michel Barnier]], the Chief Negotiator appointed by the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jun/19/boris-johnson-and-gove-both-back-may-as-tory-leadership-speculation-continues-politics-live |title=UK appears to capitulate on sequencing on first day of Brexit talks – as it happened |first=Andrew |last=Sparrow |date=19 June 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref> They began to discuss a [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]], including terms of a transitional period and an outline of the objectives for a future UK-EU relationship. In November 2018, European Union officials announced that they would accept no further negotiations or changes before the UK legally leaves.

A [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] was finally ratified by the UK and the EU, and came into force from 1 February 2020. With the Brexit negotiations to establish a [[EU free trade agreements|trade agreement treaty]] between the EU and the UK has started. In addition, the EU's existing Free Trade and [[WTO]] [[tariff-rate quota]]s with third countries (agreed while the UK was still a member) may need be split or renegotiated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ceps.eu/publications/impact-brexit-eu%E2%80%99s-international-agreements |title=The Impact of Brexit on the EU's International Agreements |date=15 July 2016 |website=Centre for European Policy Studies |access-date=3 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615083202/https://www.ceps.eu/publications/impact-brexit-eu%E2%80%99s-international-agreements |archive-date=15 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.cigionline.org/publications/brexit-and-international-trade-one-year-after-referendum |title=Brexit and International Trade: One Year after the Referendum |first=Valerie |last=Hughes |date=26 September 2017 |journal=Centre for International Governance Innovation |access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Brexit sidebar}}
===2015 United Kingdom general election===
In its [[election manifesto]] for the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election in May 2015]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] promised to call an EU referendum by the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32302062|title=At-a-glance: Conservative manifesto|date=15 April 2015|access-date=22 September 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/14/conservatives-election-manifesto-2015-the-key-points|title=Conservatives election manifesto 2015 - the key points|first=Frances|last=Perraudin|date=14 April 2015|website=the Guardian|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref>

The [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum]], held on 23 June 2016, resulted in a 51.9% majority vote for leaving the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results|title=EU referendum results|date=24 June 2016|access-date=5 March 2019|website=BBC.co.uk}}</ref>

==Preparatory work, and intentions==
According to the European parliament, "For the moment, it appears that the two sides have different views on the sequencing and scope of the negotiations, and notably the cross-over between the withdrawal agreement and the structure of future relations, and this divergence itself may be one of the first major challenges to overcome."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/599352/EPRS_IDA%282017%29599352_EN.pdf |title=UK withdrawal from the European Union |website=European Parliament |date=March 2017}}</ref>

===UK negotiation===
The [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] was originally responsible for overseeing the negotiations to leave the EU and for establishing the future relationship between the UK and EU. This role was later taken over directly by the [[Prime Minister]] and [[Cabinet Office]].

* [[Theresa May]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]
* [[Oliver Robbins]], Europe Advisor to the Prime Minister and chief negotiator
* [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], [[Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union]] until 8 July 2018.
* [[Dominic Raab]], Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 9 July 2018 until 15 November 2018.
* [[Stephen Barclay]], Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union from 16 November 2018.

* Stephen Barclay, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.
* Sir Tim Barrow, UK Permanent Representative to the EU

====Article 50 invocation====
The United Kingdom's proposed principles were set out in the Article 50 notification:
* Constructive discussions
* Citizens first
* Comprehensive agreement
* Minimise disruption
* Ireland/Northern Ireland position
* Technical talks on detailed policy
* Work together on European values<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/29/article-50-brexit-letter-read-full/ |title= Article 50 letter: Read it in full |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 March 2017}}</ref>

The Prime Minister's formal letter of notification was delivered in Brussels on 29 March 2017.<ref name="notificationletter">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/604079/Prime_Ministers_letter_to_European_Council_President_Donald_Tusk.pdf |title=Prime Minister's letter to Donald Tusk triggering Article 50 |date=19 March 2017 |website=UK Government |access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref> It included withdrawal from the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. The letter recognised that consequences for the UK of leaving the EU included loss of influence over rules that affect the European economy, and UK companies trading within the EU aligning with rules agreed by institutions of which the UK would no longer be part. It proposed agreeing to seven principles for the conduct of the withdrawal negotiation. These are for:
# engaging with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation.
# aiming to strike an early agreement about the rights of the many EU citizens living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union.
# working towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking in both economic and security cooperation, and agreeing the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.
# working together to minimise disruption and giving as much certainty as possible, letting people and businesses in the UK and the EU benefit from implementation periods to adjust in an orderly way to new arrangements.
# in particular, paying attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.
# beginning technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, including a Free Trade Agreement covering sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries.
# continuing to work together to advance and protect our shared liberal, democratic values of Europe, to ensure that Europe remains able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.

====Role of the countries of the United Kingdom====
{{Further|Countries of the United Kingdom}}

The constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge [[Udo Di Fabio]] has stated his opinion that separate negotiations with the EU institutions by Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/brexit/zukunft-der-europaeischen-union-kopf-hoch-14327446.html |title=Future of the European Union – Chin up! |last=Di Fabio |first=Udo |date=7 July 2016|newspaper=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref>

====UK general election====
The start of negotiations was delayed until after the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|United Kingdom general election]], which took place on 8 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39643804 |title=General election 2017: MPs back plans for 8 June poll |website=BBC News |date=19 April 2017}}</ref> [[Antonio Tajani]], speaking on 20 April, said the early election should bring stability to the UK, which would have been good for negotiations.<ref name="Sky204">{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/general-election-is-good-for-brexit-negotiations-says-european-parliament-president-10844115 |title=General Election is good for Brexit negotiations, says European Parliament President |website=Sky News |date=20 April 2017}}</ref> In the event, the election led to a [[hung parliament]] which has reduced the Prime Minister's room for manoeuvre; in particular in respect of the [[Irish border question]] due to her dependency on a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with Northern Ireland's [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

===EU27 negotiation===
{{See also|European Union negotiating directives for Brexit}}
* [[Michel Barnier]], Chief Negotiator
* [[Guy Verhofstadt]], Brexit Coordinator for the [[European Parliament]] and Chair of the Brexit Steering Group<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/brexit-steering-group/en/home.html|website=European Parliament|access-date=23 December 2019|title=Brexit Steering Group}}</ref>

* [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], [[President of the European Commission]]
* [[Leo Varadkar]], [[Taoiseach]] (October 2019 renegotiation)

Following the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50, draft guidelines for the negotiations were sent to EU delegations of the 27 other member states (the EU27). The draft, prepared by the [[President of the European Council]], states that the guidelines define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 and set out the overall positions and principles the Union will pursue throughout the negotiation. It states that in the negotiations the Union's overall objective will be to preserve its interests, those of its member states, its citizens and its businesses, and that, in the best interest of both sides, the Union will be constructive throughout and strive to find an agreement. The draft sets out two core principles:
# The European Council will continue to base itself on the principles set out in the statement of Heads of State or Government and of the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission on 29 June 2016. It reiterates its wish to have the United Kingdom as a close partner in the future. It further reiterates that any agreement with the United Kingdom will have to be based on a balance of rights and obligations, and ensure a level-playing field. Preserving the integrity of the [[European Single Market]] excludes participation based on a sector-by-sector approach. A non-member of the Union that does not live up to the same obligations as the members cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits. In this context, the European Council welcomes the recognition by the British Government that the four freedoms of the Single Market are indivisible and there can be no "cherry picking".
# Negotiations under Article 50 TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]) will be conducted as a single package. In accordance with the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, individual items cannot be settled separately. The Union will approach the negotiations with unified positions, and will engage with the United Kingdom exclusively through the channels set out in these guidelines and in the negotiating directives. So as not to undercut the position of the Union, there will be no separate negotiations between individual member states and the United Kingdom on matters pertaining to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union."<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |title=In full: The EU's draft guidelines for Brexit negotiations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/31/full-eus-draft-guidelines-brexit-negotiations/ |date=31 March 2017 |access-date=8 April 2018 }}</ref>

According to the European Parliament, the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) should enter into force "well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019", and the negotiations should focus on:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20170329RES69090/20170329RES69090.pdf |title=European Parliament resolution on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that it intends to withdraw from the European Union |website=European Parliament |date=29 March 2017}}</ref>
* The legal status of European Union citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other member states, as well as other provisions concerning their rights;
* The settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union;
* The European Union's external border;
* The clarification of the status of the United Kingdom's international commitments taken as a Member of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 member states will be the legal successor of the European Union of 28 member states;
* Legal certainty for legal entities, including companies;
* The designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement.

On 18 April 2017, a spokesman for [[Donald Tusk]] said "We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/election-call-likened-to-hitchcock-film-by-eus-donald-tusk-10842357 |title=Election call likened to Hitchcock film by EU's Donald Tusk |last=Minelle |first=Bethany |date=18 April 2017 |website=Sky News |access-date=19 April 2017}}</ref> On 29 April, the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate.<ref name="Sky294">{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/eu-leaders-unanimously-agree-brexit-strategy-10855627 |title=EU leaders unanimously agree Brexit strategy |website=Sky News |date=29 April 2017}}</ref>

In a speech to a plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels on 22 March 2017, Barnier, as EU Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations, said the EU wanted to succeed by reaching a deal with the British, not against them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-723_en.htm |title=Speech by Michel Barnier, Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom, at the plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions |date=22 March 2017 |website=[[European Commission]] |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref>

On 22 May the European Council, following the approval of [[European Union negotiating directives for Brexit|the negotiating directives]] that the EU27 had adopted by strong [[qualified majority voting]],{{efn|at least 72% of the 27 member states (that is, 20 member states), together representing at least 65% of the population of the EU27}} authorised the Commission to open Article 50 discussions with UK, with Michel Barnier appointed as the negotiator. It further confirmed that all agendas, EU position papers, Non-papers and EU text proposals would be released to the public and published on line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1405_en.htm |title=European Commission receives mandate to begin negotiations with the UK |website=European Commission |date=22 May 2017}}</ref>

===Intergovernmental organisation===
[[Intergovernmental organisation]]s also involved in Brexit uncertainty considerations include the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and the [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA). IATA expects an agreement to avoid disruption.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.air-cosmos.com/brexit-iata-veut-une-solution-rapide-104095 |title=Brexit : IATA veut une solution rapide |first=Jean-Baptiste |last=Heguy |date=5 December 2017 |magazine=[[Air & Cosmos]] |language=fr |access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

===Phases===
EU27 guidelines include:
* Agreement on the so-called "[[EU divorce bill|divorce bill]]";
* Agreement on rights of EU citizens living in the UK;
* Agreement on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic within the withdrawal phase.<ref name="Sky294" />

The second phase, covering the post-Brexit relationship between the EU27 and the UK, was to begin "as soon as the European Council decides that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/04/29-euco-brexit-guidelines/ |title=European Council (Art. 50) guidelines for Brexit negotiations |date=29 April 2017 |website=European Council |access-date=9 September 2017}}</ref> The earliest opportunity for this decision was 19 October 2017, at a summit of EU leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-30/brexit-watchers-your-guide-to-key-dates-in-coming-negotiations |title=Your Guide to Key Dates in the Brexit Negotiations |last=Chrysoloras |first=Nikos |date=30 March 2017 |website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=9 September 2017}}</ref> although at that meeting it was agreed to start negotiations during the December meeting.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/23512/20-euco-conclusions-art50.pdf |title=Council Conclusions |date=20 October 2017 |website=European Council |access-date=8 December 2017}}</ref>

Some effects of the UK withdrawal could emerge before the UK and the EU27 conclude the Article 50 negotiation, as a result of policies existing when the negotiation begins, or some change of policy later. At the outset policy provisions binding on the EU include principles, aspirations and objectives set out in the TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]) Preamble<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Preamble |title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|at=Peramble|via=Wikisource}}</ref> and Articles,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions |title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|at=Title I: Common Provisions|via=Wikisource}}</ref> of which

:''Article 3'' mentions the promotion of "scientific and technological advance" in a context governed by "The Union's aim is to promote peace, its values and the well-being of its peoples", the Union's [[European Single Market|internal market]], "work for the [[sustainable development]] of Europe based on balanced economic growth and price stability, a highly competitive [[social market economy]], aiming at full employment and social progress", and the requirement that "The Union shall pursue its objectives by appropriate means commensurate with the competences which are conferred upon it in the Treaties",

and

:''Article 4'' mentions "competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States".

Policies mentioned in the Preamble include:

* Achieve the strengthening and convergence of member states' economies and establish an economic and monetary union including a single and stable currency,
* Promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection, and implement policies ensuring that advances in economic integration are accompanied by parallel progress in other fields,
* Establish a citizenship common to nationals of their countries,
* Implement a common foreign and security policy including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, thereby reinforcing the European identity and its independence in order to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world,
* Facilitate the [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|free movement of persons]], while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples, by establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.
* Continue the process of creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.

UK policy was stated in a [[white paper]] published in February 2017: ''The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf |title=The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union |date=February 2017 |website=UK Government}}</ref> In the white paper, UK negotiating policy was set out as twelve guiding principles:
:# Providing certainty and clarity, including a "Great Repeal Bill" to remove the European Communities Act 1972 from the [[statute book]] and convert existing EU law into domestic law.
:# Taking control of the UK statute book and ending the jurisdiction of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] in the UK.
:# Strengthening the Union of all parts of the Kingdom, and remaining fully committed to the [[Good Friday Agreement|Belfast Agreement]] and its successors.
:# Working to deliver a practical solution that allows for the maintenance of the [[Common Travel Area]] whilst protecting the integrity of the UK immigration system, and which protects the strong ties with Ireland.
:# Controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK.
:# Securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other member states.
:# Protecting and enhancing existing workers' rights.
:# Forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU.
:# Forging free trade relationships across the world.
:# Remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.
:# Continuing to work with the EU to preserve European security, to fight terrorism, and to uphold justice across Europe.
:# Seeking a phased process of implementation, in which both the UK and the EU institutions and the remaining EU member states prepare for the new arrangements.

===Pre-negotiation events===
On 28 June 2016, five days after the referendum, Chancellor of Germany [[Angela Merkel]] advised the German parliament of the agreed EU negotiation position: the UK could remain in the [[European Single Market]] (ESM) only if the UK accepted the ESM's four conditions (free movement of goods, capital, services and labour). While she expected the UK to remain an important NATO partner, the EU's priority was unity and self-preservation. She warned the UK not to delude itself.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article156631505/Mit-Merkel-wird-es-kein-Rosinenpicken-fuer-die-Briten-geben.html |title=Brexit-Bundestagsdebatte: Mit Merkel wird es kein Rosinenpicken für die Briten geben |trans-title=Brexit parliamentary debate: With Merkel there will be no cherrypicking for the British |newspaper=[[Die Welt]] |language=de |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=14 May 2017}}</ref> The next day, Tusk confirmed that the UK would not be allowed access to the ESM unless they accepted its four freedoms.<ref>{{cite news |last=Heffer |first=Greg |date=29 June 2016 |title='It's not single market à la carte' Donald Tusk tells UK it's Free Movement or Nothing |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/684528/Brexit-Donald-Tusk-Britain-free-movement-access-EU-single-market-David-Cameron |newspaper=Daily Express |access-date=1 July 2016}}</ref>

In contrast, at her October 2016 party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were priorities.

The statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the letter notifying withdrawal, authorised by the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]] and signed by the British Prime Minister, was handed to the President of the European Council. The letter called for a "deep and special relationship" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organization terms, and a weakening of the UK's cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. In the letter, the Prime Minister reasoned that, as the EU leaders did not wish "cherry picking" of the ESM, the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39431070 |date=29 March 2017 |website=BBC News |title=Brexit: The UK's letter triggering Article 50|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future cooperation without first settling the terms of the divorce, Verhofstadt referred to the letter as "blackmail" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] warned that the UK's decision to quit the block was a "choice they will regret one day".<ref>{{cite news |last=Asthana |first=Anushka |date=30 March 2017 |title=Don't blackmail us over security, EU warns May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref>

In May 2017, unflattering details of a four-way meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and his chief-of-staff [[Martin Selmayr]] were leaked to the German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung'', presumably by Martin Selmayr.<ref name="auto4">{{cite news |last=Bush |first=Stephen |date=2 May 2017 |title=Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker's dinner leaked because no-one thinks Brexit will work |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2017/05/theresa-may-and-jean-claude-junckers-dinner-leaked-because-no-one-thinks |newspaper=New Statesman |access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> According to the leaked description, Juncker claimed that Theresa May was "living in another galaxy" when suggesting that British and EU migrant rights could be rapidly negotiated and agreed in the course of June 2017.

==Negotiation for withdrawal agreement==
===2017===
{{main|Brexit negotiations in 2017}}

The United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on 29 March 2017. This started a two-year negotiation period but negotiations did not formally begin until 19 June 2017

===2018===
{{main|Brexit negotiations in 2018}}

The UK Government published several proposals during 2018, including the [[Chequers plan]] in July which sought to serve as the basis of the UK-EU trade deal, and a draft [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|Withdrawal Agreement]] which the UK Government and EU agreed in November 2018. The Chequers plan led to the resignation in July of David Davis as the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union and his replacement, Dominic Raab, resigned in November after the publication of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. He was replaced by Stephen Barclay. Negotiations over the [[Irish border question]] and the [[Irish backstop]] were frequently central to the debate around the Withdrawal Agreement.

===2019===
{{main|Brexit negotiations in 2019}}

Approaching the end of the two-year negotiation period in March 2019, Theresa May and European leaders agreed a delay for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to approve the proposed Withdrawal Agreement. As it was rejected for the third time, a further extension (to 31 October 2019) was agreed in April 2019, with an option to terminate UK membership earlier should the Withdrawal Agreement be passed by the UK Parliament before then (which it did not). The consequence of this extension was that the UK (being still a member) had to take part in the [[2019 European Parliament election]] in May 2019. In early October the UK parliament approved delay until 31 January 2020. 

On 17 October, Boris Johnson and [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] announced that they had finally reached agreement (subject to ratification) on a new [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] on terms which both parties considered acceptable.<ref name="guardianDeal">{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/how-is-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-different-from-theresa-may | title = How is Boris Johnson's Brexit deal different from Theresa May's? | author = Lisa O'Carroll | newspaper = The Guardian | date= 17 October 2019| access-date= 2 January 2020}}</ref> On 30 October 2019, the day named as "exit day" in UK legislation was changed to 31 January 2020 at 11.00 p.m.<ref>The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30th October 2019.[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1423/regulation/2/made]</ref> The Parliaments of the UK and of the EU approved the agreement in January 2020 and Brexit finally happened at that time.{{fact|date=March 2020}}

==Financial settlement==
{{main|Brexit divorce bill}}

Two different legal approaches arose in determining the financial element of the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]] and (at least initially) the UK and EU negotiators differed on which would be the more appropriate.<ref name=independent220917>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-divorce-bill-payment-michel-barnier-david-davis-backtracking-brussels-a7934296.html |title=Britain is 'backtracking' on its Brexit divorce bill commitments, EU's chief negotiator warns |date=7 September 2017|newspaper=The Independent |access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref> From Michel Barnier's point of view, the budget contributions that were agreed by 28 member states have to be paid by 28 member states, until the end of that budget period.<ref name="independent220917" /> David Davis said the "UK wants to go through the Brexit bill line-by-line to work out what it owes the EU."<ref name=independent220917 /> A leaving state is legally obliged to contribute to the EU budget beyond its membership period or to continue to honour the commitments it made during the (pre-Brexit) budget setting process.<ref name=independent220917 />

Discussing financial and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget is funded by revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU's Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the [[European Union (Finance) Act 2015]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/32/pdfs/ukpgaen_20150032_en.pdf |title=European Union (Finance) Act 2015, Explanatory Notes |website=UK Government}}</ref> The revenue includes contributions from import duties and [[VAT]] collected by member states.

The ECB set up the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of €440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the [[European Commission]] and the [[Budget of the European Union]] as collateral to borrow a further €60bn.

The EU has a pension liability of €64 billion (which includes current and former British MEPs as well as current and former employees of the Institutions).<ref name=HoL317/>

The UK benefits from a [[UK rebate|rebate]] which reduces its contribution to the [[EU budget]]. The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020.<ref name=HoL317/>

==UK citizens elsewhere in the EU and other EU citizens in the UK==
Concerns have been raised by UK citizens who live in other EU countries, and by citizens from those countries who live in the UK. In May 2017, [[Michel Barnier]] stated: "Currently around 3.2 million EU citizens work and live in the UK, and 1.2 million British citizens work and live in the EU."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-1236_en.htm |title=Press release – Speech by Michel Barnier at the 7th State of the Union Conference, European University Institute, Florence |date=5 May 2017 |website=European Commission|access-date=7 May 2017}}</ref>

By the end of September 2017 progress had been made on several of the 60 points which became green, while 13 out of the 60 points remain red. Three points (points #14, #15, and #16 related to monitoring and CJEU) have to be addressed at governance level.

As of October 2018, UK residents in the EU have not yet had their fates decided on. On 16 October 2018, just before departing for the EU27–UK summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking to the German parliament, asked "How do we treat the 100,000 British citizens in Germany on the day after Brexit if there is no deal?", without supplying an answer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/merkel-regierungserklaerung-zum-brexit-1.4174193 |title=Merkels vier Minuten für den Brexit [Merkel's four minutes for Brexit] |last=Al-Serori |first=Leila |date=17 October 2018 |newspaper=Sueddeutsche Zeitung |access-date=17 October 2018|language=de}}</ref>

===Implications===
The general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilecproject.eu/sites/default/files/GUIDELINES%20INVOLUNTARY%20LOSS%20OF%20EUROPEAN%20CITIZENSHIP%20.pdf |title=Guidelines: Involuntary Loss of European Citizenship |date=2015 |website=European Union |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate.<ref name="ir.lawnet.fordham.edu">{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2324&context=ilj |title=The Withdrawal Clause of the Lisbon Treaty in the Light of EU Citizenship (Between Disintegration and Integration) |last=Rieder |first=Clemens M. |journal=Fordham International Law Journal |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=2013 |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> The situation of a person acquiring EU citizenship when the UK joined the EU in 1973 compared to a person born in the UK after 1973 and was therefore born into EU citizenship, may differ. It may be necessary for the ECJ to rule on these issues.

The ECJ ruled in a 2017 decision (''Chávez-Vílchez and others'') that the third-country (non-EEA) national parent of a child with EU nationality may be entitled to a ‘derivative right of residence’, even if the other parent were an EU national and were “able and willing to assume sole responsibility for the primary day-to-day care of the child”.<ref>{{citation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=190502&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=5568946 |title=Chávez-Vílchez and others C-133/15 ECLI:EU:C:2017:354 |date=10 May 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brusselstimes.com/eu-affairs/8212/non-european-parents-of-european-child-have-eu-right-of-residency |title=Non-European parents of European child have EU right of residency |newspaper=Brussels Times |date=11 May 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The ability of the other (EU-national) parent to care for the child would, nevertheless, be a “relevant factor” in assessing whether the third-country national parent should be granted residence. The ''Chávez-Vílchez'' decision built upon the ECJ’s decision in ''Ruiz Zambrano'',<ref>{{citation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=80236&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=398771 |title=Ruiz Zambrano C‑34/09 ECLI:EU:C:2011:124 |date=8 March 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/801/pdfs/uksiem_20180801_en.pdf |title=Explanatory Note to the Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 |date=2 July 2018 }}</ref> which gave a ‘derivative right of residence’ to a third-country national primary carer of a child with EU nationality. The Chávez-Vílchez decision may have consequential effects for UK residents who have young children and wish to live in the EU27 territory post Brexit, but this remains to be tested.

===Immigration and mobility===
Until the UK effectively withdraws from the EU in 2019 or at another agreed date, the current system of free movement of labour between the EU27 and the UK remains in place.

The report of the House of Commons [[Exiting the European Union Select Committee|Exiting the European Union Committee]] on ''The Government's negotiating objectives'', published in April 2017,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmexeu/1125/112502.htm |title=3rd Report – The Government's negotiating objectives: the White Paper (HC 1125) |date=4 April 2017 |website=House of Commons |access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> proposed (paragraphs 20 and 123) that the future system for EU migration should meet the needs of different sectors of the UK economy, including those employing scientists, bankers, vets, care workers, health service professionals and seasonal agriculture workers.

[[Theresa May]], answering press questions on 5 April 2017, commented that the free movement of labour would not end in March 2019; an implementation period of possibly five years would give business and government time to adjust.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

The UK currently charges an annual levy of up to £1,000 for each non-EU citizen employed within the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/uk-visa-sponsorship-employers/immigration-skills-charge |title=UK visa sponsorship for employers: Immigration skills charge |website=UK Government |access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref> Proposals are under consideration to increase this 'immigration skills charge' to £2,000 p.a. and to implement a similar levy on EU citizens employed in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/18/news/economy/foreign-worker-charge-theresa-may/index.html |title=Americans are going to find it much harder to get a job in Britain |website=CNN |date=18 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-latest-news-uk-employers-pay-1000-per-eu-skilled-worker-european-immigration-skills-levy-a7521626.html |title=UK employers would have to pay a £1,000-a-year fee per EU skilled worker after Brexit under new government plans |newspaper=The Independent |date=11 January 2017}}</ref>

According to an unconfirmed newspaper report, a leaked Home Office paper has a proposal that the UK will end the free movement of labour of low-skilled workers immediately after Brexit, focusing on highly skilled EU workers instead.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/05/leaked-document-reveals-uk-brexit-plan-to-deter-eu-immigrants |title=Leaked document reveals UK Brexit plan to deter EU immigrants |last1=Hopkins |first1=Nick |date=5 September 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=6 September 2017 |last2=Travis |first2=Alan|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/uk-eu-migrants-brexit-plans-to-cut-back-on-post-brexit-report/ |title=UK plans to cut back on EU migrants post Brexit: report |date=5 September 2017 |website=Politico.eu |access-date=6 September 2017}}</ref> The proposal would limit lower-skilled EU migrants' residency permits to a maximum of two years, and the implementation of a new immigration system ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants while placing tough restrictions on their rights to bring over family members.<ref name=":0" /> Those in "high-skilled occupations" could be given permission to work in the UK for a period of three to five years.<ref name=":0" />

==Migration==
Immigration is one topic requiring partnership between EU and UK, as according to Theresa May, "Mass migration and terrorism are but two examples of the challenges to our shared European interests and values that we can only solve in partnership".<ref name="Spectator9-17">{{cite magazine |url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/09/theresa-mays-brexit-speech-full-text/ |title=Theresa May's Florence speech on Brexit, full text |date=22 September 2017 |magazine=[[The Spectator]] |access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

In the context of Brexit, the question of migration might contain two subtopics: on one hand migrations between EU including UK and third countries which might be dealt with at a local level; and on the other hand migration between EU and UK once UK has become a third country which was discussed for the withdrawal agreement.

==European Court of Justice (ECJ)==
The concept of [[European Court of Justice]] competence creates complications. Some pro-Brexiteers believe the Court of Justice might be completely removed from the UK landscape. Various other opinions consider that the Court of Justice or some equivalent should be able to rule on remaining issues after Brexit (for instance between a European and a British stakeholder), at least in respect of the TEU ([[Treaty on European Union]]), [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]], or access to the [[European Single Market]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-eu-ministers-invincible-ignorance-european-court-sir-david-edward-theresa-may-a7656826.html |title='Invincible ignorance' of Theresa May's Brexit-backing ministers condemned by former judge |date=29 March 2017|newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

After the 2017 negotiations, in February 2018 the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/draft_withdrawal_agreement.pdf |title=European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community |date=28 February 2018 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> consider for instance that:
* "The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period. That jurisdiction shall extend to all stages of proceedings, including appeal proceedings before the Court of Justice and proceedings before the General Court after a case has been referred back to it."
* "The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on requests from courts and tribunals of the United Kingdom referred to it before the end of the transition period."

==Sectoral issues==
Documents setting out how the Brexit will affect parts of the [[British economy]] were set up for the government, "the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue" containing "excruciating detail" according to Brexit Secretary David Davis.<!--<ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017>--> The ministers were reluctant to [[publish]] them but in November 2017, a vote in Parliament allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions to avoid [[news leak]]s.<!--<ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017>--> They were released online on 21 December 2017 but lawmakers were unimpressed: "Most of this could be found on [[Wikipedia]] or with a quick [[Google search]]", said Labour's [[David Lammy]], "these documents [were made] in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises."<ref name=Bloomberg21dec2017>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/may-heads-to-poland-to-seek-brexit-ally-after-firing-her-deputy |title=May Lands in Poland to Seek Brexit Ally After Firing Deputy |first=Robert |last=Hutton |date=21 December 2017 |website=Bloomberg}}</ref>

===Trade===
Without a trade agreement in place, UK trade with the EU would be governed by the World Trade Organization's [[Bali Package]]. This would lead to common tariffs and [[non-tariff barriers to trade|non-tariff barriers]] being imposed by the EU27 upon the UK's access to the [[European Single Market]], because the Market is also a [[customs union]]. However, the UK would then have an opportunity to control immigration as well as develop its own trade regulations.

The UK is not permitted to hold trade talks until after Brexit is concluded, however the UK can do preparatory work with other countries regarding the UK's future trading relationships; this is not to the liking of some EU27 countries.<ref name=POL114/> Before Britain leaves the EU, they may put trade agreements in place with non-EU countries.<ref>{{cite report |title=Brexit, Ireland and Northern Ireland |publisher=Constitutional Conundrums |date=2016}}</ref>

Only the EU can act in areas where it has exclusive competence, such as the customs union and common commercial policy. In those areas member states may not act independently.<ref name="gov.uk">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279629/bis-13-865-balance-of-competences-review-trade-and-investment.pdf |title=Review Of The Balance Of Competences Between The United Kingdom And The European Union |date=May 2013 |website=[[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> The UK can still negotiate its own bilateral investment protection treaties subject to Commission authorisation.<ref name="gov.uk"/>

Strategic controls on military goods are primarily a member state competence. As a result, member states themselves negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements on the strategic aspects of trade in defense goods.<ref name="gov.uk"/>

The EU27 wish to exclude the UK from sitting in on trade negotiations held by the EU during the period ending March 2019, seeing the UK as a competitor. Theresa May rejected this idea, saying "While we're members of the European Union we would expect our obligations but also our rights to be honoured in full."<ref name="POL114">{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/trade-talks-for-non-british-eyes-only/ |title=Trade talks: For non-British eyes only? |website=Politico.eu |date=10 April 2017}}</ref>

====Asset management companies====
The situation may be different when it comes to the [[fund management]] industry, as British asset owners, notably UK [[pension fund]]s, often constitute an incommensurate share of total turnover for German, French, Dutch and other [[Continental European]] asset managers.

This imbalance could potentially give Britain some negotiating leverage e.g. power of [[retorsion]] in case the EU attempts to impose an abrupt cancellation of the mutually-binding obligations and advantages pertaining to the [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004]] (''"fund passporting"''). Research conducted by the [[World Pensions & Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] shows that {{quote|"Assets owned by UK pension funds are more than eleven times bigger than those of all German and French pension funds put together [...] If need be, at the first hint of threat to the City of London, Her Majesty's Government should be in a position to respond very forcefully."<ref>{{cite journal |title= Beyond Brexit: Britain, Europe and the Pension Wealth of Nations |url=https://www.academia.edu/26810948 |journal=Pensions Age |date=July 2016 |page=44 |access-date=11 July 2016|last1=Firzli |first1=M.

===Security===
The letter of 29 March 2017 giving the UK's [[United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|notice of intention to withdraw]] from the EU stated "In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened."<ref name="notificationletter" /> This was seen by some as a threat.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/29/brexit-eu-condemns-mays-blackmail-over-security-cooperation |title=Don't blackmail us over security, EU warns May |date=30 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref> On 31 March, [[Boris Johnson]], the UK Foreign Secretary, confirmed that the "UK commitment to EU security is unconditional".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/uk-article-50-letter-european-diplomats-threat-security-cooperation |title=Boris Johnson joins UK attempts to calm Brexit security concerns |date=31 March 2017|newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=1 April 2017}}</ref>

The call by the United States to other members of [[NATO]] to increase their defence expenditure to the 2% of GDP level coincides in timing with Brexit. The UK is the second largest contributor to NATO defence, one of only five to meet the 2% level and one of only two EU members who have nuclear weapons. The possibility of a new Franco-German partnership to fill the vacuum left by Britain has been raised as a possibility and post Brexit an EU military headquarters, previously vetoed by the UK, may be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170403-france-eu-nato-boost-military-defense-spending-brexit-us-warnings-isolationism |title=EU, French militaries prepare to go it alone after Brexit, US warnings |website=France24 |date=3 April 2017}}</ref> The UK is fully committed to NATO.

Brexit raised issues around [[sovereignty]] for [[Gibraltar#Governance|Gibraltar]], the only [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the EU.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/02/spain-drops-plan-to-impose-veto-if-scotland-tries-to-join-eu |title=Spain drops plan to impose veto if Scotland tries to join EU |first=Jennifer |last=Rankin |date=2 April 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Gibraltarians voted to stay in the European Union by 96%.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/world/europe/gibraltar-brexit-spain-britain-european-union.html |title=Spain's Desire for Gibraltar Complicates 'Brexit' Talks With E.U. |first=Stephen |last=Castle |date=1 April 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Spain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar; however, in 2002 [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|Gibraltarians voted 99% to keep British sovereignty]].

The EU27 draft guidelines allow Spain a veto over any effect the Brexit agreement has as regards Gibraltar. The guidelines state: "After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/brexit-guidelines-eu-hands-spain-power-over-gibraltars-future-10819502 |title= Brexit guidelines: EU hands Spain power over Gibraltar's future |website=Sky News |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>

===Crown dependencies===
The [[Crown dependencies]] are not part of either the UK or the EU. They have a unique constitutional relationship both with the UK and, as encapsulated in Protocol{{nbsp}}3 to the UK's [[Treaty of Accession 1972|Treaty of Accession]], with the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/136/136.pdf |title=Brexit: the Crown Dependencies |website=House of Lords |date=23 March 2017}}</ref> They have no voting rights in EU or UK referendums or elections and no international voice, the UK government having the responsibility to act for the dependencies on foreign matters. [[Oliver Heald]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] is responsible for managing the relationship between the Islands and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://guernseypress.com/news/2017/04/08/protecting-finance-and-legal-sectors-a-priority-for-minister/ |title=Protecting finance and legal sectors a priority for minister |newspaper=Guernsey Press |date=8 April 2017}}</ref>

==Possibility of an extended transitional period==
Most of the major UK political parties support the idea of a transition period for applying temporary trade arrangements after the end of the UK's membership of the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.incelaw.com/tw/knowledge-bank/the-post-brexit-transitional-period-bridge-over-troubled-negotiations |title=The post-Brexit transitional period: Bridge over troubled negotiations? |website=International Law Firm |access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>

According to a speech by [[Michel Barnier]] in September 2017, the [[EU]] would have to define the conditions for a transitional period, if the [[UK]] requests one, and the transition period would be part of the [[Article 50]] withdrawal agreement.<ref name="europa.eu">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3404_en.htm |title=Press release - Speech by Michel Barnier in front of the Committees of Foreign Affairs and the Committees of European Affairs of the Italian Parliament |website=European Commission |access-date=9 December 2017}}</ref>

===UK government's legal advice===
Following an unprecedented vote on 4 December 2018, MPs ruled that the UK government was in [[contempt of parliament]] for refusing to provide to Parliament, the full legal advice it had been given on the effect of its proposed terms for withdrawal.<ref name=brexitbbc20181205>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46451970 |title=Brexit: Legal advice warns of Irish border 'stalemate' |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2018 |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref> The key point within the advice covered the legal effect of the "backstop" agreement governing Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the rest of the UK, in regard to the customs border between the EU and UK, and its implications for the [[Good Friday agreement]] which had led to the end of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, and specifically, whether the UK would be certain of being able to leave the EU in a practical sense, under the draft proposals.

The following day, the advice was published. The question asked was, ''"What is the legal effect of the UK agreeing to the Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular its effect in conjunction with Articles{{nbsp}}5 and 184 of the main Withdrawal Agreement?"'' The advice given was that:<ref name=brexitbbc20181205/>

:The Protocol is binding on the UK and EU [para 3], and anticipates a final future resolution of the border and customs issues being reached [para 5,12,13]. But "the Protocol is intended to subsist even when negotiations have clearly broken down" [para 16] and "In conclusion, the current drafting of the Protocol{{nbsp}}... does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement. This remains the case even if parties are still negotiating many years later, and even if the parties believe that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement." [para 30]

=="No-deal" as a negotiating position==
<!-- Note to editors: this section is about NEGOTIATIONS, not about issues that (may) arise from a no-deal exit, Please use the no-deal article for that topic. -->

A [[No-deal Brexit]] would involve the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without any [[Free Trade Agreement]] and relying on the trading rules set by the [[World Trade Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leavehq.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=128|title=What's wrong with the WTO Option?|last=LeaveHQ|website=leavehq.com}}</ref> The UK government has consistently said it will aim for the "best possible deal" but that "no deal is better than a bad deal". This position was restated in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election.<ref>''Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2017''. 18 May 2017. pp35-36. "The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK. But we will enter the negotiations in a spirit of sincere cooperation and committed to getting the best deal for Britain."</ref> In July 2017, Michel Barnier said that "a fair deal is better than no deal", because "In the case of Brexit, 'no deal' is a return to a distant past".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/06/frictionless-trade-impossible-if-uk-leaves-eu-single-market-says-barnier |title=Frictionless trade impossible if UK leaves EU single market, says Barnier |last=Rankin |first=Jennifer |date=6 July 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=7 July 2017|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In June 2017, a Parliamentary inquiry concluded that "the possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to justify planning for it. The Government has produced no evidence, either to this inquiry or in its White Paper, to indicate that it is giving the possibility of 'no deal' the level of consideration that it deserves, or is contemplating any serious contingency planning. This is all the more urgent if the Government is serious in its assertion that it will walk away from a 'bad' deal."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/1077/107702.htm |title=House of Commons - Article 50 negotiations: Implications of 'no deal' - Foreign Affairs Committee |website=UK Parliament |access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref>

In September 2017, the BBC reported that there was little evidence of UK government preparations for a "No Deal" scenario: "our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal – and the EU27 can surely see it."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Chris |title=Will the government really accept 'No Deal' with the EU? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41271028 |website=BBC News |date=19 September 2017 |access-date=21 September 2017}}</ref>

While withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were in progress in 2017, Barnier, as the EU's chief negotiator, speaking in Rome to Committees of the Italian Parliament on 21 September, said a future trade deal with the United Kingdom is the trade deal which will be negotiated after sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal. Barnier commented that the EU will want to negotiate a future trade deal with the United Kingdom, because trade with the United Kingdom will continue.<ref name="auto5">{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-17-3404_en.htm |title=Speech by Michel Barnier in front of the Committees of Foreign Affairs and the Committees of European Affairs of the Italian Parliament, Rome |date=21 September 2017 |website=European Commission |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> At the same time Barnier said "the future trade deal with the United Kingdom will be particular, as it will be less about building convergence, and more about controlling future divergence. This is key to establishing fair competition."<ref name="auto5"/>

The United Kingdom's then prime minister, in a speech at the [[Santa Maria Novella]] church in Florence on 22 September 2017,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/22/mays-florence-speech-venue-represents-european-unity-not-division |title=May's Florence speech venue represents European unity, not division |date=22 September 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> proposed an economic partnership between the UK and the EU which respects both the freedoms and principles of the EU, and the wishes of the British people. At the same time she re-affirmed that after the UK leaves the EU a period of implementation would be in their mutual interest, to be agreed under Article 50 for a strictly time-limited period.<ref name="Spectator9-17"/>

The European parliament voted a Brexit resolution (the European Parliament resolution of 14 March 2018) on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship (2018/2573(RSP)) with 544 MEP against 110 (with 51 abstentions).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/media/news/2018/march18/association-agreement.html |title=Brexit: EP recommends association agreement for future EU-UK relations |website=European Parliament |access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The 14 page<ref name="europa.eu1">{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2018-0069+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN |title=Guidelines on the framework of future EU-UK relations |date=14 March 2018 |website=European Parliament |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> document states that an association agreement between EU and UK could be an adequate framework for the future. This resolution proposes that the agreement address four domains: trade, interior security, foreign and defense policy collaboration, and thematic cooperation (for instance for research and innovation).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://lentreprise.lexpress.fr/actualites/1/actualites/brexit-les-eurodeputes-proposent-un-accord-d-association-au-royaume-uni_1992319.html |title=Brexit : les eurodéputés proposent un accord d'association au Royaume-Uni |date=14 March 2018|magazine=[[L'Express]] |language=fr |access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2017-0490&language=EN&ring=B8-2017-0677 |title=State of play of negotiations with the United Kingdom |date=13 December 2017 |website=European Parliament |access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref>
The resolution also urges the UK to present a clear position on all outstanding issues pertaining to its orderly withdrawal.<ref name="europa.eu1"/>

In December 2018, then Secretary for Work and Pensions [[Amber Rudd]] suggested that a [[Norway-plus]] model{{nbsp}}– the membership of the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA){{nbsp}}– could be an alternative if Theresa May's Brexit deal is rejected.<ref name="norwaymodel">{{cite news |title=Rudd says Norway-style Brexit deal is 'plausible' |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3a0010aa-facb-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e |work=Financial Times |date=8 December 2018}}</ref>

==Trade deal negotiation between the UK and EU, 2020==
{{Main|Trade deal negotiation between the UK and EU}}
Beginning in March 2020, representatives of the UK and the EU commenced negotiations for a [[free trade agreement|trade agreement]] to make trade easier than it would be without such a deal. The deal might cover (or eliminate) both [[tariff]] and [[non-tariff barriers to trade]].

During the [[Brexit negotiations in 2017]], the two sides agreed that trade negotiation could only start after the UK's withdrawal, because such negotiations could not happen when the UK still has a veto right within the EU.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/29/eu-brexit-guidelines-document-really-means/ |title=EU Brexit guidelines: What's in the document, and what it really means |last=Foster |first=Peter |date=29 April 2017|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=14 May 2017}}</ref> For this and other reasons, a [[transition period]] after Brexit day was defined to allow those negotiations. This transition period started on the first February 2020, in accordance with the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement|withdrawal agreement]]. The first deadline is the 31 December 2020, a deadline which can be extended for two years.<ref name=Euronews200211>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/02/11/brexit-draft-deal-first-of-many-hurdles-to-a-smooth-exit|title=Post-Brexit Guide: Where are we now? *latest updates*|first=Alasdair|last=Sandford|date=February 11, 2020|website=euronews}}</ref> The British government has declared that it will not apply for any such extension.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-johnson-transition/uk-will-not-extend-brexit-transition-period-johnsons-spokesman-idUSKBN1Z5139 | title = UK will not extend Brexit transition period - Johnson's spokesman | date =6 January 2020 | work = [[Reuters]] | access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> In addition, it clarified the only kind of trade deal the UK is interested is in, if any, is a [[Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement|Canadian style trade deal]],<ref name="politico-uk-may-not-like-">{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-trade-deal-will-contain-financial-services-but-uk-may-not-like-it/|title=Brexit trade deal will contain financial services, but UK may not like it|first=Pierre|last=Briançon|date=January 11, 2018|website=POLITICO}}</ref> as documented in Barnier's "staircase" slide.<ref name="15-12-2017">{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/slide_presented_by_barnier_at_euco_15-12-2017.pdf | title = Slide presented by Michel Barnier, European Commission Chief Negotiator, to the Heads of State and Government at the European Council (Article 50) on 15 December 2017| date=15 December 2017 | access-date = 8 March 2020| work= [[European Commission]]}}</ref>
