{{short description|List of individuals to whom money is paid by the government}}
A '''civil list''' is a list of individuals to whom [[money]] is paid by the [[government]], typically for service to the state or as honorary pensions. It is a term especially associated with the [[United Kingdom]] and its former colonies of [[Canada]], [[India]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and many more. It was originally defined as expenses supporting the monarch. 

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the Civil List was, until 2011, the annual grant that covered some expenses associated with the Sovereign performing their official duties, including those for staff salaries, State Visits, public engagements, ceremonial functions and the upkeep of the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Households]]. The cost of transport and security for the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]], together with property maintenance and other sundry expenses, were covered by separate grants from individual Government Departments. The Civil List was abolished under the [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]].

===History===
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the expenses relating to the support of the monarch were largely separated from the ordinary expenses of the state managed by the [[Exchequer]]. This was a reaction to the reigns of [[Charles II of England]] and [[James II of England]] (also known as [[James VII of Scotland]]), whose large revenues had made them independent of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In [[Civil List Act 1697|1697]], Parliament under [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] fixed [[the Crown]]'s peacetime revenue at £1,200,000 per year; of this about £700,000 was appropriated towards the Civil List.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol7/pp382-385|title=William III, 1697-8: An Act for granting to His Majesty a further Subsidy of Tunnage and Poundage towards raiseing the Yearly Su[m]m of Seven hundred thousand Pounds...

III. p. 4. n. 5.] {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Convention and Bill of Rights|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/billofrights/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref> The sovereigns were expected to use this to defray some of the costs of running the civil government (such as the Civil Service, judges' and ambassadors' salaries) and the payment of pensions, as well as the expenses of the Royal Household and the sovereign's personal expenses. It was from this that the term "Civil List" arose, to distinguish it from the statement of military and naval expenses which were funded through special taxation.

The accession of [[George III]] in 1760 marked a significant change in royal finances. As his predecessor, George II, had failed to meet all of the specific costs of the civil government in accordance with the previous arrangement, it was decided by the [[Civil List Act 1760]] that George III would surrender the hereditary revenues from the [[Crown Estate]] to Parliament for the duration of his reign, and in return Parliament would assume responsibility for most of the costs of the civil government. Parliament would continue to pay the Civil List, which would defray the expenses of the [[Royal Household]] and some of the costs of the civil government. George III, however, retained the income from the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].

On the accession of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] in 1830, the sum voted for the Civil List was restricted to the expenses of the Royal Household, removing any residual responsibilities associated with the cost of the civil government.  This finally removed any links between the Sovereign and the cost of the civil government. On the accession of [[Queen Victoria]], the [[Civil List Act 1837]]—which reiterated the principles of the civil list system and specified all prior Acts as in force—was passed. Upon the accession of subsequent monarchs down to [[Queen Elizabeth II]], this constitutional arrangement was confirmed, but the historical term "Civil List" remained even though the grant had nothing to do with the expenses of the civil government.

In 1931 [[George V]] decided to eschew the £50,000 due to him from the Civil List as a result of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]]. As [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]], [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby|Sir Frederick Ponsonby]] wrote to Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] to say that George had felt it was possible to reject the grant by "exercise of the most rigid economy" and that [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and other royal family members were "desirous that reductions in these grants should be made during this time of national crisis".<ref>"Silence of the readers", ''[[The Times]]'', 22 August 1992; pg. 10.</ref>

===Elizabeth II===
The last British monarch to receive Civil List payments was Elizabeth II. The Civil List for her reign lasted from her accession in 1952 until its abolition in 2012. During this period the Queen, as head of state, used the Civil List to defray some of the official expenditure of the monarchy.

Only the Queen, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] ever received direct funding from the Civil List.<ref name=Indy_Royal>{{cite news |last=Verkaik |first=Robert |title=Royal aides want to see abolition of Civil List |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/royal-aides-want-to-see-abolition--of-civil-list-606157.html |newspaper=The Independent|date=30 May 2002 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}</ref> The [[Prince of Wales]] and his immediate family (the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]], the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]], and [[Prince Harry]]) received their income from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. The state duties and staff of other members of the Royal Family were funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which was fully refunded by the Queen to the Treasury.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sovereign Grant Act: main provisions |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm |publisher=HM Treasury |accessdate=8 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103012814/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm |archivedate=3 January 2012 }}</ref> The Queen's consort ([[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]) received £359,000 per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is The True Cost Of The Monarchy?|url=http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/what-is-the-true-cost-of-the-monarchy-3032|publisher=Royal Central|date=17 February 2013|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref> The Queen was permitted to claim these amounts as a deduction against her gross income from personal investments and other sources—the net amount, after deductions, was subject to normal income tax.

The last two decades of the Civil List were marked by surpluses and deficits. Surpluses in the 1991–2000 Civil List caused by low inflation and the efforts of the Queen and her staff to make the Royal Household more efficient led to the accrual of a £35.3 million reserve by late 2000. Consequently, the Civil List was fixed at £7.9 million annually in 2001, the same amount as in 1991, and remained at that level until its abolition. The reserve was then used to make up the shortfall in the Civil List during the subsequent decade.<ref name=BBC_How>{{cite news |author=Elena Egawhary |title=How the Civil List is spent |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10391693 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref> The [[Civil List Act 1972]] forbade Parliament from reducing any of these payments.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/30/politics.jubilee |title=Secret deals that obscure the royal finances &#124; UK news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref>

The abolition of the Civil List was announced in the spending review statement to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 20 October 2010 by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]]. In its place, he said, "the Royal Household will receive a new Sovereign Support Grant linked to a portion of the revenue of the Crown Estate". The [[Crown Estate]] is a [[statutory corporation]], run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners and generates revenue for [[HM Treasury]] every year (an income surplus of £210.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2010).<ref>{{cite web | title = News Page - 2010 Annual Results | publisher = The Crown Estate | date = 15 July 2010 | url = http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/newscontent/92-2010-annual-results.htm | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100822160837/http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/newscontent/92-2010-annual-results.htm | archivedate = 22 August 2010 }}</ref> This income is received by the Crown and given to the state as a result of the agreement reached in 1760 that has been renewed at the beginning of each subsequent reign. The [[Sovereign Grant Act 2011]] received [[Royal Assent]] on 18 October 2011. Under this Act, the Sovereign Grant now funds all of the official expenditure of the monarchy, not just the expenditure previously borne by the Civil List.

===Civil List pensions===
{{see also|Pensions in the United Kingdom#Civil List pensions}}
These are pensions traditionally granted by the Sovereign from the Civil List upon the recommendation of the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The [[Civil List Act 1837]] applied the condition that any new pensions should be "granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country."<ref>Civil List Act 1837 (c.2)</ref> Famous recipients include [[William Wordsworth]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The economy of literary form: English literature and the industrialization of publishing, 1800-1850|last=Erickson|first=Lee|date=1996|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801851459|location=Baltimore|pages=76|oclc=32394070}}</ref> [[William Barnes]],<ref>Chris Wrigley, 'Barnes, William (1801–1886)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1475 accessed 7 Sept 2017]</ref> [[Geraldine Jewsbury]],<ref>Joanne Wilkes, 'Jewsbury, Geraldine Endsor (1812–1880)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14815 accessed 7 Sept 2017]</ref> [[Margaret Oliphant]],<ref>

==Canada==

In [[Canada]] the civil list was a common term during the [[Canada under British Imperial Control (1764-1867)|pre-confederation period]]; it referred to the payment for all officials on the government payroll.  There was much controversy as to whether the list would be controlled by the [[Governor]] or by the Legislative Assembly.  The Assembly demanded control of all money matters, while the Governors worried that if the Assembly was given this power, then certain positions would be delisted.  Eventually under the [[Robert Baldwin|Baldwin]]-[[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Lafontaine]] government, a compromise was reached with [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]].

The term ''civil list'' is no longer commonly used to describe the payment of civil servants in Canada, who are covered in the budgets of executive agencies.

==India==
[[Civil Services of India]] civil servant bureaucrats, in a personal capacity, are paid from the Civil List. Senior civil servants may be called to account by [[Parliament of India|Parliament]]. The civil service system in India is rank-based and does not follow the tenets of the position-based civil services.<ref name="India National Civil Service">{{cite web |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/unpan006306.pdf |title=National Civil Service System in India : A Critical View|author=United Nations Public Administration Network|date= |publisher=Government of India |location= |accessdate=21 July 2014|author-link=United Nations Public Administration Network}}</ref>

==Morocco==
Article 45 of the 2011 Amended [[Moroccan Constitution]] states that the King shall have a civil list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/constitution |title=Constitution |publisher=Maroc.ma |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}</ref> A similar provision was contained in Article 22 of the 1996 Amended Moroccan Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un-dpadm/unpan041912.pdf|title=Morocco Constitution Adopted 13 September 1996|publisher=United Nations Public Administration Network |accessdate=2016-05-13}}</ref>

The [[Civil List Act 1979]] describes the funds provided for the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]], [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[New Zealand Cabinet|Cabinet Ministers]] and [[Parliament of New Zealand|Members of Parliament]].

==Singapore==
The Civil List and Gratuity Act<ref>{{Singapore legislation|cap=44|ed=2002}}</ref> provides a civil list and gratuity for the maintenance of the [[President of Singapore]].
