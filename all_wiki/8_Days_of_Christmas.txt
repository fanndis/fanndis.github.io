'''''8 Days of Christmas''''' is the fourth and penultimate [[studio album]] and the first and only [[Christmas album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] girl group [[Destiny's Child]], released on October 30, 2001 by [[Columbia Records]].

== Background ==
The album contains twelve tracks featuring traditional Christmas songs and three original songs. Most of them are re-arranged with up-tempo beats in a contemporary R&B style. The album was recorded in Summer 2001 in the United States, but [[Kelly Rowland]] stated during the "[[8 Days of Christmas (song)|8 Days of Christmas]]" video premiere on [[BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'' in Fall 2001 that parts of the album were also recorded in Japan during Destiny's Child's overseas promo tour. In the same interview, [[Beyoncé]] revealed, "Actually we wrote the song two years ago, when we went in the studio to do some Christmas something. That's what started the idea of doing a Christmas album."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freewebs.com/keytasvibe/destinyschild.htm |title=Keyta's Vibe – DESTINY'S CHILD |publisher=Freewebs.com |accessdate=2011-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918030206/http://www.freewebs.com/keytasvibe/destinyschild.htm |archive-date=2010-09-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The song "8 Days of Christmas" first appeared on the double-disc reissue of ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' in November 2000.

''8 Days of Christmas'' received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]], gave the album 2.5 out 5 stars. In his review, he felt that it did not offer anything different from any other Christmas album, and that it had the same formula as every other Christmas album, making it very predictable.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r557261|pure_url=yes}} "8 Days of Christmas - Destiny's Child"]. [[AllMusic]].</ref> Chris Willman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the album a B+. He felt that the album had a rough start, stating that song lyrics such as, "a pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring" were too materialistic, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, however, he stated that originals like "Winter Christmas", and "[[This Christmas (Donny Hathaway song)|This Christmas]]" helped the album quickly recover.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,253136,00.html|title=Music reviews on ''MTV TRL Christmas''; ''8 Days of Christmas''; Barbra Streisand's ''Christmas Memories''; ''NOW That's What I call Christmas!''; Toni Braxton's ''Snowflakes''; They Might Be Giants' ''Holidayland''; Extraordinare''|last=Willman|first=Chris|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 30, 2001| accessdate= March 24, 2018}}</ref> ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' gave the album a mixed review, stating  that some songs of the album fell short, but despite that, there were a few gifts on the album, such as "[[Carol of the Bells]]". They came to conclusion that while it was good, it was not destined for success.<ref name="people2001"/> Alexa Camp of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the album 2.5 out of 5 stars. She said that the album sounded like a, "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]] II:Winter Ghetto-chic," and that the album brought little justice to the original songs.<ref name="slantmagazine2001"/>
