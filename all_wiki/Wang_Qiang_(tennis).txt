'''Wang Qiang''' ({{zh|s=王蔷|p=Wáng Qiáng}}; {{small|Mandarin pronunciation:}} {{IPAc-cmn|wang|2|-|q|yang|2|}}; born 14 January 1992) is a Chinese professional [[tennis]] player. She has won two singles titles on the [[WTA Tour]], one singles title on the [[WTA 125K series]], and 13 singles titles and one doubles title on the [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF Circuit]]. Her best result at a Grand Slam tournament came at the [[2019 US Open – Women's Singles|2019 US Open]] where she reached the quarterfinals.

==Career==
[[File:Wang Qiang 2, 2015 Wimbledon Championships - Diliff.jpg|thumb|Wang Qiang at [[2015 Wimbledon Championships]]]]
Wang was born in [[Tianjin]]. At age nine, she started playing tennis.<ref>http://www.87pat.com/qiang-wang/e/profile/index.html</ref> That year, she became the promotion player for the Tianjin National Tennis Center. For two years consecutively (2006, 2007), she won the Junior's Tennis Championship in China. She officially started touring the [[ITF Women's Circuit]] in Japan as of 2007.

In February 2010, she was a main draw at the AOAO Sports charity themed 'Fiji Tennis Invitation Classis' [FTIC] created by Ademola Oduwole on Denarau Island in Fiji aimed at promoting girls sports. She defeated Christina Visico of the Philippines in the finals to win her $2000 purse and a $4000 [[Chris Aire]] watch donated by the Hollywood Luxury watch designer <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fijisun.com.fj/2010/02/04/wang-out-to-win/|title=Wang out to win|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fijisun.com.fj/2010/02/05/wang-reigns-at-denarau/|title=Wang reigns at Denarau|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fijisun.com.fj/2010/02/05/oduwole-brains-behind-tourism-exposure/|title=Oduwole brains behind tourism exposure|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fijisun.com.fj/2010/02/06/ambassador-salutes-tourney/|title=Ambassador salutes tourney|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>

Wang achieved her first big circuit win at the [[2013 Malaysian Open]] where, after qualifying, she beat top seed and world No. 10 [[Caroline Wozniacki]] in the first round.<ref name="wozniacki_win">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/21605241 Caroline Wozniacki loses to Qiang Wang in Malaysian Open]</ref>

She made her Grand Slam main-draw debut at the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|2014 US Open]] from the qualifying tournament,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/draws/us/index.html|title=Women's Qualifying Singles Draw |accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> and defeated [[Paula Kania]] of Poland in the first round by 6–2, 6–0, before losing to Australian [[Casey Dellaqua]] in the second round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-08-29/dellacqua-defeats-wang-to-reach-third-round-of-us-open/5704586 |title=US Open: Casey Dellacqua fires past Qiang Wang to reach third round for first time, Samantha Stosur crumbles |date=August 28, 2014 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref>

In 2016, Wang's best results came at the Grand Slams, reaching the second round of the [[2016 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], [[2016 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], and [[2016 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]]. She also competed in singles at the [[Tennis at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's singles|2016 Summer Olympics]], but lost in the first round to two-time Grand Slam winner [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]].

In 2017, Wang reached her first quarterfinal at a Premier-level tournament, winning three straight set matches in [[2017 Dubai Tennis Championships – Women's Singles|Dubai]] (a Premier 5 tournament) before losing to [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. She finished the year ranked inside the top 50 for the first time, at no. 45 in the world.

===2018: Asian Games gold medalist, two WTA titles, world No. 20===
Wang got off to a very slow start in the 2018 season, winning just one main draw match in her first four tournaments. She then reached the fourth round in [[2018 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], defeating former top-10 players [[Timea Bacsinszky]] and [[Kristina Mladenovic]] en route, before falling to world No. 1 [[Simona Halep]]. Wang struggled in her next five tournaments though, and her ranking dropped to no. 91 in the world.

She then reached her first quarterfinal of the year in [[2018 Internationaux de Strasbourg – Singles|Strasbourg]], losing to top seed [[Ashleigh Barty]]. At the [[2018 French Open – Women's Singles|French Open]], Wang upset the ninth seed and seven-time Grand Slam winner [[Venus Williams]] in the first round, then defeated [[Petra Martić]] to advance to the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time. However, she was then beaten by [[Yulia Putintseva]]. The only grass court tournament she played in was [[2018 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], where she lost in the opening round to compatriot [[Zheng Saisai]].

Wang won the golden medal in singles at the [[2018 Asian Games|Asian Games]] defeating [[Jeong Su-nam]], [[Gozal Ainitdinova]], [[Aldila Sutjiadi]], [[Liang En-shuo]], and finally compatriot [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]] in the final.

Wang also had a great run in the Asian Swing. She won her first WTA tour tile in July at [[2018 Jiangxi International Women's Tennis Open|Jiangxi]], where she defeated [[Zheng Saisai]] in the final. After reaching the third round at the [[2018 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open]] before falling to [[Elina Svitolina]], Wang won her second title of the year (and career) in [[2018 Guangzhou International Women's Open|Guangzhou]], where she didn't drop more than four games in each match throughout the tournament. As a result of her Guangzhou triumph, she reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 34 and replaced [[Zhang Shuai]] as the highest-ranked Chinese player.

The next week, she competed at the Premier-5 tournament in [[2018 Wuhan Open|Wuhan]], where she defeated [[Maria Sakkari]], eighth seed [[Karolína Plíšková]], and [[Daria Gavrilova]] in the first three matches. In the quarterfinals, she defeated 2016 Olympic gold medalist [[Monica Puig]] in straight sets to reach the semifinals, but was forced to retire from the match against [[Anett Kontaveit]] due to injury. She became the first ever Chinese player to reach the semifinals at the tournament, and reached another new career-high ranking of No. 28.

Wang received a wildcard into the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in Beijing. As a Wuhan Open semifinalist, she received a first-round bye. She defeated the [[2017 French Open]] champion [[Jelena Ostapenko]] in the second round by 6–0, 6–0. In the third round, she beat [[Karolína Plíšková]] for the second time in consecutive weeks in straight sets. In the quarterfinal, she defeated Wuhan champion [[Aryna Sabalenka]] in two very tight sets. Her run ended in the semifinal, at the hands of former world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. However, her first ever Premier Mandatory semifinal earned her a new career-high ranking of No. 24.

Wang was seeded sixth in [[2018 Hong Kong Tennis Open|Hong Kong]]. She defeated [[Zhang Ling (tennis)|Zhang Ling]] and [[Christina McHale]] to reach the quarterfinals, where she faced top seed [[Elina Svitolina]]. Wang took a decisive lead quickly, taking the first set 6–2 and was leading 5–2 in the second when the match was suspended for the night due to a sudden downpour. She closed out the set 6–4 the next day, advancing to the semifinals. In the semifinal she defeated fourth seed [[Garbiñe Muguruza]] in three sets, coming back from a 1–4 deficit in the third to win 7–5. In her third final of the year, Wang was defeated by 18-year-old [[Dayana Yastremska]] in straight sets. On 22 October, she reached a new career-high ranking of No. 22.

She was awarded a wild card to enter the [[2018 WTA Elite Trophy|WTA Elite Trophy]], but with withdrawals from both [[Serena Williams]] and Jelena Ostapenko, she qualified for the main draw with her ranking. In her first round-robin match, she lost to [[Daria Kasatkina]] in three sets. She then played [[Madison Keys]], winning the match in three sets. Later, Keys, as the winner of the group, announced her withdrawal due to a knee injury, allowing the second-placed Wang to play the semifinal match against Muguruza, where she won in straight sets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtatennis.com/news/wang-routs-muguruza-reach-historic-zhuhai-final-against-barty|title=Wang routs Muguruza to reach historic Zhuhai final against Barty|last=Livaudais|first=Stephanie|date=2018-11-03|work=WTA Tennis|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}</ref> In the final, she was defeated by [[Ashleigh Barty]]. Her performance in Zhuhai saw her break the top 20 for the first time, and ensured she would end the year as world No. 20.

===2019: First Grand Slam quarterfinal, career-high ranking===
[[File:Wang Q. WM19 (9) (48521677276).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Wang at the [[2019 Wimbledon Championships|2019 Wimbledon]]]]
Seeded 21st at the [[2019 Australian Open|Australian Open]] (her first ever seeding at a Grand Slam tournament), Wang defeated [[Fiona Ferro]] and [[Aleksandra Krunić]], and then lost to 13th seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. This was her best performance to date at the tournament. At [[2019 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]], she defeated 16th seed [[Elise Mertens]] and reached the fourth round, losing to the Canadian wildcard (and eventual champion) [[Bianca Andreescu]]. In [[2019 Miami Open|Miami]], she reached the quarterfinals, where she lost to second seed [[Simona Halep]]. At the [[2019 J&T Banka Prague Open|Prague Open]], she was seeded third, reaching the quarterfinals and then lost to [[Bernarda Pera]]. Wang failed to advance past the second round at any tournament during the clay-court season, losing in the first round at [[2019 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] and [[2019 Italian Open (tennis)|Rome]], and losing in the second round at [[2019 Internationaux de Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and the [[2019 French Open|French Open]].

At the [[2019 Birmingham Classic|Birmingham Classic]], she defeated [[Lauren Davis]] and then lost to [[Venus Williams]] in the second round. She subsequently withdrew from the [[2019 Eastbourne International|Eastbourne International]]. At [[2019 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], she was seeded 15th. She defeated [[Vera Lapko]] and [[Tamara Zidanšek]], and then lost to [[Elise Mertens]] in the third round. This was her best result at the tournament to date.

She achieved a series of new career-high rankings over the course of the year, achieving the world No. 15 ranking prior to Wimbledon.

At the [[2019 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Wang was seeded 18th. She defeated [[Caroline Dolehide]], [[Alison Van Uytvanck]], and [[Fiona Ferro]] to advance to the second week of a Grand Slam event for the first time. She then upset tournament favorite and world No. 2, Ashleigh Barty in the fourth round, her first victory over a top-three player, to advance to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. She became just the fifth Chinese player in history, after [[Li Na]], [[Zheng Jie]], [[Peng Shuai]], and Zhang Shuai, to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal, and the third to do so at the US Open, after Li and Peng. However, she heavily lost to eventual runner-up Serena Williams in straight sets, winning just one game. After the tournament, she rose six places to reach another new career high of world No. 12, becoming the second-highest ranked Chinese singles player in history.

Wang struggled following the US Open though, managing just two match wins on the Asian hard-courts, one in [[2019 Wuhan Open – Singles|Wuhan]] and the other in [[2019 Tianjin Open – Singles|Tianjin]]. After failing to qualify or receive a wild card for the [[2019 WTA Elite Trophy|WTA Elite Trophy]], she finished the year ranked world No. 29, her second consecutive year inside the top 30.

===2020: Win over Serena Williams===
Wang opened her new season with a quarterfinal appearance at the [[2020 WTA Shenzhen Open|Shenzhen Open]] and a first-round loss to [[Angelique Kerber]] at the [[2020 Adelaide International|Adelaide International]]. Seeded 27th at the [[2020 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open]], she defeated [[Pauline Parmentier]] and [[Fiona Ferro]] to reach the third round, where she pulled off a major upset by defeating eighth seed Serena Williams in three sets, avenging her lopsided loss to the American at the previous US Open.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bradford |first1=Brendan |title=Australian Open 2020: Serena Williams shocked by China's Qiang Wang in third round upset |url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/tennis/news/australian-open-2020-serena-williams-qiang-wang-third-round-upset/l1k8yukba3kh1uoa8zahfdzol |website=Sporting News |language=en-au |date=January 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Serena Williams Loses at Australian Open |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/sports/tennis/serena-williams-australian-open.html |work=The New York Times |date=January 23, 2020}}</ref> However, she was upset herself in the fourth round by the unseeded Tunisian [[Ons Jabeur]].
