Before becoming a full-time investigative reporter at the Post, Priest specialized in intelligence reporting and wrote many articles on the U.S. "[[War on terror]]" and was the newspaper's Pentagon correspondent.

In February 2006, Priest was awarded the [[George Polk Award]] for National Reporting for her November 2005 article on secret CIA detention facilities in foreign countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2005.html|title=Brooklyn - LIU|website=www.brooklyn.liu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720224212/http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2005.html|accessdate=17 August 2018|archive-date=2006-07-20}}</ref> Priest also revealed the existence of the [[Counterterrorist Intelligence Center]]s (CTIC) in a November 17, 2005, [[wikt:front page|front page]] article, which are [[counter-terrorist]] operations centers run jointly by the [[CIA]] and foreign [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] services.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111702070_pf.html "Foreign Network at Front of CIA's Terror Fight"].

November 17, 2005.</ref> The [[Alliance Base]] in Paris, involving the [[Directorate-General for External Security|DGSE]] and other foreign intelligence agencies, is one of the most important CTIC.

== "Black sites" ==
Titled "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons", the article, published by the ''Washington Post'' [[above the fold]] on November 2, 2005, asserts the existence of clandestine, extraterritorial, [[CIA]] [[interrogation]] sites.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/01/AR2005110101644.html "CIA Holds Terror Suspects in Secret Prisons"]. ''The Washington Post''. November 2, 2005.</ref> This article triggered a worldwide debate on these "[[black site]]s."  The article updated one-year-old revelations by Priest and investigative reporter Joe Stephens.<ref>{{cite news |title=Secret World of U.S. Interrogation â€“ Long History of Tactics in Overseas Prisons Is Coming to Light |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15981-2004May10.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=May 11, 2004 |accessdate=2012-05-11 |author=Dana Priest and Joe Stephens}}</ref> Priest's article states that in addition to the 750 [[List of Guantanamo Bay detainees|Guantanamo Bay detainees]] in military custody, the CIA held approximately 30 senior members of the [[al Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] leadership and approximately 100 foot soldiers in their own facilities around the world. She wrote that several former [[Soviet Bloc]] countries had allowed the CIA to run interrogation facilities on their territory.

On April 21, 2006, The ''New York Times'' claimed that a [[European Union]] investigation, under the direction of the Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]], has not proved the existence of secret CIA prisons in Europe.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/21/world/europe/21rendition.html No Proof of Secret C.I.A. Prisons, European Antiterror Chief Says], ''The New York Times,'' April 21, 2006</ref> But, Dick Marty's report, published in June 2006, showed that 14 European countries had participated in the CIA's [[extraordinary rendition]]s, using various airports and military bases (i.e. [[Ramstein Air Base]] in Germany, [[Lajes Field]] in the [[Azores]], etc.).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5056614.stm "Secret CIA jail claims rejected"].

Priest said that [[George W. Bush|President Bush]], former vice president [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] and other [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] members personally tried to persuade the ''Post'' not to publish the story in a White House meeting, but that executive editor [[Leonard Downie]] made the decision to proceed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ondemand.duke.edu/video/20075/dana-priest-adventures-in-jour |title=Dana Priest, "Adventures in Journalism: From CIA Secret Prisons to Walter Reed" |publisher=Ewing Lecture on Ethics in Journalism, [[Duke University]] |date=October 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> In an interview, Priest confirmed that the CIA had referred her story to the [[US Justice Department|Justice Department]], and that various [[United States Congress|Congressmembers]] have called for an inquiry, to determine whether she or her sources had broken any laws.<ref>[http://www.danapriestfansite.com/articlesondp/twincitiesinterview-danapriest.html "Interview: Dana Priest on secret gulags, CIA and war"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213123754/http://www.danapriestfansite.com/articlesondp/twincitiesinterview-danapriest.html |date=2010-02-13 }}. ''Pulse of the Twin Cities''. December 1, 2005.</ref> The ''Post'' reported on April 21, 2006, that a CIA employee, [[Mary McCarthy (CIA)|Mary O. McCarthy]], was fired for allegedly leaking classified information to Priest and other journalists. The allegation has been disputed by McCarthy and by the ''Post''.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/24/AR2006042401601.html "Dismissed CIA Officer Denies Leak Role: Official Says Agency Is Not Asserting She Told of Secret Prisons"]. ''The Washington Post''. April 25, 2006.</ref>

In an extended interview with ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', Priest responded to criticism that her ''Post'' reporting could have damaged national security by saying, <blockquote>"There's no floodgate of information out there in the realm of intelligence; there just isn't. That defies looking at the newspapers every day. People who say that, they're just taking the word of the government. I think we did do a very responsible job at what we did. We tried to figure out a way to get as much as information to the public as we could without damaging national security."</blockquote>Replying to a follow-up question about the possibility of damaging U.S. interests by publicizing or alluding to various intelligence capabilities, sources and methods, Priest said, 
<blockquote>"Does that make sense to you? Letting the bad guys know that we can eavesdrop on them, they don't know that? I think one of the revealing facts about the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|NSA [wiretapping] case]], if you take the government on the face value, is the extent to which they are underestimating the enemy, which is not a good thing if you want to defeat the enemy."<ref>{{cite web

== Walter Reed conditions ==
On February 18, 2007 Priest and [[Anne Hull]] [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal|exposed]] degrading conditions at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] for outpatient Iraq War veterans. The story caused an uproar across the United States and resulted in the resignation of [[Secretary of the Army]], [[Francis J. Harvey]].<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701172.html "Soldiers Face Neglect, Frustration At Army's Top Medical Facility"], ''The Washington Post,'' February 18, 2007.</ref>

The story exposed the existence of mold, mice and rust in outpatient facilities and showed the deteriorating conditions in facilities for wounded soldiers and veterans. This resulted in severe investigations by Rep. [[Henry Waxman]] (D-CA), who chaired the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] in the House and by Sen. [[Carl Levin]] (D-MI), on the Senate side, who chaired the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]].
Republicans and Democrats joined hands in criticizing the respective parties responsible for the conditions there. This prompted President [[George W. Bush]] to appoint former [[Senate Majority Leader]] and 1996 Presidential Candidate Sen. [[Bob Dole]] (R-KS) and former [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] [[Donna Shalala]] to oversee the process of healthcare for wounded soldiers. The stories won the [[2008 Pulitzer Prize]] in Public Service. In an April 12, 2013 ceremony, Priest accepted the first Pell Center Prize for Storytelling in the Public Square award for this story and her other body of published work.<ref>{{ cite web |url=http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2013/04/washington-posts-dana-priest-honored-at-story-in-the-public-square-at-salve.html |title=Washington Post's Dana Priest Honored at Story in the Public Square at Salve's Pell Center |last=Caporizzo |first=Maria |work=[[Providence Journal]] |date=April 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2013/03/pulitizer-winner-dana-priest-name-inaugural-winner-of-pell-center-prize-for.html |title=Pulitzer recipient named first winner of Pell Center storytelling prize |last=Mooney |first=Tom |work=Providence Journal |date=March 12, 2013}}</ref>

==Top Secret America==
{{main|Top Secret America}}
