Fighting broke out again in October, resulting in at least 80 deaths, the displacement of more than 20,000 people, and the burning of thousands of homes. Rohingyas are not allowed to leave their settlements, officially due to security concerns, and are the subject of a campaign of commercial boycott led by Buddhist monks.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Unforgiving history |url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21565638-why-buddhists-and-muslims-rakhine-state-myanmar-are-each-others%E2%80%99-throats-unforgiving |magazine=The Economist |date=3 November 2012 |access-date=23 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108000528/https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21565638-why-buddhists-and-muslims-rakhine-state-myanmar-are-each-others%E2%80%99-throats-unforgiving |archive-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Map of Rohingya people in Rakhine State.png|thumb|280px|Rohingya people in Rakhine State]]
{{Main|Rohingya insurgency in Western Burma|Rohingya people}}
Sectarian clashes occur sporadically in Rakhine State, often between the Buddhist [[Rakhine people]] who are majority in the southern part, and [[Rohingya]] Muslims who are majority in the north.<ref name="BBC emergency" /> Before the riots, there were widespread and strongly held fears circulating among Buddhist Rakhines that they would soon become a minority in all of [[Arakan]], and not just the northern part, which has long been a Muslim majority.  The Burmese government classifies the Rohingya as "immigrants" to Burma and denies them full citizenship. Due to their lack of citizenship, they were previously subject to restrictions on government education, officially recognised marriages, and along with ethnic Rakhines, endured forced labour under the military government.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/myanmar-conflict-rohingya-muslims_n_1595976.html | title=Myanmar Conflict: Rohingya Muslims Persecuted in Myanmar And Bangladesh | agency=Huffington Post | date=14 June 2012 | accessdate=5 November 2012 | first=Ryan | last=Craggs | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724181937/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/myanmar-conflict-rohingya-muslims_n_1595976.html | archive-date=24 July 2012 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/11/uk-myanmar-violence-idUSLNE85A01C20120611 | title=Muslim, Buddhist mob violence threatens new Myanmar image | agency=Reuters | date=11 June 2012 | accessdate=12 June 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612063732/http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/11/uk-myanmar-violence-idUSLNE85A01C20120611 | archive-date=12 June 2012 | url-status=live}}</ref>

On the evening of 28 May, three Muslim youths apparently robbed, raped and murdered an ethnic Rakhine woman, Ma Thida Htwe, near her village Tha Pri Chaung when she was returning home from Kyauk Ni Maw Village of Rambree township.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ma Thida Htwe remembered in Arakan |url=http://narinjara.com/ma-thida-htwe-remembered-in-arakan/ |accessdate=4 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908021006/http://narinjara.com/ma-thida-htwe-remembered-in-arakan/ |archive-date=8 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===8 June: Initial attacks===
Despite increased security measures, at 3:50&nbsp;pm 8 June, a large mob of Rakhine ignited several houses in Bohmu Village, [[Maungdaw]] Township where 80% of the population is Rohingya Muslims. Telephone lines were also damaged.<ref name="11-2">{{cite web | url=http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=575:curfew-imposed-in-rakhine-township-amidst-rohingya-terrorist-attacks&catid=42:weekly-eleven-news&Itemid=109 | title=Curfew imposed in Rakhine township amidst Rohingya terrorist attacks | publisher=Eleven Media Group | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612204339/http://eversion.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=575:curfew-imposed-in-rakhine-township-amidst-rohingya-terrorist-attacks&catid=42:weekly-eleven-news&Itemid=109 | archive-date=12 June 2012 | url-status=dead}}</ref> By the evening, Hmuu Zaw, a high-ranking officer, reported that the security forces were protecting 14 burnt villages in [[Maungdaw]] township.

An hour later, the rioters had a police outpost in Khayay Mying Village surrounded. The police fired warning shots to disperse them.<ref name="11-1"/> At 10 o'clock, armed forces had taken positions in Maungdaw.

===9 June: Riots spread===
On the morning of 9 June, five army battalions arrived to reinforce the existing security forces. Government set up refugee camps for those whose houses had been burned. Government reports stated that Relief and Resettlement Ministry and Ministry of Defense had distributed 3.3 tons of supplies and 2 tons of clothes respectively.<ref name="11-3">{{cite web | url=http://news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14026&Itemid=112 | title=ဖစ္ပြားျပီးေနာက္ရက္၌ အေျခအေနမ်ားကို သက္ဆိုင္ရာက ထိန္းခ်ဳပ္ႏိုင္ျပီ ျဖစ္ေၾကာင္းသိရ | publisher=Eleven Media Group | date=10 June 2012 | accessdate=11 June 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613230459/http://www.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14026&Itemid=112 | archive-date=13 June 2012 | url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite increased security presence, the riots continued unabated. Security forces successfully prevented rioters' attempt to torch five-quarters of Maungdaw. However, Rakhine villagers from [[Buthidaung Township]] (where 90 percent of people are Rohingya Muslims) arrived at refugee camps after their houses had been razed by Muslims. Soon after, soldiers took positions and anti-riot police patrolled in the township. The Muslim rioters marched to Sittwe and burned down three houses in Mingan quarter.

=== Rohingya diaspora ===
Around 140,000 people, the majority of them Rohingya Muslims, were displaced by two waves of organized violence between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine last year that left some 200 people dead. Thousands of Rohingya have fled Myanmar since then on overcrowded boats to Malaysia or further south, despite the dangers posed by rough seas. Hundreds are believed to have died at sea in 2013. In May, nearly 60 Rohingyas went missing after their boat sank after hitting rocks as a cyclone approached the bay.

In November, another boat carrying 70 Rohingyas fleeing sectarian violence capsized off the western coast of Myanmar. Only eight survivors have been found.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/8710-dozens-of-rohingya-missing-following-boat-capsize.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106054829/http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/8710-dozens-of-rohingya-missing-following-boat-capsize.html |archive-date=6 November 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', [[2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots|later]] [[Bamar people|Burmese]] Buddhist mob violence against [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims in such places as [[Meiktila]], [[Okpho Township|Okpho]] and [[Gyobingauk Township]] "follows on from, and is clearly inspired by, the massacres of Rohingya Muslims around Sittwe"<ref>https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21574506-sectarian-violence-was-not-supposed-be-part-myanmars-bright-new-direction-when-lid-blows {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603083849/http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21574506-sectarian-violence-was-not-supposed-be-part-myanmars-bright-new-direction-when-lid-blows |date=3 June 2017 }} Communal violence in Myanmar: When the lid blows off</ref> and "now seems to be spreading to other parts of Asia, too".<ref>https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21582321-fuelled-dangerous-brew-faith-ethnicity-and-politics-tit-tat-conflict-escalating {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124144415/http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21582321-fuelled-dangerous-brew-faith-ethnicity-and-politics-tit-tat-conflict-escalating |date=24 November 2015 }} Buddhism v Islam in Asia: Fears of a new religious strife</ref>

===India===
{{main|Azad Maidan riots}}
A Rohingya refugee colony gradually grew in New Delhi, as Bangladeshi refugees and Rohingya refugees settled here. By 2018, the colony had grown to more than 30,000 people.

In August 2012, about 20,000 Indians, mostly [[Muslims in India|Muslims]] gathered in Mumbai's Azad Maidan to protest the treatment of Rohingyas in Rakhine state. The protest, called by regional Muslim organizations and political parties quickly grew violent. Protesters began to riot and set fire to the offices and establishments in the vicinity. The police was outnumbered and the riots continued for 5 days.<ref>{{cite news |title=Azad maidan riots - Five days later, some questions for the police |url=https://www.mid-day.com/articles/azad-maidan-riots-five-days-later-some-hard-questions-for-mumbai-police/177333 |accessdate=8 October 2018 |publisher=Mid Day |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008174932/https://www.mid-day.com/articles/azad-maidan-riots-five-days-later-some-hard-questions-for-mumbai-police/177333 |archive-date=8 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The riots started off initially as a protest organized in [[Azad Maidan]] on 11 August 2012 to condemn the Rakhine riots and Assam riots, which later turned into a riot. The riot reportedly began as the crowd got angry either after hearing an inflammatory speech or after seeing photographs of Assam violence and Rakhine state riots. The riot resulted in two deaths and injuries to 54 people including 45 policemen.<ref name="fp-poem">{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/mumbai/azad-maidan-violence-poem-by-mumbai-cop-sparks-outrage-586986.html|title=Azad Maidan Violence poem by Mumbai cop sparks outrage|work=Firstpost|access-date=18 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103021638/http://www.firstpost.com/mumbai/azad-maidan-violence-poem-by-mumbai-cop-sparks-outrage-586986.html|archive-date=3 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Mumbai Police estimated that the riots caused a loss of {{INR}} 2.74 crore in damages to public and private property.
