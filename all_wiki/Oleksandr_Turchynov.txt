In [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998, he was elected]] to [[Verkhovna Rada|parliament]] as a member of [[Hromada (political party)|Hromada]] but after the [[Pavlo Lazarenko#Imprisonments and trials|scandal around Lazarenko]], he left the faction and party (during May 1999) together with Yulia Tymoshenko's [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]]. He was re-elected to parliament in 2002 and 2006 as part of the [[BYuT]].

On 4 February 2005, Turchynov was appointed and served as the first‐ever civilian head of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU). With the approval of Turchynov as the head of the SBU, he dissolved the investigation team that was investigating the [[Georgiy Gongadze]] case since 2002. According to the first deputy head of the Main Investigation Department of the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine]] Roman Shubin, Turchynov ordered not to provide operational data on the Gongadze case to the investigation group of the Security Service of Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://podrobnosti.ua/308083-genprokuratura-ljudi-turchinova-dezinformirujut-obschestvennost.html |script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура: Люди Турчинова дезинформируют общественность |publisher=podrobnosti.ua |language=ru |date=25 April 2006 |access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:Дело Гонгадзе: Пукач скрывается в Украине? |url=http://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/delo-honhadze-pukach-ckryvaetcja-v-ukraine.html |work=[[Segodnya]] |language=ru |date=16 November 2007 |access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://zn.ua/LAW/avantyury_diletantov.html |script-title=ru:Авантюры дилетантов |work=[[Dzerkalo Tyzhnia]] |language=ru |date=28 April 2006 |access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref>

In August 2007, Turchynov replied to the accusation that his stance on [[same-sex marriage]] is typically conservative, "I do not agree. If a man has normal views, then you label him a conservative, but those who use drugs or promote [[sodomy]], you label them a progressive person. All of these are [[perversions]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgf.org.uk/news/research-2/overview-of-lesbian-and-gay-rights-in-eastern-europe/|title=Overview of Lesbian and Gay rights in Eastern Europe|publisher=[[The Lesbian & Gay Foundation]]|access-date=12 August 2009|archive-date=20 August 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820220202/http://www.lgf.org.uk/news/research-2/overview-of-lesbian-and-gay-rights-in-eastern-europe/|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 1 May 2017, the journalistic investigation of the program ''Our money with Denis Bigus'' (channel ''24'') proved the connection between Oleksandr Turchynov and people's deputy Ruslan Lukyanchuk with three large companies (''Absolut Finance'', ''Magnate'' and ''Octave Finance'') that own 1,200 exchange points of 3,500 legal [[Bureau de change|currency exchange offices]] in Ukraine. These points exchanged currencies without [[cash register]]s, which violates the requirements of the law, since in this case automatic tax reporting is not provided to the [[State Fiscal Service (Ukraine)|State Fiscal Service]]. All these companies are listed on the nominees — Oksana and Ilona Brodovskaya and Hryhoriy Pron'ko (Oksana's father). However, their connection with the joint business of Turchinov and Lukyanchuk was proved by journalists — Oksana and her husband Valentin Brodovsky were assistants of Ruslan Lukyanchuk during four convocations of the Verkhovna Rada.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://24tv.ua/komu_nalezhat_punkti_obminu_valyut_i_chomu_podatkova_ne_bachit_podatkiv_nardepa_n812815 | script-title=uk:Кому належать пункти обміну валют і чому податкова "не бачить" податків нардепа | publisher = TV-channel 24 | language = uk | date = 1 May 2017 | access-date = 27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/smi-svyazali-s-turchinovym-i-lukyanchukom-obmenniki-sovladelicey-kotoryh-yavlyaetsya-23-letnyaya-model-852620.html | script-title=ru:СМИ связали с Турчиновым и Лукьянчуком обменники, совладелицей которых является 23-летняя модель | publisher = TSN | language = ru | date = 3 May 2017 | access-date = 27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3847337-obmennye-punkty-turchynova-yzbehauit-nalohovoi-smy | script-title=ru:Обменные пункты Турчинова избегают налоговой — СМИ | publisher = Корреспондент.net | language = ru | date = 4 May 2017 | access-date = 27 April 2018}}</ref> Investigations on this subject were published in the Ukrainian media earlier.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://strana.ua/articles/analysis/24464-kak-okruzhenie-turchinova-monopolizirovalo-rynok-obmena-valyut.html | script-title=ru:Какое отношение имеет Турчинов к обменным пунктам в Украине | publisher = «[[Страна.ua]]» | language = ru | date = 27 July 2016 | access-date = 27 April 2018}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In June 2003, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine [[Viktor Shokin]] announced his intention to send the proposal to the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] an idea to bringing to trial the deputies Oleksandr Turchynov, Stepan Khmara and Mykolay Rudkovsky. According to Shokin, the People's deputies were insulting and beating the staff of the [[Lukyanivska Prison]]. Deputies demanded the release of Gennady Tymoshenko and Antonina Bolyura. They were incriminated with three cases of the [[Law of Ukraine#Criminal law|Criminal Code]]: "Capturing state buildings", "Threat to law enforcement officers", and "Excess of power with the use of weapons and verbal insulting of law enforcement officers."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://podrobnosti.ua/65670-genprokuratura-planiruet-privlech-k-ugolovnoj-otvetstvennosti-deputatov-shturmovavshih-sizo.html | script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура планирует привлечь к уголовной ответственности депутатов, штурмовавших СИЗО | publisher = podrobnosti.ua | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | access-date = 2 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/73958-genprokuratura-hochet-privlech-k-otvetstvennosti-treh-deputatov-verhovnoj-rady-obnovleno | script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура хочет привлечь к ответственности трех депутатов Верховной Рады (обновлено) | publisher = Korrespondent.net | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | access-date = 2 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2003/06/27/4373311/ | script-title=ru:Турчинов, Хмара, Рудьковский — криминальные хулиганы? | publisher = [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] | language = ru | date = 27 July 2003 | access-date = 2 April 2018}}</ref>

On 13 September 2003, tax officials detained at the office of the "Fatherland" party Ruslan Lukyanchuk, one of the assistants of Oleksandr Turchynov.

The [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine]] Svyatoslav Piskun then stated that the detention of Turchynov's assistant was part of a planned process of initiating a criminal case. According to Piskun, about hundreds of thousands of illegally converted dollars were sent to the office of the "Fatherland" party.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://podrobnosti.ua/37925-vozbuzhdeno-ugolovnoe-delo-protiv-turchinova.html | script-title=ru:Возбуждено уголовное дело против Турчинова | publisher = podrobnosti.ua | date = 2 October 2002 | access-date = 27 March 2018 | language = ru}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]]'' newspaper referring to deputy mayor of [[Kyiv]] [[Leonid Chernovetskyi]], Mr. Turchynov is related to unlawful construction in the Landscape Valley (''Peyzazhna aleya'') district of [[Kyiv]]. In autumn of 2004 the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine]] signed an investment contract with JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' (OAO "Ukrayinsʹke mayno") on the construction of an apartment building in this district. With this the share of the MFA in the project made just 20%. The Ministry actually became a cover for the businessmen. As of 1 January 2007, 91.1% of the JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' shares belonged to ''Eclad Invest Ltd.'' (USA), and 8.2% to Valery Kovalenko. Previously, the shares of JSC ''Ukrainian Property'' belonged to JSC ''Financial holding "L-Holding"'', the largest shareholder of which was JSC ''Centre of Financial Technologies''. Oleksandr Turchinov owned 26.2% of the shares of this company.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://from-ua.com/news/131567-smi-turchinov-prichasten-k-nezakonnoi-zastroike-na-peizazhnoi-allee.html | script-title=ru:СМИ: Турчинов причастен к незаконной застройке на Пейзажной аллее | publisher = from-ua.com | date = 7 May 2008 | access-date = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.segodnya.ua/newsarchive/ctrojku-na-pejzazhnoj-allee-initsiiroval-turchinov---kilchitskaja.html | script-title=ru:Стройку на Пейзажной аллее инициировал Турчинов – Кильчицкая | publisher = [[Segodnya]] | date = 17 April 2008 | access-date = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}</ref> On 23 April 2008, the Kyiv District Administrative Court ruled that Oleksandr Turchinov had no personal relationship with the construction of the Landscape Valley.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.unian.net/politics/111971-sud-ustanovil-chto-turchinov-na-peyzajnoy-allee-nichego-ne-stroit.html | script-title=ru:Суд установил, что Турчинов на Пейзажной аллее ничего не строит | publisher = [[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]] | date = 23 April 2008 | access-date = 19 March 2018 | language = ru}}</ref>

In August 2016, journalists of the ''Economichna Pravda'' (''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' project) accused Oleksandr Turchinov of influencing the leadership of the [[State Special Communications Service of Ukraine]] (DSTSZI).

In March 2017, former people's deputy [[Oleksandr Shepelev]] accused Turchinov and [[Ruslan Lukyanchuk]] of stealing and withdrawing $800 million from the state budget with the assistance of the [[International Monetary Fund]]. According to Shepelev, in 2009 Turchinov and Lukyanchuk "were taxed by the heads of ministries and state enterprises", and received money from them to the accounts of the ''European Bank for Rational Financing'' (EBRD). There, hryvnias were converted into the [[cash]] dollars, which then were withdrawn to [[Offshore financial centre|offshores]] through the Baltic banks and [[Shell corporation|shell companies]]. The largest of these companies was ''Fortex'', owned by Lukyanchuk and registered in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].
