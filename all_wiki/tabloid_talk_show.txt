A '''tabloid talk show''' is a subgenre of the [[talk show]] genre that emphasizes controversial and sensationalistic topical subject matter. The subgenre originated in the United States and achieved peak viewership from the mid-1980s through the end of the 1990s.<ref name="grimes1995">{{cite news|title=Word for Word/Television Sociology; The Deconstruction of Jenny And Jerry, Maury and Montel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/10/weekinreview/word-for-word-television-sociology-deconstruction-jenny-jerry-maury-montel.html|author=William Grimes|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=December 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Trash TV: Insightful and in touch with America|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1996-04-09/news/1996100029_1_ricki-lake-jessy-raphael-airtime|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=April 4, 1996|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref> Airing mostly during the day and distributed mostly through [[broadcast syndication|television syndication]], tabloid talk shows originated in the 1960s and early 1970s with series hosted by [[Joe Pyne]], [[Les Crane]], and [[Phil Donahue]]; the format was popularized by personal confession-filled ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', which debuted nationally in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coming After Oprah|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/l/x/lxm7/oprah.html|publisher=[[Penn State University]]|date=|accessdate=November 19, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030625111121/http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/l/x/lxm7/oprah.html|archivedate=June 25, 2003|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Oprahization|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/Oprahization.asp|author=Paul McFedries|publisher=Word Spy|date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> The format has since been emulated outside the United States, with the United Kingdom, Latin America and the Philippines all having popular shows that fit the format.

Tabloid talk shows have sometimes been described as the "freak shows" of the late 20th century, since most of their guests were outside the mainstream. The host invites a group of guests to discuss an emotional or provocative topic – ranging from marital infidelity to more outlandish topics – and the guests are encouraged to make public confessions and resolve their problems with on-camera "group therapy".<ref>{{cite news|title=Baring All on a Talk Show Is No Way To Solve Problems|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-05/features/9501050061_1_gordon-elliott-show-talk-audience|author=Wendy Hundley|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=January 5, 1995}}</ref> Similar shows are popular throughout Europe.

Tabloid talk shows are sometimes described using the [[pejorative]] [[slang]] term "[[#Trash TV|Trash TV]]", particularly when producers appear to purposely design their shows to create controversy or confrontation, as in the case of ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'' (such as when a 1988 show featuring [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[Neo-Nazism]] members, [[anti-racism]] people and [[Jews]] activists led to an on-camera brawl) and ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'', which focused on lurid [[wikt:tryst|trysts]] – often between family members.<ref>{{cite web|title=Truth Behind Jerry Springer &#124; Jerry Springer Awful Truths Shocking fact from the "Springer" set: Some people love flying chairs.

==History==
''The [[Les Crane]] Show'', a network talk show that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of its late-night schedule from August 1964 to February 1965, was the first talk show to follow the format. Host Les Crane would bring on controversial guests, interview them in an aggressive but fair style, and take questions from the audience. Crane was the first to interview an openly gay man on-air and frequently interviewed black celebrities, folk singers and other [[taboo]] guests; Crane was rebuffed in his efforts to interview [[lesbian]] on one of his shows. The format was designed as competition to [[NBC]]'s long-running franchise, ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight]]'', and its hard style contrasted with ''Tonight's'' more comedic format. The show generated significant controversy and was canceled after six months, later being retooled into a lighter talk show in an effort to boost ratings. [[Joe Pyne]], a [[Los Angeles]]-based host, also hosted a similar talk show in syndication, although the focus was more on his confrontations with guests and less on audience participation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside the Depths of Talk TV|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-06/entertainment/ca-50893_1_talk-shows|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 6, 1996}}</ref> In Chicago, [[Lee Phillip Bell]] occasionally addressed controversial topics within the context of her long-running talk show as early as the late 1950s, but her show did not have a studio audience.<ref name=vault>{{YouTube|yGDgWEFLQg4|CBS 2 Vault: A Salute To Lee Phillip}}</ref>

=== Trash TV ===
The subgenre is sometimes described in pejorative slang as "trash TV", particularly when the show hosts appear to purposely design their shows to create controversy or confrontation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Killing Poses Hard Questions About Talk TV|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/14/us/killing-poses-hard-questions-about-talk-tv.html|author=[[Bill Carter]]|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=March 14, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Them's Fightin' Words|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/05/entertainment/ca-36037|author=Greg Braxton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=April 5, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Talk of the Town?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/31/entertainment/ca-28056|author=Kristin Hohenadel|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Times Mirror Company|date=October 31, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Television: A League Of Her Own|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984746,00.html|author=Ginia Bellafante|periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=June 24, 1996|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}</ref> One of the earliest of the post-Oprah shows was ''Geraldo'', which was oriented toward controversial guests and theatricality. As an example, one of the early show topics was titled "Men in Lace Panties and the Women Who Love Them". One 1988 episode featuring [[white power skinhead]] ended in a brawl that left host [[Geraldo Rivera]] with a broken nose.<ref>{{cite web|title=24&nbsp;×&nbsp;7|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0763020.html|publisher=Factmonster.com|date=|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> This incident led to ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'}}s characterization of his show as "Trash TV". The term was subsequently applied to tabloid talk shows at their most extreme; some hosts, such as [[Jerry Springer]], have proudly accepted the label, while other hosts, such as [[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]], resent it.

''The Jerry Springer Show'' would gain a reputation as the most confrontational and sexually explicit, with stories of lurid trysts – often between family members, and with stripping guests and audience members.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aim Higher, Forum Urges Talk Shows|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60616F83F5E0C7B8EDDA90994DD494D81|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 28, 1995|accessdate=December 6, 2010}}</ref> Although the show started as a politically oriented talk show, the search for higher ratings in an extremely competitive market led Springer to topics often described as tawdry and provocative, increasing its viewership in the process. Topics included partners admitting their [[adultery]] to each other, women or men admitting to their partners that they were transvestites who had convinced their partners that they were a different sex, or revealing that they were pre- or post-op [[transsexuals]], [[paternity test]]s, numerous features on the Ku Klux Klan and other [[racism]], and an exposé of [[shock rock]] featuring [[Eldon Hoke]] from [[Mentors (band)|Mentors]] and an appearance from [[gwar]]. Violence and fights between guests became almost [[ritual]], with head of security [[Steve Wilkos]] separating the combatants before fights escalated into something more serious. Though frequently criticized, Springer claimed that he had no creative control over the guests.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/jerry-springer-moving-to-the-cw-this-fall|title='Jerry Springer' Moving to The CW This Fall|last=Albaniak|first=Paige|date=13 June 2018|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=14 June 2018}}</ref>

''[[Maury (talk show)|Maury]]'' would go on to become one of the most enduring examples of the format. Debuting the same season as Springer and likewise initially having a more serious focus, host [[Maury Povich]] over time developed a largely formulaic series that carved out a niche: by the 2010s, ''Maury'' had become almost synonymous with adversarial [[DNA paternity testing]] and [[polygraph]]. A typical episode of ''Maury'' features an urban poor woman, often with a checkered sexual background, accusing a past sexual partner of being the father of her child, which the man will categorically deny. At the end of the segment, Povich dramatically reveals the results of the paternity test; if the test proves that the man is not the father, he will celebrate boisterously, sometimes infamously in dance or by running into the audience to high-five audience members, as the mother runs backstage sobbing, while if he is determined to be the father, the mother will strut in triumph, sometimes holding a copy of the results and shoving the results into the now-proven father's face. By the 21st century, ''Maury'' had already earned a reputation as being "miles further down the commode" than Springer, and the name of the show would become a [[proverb]] for dysfunctional parental situations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/candy/2002/2002-03-13-candy.htm|title=There shouldn't be a next time, America|last=Matheson|first=Whitney|date=December 3, 2002|work=USA Today|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}</ref>

===Controversy===
{{unrefsect|date=March 2020}}
On an episode of ''The Jenny Jones Show'' titled "Same-Sex Secret Crushes", taped on March 6, 1995, a [[gay]] man named [[Scott Amedure]] confessed his love for his friend, Jonathan Schmitz. Schmitz reacted with laughter while on the show, but became disturbed by the incident later. He had a history of [[mental disorder]] and [[alcoholism]]/[[substance abuse]]. Three days after the show's initial airing, Schmitz killed Amedure. Schmitz was later convicted of [[murder]] and was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison.

Amedure's family then filed a lawsuit against the producers of ''The Jenny Jones Show''. In interviews, Jones said that her producers told Schmitz that his admirer could be a male, but Schmitz maintained they misled him into thinking it would be a woman. While under oath, Jones admitted that the show did not want Schmitz to know that his admirer was a man. Amedure's family won the initial ruling, and the show was ordered to pay them $25 million.

===Decline and resurgence===
By the early [[2000s]], the genre began to decline in popularity with viewers, and certain hosts either saw their shows cancelled due to low ratings (such as Jenny Jones and Sally Jessy Raphaël), died (such as [[Wally George]]) or voluntarily ended their shows to pursue other interests (such as Ricki Lake). Many media analysts have attributed the decline in popularity of tabloid talk shows and daytime talk in general to competition from [[cable television]] and [[satellite television]], and an increased number of women in the workforce (resulting in a corresponding decline in potential viewers for [[daytime television]], a phenomenon that had also mostly killed off the tabloid talk show's predecessor in daytime lineups, the daytime [[game show]], and would later force cutbacks in [[soap opera]]s, another daytime staple, as well). Common presumptions indicated that viewers were tiring of the constant recycling of subjects that are often shown on such programs.<ref>{{cite news|title=Falling Ratings Threaten All Except Top Talk Shows|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/20/arts/falling-ratings-threaten-all-except-top-talk-shows.html|author=Lawrie Mifflin|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=December 20, 1995}}</ref> Another explanation would be that the same audience shifted directly over to the new [[reality television]] and [[court show]] genre that rose to prominence at around the same time; most reality television and many court shows featured conflicts and raunchy material that would be normally seen in a tabloid talk show. (When Springer's show was canceled in 2018, it was replaced with a court show hosted by Springer.)<ref name="nypost">{{cite web |title=‘Judge Jerry’ Springer is coming to your TV next fall |url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/22/judge-jerry-springer-is-coming-to-your-tv-next-fall/ |website=New York Post |accessdate=26 November 2018 |date=23 October 2018}}</ref> As early as the late 1990s, hosts such as Oprah Winfrey, and to a lesser extent [[Montel Williams]], began to distance their programs from the genre by refocusing them to incorporate more serious subject matter or staying on stage in the manner of more traditional talk shows. Another example of this trend was Geraldo Rivera ending his show in 1998 to focus on his [[CNBC]] talk show ''[[Rivera Live]]'' full-time. New talk shows also followed the trend of emphasizing less bawdy themes; ''[[Ananda Lewis|The Ananda Lewis Show]]'' (which ran from 2001 to 2002) made a point of being an alternative to the tabloid style talk shows still airing at the time.

''The Phil Donahue Show'', seen by many as originating the genre, was cancelled in 1996 as it could not compete with the new crop of shows. Donahue and Rivera would attempt to re-establish their journalistic credentials on cable television: Donahue with a short-lived talk show on [[MSNBC]], and Rivera going back to his "roving reporter" roots, filing reports on CNBC, [[NBC]] and [[Fox News]]. Maury Povich began hosting a weekend news show in 2006 with wife [[Connie Chung]] on MSNBC while still hosting his daytime show. ''[[Weekends with Maury and Connie]]'' was cancelled after six months due to low ratings, and received harsh reviews by many of the same critics who criticized his daytime talk show. Jerry Springer, while continuing to host his televised "[[freak show]]", also hosted [[Springer on the Radio]] on [[Air America (radio network)|Air America]] in the mid-2000s. The syndicated ''[[Judge Hatchett]]'' dealt with many of the topics of tabloid talk shows, but was set within the framework of a court show and was more direct in its efforts to intervene in the participants' lives.

Only a handful of the shows from the tabloid talk era remained in production as of 2011, and only one new tabloid talk show premiered between 2000 and that time: ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'', which ran from 2005 to 2010, was a replacement for ''Ricki Lake'' after Lake quit her show. ''Tyra''{{'}}s format was more contemporary in the style of ''Oprah'' and ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', but had gone over the limits of her show by having her audience members appear in their underwear along with her and most famously, pretending to suffer the effects from [[rabies]] to a shocked reaction.

Tabloid shows have seen a slight comeback in the late 2000s and early 2010s, although with a greater emphasis on [[self-help]] than their predecessors (owing to the popularity of shows such as ''Dr. Phil''). Steve Wilkos eventually left ''Jerry Springer'' and received his own syndicated talk show, ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]'', which debuted in 2007. The once-defunct [[Tribune Entertainment]] ordered new pilots for tabloid-style talk shows hosted by radio shock jock [[Bubba the Love Sponge]] and conservative talk radio host [[Bill Cunningham (talk show host)|Bill Cunningham]], for a possible fall 2011 debut; while Bubba's show was not picked up, ''[[The Bill Cunningham Show]]'' debuted in limited syndication in September 2011 before moving to [[The CW]] (becoming the only talk show on U.S. network television not to be lifestyle- or celebrity interview-oriented) in September 2012; Cunningham continued to host the show until he decided to leave in 2016, at which point [[Robert Irvine]] took Cunningham's place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tribune looking to get back into syndication|url=http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/24739.html|website=Radio & Television Business Report|publisher=TPR|accessdate=July 9, 2010|date=June 3, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605091123/http://www.rbr.com/tv-cable/24739.html|archivedate=June 5, 2010|df=}}</ref> [[The Jeremy Kyle Show (American TV series)|An American version]] of the British tabloid talk show ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'' also launched in September 2011. ''[[The Ricki Lake Show (2012 talk show)|Ricki Lake]]'' and ''[[The Queen Latifah Show]]'' were both slated to return in September 2012, but with revamped, more mature formats (Latifah's as a more celebrity and lifestyle-focused program and Lake's focusing more on lifestyle and self-help topics) to reflect the hosts' increased age; also set to debut was a show hosted by [[Trisha Goddard]], who hosted a tabloid show in the United Kingdom for several years. Lake's new show lasted only a year, and Queen Latifah's was delayed until September 2013 and was cancelled after two years. Goddard and Kyle also failed to gain traction with their U.S. talk show efforts, and both were canceled after two seasons.

''Face the Truth'', a half-hour series which debuted in the fall of 2018, attempted to cross the tabloid format with the [[panel show]] with host [[Vivica A. Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/exclusive-ctds-face-the-truth-firm-go-for-fall|title=CTD’s ‘Face the Truth’ Firm Go for Fall|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> The program failed however, and was cancelled after one season.

==Influence==
In the scholarly text ''"Freaks Talk Back"'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua Gamson, Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity, excerpt and interview|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/280640.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> Yale University sociology professor [[Joshua Gamson]] credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for [[gay]], [[bisexuality]], transsexuals and [[transgender]] people, and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review [[Michael Bronski]] wrote "In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered {{sic}} people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Jane Whitney, and Geraldo, people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week."<ref>{{cite web|title=Freaks Talk Back: Tabloid Talk Shows and Sexual Nonconformity: Joshua Gamson: 9780226280653: Amazon.com: Books|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226280659/|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|date=|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref>

Gamson credits the tabloid talk show fad with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a recent ''Time'' magazine article describing early 21st century gays coming out of the closet younger and younger, and the decline of suicide rates among gays and lesbians. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused homosexuals to be embraced on more traditional forms of media. Examples include sitcoms like ''[[Will & Grace]]'', primetime shows like ''[[Queer Eye (2003 TV series)|Queer Eye]]'' and feature films like the [[Academy Awards]]-winning ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''.

While having changed with the times from her tabloid talk show roots, Winfrey continued to include gay guests by using her show to promote openly gay personalities like her hairdresser, makeup artist, and decorator [[Nate Berkus]] who inspired an outpouring of sympathy from middle America after grieving the loss of his partner in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show''. Winfrey's "therapeutic" hosting style and the tabloid talk show genre has been either credited or blamed for leading the media counterculture of the 1980s and 1990s, which some believe broke 20th century taboos, led to America's self-help obsession and created confession culture. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' coined the term "Oprahfication" to refer to the concept of public confession as a form of therapy and ''Time'' magazine named Winfrey one of the "100 Most Influential People" of the 20th century.

Sociologist Vicki Abt criticised tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book ''Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV Talk Show'', Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Oprah's success was blurring the lines between normal and deviant behavior. Television critic [[Jeff Jarvis]] agreed, saying "Oprah was the one that trashed daytime TV. She took the Donahue format and then brought on the whiny misfits and losers and screamers and shouters, and then everyone, including Donahue, followed her, until it went overboard. Then finally she came back and recanted and said, no, no, now I'm the queen of quality on TV."<ref>{{cite web|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/29/rs.01.html|website=CNN.com|date=January 29, 2006|accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> Talk shows were often spoofed in mainstream media, with ''[[Night Stand with Dick Dietrick]]'' being one of the full-length spoofs of the medium (complete with fake guests and audience members asking questions).

===Oprah talks to Phil Donahue===
In the September 2002 issue of ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]'', Oprah Winfrey interviewed Phil Donahue at his [[Manhattan]] [[penthouse apartment]] in what she described as a "full-circle" moment. She wrote in the article's introduction, "If there had been no Phil Donahue show, there would be no Oprah Winfrey show. He was the first to acknowledge that women are interested in more than mascara tips and cake recipes – that we're intelligent, we're concerned about the world around us, and we want the best possible lives for ourselves."

In the interview, Donahue explained that "the show became a place where women discussed issues that didn't naturally come up, and certainly not in mixed company. Much of what we talked about on the air is what women had been talking about in ladies' rooms." Donahue recalled that he finally had to do a show about doctors who hated him because, for the first time, women were challenging their physicians. He also discussed how hosting the show helped him overcome his own taboos. "I put a gay guy on in 1968 – a real live homosexual sitting right next to me. I was terrified ... I'm from [[University of Notre Dame]]. And believe me that's the one thing you didn't want to be doing at Notre Dame was hangin' with gay people ... If you don't understand those feelings then you don't understand homophobia. There's a reason for the closet. As the years went by after that show, I got involved in gay politics, and through my activism, I began to realize what it must be like to be born, to live, and to die in the closet."

Donahue also commented on the new crop of tabloid talk shows, such as Jenny Jones – "One-Night Stand Reunions". When Winfrey reminded him "You started all this," he replied, "If that's what you think, I'm proud. What I'm most proud of is that we involved the audience more than anybody else in the game. People who owned the airwaves got to use them in this wild thing called democracy." While both Winfrey and Donahue admitted to having done shows that were "naughty", both wondered if newer shows like Jerry Springer had crossed over into a whole different territory. Reflecting on the genre as a whole Donahue added, "If you want to know about America's culture in the last half of the 20th century, watch some of these programs."

==Europe==
===In Greece===
[[Annita Pania]] is the longest living representative of the tabloid talk genre in [[Greece]], which reached its peak during the mid-1990s.

===In the United Kingdom===
American tabloid talk is widely viewed in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news|title=TELEVISION; Stiff Upper Lips on British Talk Shows (Lower, Too)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-stiff-upper-lips-on-british-talk-shows-lower-too.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 7, 1995|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref> First-run tabloid chat shows are also produced in the United Kingdom (especially ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''), which are largely similar to their American counterparts, albeit more tame in style. Most hosts get more involved with their guests, rather than taking an apathetic attitude in a fashion similar to Jerry Springer and usually the audience is not as involved. [[Jeremy Kyle]], for example, was known for his confrontational attitude towards those on his programme, ''[[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]'', while others like [[Trisha Goddard]] are more pacifist. Springer himself hosted a series on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] as ''The Jerry Springer Show''. [[Vanessa Feltz]]'s programme ''[[The Vanessa Show]]'' was cancelled by the [[BBC]] in 1999, as a result of the discovery that some participants were actually actors cast from a talent agency, although it was known previously for outlandish stories similar to the American shows.<ref>{{cite news|title='Vanessa Show' is axed by BBC|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/vanessa-show-is-axed-by-bbc-1099164.html|author=Paul McCann|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=June 10, 1999}}</ref>
