The '''Parliament of the United Kingdom'''{{efn|group=note|name=a|Alternatively called the ''British Parliament'', ''UK Parliament'' or ''Westminster Parliament''.

Prior to the opening of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in October 2009, the House of Lords also performed a [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judicial role]] through the [[Law Lords]].

The House of Commons is an elected chamber with [[Elections in the United Kingdom|elections]] to 650 [[single member constituencies]] held at least every five years under the [[first-past-the-post system]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How MPs are elected |work=How Parliament works |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> The two houses meet in separate [[legislative chamber|chambers]] in the Palace of Westminster.

Most cabinet ministers are from the Commons, whilst junior ministers can be from either house. 

With the global expansion of the [[British Empire]], the UK Parliament has [[Westminster system|shaped the political systems of many countries as ex-colonies]] and so it has been called the "[[Mother of Parliaments]]."<ref>{{cite web |last=Jenkin |first=Clive |title=Debate: 30&nbsp;June 2004: Column 318 |work=House of Commons debates |publisher=[[Hansard]] |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040630/debtext/40630-15.htm |accessdate=10 February 2008}}</ref>{{efn|group=note|However, [[John Bright]]{{spaced ndash}}who coined the epithet{{spaced ndash}}used it in reference to the political culture of [[England]] rather than just the parliamentary system.<ref>{{cite news |title=Messers.

In theory, the UK's supreme legislative power is officially vested in the Crown-in-Parliament. However, [[the Crown]] normally acts on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the prime minister, and the powers of the House of Lords are limited to only delaying legislation; thus power is ''de facto'' vested in the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Queen in Parliament |work=The Monarchy Today: Queen and State |publisher=[[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|The British Monarchy]] |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/OutPut/Page4691.asp |accessdate=19 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118231241/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4691.asp |archivedate=18 January 2008 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{for|histories of the parliaments preceding the UK Parliament|Parliament of England|Parliament of Scotland|Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament of Ireland}}
{{for|a summary|Parliament in the Making#Historical events in the development of Parliament{{!}}Parliament in the Making}}
The [[Parliament of Great Britain]] was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the [[Treaty of Union]] by [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] passed by the [[Parliament of England]] (established 1215) and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] (c.1235), both Acts of Union stating, "That the United Kingdom of Great Britain be represented by one and the same Parliament to be styled The Parliament of Great Britain." At the start of the 19th century, Parliament was further enlarged by [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] ratified by the Parliament of Great Britain and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] (1297) that abolished the latter and added 100 Irish MPs and 32 Lords to the former to create the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] formally amended the name to the "Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",<ref>''Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927''</ref> five years after the secession of the [[Irish Free State]].

===Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland===
[[File:Print of Houses of Parliament before 1834 Fire.jpg|thumb|Print of the [[Palace of Westminster]], before [[Burning of Parliament|it burnt down in 1834]]]]
The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] was created on 1 January 1801, by the merger of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] under the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. The principle of ministerial responsibility to the lower House did not develop until the 19th century—the House of Lords was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice. Members of the House of Commons (MPs) were elected in an antiquated [[electoral system]], under which [[constituency|constituencies]] of vastly different sizes existed. Thus, the borough of [[Old Sarum]], with seven voters, could elect two members, as could the borough of [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]], which had almost completely disappeared into the sea due to land erosion.

Many small constituencies, known as pocket or [[rotten borough]]s, were controlled by members of the House of Lords, who could ensure the election of their relatives or supporters. During the reforms of the 19th century, beginning with the [[Reform Act 1832]], the electoral system for the House of Commons was progressively regularised. No longer dependent on the Lords for their seats, MPs grew more assertive.

The supremacy of the British House of Commons was reaffirmed in the early 20th century. In 1909, the Commons passed the so-called "[[People's Budget]]," which made numerous changes to the taxation system which were detrimental to wealthy landowners. The House of Lords, which consisted mostly of powerful landowners, rejected the Budget. On the basis of the Budget's popularity and the Lords' consequent unpopularity, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] narrowly won two general elections in 1910.

Using the result as a mandate, the Liberal Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], introduced the Parliament Bill, which sought to restrict the powers of the House of Lords. (He did not reintroduce the land tax provision of the People's Budget.) When the Lords refused to pass the bill, Asquith countered with a promise extracted from the King in secret before the second general election of 1910 and requested the creation of several hundred Liberal peers, so as to erase the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the House of Lords. In the face of such a threat, the House of Lords narrowly passed the bill.

The [[Parliament Act 1911]], as it became, prevented the Lords from blocking a [[money bill]] (a bill dealing with taxation), and allowed them to delay any other bill for a maximum of three sessions (reduced to two sessions in 1949), after which it could become law over their objections. However, regardless of the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the House of Lords has always retained the unrestricted power to veto any bill outright which attempts to extend the life of a parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ |title=The Parliament Acts |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref>

===Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland===
The [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] created the parliaments of [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] and reduced the representation of both parts at Westminster. The number of Northern Ireland seats was increased again after the introduction of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] in 1973. The [[Irish Free State]] became independent in 1922, and in 1927 parliament was renamed the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Further reforms to the House of Lords were made in the 20th century. The [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] authorised the regular creation of [[life peerage]] dignities. By the 1960s, the regular creation of hereditary peerage dignities had ceased; thereafter, almost all new peers were life peers only.

The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, although it made an exception for 92 of them to be elected to life-terms by the other hereditary peers, with by-elections upon their death. The House of Lords is now a chamber that is subordinate to the House of Commons. Additionally, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] led to abolition of the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] with the creation of the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in October 2009.

==Composition and powers==
The legislative authority, the [[Crown-in-Parliament]], has three separate elements: the Monarch, the [[House of Lords]], and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. No individual may be a member of both Houses, and members of the House of Lords are legally barred from voting in elections for members of the House of Commons. Formerly, no-one could be a member of Parliament while holding an [[office of profit]] under the Crown, thus maintaining the [[separation of powers]], but the principle has been gradually eroded. Until 1919, Members of Parliament who were appointed to ministerial office lost their seats in the House of Commons and had to seek re-election; the rule was abolished in 1926. Holders of offices are ineligible to serve as a Member of Parliament under the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]].

[[Royal Assent]] of the Monarch is required for all Bills to become law, and certain delegated legislation must be made by the Monarch by [[Order in Council]]. The Crown also has executive powers which do not depend on Parliament, through [[Royal Prerogative|prerogative powers]], including the power to make treaties, declare war, award honours, and appoint officers and civil servants. In practice these are always exercised by the monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the other ministers of [[HM Government]]. The Prime Minister and government are directly accountable to Parliament, through its control of public finances, and to the public, through the election of members of parliament.

The Monarch also appoints the Prime Minister, who then forms a government from members of the Houses of Parliament. This must be someone who could command a majority in a confidence vote in the House of Commons. In the past the monarch has occasionally had to make a judgement, as in the appointment of [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in 1963 when it was thought that the incumbent Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], had become ill with terminal cancer. However, today the monarch is advised by the outgoing Prime Minister as to whom he or she should offer the position to next.

The House of Lords is known formally as, "The Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled," the Lords Spiritual being bishops of the [[Church of England]] and the Lords Temporal being [[Peerage|Peers of the Realm]]. The Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal are considered separate "[[Estates of the realm|estates]]," but they sit, debate and vote together.

Since the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], the powers of the House of Lords have been very much less than those of the House of Commons. All bills except [[money bills]] are debated and voted upon in the House of Lords; however, by voting against a bill, the House of Lords can only delay it for a maximum of two parliamentary sessions over a year. After that time, the House of Commons can force the Bill through without the Lords' consent, under the Parliament Acts. The House of Lords can also hold the government to account through questions to government ministers and the operation of a small number of select committees. The highest court in England & Wales and in Northern Ireland used to be a committee of the House of Lords, but it became an independent [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|supreme court]] in 2009.

The Lords Spiritual formerly included all of the senior clergymen of the Church of England—archbishops, bishops, abbots and mitred priors. Upon the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under Henry VIII the abbots and mitred priors lost their positions in Parliament. All [[diocesan bishop]]s continued to sit in Parliament, but the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]], and later Acts, provide that only the 26 most senior are Lords Spiritual. These always include the incumbents of the "five great [[episcopal see|sees]]," namely the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and the [[Bishop of Winchester]]. The remaining 21 Lords Spiritual are the most senior diocesan bishops, ranked in order of [[consecration]], although the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] makes time-limited provision for vacancies to be filled by women who are bishops.

The Lords Temporal are life peers created under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]] and the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], in addition to 92 hereditary peers under the [[House of Lords Act 1999]]. Formerly, the Lords Temporal were exclusively hereditary peers. The right of some hereditary peers to sit in Parliament was not automatic: after Scotland and England united into Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that all peers whose dignities had been created by English kings could sit in Parliament, but those whose dignities had been created by Scottish kings were to elect a limited number of "[[representative peers]]." A similar arrangement was made in respect of Ireland when it was united with Great Britain in 1801, but when southern Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 the election of Irish representative peers ceased. By the [[Peerage Act 1963]], the election of Scottish representative peers also ended, and all Scottish peers were granted the right to sit in Parliament. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, only life peerages (that is to say, peerage dignities which cannot be inherited) automatically entitle their holders to seats in the House of Lords. Of the hereditary peers, only 92—the [[Earl Marshal]], the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and the 90 elected by other peers—retain their seats in the House.

The Commons, the last of the "estates" of the Kingdom, are represented in the House of Commons, which is known formally as, "The Honourable The Commons in Parliament Assembled" ("commons" coming not from the term "commoner," but from ''{{lang|fr|commune}}'', the old French term for a district).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As of 2019, the House consists of 650 members, however one seat is left vacant by the Speaker of the House, who must remain politically impartial, and so does not get a vote on the passing of bills. Each Member of Parliament (MP) is chosen by a single constituency by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|First-Past-the-Post]] electoral system. There are 650 constituencies in the United Kingdom, each made up of an average of 65,925 voters. The First-Past-the-Post system means that every constituency elects one MP each (except the constituency of the Speaker, whose seat is uncontested). Each voter assigns one vote for one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected as MP to represent their constituency. A party needs win 326 constituencies (known as "seats") to win a majority in the House of Commons. In the event that no party achieves a majority, a situation of no overall control occurs - commonly known as a Hung Parliament. In the event of a Hung Parliament, the party with the most seats has the opportunity to form a coalition with other parties, so their combined seat tally extends past the 326-seat majority. Universal adult [[suffrage]] exists for those 18 and over; citizens of the United Kingdom, and those of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] resident in the United Kingdom, are qualified to vote, unless they are in prison at the time of the election. The term of members of the House of Commons depends on the term of Parliament, a maximum of five years; a general election, during which all the seats are contested, occurs after each dissolution (see below).

All legislation must be passed by the House of Commons to become law and it controls taxation and the supply of money to the government. Government ministers (including the Prime Minister) must regularly answer questions in the House of Commons and there are a number of [[Select Committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]] that scrutinise particular issues and the workings of the government. There are also mechanisms that allow members of the House of Commons to bring to the attention of the government particular issues affecting their constituents.

==State Opening of Parliament==
{{Main|State Opening of Parliament}}
The State Opening of Parliament is an annual event that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is held in the [[House of Lords]] Chamber. Before 2012, it took place in November or December,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-stateopening/ |title=State Opening of Parliament |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=House of Lords Information Office |accessdate=14 October 2009}}</ref> or, in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembled. From 2012 onwards, the ceremony has taken place in May or June.

[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Leading 17th century Parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] is one of the [[Five Members]] annually commemorated]]
Upon the signal of the Monarch, the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] raises their wand of office to signal to [[Black Rod]], who is charged with summoning the House of Commons and has been waiting in the Commons lobby. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords and an [[Inspector#United Kingdom|inspector of police]], approaches the doors to the Chamber of the Commons. In 1642, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] stormed into the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the [[Five Members]], who included the celebrated English patriot and leading Parliamentarian [[John Hampden]]. This action sparked the [[English Civil War]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=John Joseph |last1=Bagley |first2=A.

Since then, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is in session.<ref name="State opening">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/guides/newsid_81000/81909.stm |title=Democracy Live: Black Rod |work=BBC News |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref> On Black Rod's approach, the doors are slammed shut against them, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch.<ref name="State opening"/> They then strike, with the end of their ceremonial staff (the Black Rod), three times on the closed doors of the Commons Chamber. They are then admitted, and announce the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons.<ref name="State opening"/>

The monarch reads a speech, known as the [[Speech from the Throne]], which is prepared by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government intends to seek the agreement of both Houses of Parliament.

After the monarch leaves, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an "Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech." But, first, each House considers a bill ''[[pro forma]]'' to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the [[Select Vestries Bill]], while the Commons equivalent is the [[Outlawries Bill]]. The Bills are considered for the sake of form only, and do not make any actual progress.

==Legislative procedure==
:''See also the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Stages of a bill|stages of a bill]] section in [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom]]''
Both houses of the British Parliament are presided over by a speaker, the [[Speaker of the  House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House]] for the Commons and the [[Lord Speaker]] in the House of Lords.

For the Commons, the approval of the Sovereign is theoretically required before the election of the Speaker becomes valid, but it is, by modern convention, always granted. The Speaker's place may be taken by the [[Chairman of Ways and Means]], the First Deputy Chairman, or the Second Deputy Chairman. (The titles of those three officials refer to the Committee of Ways and Means, a body which no longer exists.)

Prior to July 2006, the House of Lords was presided over by a [[Lord Chancellor]] (a Cabinet member), whose influence as Speaker was very limited (whilst the powers belonging to the Speaker of the House of Commons are vast). However, as part of the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the position of Speaker of the House of Lords (as it is termed in the Act) was separated from the office of Lord Chancellor (the office which has control over the judiciary as a whole), though the Lords remain largely self-governing. Decisions on points of order and on the disciplining of unruly members are made by the whole body, but by the Speaker alone in the Lower House. Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole (using the words "My Lords"), but those in the House of Commons are addressed to the Speaker alone (using "Mr Speaker" or "Madam Speaker"). Speeches may be made to [[List of people who have addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament|both Houses simultaneously]].

Both Houses may decide questions by [[voice vote]]; members shout out "Aye!" and "No!" in the Commons—or "Content!" and "Not-Content!" in the Lords—and the presiding officer declares the result. The pronouncement of either Speaker may be challenged, and a recorded vote (known as a [[division (vote)|division]]) demanded. (The Speaker of the House of Commons may choose to overrule a frivolous request for a division, but the Lord Speaker does not have that power.) In each House, a division requires members to file into one of the two lobbies alongside the Chamber; their names are recorded by clerks, and their votes are counted as they exit the lobbies to re-enter the Chamber. The Speaker of the House of Commons is expected to be non-partisan, and does not cast a vote except in the case of a tie; the Lord Speaker, however, votes along with the other Lords.

Both Houses normally conduct their business in public, and there are galleries where visitors may sit.

==Duration==

Originally there was no fixed limit on the length of a Parliament, but the [[Triennial Act 1694]] set the maximum duration at three years. As the frequent elections were deemed inconvenient, the [[Septennial Act 1715]] extended the maximum to seven years, but the [[Parliament Act 1911]] reduced it to five. During the [[Second World War]], the term was temporarily extended to ten years by Acts of Parliament. Since the end of the war the maximum has remained five years. Modern Parliaments, however, rarely continued for the maximum duration; normally, they were dissolved earlier. For instance, the [[Fifty-Second Parliament of the United Kingdom|52nd]], which assembled in 1997, was dissolved after four years. The Septennial Act was repealed by the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which established a presumption that a Parliament will last for five years, unless two thirds of the House of Commons votes for an early general election, or the government loses the confidence of the House.

Following a general election, a new Parliamentary session begins. Parliament is formally summoned 40 days in advance by the Sovereign, who is the source of parliamentary authority. On the day indicated by the Sovereign's proclamation, the two Houses assemble in their respective chambers. The Commons are then summoned to the House of Lords, where [[Lords Commissioners]] (representatives of the Sovereign) instruct them to elect a Speaker. The Commons perform the election; on the next day, they return to the House of Lords, where the Lords Commissioners confirm the election and grant the new Speaker the royal approval in the Sovereign's name.

The business of Parliament for the next few days of its session involves the taking of the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oaths of allegiance]]. Once a majority of the members have taken the oath in each House, the State Opening of Parliament may take place. The Lords take their seats in the House of Lords Chamber, the Commons appear at the Bar (at the entrance to the Chamber), and the Sovereign takes his or her seat on the throne. The Sovereign then reads the [[Speech from the Throne]]—the content of which is determined by the Ministers of the Crown—outlining the Government's legislative agenda for the upcoming year. Thereafter, each House proceeds to the transaction of legislative business.

By custom, before considering the Government's legislative agenda, a bill is introduced ''pro forma'' in each House—the [[Select Vestries Bill]] in the House of Lords and the [[Outlawries Bill]] in the House of Commons. These bills do not become laws; they are ceremonial indications of the power of each House to debate independently of the Crown. After the ''pro forma'' bill is introduced, each House debates the content of the Speech from the Throne for several days. Once each House formally sends its reply to the Speech, legislative business may commence, appointing committees, electing officers, passing resolutions and considering legislation.

A session of Parliament is brought to an end by a [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]]. There is a ceremony similar to the State Opening, but much less well known to the general public. Normally, the Sovereign does not personally attend the prorogation ceremony in the House of Lords; he or she is represented by Lords Commissioners. The next session of Parliament begins under the procedures described above, but it is not necessary to conduct another election of a Speaker or take the oaths of allegiance afresh at the beginning of such subsequent sessions. Instead, the State Opening of Parliament proceeds directly. To avoid the delay of opening a new session in the event of an emergency during the long summer recess, Parliament is no longer prorogued beforehand, but only after the Houses have reconvened in the autumn; the State Opening follows a few days later.

Each Parliament comes to an end, after a number of sessions, in anticipation of a general election. [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament is dissolved]] by virtue of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]]. Prior to that, dissolution was effected by the Sovereign, always on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister could seek dissolution at a time politically advantageous to his or her party. If the Prime Minister loses the support of the House of Commons, Parliament will dissolve and a new election will be held. Parliaments can also be dissolved if two-thirds of the House of Commons votes for an early election.

Formerly, the demise of the Sovereign automatically brought a Parliament to an end, the Crown being seen as the ''{{lang|la|caput, principium, et finis}}'' (beginning, basis and end) of the body, but this is no longer the case. The first change was during the reign of William and Mary, when it was seen to be inconvenient to have no Parliament at a time when succession to the Crown could be disputed, and an Act was passed that provided that a Parliament was to continue for six months after the death of a Sovereign, unless dissolved earlier. Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]] Parliament can now continue for as long as it would otherwise have done in the event of the death of the Sovereign.

After each Parliament concludes, the Crown issues writs to hold a general election and elect new members of the House of Commons, though membership of the House of Lords does not change.

==Legislative functions==
[[File:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Parliament meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]].]]
Laws can be made by Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament. While Acts can apply to the whole of the United Kingdom including Scotland, due to the continuing separation of [[Scots law]] many Acts do not apply to Scotland and may be matched either by equivalent Acts that apply to Scotland alone or, since 1999, by legislation set by the [[Scottish Parliament]] relating to devolved matters.

This has led to a paradox known as the [[West Lothian question]]. The existence of a devolved Scottish Parliament means that while Westminster MPs from Scotland may vote directly on matters that affect English constituencies, they may not have much power over their laws affecting their own constituency. Since there is no devolved "English Parliament," the converse is not true. While any Act of the Scottish Parliament may be overturned, amended or ignored by Westminster, in practice this has yet to happen. [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s enables the UK Parliament to vote on issues normally devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, as part of United Kingdom legislation.

Laws, in draft form known as bills, may be introduced by any member of either House. A bill introduced by a Minister is known as a "Government Bill"; one introduced by another member is called a "[[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Member's Bill]]." A different way of categorising bills involves the subject. Most bills, involving the general public, are called "[[public bill]]s." A bill that seeks to grant special rights to an individual or small group of individuals, or a body such as a local authority, is called a "[[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Bill]]." A Public Bill which affects private rights (in the way a Private Bill would) is called a "[[Hybrid Bill]]," although those that draft bills take pains to avoid this.

Private Members' Bills make up the majority of bills, but are far less likely to be passed than government bills. There are three methods for an MP to introduce a Private Member's Bill. The Private Members' Ballot (once per Session) put names into a ballot, and those who win are given time to propose a bill. The [[Ten Minute Rule]] is another method, where MPs are granted ten minutes to outline the case for a new piece of legislation. Standing Order 57 is the third method, which allows a bill to be introduced without debate if a day's notice is given to the Table Office. [[Filibuster]]ing is a danger, as an opponent of a bill can waste much of the limited time allotted to it. Private Members' Bills have no chance of success if the current government opposes them, but they are used in moral issues: the bills to decriminalise homosexuality and abortion were Private Members' Bills, for example. Governments can sometimes attempt to use Private Members' Bills to pass things it would rather not be associated with. "Handout bills" are bills which a government hands to MPs who win Private Members' Ballots.

Each Bill goes through several stages in each House. The first stage, called the [[first reading]], is a formality. At the [[second reading]], the general principles of the bill are debated, and the House may vote to reject the bill, by not passing the motion "That the Bill be now read a second time." Defeats of Government Bills in the Commons are extremely rare, the last being in 2005, and may constitute a [[motion of no confidence]]. (Defeats of Bills in the Lords never affect confidence and are much more frequent.)

Following the second reading, the bill is sent to a committee. In the House of Lords, the [[Committee of the Whole House]] or the [[Grand Committee]] are used. Each consists of all members of the House; the latter operates under special procedures, and is used only for uncontroversial bills. In the House of Commons, the bill is usually committed to a Public Bill Committee, consisting of between 16 and 50 members, but the Committee of the Whole House is used for important legislation. Several other types of committees, including Select Committees, may be used, but rarely. A committee considers the bill clause by clause, and reports the bill as amended to the House, where further detailed consideration ("consideration stage" or "report stage") occurs. However, a practice which used to be called the "kangaroo" (Standing Order 32) allows the Speaker to select which amendments are debated. This device is also used under Standing Order 89 by the committee chairman, to restrict debate in committee. The Speaker, who is impartial as between the parties, by convention selects amendments for debate which represent the main divisions of opinion within the House. Other amendments can technically be proposed, but in practice have no chance of success unless the parties in the House are closely divided. If pressed they would normally be casually defeated by acclamation.

Once the House has considered the bill, the third reading follows. In the House of Commons, no further amendments may be made, and the passage of the motion "That the Bill be now read a third time" is passage of the whole bill. In the House of Lords further amendments to the bill may be moved. After the passage of the third reading motion, the House of Lords must vote on the motion "That the Bill do now pass." Following its passage in one House, the bill is sent to the other House. If passed in identical form by both Houses, it may be presented for the Sovereign's Assent. If one House passes amendments that the other will not agree to, and the two Houses cannot resolve their disagreements, the bill will normally fail.

Since the passage of the Parliament Act 1911 the power of the House of Lords to reject bills passed by the House of Commons has been restricted, with further restrictions were placed by the Parliament Act 1949. If the House of Commons passes a public bill in two successive sessions, and the House of Lords rejects it both times, the Commons may direct that the bill be presented to the Sovereign for his or her Assent, disregarding the rejection of the Bill in the House of Lords. In each case, the bill must be passed by the House of Commons at least one calendar month before the end of the session. The provision does not apply to Private bills or to Public bills if they originated in the House of Lords or if they seek to extend the duration of a Parliament beyond five years. A special procedure applies in relation to bills classified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as "Money Bills." A Money Bill concerns ''solely'' national taxation or public funds; the Speaker's certificate is deemed conclusive under all circumstances. If the House of Lords fails to pass a Money Bill within one month of its passage in the House of Commons, the Lower House may direct that the Bill be submitted for the Sovereign's Assent immediately.{{sfn|May|Chisholm|1911}}

Even before the passage of the Parliament Acts, the Commons possessed pre-eminence in cases of financial matters. By ancient custom, the House of Lords may not introduce a bill relating to taxation or [[Westminster System|Supply]], nor amend a bill so as to insert a provision relating to taxation or Supply, nor amend a Supply Bill in any way. The House of Commons is free to waive this privilege, and sometimes does so to allow the House of Lords to pass amendments with financial implications. The House of Lords remains free to reject bills relating to Supply and taxation, but may be over-ruled easily if the bills are Money Bills. (A bill relating to revenue and Supply may not be a Money Bill if, for example, it includes subjects other than national taxation and public funds).

The last stage of a bill involves the granting of the [[Royal Assent]]. Theoretically, the Sovereign may either grant or withhold Royal Assent (make the bill a law or veto the bill). In modern times the Sovereign always grants the Royal Assent, using the [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] words "[[La Reyne le veult]]" (the Queen wishes it; "Le Roy" instead in the case of a king). The last refusal to grant the Assent was in 1708, when [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld her Assent from a bill "for the settling of Militia in Scotland," in the words "{{lang|xno|La reyne s'avisera}}" (the Queen will think it over).

Thus, every bill obtains the assent of all three components of Parliament before it becomes law (except where the House of Lords is over-ridden under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]). The words "BE IT ENACTED by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-,"{{sfn|May|Chisholm|1911}} or, where the House of Lords' authority has been over-ridden by use of the Parliament Acts, the words "BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-" appear near the beginning of each Act of Parliament. These words are known as the [[enacting formula]].

==Judicial functions==
Prior to the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in 2009, Parliament was the highest court in the realm for most purposes, but the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] had jurisdiction in some cases (for instance, appeals from ecclesiastical courts). The jurisdiction of Parliament arose from the ancient custom of petitioning the Houses to redress grievances and to do justice. The House of Commons ceased considering petitions to reverse the judgements of lower courts in 1399, effectively leaving the House of Lords as the court of last resort. In modern times, the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] were performed not by the whole House, but by the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]] (judges granted life peerage dignities under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]]) and by Lords of Appeal (other peers with experience in the judiciary). However, under the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], these judicial functions were transferred to the newly created [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in 2009, and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary became the first Justices of the Supreme Court. Peers who hold high judicial office are no longer allowed to vote or speak in the Lords until they retire as justices.

In the late 19th century, Acts allowed for the appointment of ''Scottish Lords of Appeal in Ordinary'' and ended appeal in Scottish criminal matters to the House of Lords, so that the [[High Court of Justiciary]] became the highest criminal court in [[Scotland]]. There is an argument that the provisions of Article XIX of the Union with England Act 1707 prevent any Court outside Scotland from hearing any appeal in criminal cases: "And that the said Courts or any other of the like nature after the Unions shall have no power to Cognosce Review or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within Scotland or stop the Execution of the same." The House of Lords judicial committee usually had a minimum of two Scottish Judges to ensure that some experience of [[Scots law]] was brought to bear on Scottish appeals in civil cases, from the [[Court of Session]]. The Supreme Court now usually has at least two Scottish judges, together with at least one from Northern Ireland.<ref>https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-library/lln2009-010appellate.pdf</ref> As Wales is developing its own judicature, it is likely that the same principle will be applied.

Certain other judicial functions have historically been performed by the House of Lords. Until 1948, it was the body in which peers had to be tried for [[felony|felonies]] or [[high treason]]; now, they are tried by normal juries. The last occasion of the trial of a peer in the House of Lords was in 1935. When the House of Commons [[impeachment|impeaches]] an individual, the trial takes place in the House of Lords. Impeachments are now possibly defunct, as the last one occurred in 1806. In 2006, a number of MPs attempted to revive the custom, having signed a motion for the impeachment of [[Tony Blair]], but this was unsuccessful.

==Relationship with the UK Government==
The British Government is answerable to the House of Commons. However, neither the Prime Minister nor members of the Government are elected by the House of Commons. Instead, the Queen requests the person most likely to command the support of a majority in the House, normally the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, to form a government. So that they may be accountable to the Lower House, the Prime Minister and most members of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] are, by convention, members of the House of Commons. The last Prime Minister to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Alec Douglas-Home|Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home]], who became Prime Minister in 1963. To adhere to the convention under which he was responsible to the Lower House, he disclaimed his peerage and procured election to the House of Commons within days of becoming Prime Minister.

Governments have a tendency to dominate the legislative functions of Parliament, by using their in-built majority in the House of Commons, and sometimes using their patronage power to appoint supportive peers in the Lords. In practice, governments can pass any legislation (within reason) in the Commons they wish, unless there is major dissent by MPs in the governing party.
But even in these situations, it is highly unlikely a bill will be defeated, though dissenting MPs may be able to extract concessions from the government. In 1976, [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg, Lord Hailsham of St&nbsp;Marylebone]] created a now widely used name for this behaviour, in an academic paper called "[[elective dictatorship]]."

Parliament controls the executive by passing or rejecting its Bills and by forcing Ministers of the Crown to answer for their actions, either at [[Prime Minister's Questions|"Question Time"]] or during meetings of the [[List of Committees of the United Kingdom Parliament|parliamentary committees]]. In both cases, Ministers are asked questions by members of their Houses, and are obliged to answer.

Although the House of Lords may scrutinise the executive through Question Time and through its committees, it cannot bring down the Government. A ministry must always retain the confidence and support of the House of Commons. The Lower House may indicate its lack of support by rejecting a [[Motion of no confidence votes in the United Kingdom|Motion of Confidence]] or by passing a [[Motion of no confidence votes in the United Kingdom|Motion of No Confidence]]. Confidence Motions are generally originated by the Government to reinforce its support in the House, whilst No Confidence Motions are introduced by the Opposition. The motions sometimes take the form "That this House has [no] confidence in Her Majesty's Government" but several other varieties, many referring to specific policies supported or opposed by Parliament, are used. For instance, a Confidence Motion of 1992 used the form, "That this House expresses the support for the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government." Such a motion may theoretically be introduced in the House of Lords, but, as the Government need not enjoy the confidence of that House, would not be of the same effect as a similar motion in the House of Commons; the only modern instance of such an occurrence involves the 'No Confidence' motion that was introduced in 1993 and subsequently defeated.

Many votes are considered votes of confidence, although not including the language mentioned above. Important bills that form part of the Government's agenda (as stated in the Speech from the Throne) are generally considered matters of confidence. The defeat of such a bill by the House of Commons indicates that a Government no longer has the confidence of that House. The same effect is achieved if the House of Commons "[[Loss of supply|withdraws Supply]]," that is, rejects the budget.

Where a Government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, in other words has lost the ability to secure the basic requirement of the authority of the House of Commons to tax and to spend Government money, the Prime Minister is obliged either to resign, or seek the dissolution of Parliament and a new general election. Otherwise the machinery of government grinds to a halt within days. The third choice – to mount a coup d'état or an anti-democratic revolution – is hardly to be contemplated in the present age. Though all three situations have arisen in recent years even in developed economies, international relations have allowed a disaster to be avoided.

Where a Prime Minister has ceased to retain the necessary majority and requests a dissolution, the Sovereign can in theory reject his or her request, forcing a resignation and allowing the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] to be asked to form a new government. This power is used extremely rarely. The conditions that should be met to allow such a refusal are known as the [[Lascelles Principles]]. These conditions and principles are [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] arising from the Sovereign's [[reserve power]]s as well as longstanding tradition and practice, not laid down in law.

In practice, the House of Commons' scrutiny of the Government is very weak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.com/2018/09/20/audit2018-how-democratic-is-the-house-of-commons-how-effectively-does-it-control-the-uk-government-and-represent-citizens/|title=How democratic is the House of Commons?

===Parliamentary questions===
{{see also|Question Time#United Kingdom|Prime Minister's Questions}}
In the United Kingdom, question time in the House of Commons lasts for an hour each day from Monday to Thursday (2:30 to 3:30&nbsp;pm on Mondays, 11:30&nbsp;am to 12:30&nbsp;pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and 9:30 to 10:30&nbsp;am on Thursdays). Each Government department has its place in a rota which repeats every five weeks. The exception to this sequence are the Business Questions (Questions to the [[Leader of House of Commons]]), in which questions are answered each Thursday about the business of the House the following week. Also, [[Questions to the Prime Minister]] takes place each Wednesday from noon to 12:30&nbsp;pm.

In addition to government departments, there are also questions to the Church commissioners.<ref name="pdf" /> Additionally, each Member of Parliament is entitled to table questions for written answer. Written questions are addressed to the Ministerial head of a government department, usually a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], but they are often answered by a [[Minister of State]] or [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]]. Written Questions are submitted to the Clerks of the Table Office, either on paper or electronically, and answers are recorded in ''[[Hansard|The Official Report (Hansard)]]'' so as to be widely available and accessible.<ref name="pdf" />

In the House of Lords, a half-hour is set aside each afternoon at the start of the day's proceedings for Lords' oral questions. A peer submits a question in advance, which then appears on the [[Order Paper]] for the day's proceedings.<ref name="pdf" /> The peer shall say: "''My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper''." The Minister responsible then answers the question. The peer is then allowed to ask a supplementary question and other peers ask further questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. (For instance, if the question regards immigration, peers can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period.)<ref name="pdf">{{cite web

==Parliamentary sovereignty==
{{Main|Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Stormont Parliamentary Building 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]], [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]], [[Northern Ireland]] is home to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].]]
Several different views have been taken of Parliament's sovereignty. According to the jurist [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]], "It has sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal ... it can, in short, do every thing that is not naturally impossible."

A different view has been taken by the Scottish judge [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Thomas Cooper, 1st Lord Cooper of Culross]]. When he decided the 1953 case of ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' as [[Court of Session|Lord President of the Court of Session]], he stated, "The principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law." He continued, "Considering that the [[Act of Union 1707|Union legislation]] extinguished the Parliaments of Scotland and England and replaced them by a new Parliament, I have difficulty in seeing why the new Parliament of Great Britain must inherit all the peculiar characteristics of the English Parliament but none of the Scottish." Nevertheless, he did not give a conclusive opinion on the subject.

Thus, the question of Parliamentary sovereignty appears to remain unresolved. Parliament has not passed any Act defining its own sovereignty. The [[European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020]] states "It is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom is sovereign." without qualification or definition.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/1/part/5/crossheading/parliamentary-sovereignty/enacted European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020] section 38</ref> A related possible limitation on Parliament relates to the Scottish legal system and Presbyterian faith, preservation of which were Scottish preconditions to the creation of the unified Parliament. Since the Parliament of the United Kingdom was set up in reliance on these promises, it may be that it has no power to make laws that break them.

Parliament's power has often been eroded by its own Acts. Acts passed in [[Church of Scotland Act 1921|1921]] and 1925 granted the [[Church of Scotland]] complete independence in ecclesiastical matters. From 1973 to 2020, its power had been restricted by membership of the [[European Union]], which has the power to make laws enforceable in each member state. In the [[Factortame case]], the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that British courts could have powers to overturn British legislation contravening European law.

Parliament has also created national devolved parliaments and assemblies with differing degrees of legislative authority in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Parliament still has the power over areas for which responsibility lies with the devolved institutions, but would ordinarily gain the agreement of those institutions to act on their behalf. Similarly, it has granted the power to make regulations to Ministers of the Crown, and the power to enact religious legislation to the [[General Synod]] of the Church of England. (Measures of the General Synod and, in some cases proposed [[statutory instrument]]s made by ministers, must be approved by both Houses before they become law.)

In every case aforementioned, authority has been conceded by Act of Parliament and may be taken back in the same manner. It is entirely within the authority of Parliament, for example, to abolish the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, or — as happened in 2020 — to leave the EU. However, Parliament also revoked its legislative competence over Australia and Canada with the [[Australia Act|Australia]] and [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Acts]]: although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could pass an Act reversing its action, it would not take effect in Australia or Canada as the competence of the '''Imperial Parliament''' is no longer recognised there in law.

One well-recognised consequence of Parliament's sovereignty is that it cannot bind future Parliaments; that is, no Act of Parliament may be made secure from amendment or repeal by a future Parliament. For example, although the [[Act of Union 1800]] states that the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland are to be united "forever," Parliament permitted southern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom in 1922.

==Privileges==
{{Main|Parliamentary privilege}}
Each House of Parliament possesses and guards various ancient privileges. The House of Lords relies on inherent right. In the case of the House of Commons, the Speaker goes to the Lords' Chamber at the beginning of each new Parliament and requests representatives of the Sovereign to confirm the Lower House's "undoubted" privileges and rights. The ceremony observed by the House of Commons dates to the reign of King Henry VIII. Each House is the guardian of its privileges, and may punish breaches thereof. The extent of parliamentary privilege is based on law and custom. Sir William Blackstone states that these privileges are "very large and indefinite," and cannot be defined except by the Houses of Parliament themselves.

The foremost privilege claimed by both Houses is that of [[freedom of speech]] in debate; nothing said in either House may be questioned in any court or other institution outside Parliament. Another privilege claimed is that of freedom from arrest; at one time this was held to apply for any arrest except for [[high treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]] but it now excludes any arrest on criminal charges; it applies during a session of Parliament, and 40 days before or after such a session.<ref>{{cite web| title = United Kingdom; Member of Parliament | work = PARLINE database on national parliaments | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] | url = http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2336_D.htm | accessdate = 22 February 2008 }}</ref> Members of both Houses are no longer privileged from service on [[jury|juries]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice |last=May |first=Erskine |authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough |year=2004 |publisher=Lexis Nexis UK |isbn=978-0-406-97094-7 |pages=119, 125 |title-link=Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice }}</ref>

Both Houses possess the power to punish breaches of their privilege. Contempt of Parliament—for example, disobedience of a [[subpoena]] issued by a committee—may also be punished. The House of Lords may imprison an individual for any fixed period of time, but an individual imprisoned by the House of Commons is set free upon [[Parliamentary session#Prorogation|prorogation]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| title = Parliament (United Kingdom government) | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-444244/Parliament | accessdate = 22 February 2008 }}</ref> The punishments imposed by either House may not be challenged in any court, and the Human Rights Act does not apply.<ref>Human Rights Act 1998, section 6(3).</ref>

Until at least 2015, members of the House of Commons also had the privilege of a separate seating area in the Palace of Westminster canteen, protected by a false partition labelled "MPs only beyond this point," so that they did not have to sit with canteen staff taking a break. This provoked mockery from a newly elected 20-year-old MP who described it as "ridiculous" snobbery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Chips are down as Mhairi heads for the canteen|last=Lo Dico|first=Joy|date=18 May 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=16|access-date=|via=}}</ref>

==Emblem==
[[File:NewPortcullis.png|right|thumb|The logo of the UK Parliament, since 2018.]]

The quasi-official emblem of the Houses of Parliament is a crowned [[portcullis]]. The portcullis was originally the badge of various English noble families from the 14th century. It went on to be adopted by the kings of the [[Tudor dynasty]] in the 16th century, under whom the Palace of Westminster became the regular meeting place of Parliament. The crown was added to make the badge a specifically royal symbol.

The portcullis probably first came to be associated with the [[Palace of Westminster]] through its use as decoration in the rebuilding of the Palace after the fire of 1512. However, at the time it was only one of many symbols. The widespread use of the portcullis throughout the Palace dates from the 19th century, when [[Charles Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] used it extensively as a decorative feature in their designs for the new Palace built following the disastrous 1834 fire.

The crowned portcullis came to be accepted during the 20th century as the emblem of both houses of parliament. This was simply a result of custom and usage rather than a specific decision. The emblem now appears on official stationery, publications and papers, and is stamped on various items in use in the Palace of Westminster, such as cutlery, silverware and china.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/2009-HCIO-Factsheet-Portcullis.pdf The Portcullis (factsheet)], House of Commons Information Office, November 2007</ref> Various shades of red and green are used for visual identification of the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].
