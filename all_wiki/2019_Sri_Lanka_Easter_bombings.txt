{{Further|List of non-state terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka|Persecution of Christians in the modern era#Sri Lanka}}
Historically, [[terrorism in Sri Lanka]] mostly involved coordinated attacks by the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) against the [[Government of Sri Lanka|government]] and [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|army]] during the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], which began in 1983. The LTTE [[Eelam War IV|was defeated in 2009]] in its effort to violently seize control of [[Tamil Eelam|the northern and eastern coasts of the island]] from the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] ethnic majority to create an independent Tamil state. The [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[communist party|party]] [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] (JVP) also held uprisings in 1971 and 1987–89.<ref>[http://archives.dailynews.lk/2010/03/23/fea35.asp JVP and LTTE the twin menace that destroyed this Nation], A.A.M.

In November 2016 he told parliament that 32 Sri Lankan Muslims from "well-educated and elite" families joined the ISIL.<ref name="Guardian 220419">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Jason |title=Sri Lanka bombings: doubts over Islamist group's potential role |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/22/sri-lanka-bombings-islamist-group-blamed-but-focus-also-on-failure-of-security-forces?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other |website=The Guardian |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=22 April 2019}}</ref> On 25 April 2019, Prime Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]] revealed that the government had known of the Sri Lankan nationals who had joined Islamic State and returned to the country – but they couldn't be arrested, because joining a foreign terrorist organisation is not against the law.<ref name="Washington Post 250419">{{cite web |last1=Tamkin |first1=Emily |title=How a legal blind spot could have kept Sri Lanka from arresting returning ISIS members |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/25/how-legal-blind-spot-could-have-kept-sri-lanka-arresting-returning-isis-members/ |website=Washington Post |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=No laws to arrest people who join foreign terrorist groups – PM Ranil Wickremesinghe – Sri Lanka Latest News |url=https://www.newsfirst.lk/2019/04/26/no-laws-to-arrest-people-who-join-foreign-terrorist-groups-pm-ranil-wickremesinghe/ |website=Sri Lanka News – Newsfirst |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=en |date=26 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="The Guardian 230419">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Jason |title=Scale of Sri Lankan attacks suggests Isis 'sub-contracted' bombings |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/isis-sub-contracted-sri-lanka-bombings-to-serve-its-own-ends |website=The Guardian |accessdate=26 April 2019 |date=23 April 2019}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the bombings investigations revealed that school textbooks for Islam published by the government also encouraged radicalisation of Muslims. The school books since the 1980s called for the death sentence for those who leave Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2019/06/sri-lankan-islamic-schools-textbooks.html|title=Sri Lankan Islamic schools textbooks recommended killings of non-Muslim|website=Sri Lanka Guardian|access-date=3 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/article/1092785/education-ministry-to-probe-extremist-views-being-published-in-school-text-books|title=Sunday Times – Education Ministry to probe content being published in school text books|website=www.sundaytimes.lk|language=en}}</ref>

=== Prior to the attacks ===
Vice president of the ''Muslim Council of Sri Lanka'' Hilmy Ahamed had said about three years ago he warned military intelligence officials about the [[National Thowheeth Jama'ath]], saying "targeting the non-Muslim community is something they encourage – they say you have to kill them in the name of religion".<ref name="Bloomberg 220419">{{cite web|last1=Marlow|first1=Iain|date=2019-04-22|title=Sri Lanka Muslims Had Warned Officials About Group Behind Attack|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-22/sri-lanka-muslims-had-warned-officials-about-group-behind-attack|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=26 April 2019|website=Bloomberg.com}}</ref>

Indian intelligence agencies provided specific information to Sri Lankan authorities about the method and target locations for the potential terrorist attacks to Sri Lankan authorities as early as 4 April, and again on the night before, and as close as two hours, before the first attack. This included information about the threat to churches, gathered from interrogation of a suspected ISIL recruit in Indian custody.<ref name="ToI parliamentary probe">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-policeman-defies-president-to-testify-at-attack-probe/articleshow/69845448.cms|date=18 June 2019|website=Times of India|accessdate=18 June 2019|title=Sri Lanka policeman defies president to testify at attack probe}}</ref><ref name="CNN Indian Intelligence">{{cite web|url= https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/23/asia/sri-lanka-investigation-ntj-intl/index.html|title=ISIS suspect gave advance warning of Sri Lanka bombings, source says |date= 23 April 2019|website= CNN |accessdate= 24 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Reuters 230419">{{cite web |last1=Aneez |first1=Shihar |last2=Sirilal |first2=Ranga |last3=Brock |first3=Joe |last4=Miglani |first4=Sanjeev |title=Exclusive: Sri Lanka was warned of threat hours before suicide... |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-blasts-warning-exclusive-idUSKCN1RZ1EC |website=Reuters |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=en |date=24 April 2019}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] reported on a police chief warning security officials in an advisory ten days before the attacks of a threat to prominent churches from a [[Islamic fundamentalism|radical Islamist]] group, [[National Thowheeth Jama'ath]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/world/asia/sri-lanka-explosion.html|title=Police Warned That Sri Lanka Churches Were Bombing Targets|date=21 April 2019|website=[[The New York Times]]|url-access=limited|accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> No information in this regard had been passed to the senior politicians of the country;<ref name="deathtoll" /><ref name="Blasts at Sri Lanka hotels and churches kill 156">{{Cite web |url=https://www.afp.com/en/news/15/blasts-sri-lanka-hotels-and-churches-kill-156-doc-1ft48d4 |title=Blasts at Sri Lanka hotels and churches kill 156 |date=21 April 2019 |website=AFP |access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref> Minister [[Harin Fernando]] then tweeted images of an internal memo and report by the police intelligence of a terror attack planned by the founder of National Thowheeth Jama’ath, Mohammed Zahran.<ref name="founder" />

Investigators have said that Rilwan Hashim, brother of Zahran, had built the explosives alongside Mohammad Hasthoon. Zahran had claimed to have been appointed member of the Sri Lankan branch of Islamic State by one of its official and to be receiving orders directly from Syria, a claim investigators believe to have been fabricated. Zahran held a meeting in early April 2019 with over a dozen people in [[Panadura]], where they decided upon the attack. Some participants however wanted to target the Buddhist festivals<ref name="Pledge"/>

The cohorts of Hashim had stayed in contact through [[Whatsapp]] and [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]]. The planning for a future attack may have begun in mid-2018, though the group hadn't selected any target. Investigators believe that the Easter attack plan came into being much later, with roles of perpetrators being decided upon only shortly before [[Easter]]. They had communicated through [[Threema]] a few weeks before the attack.<ref name="TheHindu25May"/>

In January 2019 a stockpile of suspicious explosives were discovered near the Wilpattu National Park which contained 100 kilos of high explosives and 100 detonators. The Police confirmed that this was from a "newly formed radical Muslim group". On 16 April a parked motorcycle in Kattankudy carrying explosives detonated without casualties during a lightning storm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://economynext.com/Sri_Lanka_seize_explosives_from_local_Islamist_radicals-3-13176-10.html|title=Sri Lanka seize explosives from local Islamist radicals|website=www.economynext.com|language=en|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=203298|title=Terrorist Motivations and Security Lapses Behind the Easter Carnage|website=www.island.lk|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190428/news/lightning-thunder-and-a-blast-on-the-trail-of-terror-leader-347130.html|title=Lightning, thunder and a blast: On the trail of terror leader|website=The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref>

== Attacks ==
[[File:Statue of Risen Jesus, Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|Statue of the Risen Jesus with blast marks and human blood after the Easter attack.]]
Christians were attending Easter Sunday services when the bombings took place, targeting churches and hotels around Sri Lanka. The sequence and coordination of the bombings were planned to cause maximum destruction, targeting Christians during [[church service|worship services]] across the island nation, and targeting guests during breakfast in beachfront hotels in the capital. All six of the first set of explosions targeting the churches and hotels were carried out by suicide bombers.<ref name=deathtoll>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/sri-lanka-attacks-death-toll-expected-rise-leaders-condemn-killings|title=Sri Lanka death toll expected to rise as leaders condemn killings |website=The Guardian|author=Burke, Jason|author2=Perera, Amantha|date=21 April 2019|accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref>

The first blast took place in the [[St. Anthony's Shrine, Kochchikade|Shrine of St. Anthony]], a historic Catholic church in the capital, where more than 50 people were killed.

Three 5-star hotels on the beachfront in central Colombo were attacked around the same time as the churches: the [[Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo|Shangri-La Hotel]], the [[Cinnamon Grand Hotel]] and [[The Kingsbury]].<ref name="nytimes-21apr2019"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2019/04/21/local/183395/three-more-explosions-kingsbury-shangri-la-cinnamon-grand|title=Three more explosions Kingsbury, Shangri-La, Cinnamon Grand|website=Daily News|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>

The suicide bomber who struck at the Taprobane restaurant in the Cinnamon Grand hotel had checked into the hotel with a false name the night before, claiming to be on a business trip. The bomber entered the queue of the packed restaurant's breakfast buffet the next morning and detonated explosives strapped to his back as he was about to be served.

=== Subsequent events ===
{{Main|Sainthamaruthu shootout}}
On 26 April, the [[Sri Lanka Army]] and the STF carried out a search operation in [[Sainthamaruthu]] where three explosions and a shootout occurred when they attempted to raid a suspected hideout following a tip-off. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up, killing nine of their family members, including three women and six children, while three other terrorists were shot dead by the soldiers. One civilian was caught in the crossfire and died, according to police, while a wounded woman and child were taken to hospital.{{efn|''See''<ref>{{cite news |title=Shootout in Sainthamarudu when forces raid suicide vest factory |url=https://www.newsfirst.lk/2019/04/26/shootout-in-sainthamarudu/amp/ |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=News First |date=26 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Police Curfew to be in effect until further notice in Kalmunai – Chavalakade and Samanthurai |url=http://www.hirunews.lk/215245/police-curfew-to-be-in-effect-until-further-notice-in-kalmunai-chavalakade-and-samanthurai |accessdate=26 April 2019 |work=Hiru News |date=26 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka bombings: 15 die in blast during raid on suspected hideout |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48074702 |accessdate=27 April 2019 |work=BBC News |date=27 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Slater |first1=Joanna |title=15 killed in Sri Lanka police raid at suspected terrorist hideout |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/sri-lanka-authorities-say-15-die-in-police-raid-at-home-of-suspected-terrorists/2019/04/27/de46eb64-686e-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html |accessdate=27 April 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=27 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka attacks: Relatives of key suspect Zahran Hashim killed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48085525 |accessdate=28 April 2019 |work=BBC News |date=28 April 2019}}</ref>|name=kalmunai}}

=== Precautionary measures ===
==== State of emergency ====
Following President Sirisena's return to the island from Singapore on 22 April 2019, where he was on a personal visit, the Sri Lankan government declared a [[state of emergency]] from midnight of 22 April by an extraordinary gazette notification issued by the President under the Public Security Ordinance. This would give the government, police and the armed forces sweeping powers to undertake counter terrorism activities. The government also announced that it would hold a [[national day of mourning]] the following day. On 24 April, the [[Sri Lankan Parliament]] passed emergency regulations without a vote after a day-long debate. Emergency regulations give the police and armed forces powers to search, arrest and detain persons up to 24 hours without a warrant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/article/1085509/parliament-passes-regulations-related-to-state-of-emergency|title=Sunday Times – Parliament passes regulations related to State of Emergency|website=www.sundaytimes.lk}}</ref>

On 25 August 2019, the government lifted the state of emergency, following the normalising of the security situation.<ref>{{cite news |title=State of emergency lifted as security established – Minister |url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_19B/Aug25_1566744947CH.php |accessdate=27 August 2019 |publisher=Colombo Page}}</ref>

==== Curfews ====
{{Quote box
 |quote = After incidents occurred yesterday in the North Western Province, starting from Chilaw and spreading to Kuliyapitiya, Hettipola and other areas, we had to impose curfew last evening. There were incidents of youth involved in damaging and destroying property. So, I as Army Commander request and at the same time warn anyone who has planned to destroy or dishonour the orders given by the government or the Armed Forces, that we will take stern action. I say again we will take stern action to apprehend, arrest and even open fire and use minimum or maximum powers given under emergency laws.

We will ensure that the country will not return to violence, including the violence of radicalization and terrorists. Please ensure that you do not get involved in such illegal incidents or any such activities. The Armed Forces will not hesitate to use our powers to curb, curtail and contain the situation. The Armed Forces are strong enough to ensure there won’t be an escalation of violence in any part of the island. We have deployed the Army, Navy and Air Force to assist the Police to maintain law and order. I humbly request the youth not to get involved in violence and get entangled with the Armed Forces where we are ready to use our powers.

Since 21 April evening, the government has imposed nightly [[Curfew#Sri Lanka|police curfews]] effective island-wide, with the hours reduced to 2200 to 0400 hours until 27 April. Indefinite curfews were imposed in several police divisions where incidents such as the Sainthamaruthu shootout took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/international/sri-lanka-curfew-shut-down-access-to-social-media-729886.html|title=Sri Lanka: Curfew, shut down access to social media|date=21 April 2019|website=Deccan Herald}}</ref>

On 12 May, a group of people congregated in the town of [[Chilaw]] allegedly following a Facebook post which claimed there was a plan to attack the town. An immediate police curfew was imposed and the situation was brought under control without further damage. Two people were later arrested over the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Police-curfew-imposed-in-Chilaw/108-166957|title=Police curfew imposed in Chilaw|website=www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

On 13 May, sporadic isolated incidents where groups of people vandalised property in the [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|North Western Province]] caused police to impose curfew across the entire country. Acting Police Chief C.D. Wickramaratne promised an overwhelming police response against any individuals breaking the law by instigating sporadic countrywide riots targeting Muslim-owned property and businesses. In a hard-hitting statement, Army Commander [[Mahesh Senanayake]] stated that the security forces had been given broad-ranging powers under emergency laws, and would respond proportionately to the threat, but that they would not hesitate to utilise the full extent of their powers to ensure that the rule of law is maintained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Stern-action-against-lawbreakers--warns-Acting-IGP/108-167084|title=Stern action against lawbreakers, warns Acting IGP|website=www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

On 14 May, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that all necessary powers to restore peace and stability to the country had been given to security forces and police. He further stated that creating unnecessary disturbances would hinder the ongoing investigations to apprehend terrorists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Security-forces---police-given-all-powers-to-bring-back-normalcy-PM/108-167078|title=Security forces & police given all powers to bring back normalcy-PM|website=www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref>

==== Ban on social media ====
The government temporarily blocked major [[social media]] networks and messaging services [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[WhatsApp]], [[Viber]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] within hours of the attack. The blocking included [[Virtual private network|VPN]] service providers that could be used to circumvent the blocks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Social Media Has Been Blocked For Over 24 Hours in Sri Lanka After The Deadly Explosions |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/sri-lanka-social-media-block |publisher=buzzfeednews |accessdate=23 April 2019 |date=23 April 2019}}</ref>

On 24 April 2019, a Sri Lankan MP{{who|date=May 2019}} called for both [[burqa]] and [[Niqāb|niqab]] to be banned from the country and proposed that a bill be passed in the Parliament during a local parliamentary session in wake of the attacks.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Range |first1=Irangika |title=Ban 'niqab, burqa' – Prof. Ashu |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2019/04/24/local/183684/ban-‘niqab-burqa’-prof-ashu |accessdate=30 April 2019 |work=Daily News |date=24 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Withnall |first1=Adam |title=Sri Lankan MP calls for burqa ban in wake of Easter massacre |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/sri-lanka-bombing-burqa-ban-isis-islam-ashu-marasinghe-a8883801.html |accessdate=30 April 2019 |work=The Independent |date=24 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Irshad |first1=Qadijah |title=Sri Lanka attacks: Fear of retaliation against Muslims grows as MP calls for burqa ban |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-burqa-ban-muslims-terrorism-bombings-a8885056.html |accessdate=30 April 2019 |work=The Independent |date=24 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

On 28 April 2019, President Sirisena banned any type of face covering that prevents or hinders facial identification, including the [[burqa]] or [[niqāb]] under an emergency law which will go into force on 29 April 2019. This law does not prevent a Muslim woman from wearing a [[hijab]] or [[chador]].

==== Surveillance ====
On 10 May 2019, it was mandated that copies of all sermons given inside mosques be submitted to the Ministry of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, as part of a broader strategic plan to monitor activities inside mosques. The Ministry said mosques must not be used for radicalising congregations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka imposes controls on mosques after suicide bombings |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/sri-lanka-slaps-controls-on-mosques-after-islamist-attacks |accessdate=11 May 2019 |work=The Straits Times |date=10 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

==== Centralised and Integrated Population Information System ====
On 8 May 2019, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe announced plans for a centralised platform for the collection, monitoring and storage of intelligence. The system known as the Centralised and Integrated Population Information System will collect biometric data from iris scanning and facial identification at all ports of entry and exit. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, Provincial Councils and local governments were instructed to prepare an action plan for this system in two weeks, to obtain Cabinet approval.<ref>{{cite news |title=Data protection |url=http://www.ft.lk/ft-view/Data-protection/58-677950 |accessdate=11 May 2019 |work=Daily FT |date=10 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>

;Parliamentary Select Committee
In May, a Parliamentary [[Select committee (parliamentary system)|Select Committee]] (PSC) was appointed to probe the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks and incidents in its aftermath by the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka|Speaker of the Parliament]]. The Select committee is headed by the Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri and includes seven MPs.

==== Bombing investigation ====
The [[Sri Lankan Police]] launched an investigation into the incident; it has now transpired into a major transnational investigation led by the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Investigation Department]] of the Sri Lankan Police to hunt down all the perpetrators involved in this incident. Six foreign police agencies, including [[Scotland Yard]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), and [[Interpol]] are assisting the [[Sri Lankan Police]].<ref name="CNN 260419" />

The bomber at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel was a guest who registered under the name of "Mohamed Azzam Mohamed" and gave a false address.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/sri-lanka-blast-suicide-bomber-waited-in-queue-for-easter-sunday-buffet-at-cinnamon-grand-hotel-1.1555849958833|title=Sri Lanka blast: Suicide bomber waited in queue for Easter Sunday buffet at Cinnamon Grand Hotel|website= Gulf news |access-date= 21 April 2019}}</ref> The Shangri-La Hotel bomber was identified by police as Insan Seelavan, a factory owner, nine of whose employees have been arrested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Shangri-La-suicide-bomber-identified/108-165730|title=Shangri-La suicide bomber identified|website=www.dailymirror.lk|language=English|access-date=22 April 2019}}</ref>

Later on 23 April, the Sri Lankan State Defence Minister, [[Ruwan Wijewardene]], said that initial investigations have revealed that Islamic extremists "carried out the attacks in retaliation for [[Christchurch mosque shootings|a March attack on two mosques in New Zealand]]".<ref name=AboutMotive /><ref name=AboutMotive2 /><ref name=AboutMotive3 /><ref name=AboutMotive4 /> This has been questioned by New Zealand's Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] and by analysts, as the attacks were likely planned before the Christchurch attacks.<ref name="ardern">{{cite news |title=New Zealand PM says no intelligence linking Sri Lanka attacks to Christchurch |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-blasts-newzealand/new-zealand-pm-says-no-intelligence-linking-sri-lanka-attacks-to-christchurch-idUSKCN1RZ2K4 |agency=Reuters |date=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="NZSrilanka" /><ref name="dailymirror" /> New Zealand security expert Paul Buchanan said that "Christchurch seems to be a convenient justification for something that was being planned before 15 March".<ref name="NZSrilanka" /> Shortly afterward, [[Amaq News Agency]] claimed ISIL inspired the attacks.<ref name="isisindependent" /> It released a photo and a video showing eight suicide bombers pledging allegiance to ISIL leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]. Zahran Hashim of the NTJ was identified as their leader.<ref name="auto5" /> Amaq's statements emphasised the attacks were against Christians who are war with the organisation. None of them referenced Christchurch.<ref name="autolongwar" />

Investigators believe the bombs were made of [[acetone peroxide]], and are looking into training camps that had been hidden on a remote compound near [[Wanathavilluwa]], on the west coast of the country, and possible links to overseas jihadist networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/04/article/mother-of-satan-explosive-used-in-sri-lanka-bombings/|title=Asia Times {{!}} 'Mother of Satan' explosive used in Sri Lanka bombings {{!}} Article|last=Times|first=Asia|website=Asia Times|language=en|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Telegraph 240419" />

According to the investigators, the perpetrators were offered military training by a person named Army Mohideen, while weapons training was provided overseas as well as in Nuwara Eliya and Wanathawilluwa in the Eastern Province. The vehicles used in the attack are believed to have been procured from a car sales centre in Kadawata.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vital info on terror attacks revealed by arrested suspects |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Vital-info-on-terror-attacks-revealed-by-arrested-suspects/108-165963 |accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>

Nine people arrested on 22 April 2019 and formally charged with supplying equipment used in connection with an act of terrorism appeared in [[Magistrate's Courts of Sri Lanka|Colombo Magistrates Court]] on 6 May 2019. They were released on bail of two sureties of LKR500,000 each (approx. $3,000), as the court found the case against them was weak.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sanjeewa Balasuriya |first1=Darshana |title=SIU probes to ascertain Wellampitiya police erred |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/top_story/SIU-probes-to-ascertain-Wellampitiya-police-erred/155-166699 |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=Daily Mirror |date=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref> The police launched an investigation to determine whether Wellampitiya police had erred. On 9 May 2019, investigators found Wellampitiya police officers had made several errors, neglecting to put several facts before the court. A police spokesman said stern action would be taken against the officers responsible.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sanjeewa Balasuriya |first1=Darshana |title=SIU probe finds Police had erred |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/SIU-probe-finds-Police-had-erred/108-166813 |accessdate=9 May 2019 |work=Daily Mirror |date=9 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref>

On 15 May, Wellampitiya Police officers hit back against the allegations of negligence and filed a complaint to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) alleging Colombo Magistrate Court Judge Priyantha Liyanage was being biased against the police by releasing nine of the ten suspects produced in court. A legal representative appearing on behalf of the suspects stated that the magistrate nor his client needs to wait for the police to complete its investigations for the magistrate to make a decision on the matter, the allegations made by the Wellampitiya Police officers do not have a proper basis in law. A police spokesman said an investigation had been launched into the incident, and that it appears that police may have erred by not filing the case under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Sri Lanka)|Prevention of Terrorism Act]] because the investigations were yet to be completed. He further stated that as soon as the report from the investigation is released, police will take actions against any personnel held responsible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Wellampitiya-Police-OIC-demands-inquiry/108-167146|title=Wellampitiya Police OIC demands inquiry|website=www.dailymirror.lk}}</ref>

This enables the freezing and seizure of assets belonging to these groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/President-bans-National-Thawheed-Jammath/108-166074|title=President bans National Thawheed Jammath|website=www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="Foreign Policy 230419">{{cite web |last1=Mackinnon |first1=Amy |title=Sri Lanka Attack 'Is the Wave of the Future' |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/23/sri-lanka-attack-is-the-wave-of-the-future-isis-terrorism-returnees/ |website=Foreign Policy |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

Based on their early probe, the investigators have said that the attack was planned locally without any direct hand of Islamic State. Zahran once made his cohorts listen to a recording of a puproprted ISIS official making him the head of the Sri Lankan branch. But they believe he lied greatly to others about the extent of his contacts with the group.

The [[Inspector General of Police (Sri Lanka)|Inspector General of Police]], [[Pujith Jayasundara]], came under heavy criticism following the bombings, with the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] urging that he resign for failing to prevent the bombings.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.newsfirst.lk/2019/04/22/upfa-urges-igp-to-resign-immediately/|title=UPFA urges IGP to resign immediately|date=22 April 2019|website= newsfirst |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref> Later, former Presidential candidate Field Marshal [[Sarath Fonseka]] claimed it was unfair to blame the IGP and that it was a conflict between the functioning of military intelligence and criminal investigators, and called for better intelligence mechanisms and security clearances to be streamlined.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Terror-attack:-Not-fair-to-blame-IGP:-SF/108-165820|title=Terror attack: Not fair to blame IGP: SF|date=23 April 2019|website= Dailymirror |access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref>

In a speech delivered in parliament, former president and then-opposition leader [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] slammed the government for weakening the intelligence services over the years. He stated that in January 2015, he handed over a secure and peaceful country with a strong national security apparatus. He claimed the present government is squarely responsible for the 2019 Easter bombings, stating that on an important occasion such as Easter, representatives of the government usually attend Mass; on this occasion, no representatives were present in or near churches. He blamed the government for diluting the powers of the national security apparatus and claimed this terrorist attack would never have occurred under his administration. Additionally, the government was preparing to repeal the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act (Sri Lanka)|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]; he questioned what kind of position the government would have been in to respond to the incident had they been successful in having the Act repealed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/MR-blasts-govt--for-diluting-intelligence-services/108-165806|title=MR blasts govt. for diluting intelligence services|date=23 April 2019|website= Dailymirror |access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref>

On 24 April 2019, President [[Maithripala Sirisena|Sirisena]] promised major changes to the leadership of the security forces within the next 24 hours and pledged a "complete restructure" of the police and national security forces in the coming weeks. These changes come amidst allegations that a rift between the President and Prime Minister contributed to the failure to effectively respond to threats that undermine national security. The incident also caused a major setback for the government and for other political parties just before [[2019 Sri Lankan presidential election]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/sri-lankan-president-vows-security-shake-attacks-190423175114094.html|title=Sri Lankan president vows security shake-up over attacks|date=24 April 2019|website=[[Al Jazeera]]|access-date=24 April 2019}}</ref>

Cabinet Spokesman [[Rajitha Senaratne]] initially attempted to implicate [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]] for the bombings, claiming that [[Abdul Razik]] was a suicide bomber and the secretary of the NTJ that received funding from intelligence agencies during the Rajapaksa government. Razik however is the general secretary of the Ceylon Thowheed Jama’ath (CTJ), one of the splinter groups from Sri Lanka Thawheed Jama’ath (SLTJ) of which he was the former general secretary and is neither a member of the NTJ nor a suicide bomber. Razik challenged Rajitha to provide evidence for the allegations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsfirst.lk/2019/04/30/gota-supported-organizations-such-as-ntj-rajitha-senaratne/|title="Gota supported organizations such as NTJ" – Rajitha Senaratne – Sri Lanka Latest News|date=30 April 2019|website=Sri Lanka News – Newsfirst|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/news/Ban-on-face-veil-acceptable--but-ears-must-be-covered--Ceylon-Thowheed-Jama-ath/56-677520|title=Ban on face veil acceptable, but ears must be covered: Ceylon Thowheed Jama'ath|website=www.ft.lk|language=English|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe later apologised for failing to stop the attacks, issuing a statement on Twitter saying "We take collective responsibility and apologise to our fellow citizens for our failure to protect victims of these tragic events.

==== 2019 Sri Lankan Presidential Election ====
In November 2019, [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]] was elected President who campaigned on stronger security measures to prevent a re-occurrence of the Easter bombings.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Athas |first1=Iqbal |title=Sri Lanka elects new president in first vote since deadly bombings |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/17/asia/sri-lanka-election-intl/index.html |accessdate=20 November 2019 |agency=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

==== Resignations ====
;Defence Secretary
On 23 April, President Sirisena announced plans to change the heads of the [[Sri Lanka Armed Forces|defence forces]].<ref name="Reuters 230419" /> On 25 April, [[Hemasiri Fernando]], [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)#Permanent Secretaries|Secretary of the Ministry of Defence]] tendered his resignation to the President, after it was announced that President Sirisena had requested the Defence Secretary and the Inspector General of Police resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/top_story/Prez-tells-Defence-Secretary--IGP-to-resign/155-165882|title=Prez tells Defence Secretary, IGP to resign|website=www.dailymirror.lk|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> Retired [[General]] [[Shantha Kottegoda]] was appointed to succeed Fernando as Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, while retired IGP [[N. K. Illangakoon]] was appointed adviser to the Ministry of Defence.

;Inspector General of Police
Although President Sirisena announced on 25 April that the [[Inspector General of Police]], [[Pujith Jayasundara]] would be resigning, Jayasundara made no public comment. On 29 April, the IGP was sent on compulsory leave after no response was received to President Sirisena's request for his resignation. The President lacks jurisdiction to dismiss the IGP, as he was appointed by a decision by the Constitutional Council and can only be removed by a motion passed in Parliament pursuant to the Public Officers (Procedure) Act, which requires the precise circumstances of the charges and/or allegations against him to be detailed and presented. The Police Commission still maintains jurisdiction to overturn the decision to send the IGP on compulsory leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/I-can’t-remove-IGP--he-is-a-CC-appointee:-Prez/108-165827|title=I can't remove IGP, he is a CC appointee: Prez|website=www.dailymirror.lk}}</ref> The same day, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police [[C.

D. Wickramaratne as Acting IGP. This is considered final and conclusive for all purposes, as neither the National Police Commission or the Supreme Court have jurisdictional oversight to reverse this decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/CC-approves-C-D--Wickramaratne-as-Acting-IGP/108-167023|title=CC approves C.D.

;Ministers and Provincial Governors 
Following calls for resignation of Minister of Industry and Commerce, [[Rishad Bathiudeen]] and Provençal Governors [[Azath Salley]] and [[M. L. A. M.

=== Economic ===
[[Tourism in Sri Lanka]] is the country's third largest foreign exchange earner and employs around 135,000 to 150,000 in the hotel industry. The industry had expected 3 million tourist arrivals and revenue of $5 billion in 2019. Due to the attack on tourists, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka estimated a loss of $1.5 billion in tourism earnings for the year.<ref name="ft 250419">{{cite web |last1=de Silva |first1=Charumini |title=Tourist hotels fear $1.5 b revenue loss from terror attacks |url=http://www.ft.lk/front-page/Tourist-hotels-fear----1-5-b-revenue-loss-from-terror-attacks/44-676993 |website=www.ft.lk |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=English}}</ref>

In early June, in a leaked confidential assessment of the economic damage by the Easter Sunday attacks, the [[Central Bank of Sri Lanka]] claimed that the loss of government revenue from indirect tax such as [[VAT]] was approximately Rupees 26 billion for the year.

==== Sharia law ====
Minister of Home Affairs [[Vajira Abeywardena]] stated that legislation introduced between 2010 and 2015 has "given effect to aspects of Sharia law or Islamic law" with non-governmental organisations registering under these.

==== Minimum age of marriage ====
The Prime Minister has stated that the ''Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act'' will be amended to include a minimum age of marriage of 18 years to the [[Muslim law in Sri Lanka|traditional Muslim law]], which had been criticised for lacking a minimum age of marriage, resulting in underage marriages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39898589|title=Forced to marry at 15|work=BBC News|date=20 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking_news/Govt--to-amend-Muslim-Marriage-and-Divorce-Act/108-167849|title=Govt. to amend Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act|website=www.dailymirror.lk}}</ref>
