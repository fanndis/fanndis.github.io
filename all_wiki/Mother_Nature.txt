'''Mother Nature''' (sometimes known as '''Mother Earth''' or the '''Earth Mother''') is a [[personification]] of [[nature]] that focuses on the life-giving and nurturing aspects of nature by embodying it, in the form of the [[mother]].

==European tradition history==
[[File:Atalanta Fugiens - Emblem 2d.jpg|thumb|Mother Nature image, 17th century alchemical text, ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'']]
The word "nature" comes from the [[Latin]] word, "''natura''", meaning birth or character (see [[nature (innate)]]). In [[English language|English]], its first recorded use (in the sense of the entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266. "Natura" and the personification of Mother Nature were widely popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. As a concept, seated between the properly divine and the human, it can be traced to [[Ancient Greece]], though [[Earth]] (or "''Eorthe''" in the Old English period) may have been personified as a goddess. The Norse also had a goddess called [[Jord]] (or ''Erth'').

The earliest written usage is in [[Mycenaean Greek]]: ''Ma-ka'' (transliterated as ''ma-ga''), "Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script (13th or 12th century BC).<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=346416 ''Palaeolexicon;  Word Study Tool of Ancient Languages''];</ref> In Greece, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophers had "invented" nature when they abstracted the entirety of phenomena of the world as singular: ''physis'', and this was inherited by [[Aristotle]]. Later medieval Christian thinkers did not see nature as inclusive of everything, but thought that she had been created by [[God]]; her place lay on earth, below the unchanging [[heaven]]s and [[moon]].  Nature lay somewhere in the center, with agents above her ([[angel]]s), and below her ([[demons]] and [[hell]]). For the medieval mind she was only a personification, not a goddess.

===Greek myth===
[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and four children]]

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Persephone]], daughter of [[Demeter]] (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by [[Hades]] (god of the dead), and taken to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] as his  queen. Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow and the "entire human race [would] have perished of cruel, biting hunger if [[Zeus]] had not been concerned" (Larousse 152). Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten [[pomegranate]] seeds, the food of the dead and thus, she must spend part of each year with Hades in the underworld. Demeter's grief for her daughter in the realm of the dead, is reflected in the barren winter months and her joy when Persephone returns is reflected in the bountiful summer months.

==Indigenous peoples of America==
[[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] legend says that "beneath the clouds lives the Earth-Mother from whom is derived the Water of Life, who at her bosom feeds plants, animals and human" (Larousse 428). She is otherwise known as [[Nokomis]], the [[Grandparent|Grandmother]].

In [[Inca mythology]], ''Mama Pacha'' or ''[[Pachamama]]'' is a fertility goddess who presides over planting and harvesting. Pachamama is usually translated as "Mother Earth" but a more literal translation would be "Mother Universe" (in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua language|Quechua]] mama = mother / pacha = world, space-time or the universe).<ref>Lira, Jorge A.; 1944; "'''Diccionario Kkechuwa - Español''';" Tucumán, Argentina</ref> Pachamama and her husband, [[Inti]], are the most benevolent deities and are worshiped in parts of the Andean mountain ranges (stretching from present day [[Ecuador]] to [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]).

In her book ''Coateteleco, pueblo indígena de pescadores'' ("Coatetelco, indigenous fishing town", Cuernavaca, Morelos: Vettoretti, 2015), Teódula Alemán Cleto states, ''En nuestra cultura prehipánica el respeto y la fe a nuestra madre naturaleza fueron primordiales para vivir en plena armonía como seres humanos.'' ("In our [Mexican] prehispanic culture, respect and faith in our '''Mother Nature''' (emphasis added) were paramount to living in full harmony as human beings.")<ref>{{cite book|last=Alemán Cleto|first=Teódula|title=Coateteleco, pueblo indígena de pescadores|place=Cuernavaca, Morelos|date=2015|edition=1st|language=Spanish|trans-title=Coatetelco, Indigena fishing town}}</ref>

==Southeast Asia==
In the [[Mainland Southeast Asia]]n countries of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]], earth ([[Land mass|terra firma]]) is personified as [[Phra Mae Thorani]], but her role in [[Buddhist mythology]] differs considerably from that of Mother Nature. In the [[Malay Archipelago]], that role is filled by [[Dewi Sri]], [http://www.bartleby.com/196/98.html ''The Rice-mother in the East Indies''].
