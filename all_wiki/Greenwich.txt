'''Greenwich''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-LBGreenwich.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɛ|n|ɪ|tʃ}} {{respell|GREN|itch}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɪ|n|ɪ|dʒ}} {{respell|GRIN|ij}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɪ|n|ɪ|tʃ}} {{respell|GRIN|itch}}, or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|ɛ|n|ɪ|dʒ}} {{respell|GREN|ij}}<ref>{{OED|Greenwich}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary (David Jones)|year=2011|editor1-first=Peter|editor1-last=Roach|editor2-first=Jane|editor2-last=Setter|editor3-first=John|editor3-last=Esling|edition=18th|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>) is an area of [[South London|South East]] London, England, centred {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1}} east-southeast of [[Charing Cross]]. It is within the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich]], to which it lends its name. Historically it was in the county of [[Kent]] for hundreds of years,<ref>John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles, 1887: "Greenwich, parl. bor. and par., Kent, on river Thames"[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/167]</ref> then the [[County of London]] from 1889 to 1965.

Greenwich is notable for its [[maritime history]] and for giving its name to the [[Greenwich Meridian]] (0° longitude) and [[Greenwich Mean Time]]. The town became the site of a royal palace, the [[Palace of Placentia]] from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many [[House of Tudor|Tudors]], including [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Elizabeth I]]. The palace fell into disrepair during the [[English Civil War]] and was demolished to be replaced by the [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Royal Naval Hospital for Sailors]], designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and his assistant [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]. These buildings became the [[Old Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] in 1873, and they remained a military education establishment until 1998 when they passed into the hands of the Greenwich Foundation. The historic rooms within these buildings remain open to the public; other buildings are used by [[University of Greenwich]] and [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance]].

The town became a popular resort in the 18th century and many grand houses were built there, such as [[Vanbrugh Castle]] (1717) established on Maze Hill, next to the park. From the [[Georgian period]] estates of houses were constructed above the town centre. The maritime connections of Greenwich were celebrated in the 20th century, with the siting of the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' and ''[[Gipsy Moth IV]]'' next to the river front, and the [[National Maritime Museum]] in the former buildings of the [[Royal Hospital School]] in 1934.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The place-name "Greenwich" is first attested in a Saxon charter of 918, where it appears as ''Gronewic''. It is recorded as ''Grenewic'' in 964, and as ''Grenawic'' in the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] for 1013. It is ''Grenviz'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and ''Grenewych'' in the ''Taxatio Ecclesiastica'' of 1291. The name means 'green ''wic''' ("settlement", from the Latin 'vicus').<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 204.</ref>

The settlement later became known as ''East Greenwich'' to distinguish it from ''West Greenwich'' or ''Deptford Strond'', the part of [[Deptford]] adjacent to the [[River Thames]],<ref name=Parish>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=53781|title=Parishes: Greenwich|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> but the use of ''East Greenwich'' to mean the whole of the town of Greenwich died out in the 19th century. However, Greenwich was divided into the registration subdistricts of ''Greenwich East'' and ''Greenwich West'' from the beginning of [[civil registration]] in 1837, the boundary running down what is now Greenwich Church Street and Crooms Hill, although more modern references to "''East''" and "''West''" Greenwich probably refer to the areas east and west of the [[Old Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] and [[National Maritime Museum]] corresponding with the West Greenwich [[Ward (politics)|council ward]]. An article in ''[[The Times]]'' of 13 October 1967 stated:<ref>"Greenwich-the instant village", Brandon Green, ''[[The Times]]'', 13 October 1967; p. 11.</ref>
<blockquote>
''East Greenwich'', gateway to the [[Blackwall Tunnel]], remains solidly [[working class]], the manpower for one eighth of London's [[heavy industry]]. ''West Greenwich'' is a hybrid: the spirit of Nelson, the ''Cutty Sark'', the Maritime Museum, an industrial waterfront and a number of elegant houses, ripe for development.

====Manor of East Greenwich====
[[Colonial charters in the Thirteen Colonies|Royal charters]] granted to English colonists in North America,<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp#pa Colonial Charters, Grants and Related Documents].</ref> often used the name of the [[manor]] of East Greenwich for describing the tenure (from the Latin verb ''teneo'', hold) as that of free [[socage]].<ref>[http://www.eogen.com/manorofEastGreenwich Manor of East Greenwich].</ref> [[New England]] charters provided that the grantees should hold their lands "as of his Majesty's manor of East Greenwich". This was in relation to the principle of land tenure under English law, that the ruling monarch (king or queen) was paramount lord of all the soil in the ''terra regis'',<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesday/great-domesday.htm National Archives, ''Great Domesday''].</ref> while all others held their lands, directly or indirectly, under the monarch. Land outside the physical boundaries of England, as in America, was treated as belonging constructively to one of the existing royal manors, and from Tudor times grants frequently used the name of the manor of East Greenwich,<ref>Words used in [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/va01.asp ''The First Charter of Virginia; 10 April 1606''] "...To BE HOLDEN of Us, [King James I] our heirs and Successors, as of our Manor at East-Greenwich, in the County of Kent, in free and common Soccage only, and not in Capite."</ref> but some 17c. grants named [[Windsor Castle|the castle of Windsor]].<ref>Words used in [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/pa01.asp ''Charter for the Province of Pennsylvania-1681''] "...to bee holden of Us [King Charles II], Our heires and Successors, Kings of England, as of Our Castle of Windsor in Our County of Berks, in free and comon Socage, by fealty only for all Services, and not in Capite or by Knights Service."</ref><ref>[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-13-02-0006 "N.N." ''On the Tenure of the Manor of East Greenwich''].</ref><ref>Edward P. Cheyney, ''The Manor of East Greenwich'',  American Historical Review, Volume 11, 1 October 1905.</ref> Places in North America that have taken the name "East Greenwich" include a township in [[East Greenwich Township, New Jersey|Gloucester County, New Jersey]], a hamlet in [[East Greenwich, New York|Washington County, New York]], and a town in [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|Kent County, Rhode Island]]. [[Greenwich, Connecticut]] was also named after Greenwich.

===Early settlement===
[[File:Burial mounds in Greenwich Park.jpg|thumb|Prehistoric burial mounds in Greenwich Park]]
[[Tumulus|Tumuli]] to the south-west of Flamsteed House,<ref>Flamsteed House – designed and built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1675–76, was the home of the first Astronomer Royal, John Flamsteed, and the heart of Charles II's new Royal Observatory.</ref> in [[Greenwich Park]], are thought to be early [[Bronze Age]] barrows re-used by the Saxons in the 6th century as burial grounds. To the east between the Vanbrugh and Maze Hill Gates is the site of a Roman villa or temple. A small area of red paving [[tesserae]] protected by railings marks the spot. It was excavated in 1902 and 300 coins were found dating from the emperors [[Claudius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] to the 5th century. This was excavated by the [[Channel 4]] television programme ''[[Time Team]]'' in 1999, broadcast in 2000,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/greenwich-park/things-to-see-and-do/ancient-greenwich/roman-remains|title=Roman remains|publisher=Royal Parks|access-date=24 July 2015}}</ref> and further investigations were made by the same group in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2003_greenwich.html|title=Greenwich London|journal=Time Team|publisher=Channel 4|date=2 February 2003|access-date=13 June 2011}}</ref>

The [[Roman road]] from London to [[Dover]], [[Watling Street]] crossed the high ground to the south of Greenwich, through Blackheath. This followed the line of an earlier [[Celt]]ic route from [[Canterbury]] to [[St Albans]].<ref>''The Roman Watling Street: from London to High Cross'' O. Roucoux, (Dunstable Museum Trust, 1984) {{ISBN|0-9508406-2-9}}.</ref> As late as [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], Greenwich was only a fishing town, with a safe anchorage in the river.<ref name=Parish/>

===Viking===
During the reign of  the army being encamped on the hill above. From here they attacked [[Kent]] and, in the year 1012, took the city of [[Canterbury]], making Archbishop [[Alphege]] their prisoner for seven months in their camp at Greenwich, at that time within the county of Kent. They stoned him to death for his refusal to allow his ransom (3,000 pieces of silver) to be paid; and kept his body, until the blossoming of a stick that had been immersed in his blood. For this miracle his body was released to his followers, he achieved sainthood for his martyrdom and, in the 12th century, the parish church was dedicated to him. The present church on the site west of the town centre is [[St Alfege's Church, Greenwich|St Alfege's Church]], designed by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] in 1714 and completed in 1718. Some vestiges of the Danish camps may be traced in the names of Eastcombe and [[Westcombe Park|Westcombe]], on the borders of nearby [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]].<ref name=Green>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=45486 'Greenwich', The Environs of London: volume 4: Counties of Herts, Essex & Kent (1796), pp. 426–93], accessed: 26 May 2007.</ref>

===Norman===
The [[Domesday Book]] records the manor of ''Grenviz'' in the [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] of ''Grenviz'' as held by Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]];<ref>[http://opendomesday.org/place/TQ3877/greenwich/ Open Domesday Online: Greenwich].</ref> his lands were seized by the crown in 1082. The name of the hundred was changed to [[Hundred of Blackheath, Kent|Blackheath]] when the site of the hundred court was moved there in the 12th century. A royal palace, or hunting lodge, has existed here since before 1300, when [[Edward I]] is known to have made offerings at the chapel of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=Green/>

===Plantagenet===
Subsequent monarchs were regular visitors, with [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] making his will here, and [[Henry V, King of England|Henry V]] granting the manor (for life) to [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter]], who died at Greenwich in 1426. The palace was created by [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], Henry V's half-brother and the regent to [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1447; he enclosed the park and erected a tower on the hill now occupied by the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]]. It was renamed the [[Palace of Placentia]] or Pleasaunce by [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s consort [[Margaret of Anjou]] after Humphrey's death. The palace was completed and further enlarged by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], and in 1466 it was granted to his queen, [[Elizabeth Woodville|Elizabeth]].<ref name=Green/>

Ultimately it was because the palace and its grounds were a royal possession that it was chosen as the site for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s Royal Observatory, from which stemmed Greenwich's subsequent global role as originator of the modern [[Prime Meridian]].

=== Tudor ===
The palace was the principal residence of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] whose sons Henry (later [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) and [[Edmund Tudor, Duke of Somerset|Edmund Tudor]] were born here, and baptised in St Alphege's. Henry favoured Greenwich over nearby [[Eltham Palace]], the former principal royal palace. He extended Greenwich Palace and it became his principal London seat until [[Whitehall Palace]] was built in the 1530s. Henry VIII married [[Catherine of Aragon]] and [[Anne of Cleves]] at Greenwich, and both [[Mary I of England|Mary]] (18 February 1516) and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] (7 September 1533) were born at Greenwich. His son [[Edward VI]] also died there at age 15.

The palace of Placentia, in turn, became Elizabeth's favourite summer residence.<ref name=Green/> Both she and her sister Mary I used the palace extensively, and Elizabeth's Council planned the [[Spanish Armada]] campaign there in 1588.

=== Stuart ===
[[File:Adriaen van Stalbemt - A View of Greenwich.jpg|thumb|[[Adriaen van Stalbemt]]'s ''A View of Greenwich'', c. 1632. [[Royal Collection]], London.]]
[[James I]] carried out the final remodelling work on Greenwich Palace, granting the manor to his wife [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne of Denmark]]. In 1616 Anne commissioned [[Inigo Jones]] to design and build the surviving [[Queen's House]] as the final addition to the palace.

[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] granted the manor to his wife [[Queen Henrietta Maria]], for whom Inigo Jones completed the Queen's House. During the [[English Civil War]], the palace was used as a biscuit factory and prisoner-of-war camp. Then, in the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], the palace and park were seized to become a 'mansion' for the [[Lord Protector]].

By the time of the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], the Palace of Placentia had fallen into disuse and was pulled down. New buildings began to be established as a grand palace for [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], but only the King Charles block was completed. Charles II also redesigned and replanted [[Greenwich Park]] and founded and built the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]].

Prince James (later King [[James II of England|James II & VII]]), as [[Duke of York]] and [[Lord Admiral]] until 1673, was often at Greenwich with his brother Charles and, according to [[Samuel Pepys]], he proposed the idea of creating a Royal Naval Hospital. This was eventually established at Greenwich by his daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], who in 1692–1693 commissioned [[Christopher Wren]] to design the Royal Hospital for Seamen (now the [[Old Royal Naval College]]). The work was begun under her widower [[William III of England|William III]] in 1696 and completed by [[Hawksmoor]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[Prince George of Denmark]] continued to patronise the project.

=== Hanoverian ===

[[George I of Great Britain|George I]] landed at Greenwich from Hanover on his accession in 1714. His successor [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted the Royal Hospital for Seamen the forfeited estates of the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite]] [[James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater|Earl of Derwentwater]], which allowed the building to be completed by 1751.

In 1805, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] granted the [[Queen's House]] to the [[Royal Naval Asylum]] (an orphanage school), which amalgamated in 1821–1825 with the Greenwich Hospital School. Extended with the buildings that now house the [[National Maritime Museum]], it was renamed the [[Royal Hospital School]] by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1892.

[[George IV]] donated nearly 40 paintings to the hospital in 1824, at a stroke creating a gallery in the [[Painted Hall]]. These now form the Greenwich Hospital Collection at the National Maritime Museum. Subsequently, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] and [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]] were both regular donors and visitors to the gallery.

===Victorian and Edwardian ===

[[Queen Victoria]] rarely visited Greenwich, but in 1845 her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] personally bought [[Admiral Nelson|Nelson's]] [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] coat for the Naval Gallery.

In 1838 the [[London and Greenwich Railway]] (L&GR) completed the very first steam railway in London. It started at London Bridge and had its terminus at London Street (now Greenwich High Road). It was also the first to be built specifically for passengers, and the first ever elevated railway, having 878 arches over its almost four mile stretch. South of the railway's viaduct over [[Deptford Creek]] is a Victorian [[Deptford pumping station|pumping station]] constructed in 1864 as part of Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]]'s [[London sewerage system]] (the Southern Outfall Sewer flows under Greenwich town centre).

In 1853 the local Scottish Presbyterian community built a church, St Mark's, nearby which was extended twice in the 1860s during the ministry of [[Adolph Saphir]], eventually accommodating 1,000 worshippers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Saphir,_Adolph_(DNB00)|title=Dictionary of National Biography 1850-1900 Adolph Saphir|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Saphir,_Adolph_(DNB00)|title=Saphir, Adolph (DNB00)|last=Carlyle|first=Edward Irving}}</ref>

In 1864 opposite the railway terminus, theatrical entrepreneur [[Sefton Henry Parry|Sefton Parry]] built the thousand seater [[Greenwich Theatre|New Greenwich Theatre]].<ref>''The Era'', 29 May 1864, p. 10, New Greenwich Theatre.</ref> [[William Morton (theatre manager)|William Morton]] was one of its more successful managers. The theatre was demolished in 1937 to make way for a new [[Greenwich Town Hall, London|Town Hall]], now a listed building under new ownership and renamed Meridian House.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=The Borough Hall and Meridian House (former Greenwich Town Hall)|num=1213855|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>

Greenwich Station is at the northern apex of the Ashburnham Triangle, a residential estate developed by the Ashburnham family, mainly between 1830 and 1870, on land previously developed as market gardens. It is now a designated conservation area.<ref>Report on Ashburnham triangle by Conservation Team, Development Town Planning First Floor, Peggy Middleton House 50 Woolwich New Road, London SE18 6HQ.</ref> The present Greenwich Theatre, further to the east, was constructed inside the shell of a Victorian music hall. Beginning life in 1855 as an annexe to the Rose and Crown, the music hall was rebuilt in 1871 by Charles Crowder and subsequently operated under many names. The meridian was established in 1851.

=== Modern and the present ===
[[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] both supported the creation of the [[National Maritime Museum]], and Mary presented the museum with many items.

The Prince Albert, [[Duke of York]] (later [[George VI]]), laid the foundation stone of the new [[Royal Hospital School]] when it moved out to [[Holbrook, Suffolk|Holbrook]], Suffolk. In 1937 his first public act as king (three weeks before coronation) was to open the National Maritime Museum in the buildings vacated by the school. The king was accompanied by his mother Queen Mary, his wife Queen Elizabeth (later [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]) and the Princess Elizabeth (now [[Elizabeth II]].)

Princess Elizabeth and her consort Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (who was ennobled [[Baron Greenwich]] on marriage in 1947) made their first public and official visit to Greenwich in 1948 to receive the Freedom of the Borough for Philip. In the same year, he became a trustee of the National Maritime Museum. Philip, now the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], was a trustee for 52 years until 2000, when he became its first [[patron]]. The Duke of Edinburgh has also been a patron of the ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' (which was opened by the Queen in 1957) since 1952.

During the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] of 1977, the Queen embarked at Greenwich for the Jubilee River Pageant. In 1987, she was aboard the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] ship Pacific Princess when it moored alongside the [[Old Royal Naval College]] for the company's 150th anniversary celebrations.

To mark the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]], it was announced on 5 January 2010 that on 3 February 2012 the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|London Borough of Greenwich]] would become the fourth to have Royal Borough status, the others being the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]], the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] and the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]].<ref>See also [[List of UK place names with royal patronage#Royal Borough|Royal Borough]].</ref> The status was granted in recognition of the borough's historic links with the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Royal Family]], the location of the [[Prime Meridian]] and its being a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/LeisureCulture/RoyalGreenwich/RoyalGreenwich.htm |title=Greenwich to become Royal Borough |date=5 January 2010 |access-date=5 January 2010 |publisher=Greenwich London Borough Council |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108082815/http://www.greenwich.gov.uk/Greenwich/LeisureCulture/RoyalGreenwich/RoyalGreenwich.htm |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Royal Borough of Greenwich}}
[[File:Greenwich Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Greenwich Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]
Greenwich is covered by the Greenwich West and Peninsula wards of the London Borough of Greenwich, which was formed in 1965 by merging the former [[Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich]] with that part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]] which lay south of the [[River Thames]]. Along with [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] Westcombe, [[Charlton, London|Charlton]], Glyndon, [[Woolwich]] Riverside, and [[Woolwich Common]], it elects a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Greenwich and Woolwich]]; currently the MP is [[Matthew Pennycook]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/greenwichandwoolwich |title=ukpollingreport.co.uk » Greenwich and Woolwich |publisher=ukpollingreport.co.uk |access-date=24 September 2009 }}</ref>

==Geography==

===Topography===
The town of Greenwich is built on a broad platform to the south of the outside of a broad meander in the River Thames, with a safe deep water anchorage lying in the river. To the south, the land rises steeply, {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} through Greenwich Park to the town of [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]. The higher areas consist of a sedimentary layer of gravelly soils, known as the ''Blackheath Beds'', that spread through much of the south-east over a chalk outcrop—with sands, loam and seams of clay at the lower levels by the river.

Greenwich is bordered by [[River Ravensbourne|Deptford Creek]] and [[Deptford]] to the west; the residential area of [[Westcombe Park]] to the east; the [[River Thames]] to the north; and the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] and Blackheath to the south. The [[Greenwich Peninsula]], also known as North Greenwich, forms the main projection of the town (to the northeast of the town centre).

The ''[[Cutty Sark]]'' (a [[clipper]] ship) has been preserved in a dry dock by the river. A major fire in May 2007 destroyed a part of the ship, although much had already been removed for restoration. Nearby for many years was also displayed ''[[Gipsy Moth IV]]'', the {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} yacht sailed by Sir [[Francis Chichester]] in his single-handed, 226-day [[circumnavigation]] of the globe during 1966–67. In 2004, ''Gipsy Moth IV'' was removed from Greenwich, and after restoration work completed a second circumnavigation in May 2007. On the riverside in front of the north-west corner of the hospital is an obelisk erected in memory of [[Arctic]] explorer [[Joseph René Bellot]].

Rowing has been part of life on the river at Greenwich for hundreds of years and the first Greenwich Regatta was held in 1785. The annual [[Great River Race]] along the Thames [[Tideway]] finishes at the Cutty Sark. The nearby Trafalgar Rowing Centre in Crane Street is home to [[Curlew Rowing Club|Curlew]] and [[Globe Rowing Club|Globe]] rowing clubs.

The [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Old Royal Naval College]] is Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s domed masterpiece at the centre of the heritage site. The site is administered by the Greenwich Foundation and several of the buildings are let to the [[University of Greenwich]] and one, the King Charles block, to [[Trinity College of Music]]. Within the complex is the former college dining room, the [[Painted Hall]], this was painted by [[James Thornhill]], and the [[St Paul's Chapel, Greenwich|Chapel of St Peter and St Paul]], with an interior designed by [[James 'Athenian' Stuart]].

===Greenwich Park===
{{main|Greenwich Park}}
Behind the former Naval College is the [[National Maritime Museum]] housed in buildings forming another symmetrical group and grand arcade around the [[Queen's House]], designed by [[Inigo Jones]]. Continuing to the south, [[Greenwich Park]] is a [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Park]] of {{convert|183|acre|km2|1}}, laid out in the 17th century and formed from the hunting grounds of the Royal [[Palace of Placentia]].<ref>''Greenwich and Blackheath Past'' Felix Barker (Historical Publications Ltd., 1999) {{ISBN|0-948667-55-9}}</ref>

[[File:TulipStair QueensHouse Greenwich.jpg|thumb|Spiral staircase and lantern at the [[Queen's House]] in Greenwich]]

The park rises towards [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and at the top of this hill is a statue of [[James Wolfe]], commander of the British expedition to capture [[Quebec]].<ref>[http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/wolfe.htm ''General Wolfe Statue'' (Greenwich Guide)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727053147/http://www.greenwich-guide.org.uk/wolfe.htm |date=27 July 2013 }} accessed 10 December 2007</ref> Nearby a major group of buildings within the park includes the former [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]]; the [[Prime Meridian]] passes through this building.

[[Greenwich Mean Time]] was at one time based on the time observations made at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, before being superseded by [[Coordinated Universal Time]]. While there is no longer a working astronomical observatory at Greenwich, a [[Time ball|ball]] still drops daily to mark the exact moment of 1&nbsp;p.m., and there is a museum of astronomical and navigational tools, particularly [[John Harrison]]'s [[marine chronometer]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Howse|1997}}</ref>

The [[Ranger's House]] lies at the Blackheath end of the park and houses the Wernher Collection of art,<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.12835 ''The Wernher Collection (Ranger's House)''] ([[English Heritage]]) accessed 10 December 2007</ref> and many fine houses, including [[John Vanbrugh|Vanbrugh's house]] lie on Maze Hill, on the western edge of the park.

===Town centre===
[[File:Downtown Greenwich, England 2.jpg|right|thumb|Town centre|alt=A curving street with older two- and three-storey buildings on either side. In front is a black London taxicab with an advert; midway down the street is an intersection with heavy traffic. A cupolaed clock tower rises in the rear]]
Georgian and Victorian architecture dominates in the town centre which spreads to the west of the park and Royal Naval College. Much of this forms a one-way system around a covered market, [[Greenwich Market]] and the arthouse Greenwich Cinema. Up the hill from the centre, there are many streets of Georgian houses, including the [[Fan Museum]], on Croom's Hill. Nearby at the junction of Croom's Hill with Nevada Street, is [[Greenwich Theatre]]. The [[Greenwich Playhouse]] closed in 2012.

====Market====
[[File:Greenwich Market interior.jpg|thumb|Greenwich Market|alt=An interior of a building with a translucent glass roof supported by blue-painted steel latticework. On the main floor are a number of different stalls with customers inspecting various wares.]]
There has been a market at Greenwich since the 14th century, but the history of the present market dates from 1700 when a charter to run two markets, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, was assigned by Lord Romney ([[Henry Sydney, 1st Earl of Romney|Henry, Earl of Romney]])<ref name =Green/> to the Commissioners of Greenwich Hospital for 1000 years.<ref>[http://www.greenwichmarketconsultation.co.uk/default.asp?page=288 History of Greenwich Market] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112223825/http://www.greenwichmarketconsultation.co.uk/default.asp?page=288 |date=12 January 2012 }} at Greenwich Hospital</ref>

The market is part of "the Island site", bounded by College Approach, Greenwich Church Street, King William Walk and Nelson Road, near the National Maritime Museum and the Royal Observatory. The buildings surrounding the market are [[Grade 2 listed]] and were established in 1827–1833 under the direction of [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]].<ref name="Heritage">{{cite web|title=Maritime Greenwich: World Heritage Site – Management plan|url=http://visitgreenwich.org.uk/sites/default/files/medialibrary/final_maritime_greenwich_management_plan_2014_1v3_1_1.pdf|website=Visit Greenwich|publisher=Royal Borough of Greenwich|access-date=26 September 2016}}</ref><ref name="Phantom">{{cite web|title=Historic Regeneration Schemes|url=http://www.thegreenwichphantom.co.uk/2007/10/historic-regeneration-schemes/|website=The Greenwich Phantom|access-date=26 September 2016}}</ref> A market roof was added in 1902–08 (and replaced in 2016). Later significant development occurred in 1958–60 and during the 1980s.

The landowner, Greenwich Hospital, enhanced the market between 2014 and early 2016. Following the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020 the rents for several of the marketstalls were increased by up to 60% as Greenwich Hospital's managing agent [[Knight Frank]] said it was losing money with fewer stalls operating and only four days of trading a week.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Butler|first=Sarah|date=2020-08-19|title=London's Greenwich Market stalls fear closure following huge rent increase|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/19/londons-greenwich-market-stalls-face-closure-following-huge-rent-increase|access-date=2020-08-19|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Millennium Leisure Park===
[[File:Millennium Leisure Park, East Greenwich - geograph.org.uk - 1163888.jpg|thumb|Millennium Leisure Park]]
About {{convert|1.0|mi|km|1}} east of Greenwich town centre, the Millennium Leisure Park is an out-of-town [[retail park]] on Bugsby's Way in east Greenwich. It consists of retail outlets ([[IKEA]] and [[B&Q]]), restaurants and an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] cinema. Greenwich Shopping Park is about {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1}} further east, in [[Charlton, London|Charlton]].

==Greenwich Mean Time==
{{Main|Greenwich Mean Time}}
[[File:Greenwich-Royal Observatory-016.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Observatory with the [[time ball]] atop the Octagon Room]]
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is a term originally referring to [[solar time|mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in Greenwich.  It is commonly used in practice to refer to [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) when this is viewed as a [[time zone]], especially by bodies connected with the United Kingdom, such as the [[BBC World Service]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/help/2007/12/071204_gmt.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318150112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/help/2007/12/071204_gmt.shtml|archive-date=2009-03-18|date=2007-12-07|access-date=18 September 2009|website=BBC World Service|title=What is GMT?}}</ref> the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Met Office]] and others, although strictly UTC is an [[atomic clock|atomic]] [[time standard|time scale]] which only approximates GMT with a tolerance of 0.9 second.  It is also used to refer to [[Universal Time]] (UT), which is a standard astronomical concept used in many technical fields and is referred to by the phrase [[Zulu time]].

As the United Kingdom grew into an advanced [[maritime nation]], British mariners kept at least one [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] on GMT in order to calculate their [[longitude]] from the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich meridian]], which was by convention considered to have longitude zero degrees (this convention was internationally adopted in the [[International Meridian Conference]] of 1884).{{refn|group=note|Voting took place on 13 October and the resolutions were adopted on 22 October 1884.<ref>{{harvnb|Howse|1997|pp=12, 137}}</ref>}} Note that the synchronization of the [[marine chronometer|chronometer]] on GMT did not affect shipboard time itself, which was still solar time. But this practice, combined with mariners from other nations drawing from [[Nevil Maskelyne]]'s method of [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]]s based on observations at Greenwich, eventually led to GMT being used worldwide as a reference time independent of location. Most time zones were based upon this reference as a number of hours and half-hours "ahead of GMT" or "behind GMT".

In recognition of the suburb's astronomical links, [[2830 Greenwich|Asteroid 2830]] has been named 'Greenwich'.<ref>''Dictionary of Minor Planet Names'' Lutz D. Schmadel (Springer 2003) {{ISBN|3-540-00238-3}}</ref>
