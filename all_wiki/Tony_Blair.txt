'''Anthony Charles Lynton Blair''' (born 6 May 1953) is a British politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1997 to 2007 and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1994 to 2007. After his resignation, he was appointed Special Envoy of the [[Quartet on the Middle East]], an office which he held until 2015. He currently serves as the executive chairman of the [[Tony Blair Institute for Global Change]], established in 2016. As Labour leader, Blair advocated the "[[Third Way]]."{{efn|Politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent, advocating [[social justice]], cohesion, the equal worth of each citizen, and [[equal opportunity]].}}

Blair was born in [[Edinburgh]]; [[Leo Blair|his father, Leo]], was a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]] and academic. After attending the [[independent school]] [[Fettes College]], he studied law at [[St John's College, Oxford]] and became a barrister. He became involved in Labour politics and was elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]. He supported moving the party to the [[Centrism|centre]] of British politics in an attempt to help it win power (it had been out of government since [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]). He was appointed to the party's [[Shadow Cabinet of Neil Kinnock|frontbench]] in 1988 and became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] in 1992. He became [[leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] on his [[1994 Labour Party leadership election|election as Labour Party leader]] in 1994, following the sudden death of his predecessor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Under Blair, the party used the phrase "[[New Labour]]" to distance itself from previous Labour politics and the traditional idea of [[socialism]]. Despite opposition from Labour's left wing, he abolished [[Clause IV]], the party's formal commitment to the [[nationalisation]] of the economy, weakened [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] influence in the party, and committed to the [[free market]] and the [[European Union]]. In 1997, the Labour Party won its largest landslide [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] victory in its history. Blair became the country's [[List of prime ministers of the United Kingdom by age|youngest leader]] since 1812 and remains the party's longest-serving occupant of the office. Labour won two more general elections under his leadership—in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], in which it won another landslide victory (albeit with the lowest turnout since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]), and in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], with a greatly reduced majority. He resigned as Prime Minister and Labour Party leader in 2007 and was succeeded by [[Gordon Brown]], who had been his [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] since 1997.

[[Premiership of Tony Blair|Blair's governments]] enacted constitutional reforms, removing most [[hereditary peer]]s from the [[House of Lords]], while also establishing the UK's [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] and reforming the office of [[Lord Chancellor]] (thereby [[Separation of powers|separating judicial powers]] from the legislative and executive branches). His government held referenda in which Scottish and Welsh electorates voted in favour of [[Devolution|devolved administration]], paving the way for the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament|Welsh Assembly]] (today parliament) in 1999. He was also involved in negotiating the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. His time in office occurred during a period of continued economic growth, but this became increasingly dependent on mounting debt. In 1997, his government gave the [[Bank of England]] powers to set [[interest rate]]s autonomously and he later oversaw a large increase in [[Government spending in the United Kingdom|public spending]], especially in healthcare and education. He championed [[multiculturalism]] and, between 1997 and 2007, immigration rose considerably, especially after his government welcomed immigration from the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|new EU member states]] in 2004. This provided a cheap and flexible labour supply but also fuelled [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|Euroscepticism]], especially among some of his party's core voters. His other social policies were generally [[Progressivism|progressive]]; he introduced the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], and in 2004 allowed gay couples to enter into [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]]. However, he declared himself "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" and oversaw increasing incarceration rates and [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003|new anti-social behaviour legislation]], despite contradictory evidence about the change in crime rates.

Blair oversaw British interventions in [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1999) and [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]] (2000) which were generally perceived as successful. During the [[War on Terror]], he supported the [[foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration]] and ensured that the British Armed Forces participated in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] from 2001 and, more controversially, the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Blair argued that the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime possessed an active [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) program, but no stockpiles of WMDs or an active WMD program were ever found in Iraq. The [[Iraq War]] became increasingly unpopular among the British public, and he was criticised by opponents and (in 2016) the [[Iraq Inquiry]] for waging an unjustified and unnecessary invasion. He was in office when the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7/7 bombings]] took place (2005) and introduced a range of [[Terrorism Acts|anti-terror legislation]]. His legacy remains controversial, not least because of his interventions in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Despite his electoral successes and reforms, he has also been criticised for his relationship with the media, [[Powers of the prime minister of the United Kingdom#Presidentialisation thesis|centralisation of executive powers]], and aspects of his social and economic policies.

Blair has an older brother, [[William Blair (judge)|Sir William Blair]], a [[High Court]] judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair's first home was with his family at Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name="Edinburgh Evening-birthplace" />

Blair's first relocation was when he was nineteen months old. At the end of 1954, Blair's parents and their two sons moved from Paisley Terrace to [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].<ref name="leoguarobit">{{cite news |author=Julia Langdon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/17/leo-blair |title="Leo Blair obituary" The Guardian, 17 November 2012 |publisher=Theguardian.com |date=17 November 2012 |accessdate=8 June 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325203758/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/17/leo-blair |archive-date=25 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> His father lectured in law at the [[University of Adelaide]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony's big adventure|url=http://observer.theguardian.com/secondterm/story/0,8224,944191,00.html|series=The Observer|location=UK|work=The Guardian|date=27 April 2003|accessdate=18 November 2006|first=Kamal|last=Ahmed}}</ref> It was when in Australia that Blair's sister Sarah was born. The Blairs lived in the suburb of [[Dulwich, South Australia|Dulwich]] close to the university. The family returned to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1958. They lived for a time with Hazel's mother and stepfather (William McClay) at their home in [[Stepps]] on the outskirts of north-east Glasgow. Blair's father accepted a job as a lecturer at [[Durham University]], and thus moved the family to [[Durham, England]]. Aged five, this marked the beginning of a long association Blair was to have with Durham.<ref name="leoguarobit" />

== Early political career ==
Blair joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. In the early 1980s, he was involved in [[Labour movement|Labour politics]] in [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]], where he aligned himself with the "[[soft left]]" of the party. He put himself forward as a candidate for the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney council]] elections of 1982 in Queensbridge ward, a safe Labour area, but was not selected.<ref>John Rentoul, ''Tony Blair'', Warner Books, 1996, p. 101.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>

In 1982, Blair was selected as the Labour Party candidate for the safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], where there was a forthcoming by-election.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFQDPXqf-80 "Labour's Old Romantic: A Film Portrait of Michael Foot"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217162458/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFQDPXqf-80 |date=17 February 2016 }}, ''[[BBC Two]]'', [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rm0cc Friday 5 March 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220005308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rm0cc |date=20 December 2014 }}.

With a general election due, Blair had not been selected as a candidate anywhere. He was invited to stand again in [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], and was initially inclined to agree but was advised by his head of chambers Derry Irvine to find somewhere else which might be winnable.<ref>John Rentoul, "Tony Blair", Warner Books, 1996, p. 109.</ref> The situation was complicated by the fact that Labour was fighting a legal action against planned boundary changes, and had selected candidates on the basis of previous boundaries. When the legal challenge failed, the party had to rerun all selections on the new boundaries; most were based on existing seats, but unusually in County Durham a new [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] constituency had been created out of Labour-voting areas which had no obvious predecessor seat.<ref>John Rentoul, ''Tony Blair'', Warner Books, 1996, p. 115.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

The selection for Sedgefield did not begin until after the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] was called. Blair's initial inquiries discovered that the left was trying to arrange the selection for [[Les Huckfield]], sitting MP for Nuneaton who was trying elsewhere; several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were also interested in it. When he discovered the [[Trimdon Labour Club|Trimdon branch]] had not yet made a nomination, Blair visited them and won the support of the branch secretary [[John Burton (political agent)|John Burton]], and with Burton's help was nominated by the branch. At the last minute, he was added to the shortlist and won the selection over Huckfield. It was the last candidate selection made by Labour before the election, and was made after the Labour Party had issued biographies of all its candidates ("Labour's Election Who's Who").<ref>"Labour's Election Who's Who", Labour Party, 1983, Appendix p. 2.</ref>

In his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, "I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear.

Once elected, Blair's political ascent was rapid. He received his first [[Front bench|front-bench]] appointment in 1984 as assistant [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] spokesman. In May 1985, he appeared on BBC's ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'', arguing that the Conservative Government's [[Public Order Act 1986|Public Order White Paper]] was a threat to civil liberties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCAQ520E|title=BBC Archive|publisher=BBC Programme Catalogue|accessdate=20 April 2010|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714123209/http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCAQ520E|archive-date=14 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Blair demanded an inquiry into the [[Bank of England]]'s decision to rescue the collapsed [[Johnson Matthey]] bank in October 1985. By this time, Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party (headed by leader [[Neil Kinnock]]) and was promoted after the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]] to the Shadow [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Trade and Industry]] team as spokesman on the [[City of London]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Leadership roles ===
In 1987, he stood for election to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], receiving 71 votes.<ref>{{cite news|first=John |last=Carvel|title=A fresh team of 'Yaks' will take on Labour's burden|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 July 1987|page= 2}}</ref> When Kinnock resigned after a fourth consecutive Conservative victory in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], Blair became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] under [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. The old guard argued that trends showed they were regaining strength under Smith's strong leadership.  Meanwhile, the breakaway [[Social Democratic Party|SDP]] faction had merged with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]; the resulting [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] seemed to pose a major threat to the Labour base. Blair, the leader of the modernising faction, had an entirely different vision, arguing that the long-term trends had to be reversed. The Labour Party was too locked into a base that was shrinking, since it was based on the working-class, on trade unions, and on residents of subsidised council housing. The rapidly growing middle-class was largely ignored, especially the more ambitious working-class families. They aspired to middle-class status, but accepted the Conservative argument that Labour was holding ambitious people back with its levelling-down policies. They increasingly saw Labour in terms defined by the opposition, regarding higher taxes and higher interest rates. The steps towards what would become New Labour were procedural, but essential. Calling on the slogan, "[[One member, one vote]]" John Smith (with limited input from Blair) secured an end to the trade union block vote for Westminster candidate selection at the 1993 conference.<ref>John Rentoul, ''Tony Blair: Prime Minister'' (2001) pp. 206–18</ref> But Blair and the modernisers wanted Smith to go further still, and called for radical adjustment of Party goals by repealing "Clause IV," the historic commitment to nationalisation of industry. This would be achieved in 1995.<ref>Rentoul, ''Tony Blair'' (2001) pp. 249–66.</ref>

=== Military intervention and the War on Terror ===
In his first six years in office, Blair ordered British troops into combat five times, more than any other prime minister in British history. This included Iraq in both [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|1998]] and [[Iraq War|2003]], [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1999), [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]] (2000) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6361771.stm "Blair: The Inside Story"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223141101/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6361771.stm |date=23 December 2007 }}, BBC, 22 February 2007.</ref>

The [[Kosovo War]], which Blair had advocated on moral grounds, was initially a failure when it relied solely on air strikes; the threat of a ground offensive convinced Serbia's [[Slobodan Milošević]] to withdraw. Blair had been a major advocate for a ground offensive, which [[Bill Clinton]] was reluctant to do, and ordered that 50,000 soldiers – most of the available British Army – should be made ready for action.<ref>Andrew Marr, ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing), p. 550<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> The following year, the limited [[Operation Palliser]] in [[Sierra Leone]] swiftly swung the tide against the rebel forces; before deployment, the [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone]] had been on the verge of collapse.<ref>Gberie, Lansana (2005).

From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] of [[George W. Bush]], participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The invasion of Iraq was particularly controversial, as it attracted widespread public opposition and 139 of Blair's own MPs opposed it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842|work=BBC News|title=The rise and fall of New Labour|date=3 August 2010|access-date=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805051127/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842|archive-date=5 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Further|Blairism}}

=== Social reforms ===
In 2001, Blair said, "We are a [[Centre-left politics|left of centre]] party, pursuing economic prosperity and social justice as partners and not as opposites".<ref>Polly Toynbee, Michael White and Patrick Wintour [http://society.theguardian.com/futureforpublicservices/story/0,,550059,00.html "We're a left-of-centre party pursuing prosperity and social justice"], ''The Guardian'', 11 September 2001.</ref> Blair rarely applies such labels to himself, but he promised before the 1997 election that [[New Labour]] would govern "from the radical centre", and according to one lifelong Labour Party member, has always described himself as a [[social democracy|social democrat]].<ref>[http://www.hulver.com/scoop/story/2007/5/17/73955/4678 "The Death of Socialism"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603154210/http://www.hulver.com/scoop/story/2007/5/17/73955/4678 |date=3 June 2007 }}, hulver.com, 17 May 2007.</ref> However, in a 2007 opinion piece in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]], left-wing commentator Neil Lawson described Blair as to the [[Centre-right politics|right of centre]].<ref>Neal Lawson, [https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,2060360,00.html "A decade of Blair has left the Labour party on its knees"], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2007</ref> A [[YouGov]] opinion poll in 2005 found that a small majority of British voters, including many [[New Labour]] supporters, placed Blair on the right of the political spectrum.<ref>YouGov UK Polling Report, [http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/30 ''Left vs Right''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703231557/http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/30 |date=3 July 2007 }}, 23 September 2005</ref> The ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the other hand has argued that Blair is not conservative, but instead a [[populist]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9526a670-04dc-11dc-80ed-000b5df10621.html "Why Blair was no conservative"], ''Financial Times'', 18 May 2007.</ref>

Critics and admirers tend to agree that Blair's electoral success was based on his ability to occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the political spectrum, to the extent that he has been fundamentally at odds with traditional Labour Party values. Some left-wing critics, such as [[Mike Marqusee]] in 2001, argued that Blair oversaw the final stage of a long term shift of the Labour Party to the right.<ref>Mike Marquesee, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj91/marqusee.htm "Labour's long march to the right"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422134305/http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj91/marqusee.htm |date=22 April 2007 }}, ''International Socialism'', Issue 91, Summer 2001</ref>

=== Economic policies ===

He did not reverse the [[impact of the privatisation of British Rail|privatisation of the railways]] enacted by his predecessor [[John Major]] and instead strengthened regulation (by creating the [[Office of Rail Regulation]]) and limited fare rises to [[Retail price index|inflation]] +1%.<ref>{{citation|url=http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-are|title=Who we are|publisher=Office of Rail Regulation|date=28 January 2014|accessdate=11 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312021110/http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-are|archive-date=12 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/en2003/2003en20.htm Explanatory Notes to the Act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027151849/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/en2003/2003en20.htm |date=27 October 2007 }}, opsi.gov.uk.

Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the [[First Blair ministry|government]]'s abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/06/0605/straw.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97|access-date=13 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826020835/http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/06/0605/straw.shtml|archive-date=26 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country.

==== Syria and Libya ====
A Freedom of Information request by ''The Sunday Times'' in 2012 revealed that Blair's government considered [[honorary knighthood|knighting]] Syria's President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. The documents showed Blair was willing to appear alongside Assad at a joint press conference even though the Syrians would probably have settled for a farewell handshake for the cameras; British officials sought to manipulate the media to portray Assad in a favourable light; and Blair's aides tried to help Assad's "photogenic" wife boost her profile. The newspaper noted:

After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the [[Prime Minister's Official Spokesman]] (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was [[Alastair Campbell]], who served in that role from May 1997 to 8 June 2001, after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on 29 August 2003 in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Alastair Campbell|url=http://www.alastaircampbell.org/about|publisher=Alastair Campbell.org|accessdate=2 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630115037/http://www.alastaircampbell.org/about/|archive-date=30 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

Blair had close relationships with the Clinton family.

== Relationship with Labour Party ==
Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure was criticised by the British press and Members of Parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election.<ref name=independent-09-04-06 /> Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.<ref name=independent-09-04-06>{{cite news|title='Deluded': Extraordinary attack on Blair by Cabinet|date=4 September 2006|work=The Independent|location=UK|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece|first=Francis|last=Elliott|accessdate=25 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521155231/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece|archive-date=21 May 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Gordon Brown smiles.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gordon Brown]] (''pictured'' in 2002) was Chancellor under Blair. Together, they made a pact that Brown would succeed Blair as prime minister.]]
After the death of [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] in 1994, Blair and his close colleague [[Gordon Brown]] (they shared an office at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]<ref name="Timeline" />) were both seen as possible candidates for the party leadership. They agreed not to stand against each other, it is said, as part of a supposed Blair–Brown pact. Brown, who considered himself the senior of the two, understood that Blair would give way to him: opinion polls soon indicated, however, that Blair appeared to enjoy greater support among voters.<ref>A MORI opinion poll published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 15 May found that, among the general public, Blair had the support of 32%, John Prescott 19%, Margaret Beckett 14%, Gordon Brown 9% and [[Robin Cook]] 5%.</ref> Their relationship in power became so turbulent that (it was reported) the [[deputy prime minister]], [[John Prescott]], often had to act as "marriage guidance counsellor".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.theguardian.com/labour2003/comment/0,,1056215,00.html|title=A marriage on the rocks|author-link=Andrew Rawnsley|first=Andrew|last=Rawnsley|work=The Observer|location=UK|publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd.|date=5 October 2003|accessdate=5 March 2007}}</ref>

During the 2010 election campaign Blair publicly endorsed Gordon Brown's leadership, praising the way he had handled the financial crisis.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/30/tony-blair-speech-gordon-brown-tories Tony Blair throws himself into election campaign with praise for Gordon Brown and harsh words for Tories"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213810/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/30/tony-blair-speech-gordon-brown-tories |date=4 March 2016 }}, ''The Guardian'', 30 March 2010.</ref>

Bush]] are guilty of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and genocide as a result of their roles in the 2003 Iraq War.

=== Response to the Iraq Inquiry ===
{{Further|Findings of the Iraq Inquiry}}
The Chilcot report after the conclusion of the [[Iraq Inquiry]] was issued on 6 July 2016 and it criticised Blair for joining the US in the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] in 2003. Afterwards, Blair issued a statement and held a two-hour press conference to apologise and to justify the decisions he had made in 2003 "in good faith" and denying allegations that the war had led to a significant increase in terrorism.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mason |first=Rowena |date=6 July 2016 |title=Tony Blair: 'I express more sorrow, regret and apology than you can ever believe' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/tony-blair-deliberately-exaggerated-threat-from-iraq-chilcot-report-war-inquiry |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |accessdate=7 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144112/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/tony-blair-deliberately-exaggerated-threat-from-iraq-chilcot-report-war-inquiry |archive-date=6 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> He acknowledged that the report made "real and material criticisms of preparation, planning, process and of the relationship with the United States" but cited sections of the report that he said "should lay to rest allegations of bad faith, lies or deceit". He stated: "whether people agree or disagree with my decision to take military action against Saddam Hussein; I took it in good faith and in what I believed to be the best interests of the country.&nbsp;... I will take full responsibility for any mistakes without exception or excuse. I will at the same time say why, nonetheless, I believe that it was better to remove Saddam Hussein and why I do not believe this is the cause of the terrorism we see today whether in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world".<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-tony-blair-findings-lie-iraq-war-saddam-hussein-dodgy-dossier-inquiry-latest-a7122611.html Chilcot report: Tony Blair claims findings show he did not lie over Iraq War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011212649/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chilcot-report-tony-blair-findings-lie-iraq-war-saddam-hussein-dodgy-dossier-inquiry-latest-a7122611.html |date=11 October 2017 }}, ''The Independent'' (6 July 2016).</ref><ref>[http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/statement-from-tony-blair-on-chilcot-report/ Statement from Tony Blair on Chilcot Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706182456/http://www.tonyblairoffice.org/news/entry/statement-from-tony-blair-on-chilcot-report/ |date=6 July 2016 }}, Office of Tony Blair (6 July 2016).</ref>

Blair wrote in an op-ed published by ''The Washington Post'' on 8 February 2019: "Where Iran is exercising military interference, it should be strongly pushed back. Where it is seeking influence, it should be countered. Where its proxies operate, it should be held responsible. Where its networks exist, they should be disrupted.

=== European Union ===
Blair did not want [[Brexit|the UK to leave the EU]]. Blair had called for a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. Blair also maintained, that once the terms deciding how the UK leaves the EU were known the people should vote again on those terms. Blair stated, "We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If Parliament can't then it should decide to go back to the people."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/tony-blair-britain-and-eu-should-prepare-for-second-brexit-referendum/ |title=Tony Blair: Britain and EU should prepare for second Brexit referendum |access-date=16 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181216163656/https://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/tony-blair-britain-and-eu-should-prepare-for-second-brexit-referendum/ |archive-date=16 December 2018 |url-status=live |date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>

However after the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] when the pro-withdrawal Conservative party won a sizeable majority of seats, Blair argued that remain supporters should "face up to one simple point: we lost" and "pivot to a completely new position...We're going to have to be constructive about it and see how Britain develops a constructive relationship with Europe and finds its new niche in the world." <ref>{{Cite web|last=Ferber|first=Alona|date=30 January 2020|title=Tony Blair: Remainers must accept they lost and now be constructive over Brexit|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/01/tony-blair-remainers-must-accept-they-lost-and-now-be-constructive-over-brexit|access-date=26 August 2020|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en}}</ref>

=== Views on 2020s American power ===
Blair was interviewed in June 2020 for an article in the American magazine [[The Atlantic (magazine)|''The Atlantic'']] on European views of U.S. foreign policy following the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and resulting [[Coronavirus recession|recession]], increased tensions in [[Sino-American relations]], and the [[George Floyd protests]]. He affirmed his belief in the continued strength of American [[soft power]] and the need to address Iranian military aggression, European defence budgets, and Chinese trade. He said, however, "I think it's fair to say a lot of political leaders in Europe are dismayed by what they see as the isolationism growing in America and the seeming indifference to alliances. But I think there will come a time when America decides in its own interest to reengage, so I'm optimistic that America will in the end understand that this is not about relegating your self-interest behind the common interest; it's an understanding that by acting collectively in alliance with others you promote your own interests." Blair warned that structural issues plaguing American domestic policy needed to be addressed imminently.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/06/america-image-power-trump/613228/|title=The Decline of the American World|last=McTague|first=Tom|date=24 June 2020|publisher=The Atlantic|access-date=24 June 2020}}</ref>

Blair's financial assets are structured in a complicated manner, and as such estimates of their extent vary widely.<ref>Robert Mendick, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8999847/Blair-Inc-How-Tony-Blair-makes-his-fortune.html "Blair Inc: How Tony Blair makes his fortune"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516233429/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8999847/Blair-Inc-How-Tony-Blair-makes-his-fortune.html |date=16 May 2018 }} Robert Mendick, ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 January 2012.

=== Religious faith ===
In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] broadcast on [[ITV1]] on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: "I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people&nbsp;... and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well."<ref>{{cite news|title=Blair 'prayed to God' over Iraq|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm|work=BBC News|date=3 March 2006|accessdate=18 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928202606/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm|archive-date=28 September 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Press Secretary [[Alastair Campbell]]'s diary, Blair often read the Bible before taking any important decisions. He states that Blair had a "wobble" and considered changing his mind on the eve of the [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|bombing of Iraq in 1998]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/14/tony-blair-alastair-campbell-diaries Alastair Campbell diaries: How Blair's Bible reading prompted Iraq 'wobble'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405161403/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jan/14/tony-blair-alastair-campbell-diaries |date=5 April 2016 }}, ''The Guardian'', 14 January 2011.</ref>

A longer exploration of his faith can be found in an interview with ''[[Third Way Magazine]]''. There he says that "I was brought up as [a Christian], but I was not in any real sense a practising one until I went to Oxford. There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly I began to see its social relevance. I began to make sense of the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927142102/http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43|archive-date=27 September 2007|title=Practising for Power: Tony Blair|first=Roy|last=McCloughry|work=[[Third Way Magazine]]: the modern world through Christian eyes|date=14 September 1993|accessdate=22 November 2007|quote=Since 1993, Third Way has been talking in depth to men and women who help to shape our society or set the tone of our culture.

At one point Alastair Campbell intervened in an interview, preventing the Prime Minister from answering a question about his Christianity, explaining, "We don't do God."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html|title=Campbell interrupted Blair as he spoke of his faith: 'We don't do God'|first=Colin|last=Brown|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|date=3 May 2003|accessdate=28 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327145146/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html|archive-date=27 March 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Campbell later said that he had intervened only to end the interview because the journalist had been taking an excessive time, and that the comment had just been a throwaway line.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/catherine-deveney-interview-alastair-campbell-1-1301006|title=The Catherine Deveney Interview: Alastair Campbell: Most people don't know me|work=Scotland on Sunday|date=9 November 2008|access-date=28 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510020238/http://www.scotsman.com/news/catherine-deveney-interview-alastair-campbell-1-1301006|archive-date=10 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Cherie Blair's friend and "spiritual guru" [[Carole Caplin]] is credited with introducing her and her husband to various [[New Age]] symbols and beliefs, including "magic pendants" known as "BioElectric Shields".<ref>[http://observer.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,6903,856064,00.html "Ev'rybody must get stones"], The Observer, 8 December 2002</ref> The most controversial of the Blairs' New Age practices occurred when on holiday in Mexico.
