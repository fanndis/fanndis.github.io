He is also the Deputy Leader of [[Law and Justice]], the largest party in the [[Parliament of Poland]].

==Early life==
Macierewicz was born in [[Warsaw]] on 3 August 1948. He is the youngest of three children of Zdzisław and Maria Macierewicz, both scientists. His father, a noted researcher in [[chemistry]], a soldier in the [[Home Army]] during [[World War II]], and a member of the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] [[Labour Faction (1937)|Labor Party]], committed suicide in 1949.

==Anti-communist activities==
Macierewicz was expelled from [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]] High School for political reasons in 1965, specifically for refusing to denounce the [[Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops]]. Macierewicz continued his studies at [[Maria Konopnicka]] High School. From 1966, he belonged to the [[Czarna Jedynka]] [[scout troop]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael Szporer|author2=Mark Kramer|title=Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7487-6|page=198}}</ref> After completing his baccalaureate exams, he became a student at the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1966. He co-organized underground student organizations and participated in the student strikes that marked the [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. He was arrested and remained a [[political prisoner]] from 28 March to 3 August 1968. Following the [[Polish 1970 protests]], Macierewicz launched the campaign to help victims of state oppression. In 1971 he earned a [[master's degree]] from the Institute of History of the University of Warsaw. His thesis was titled ''Hierarchy of Power and the Structure of Land Ownership in Tawantinsuyu in the First Half of the Sixteenth Century’’.

As a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral student]] at the Institute of History of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], he developed expertise on South America, but his doctoral thesis was not considered for political reasons. Subsequently, he coordinated with other independent intellectuals, writing letters of protest to the government regarding changes in the constitution of the [[Polish People's Republic]]. He taught the [[history of Latin America]] at the Department of Iberian Studies of the University of Warsaw.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antoon de Baets|title=Censorship of Historical Thought: A World Guide, 1945–2000|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31193-2|pages=390–391}}</ref> During this time he published articles and learned [[Quechuan languages]]. In January 1976, he started a [[PhD]] under the supervision of Tadeusz Łepkowski, which was interrupted by the authorities in mid-October 1976 because of Macierewicz’s dissident activities. Moreover, publication of his book and a trip to [[Argentina]] in order to conduct archival research were both blocked.

[[File:02014 Stanisław Lewek, Zdzisław Skrzypek, Antoni Macierewicz in Sanok.JPG|thumb|left|Stanisław Lewek (second from left), the physician who enabled Macierewicz’s 1982 escape from incarceration]]
After the pacification of workers in June 1976, he organized relief in [[Radom]] and [[Ursus, Warsaw|Ursus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael H. Bernhard|title=The Origins of Democratization in Poland: Workers, Intellectuals, and Oppositional Politics, 1976-1980|year=1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08093-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofdemocra0000bern/page/79 79]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofdemocra0000bern/page/79}}</ref> Along with some of his colleagues from "Black One", he created underground structures, which dealt with the monetary, legal, and medical aid for the oppressed. Macierewicz founded the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR), the forerunner of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. “Macierewicz, more than anyone else, was responsible for the formation of KOR”, notes David Ost, a Professor of Political Science at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].<ref name="Ost2010"/>

In September 1976 he co-authored the organization's first appeal and began publishing the ''[[Komunikat KSS "KOR"|Komunikat „KOR”]]'', working closely with [[Piotr Naimski]] and [[Jan Olszewski]]. From 16 May to 23 July 1977, and again in December 1979, Macierewicz was held as a political prisoner. In 1977 he started ''[[Głos (1991)|Głos]]'', one of the first magazines of the democratic opposition in the communist era.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael Szporer|author2=Mark Kramer|title=Solidarity: The Great Workers Strike of 1980|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7487-6|page=76}}</ref> In October 1979 he was a member of the Solidarity hunger strike at the [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]] in Warsaw. In connection with his opposition activities, he was kept under surveillance by the security services of communist Poland and, from 1976 until 1980, he was detained at least 23 times and his residence regularly searched.

From September 1980, Macierewicz directed the Centre for Social Research of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Piotr Wróbel|title=Historical Dictionary of Poland 1945–1996|date=27 January 2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-92701-1|pages=1977–1998}}</ref> He also began to publish the independent newspaper ''News Day Warsaw''. Since October 1980 he was a member of the National Coordination Committee of Advisors, and later the National Commission of Solidarity. On 27 September 1981 Macierewicz was one of the signatories of the founding declaration of Independence Service Clubs. In the autumn of 1981, he joined the faculty at the [[Jagiellonian University]]. After the introduction of [[martial law in Poland]], Macierewicz was part of the strike committee at the [[Gdańsk Shipyard]]. After the pacification of the protest of 16 December 1981, he was arrested but escaped from prison. Macierewicz was in hiding until 1984, directing work and issuing underground publications.

As a minister responsible for the police and security services, he was afforded full access to the former communist documentary archives, including records of communist intelligence and secret service agents. On 28 May 1992 the [[Parliament of Poland]] passed a law that the Minister of Internal Affairs had to provide the Sejm with a list of then senators, representatives, ministers, [[voivode]]s, judges and prosecutors who had been secret communist agents between 1945 and 1990.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ilan Berman|author2=J. Michael Waller|title=Dismantling Tyranny: Transitioning Beyond Totalitarian Regimes|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4903-6|page=146}}</ref> On 4 June 1992, Macierewicz provided a list, commonly known as the [[Macierewicz List]], of 64 members of the government and parliament that had been identified as secret agents in the archives of the communist secret police to the Convent of Senior Parliamentarians.

As the crisis had been unfolding, prior to the lists' presentation, on 29 May 1992, the opposition parties submitted a [[motion of no confidence]], asking for a vote on the fate of Olszewski's government. On the night of 4 June 1992, after the presentation of the lists, the motion of no confidence passed and Olszewski's government was dismissed.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Sanford|title=Poland: The Conquest of History|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-65096-3|pages=38–39}}</ref> This situation was depicted in a documentary film, ''[[Nocna zmiana]]''.

In its analysis, [[private intelligence agency|global intelligence]] company [[Stratfor]] noted:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/geopolitical-diary/geopolitical-diary-trying-redefine-poland |title=Trying to Redefine Poland |author=Geopolitical Diary |publisher=[[Stratfor]] |date=20 February 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2015 }}</ref>
{{quote|The move both removes Soviet influence and consolidates the twins' power in the government. The release of the WSI report is one of the largest and most decisive moves along these lines. By naming people in the WSI who are connected to Soviet intelligence, Kaczynski ensures their names will forever be known for — alleged or real — Soviet ties. The move undermines the entire structure of the WSI and all of its former personnel, ensuring that it and those attached to it can never recover.}}

The report contained list of members of the WSI (military intelligence service), which included dozens of current and former Polish military counterintelligence contacts, some active in highly sensitive places like [[Afghanistan]]. Polish ambassadors to [[Austria]], [[China]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Turkey]] were recalled to Warsaw. At least ten of the names, including the military attaché in Moscow, were fiercely contested.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/8744550 "Of questionable intelligence"], ''[[The Economist]]'', 22 February 2007.</ref>

===Head of the Military Counterintelligence Service===
In October 2006, Macierewicz became Head of the [[Military Counterintelligence Service (Poland)|Military Counterintelligence Service]], in office until the end of the Kaczyński government.

===Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash investigation===
[[File:Światowe Dni Młodzieży - 28488312452.jpg|thumb|Macierewicz at [[World Youth Day 2016]] in [[Kraków]]]]

Since 20 July 2010 Macierewicz is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for the Investigation of the Causes of the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]], commonly known as the [[Macierewicz Commission]]. The crash, which killed [[President of Poland]] [[Lech Kaczyński]] and his wife [[Maria Kaczyńska|Maria]], and 94 other dignitaries en route to the 70th anniversary commemorations of the [[Katyń massacre]], has already been analyzed and documented by [[Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents]].  Since the first days after the crash, Macierewicz claimed the crash was an assassination.  Established on 8 July 2010, the goal of [[Macierewicz Commission]] was to disprove the official report.  As the state investigation moved to exhumation of President Kaczyński's and others' bodies in late 2016, the ''New York Times'' summarized that "Macierewicz claimed over the years to have 'irrefutable evidence' of explosives [having caused the crash, but] his experts have yet to produce it."<ref>Berendt, Joanna, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/world/europe/poland-exhumes-lech-kaczynski.html "Poland Exhumes Ex-President’s Body in Inquiry of 2010 Plane Crash"], ''The New York Times'', 14 November 2016. Retrieved 15 November 2016.</ref>

==Controversies==

Following Macierewicz's designation as Minister of National Defence, he faced allegations of [[anti-Semitism]] and protests by the [[Anti Defamation League]].<ref>Gera, Vanessa, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20151113/eu--poland-anti-semitism/ "Jewish group protests appointment of Polish defense minister"], AP via ''huffingtonpost.com'', 13 November 2015.

"The Minister was defamed" |work=[[Wprost]] |date=12 November 2015 |accessdate=12 November 2015}}</ref> Anna Chipczynska, the President of the Jewish Community of Warsaw, said, "the latest statement by Mr. Macierewicz denouncing all forms of anti-Semitism could be a positive signal that the new Polish government will stand strongly against manifestations of hatred toward Jews."<ref>{{cite news |last=Gera |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/world/article/Jewish-group-protests-appointment-of-Polish-6629870.php |title=Jewish group protests appointment of Polish defense minister |work=[[ABC News]] |date=13 November 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref>

In July 2016, Antoni Macierewicz said that the "real enemy", Russia, shares responsibility for the [[massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres of Poles and Jews]] in German-occupied Volhynia and Eastern Galicia by the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA).<ref name="antisemitism"/> Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman [[Maria Zakharova]] said that "the Polish government is moving from Russophobia to inciting national hatred," and asked Macierewicz if "there are any historical events and natural disasters for which Russia is not the one to blame."<ref>"[http://europe.newsweek.com/poland-and-russia-clash-over-world-war-ii-massacre-claims-479973?rm=eu Poland and Russia Clash Over World War II Massacre Claims]". ''Newsweek.'' 13 July 2016.</ref> Macierewicz's claim was also criticized by the [[Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia]].<ref name="antisemitism"/>

In the comical webseries [[The Chairman's Ear]] (2017), implicit references are made to an alleged homosexual relationship between "Minister of War" Antoni and a younger man. This pun refers to Macierewicz's close ties with the much younger politician Bartłomiej Misiewicz (born in 1990).
