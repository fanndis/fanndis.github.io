'''Baoding''' ({{zh|c=保定 |p=Bǎodìng}}), formerly known as '''[[Bao Prefecture|Baozhou]]''' and '''Qingyuan''', is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Hebei]] province, approximately  {{convert|150|km}} southwest of [[Beijing]]. At the 2010 census, Baoding City had 11,194,372 inhabitants out of which 2,176,857 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 3 urban districts and Qingyuan and Mancheng counties largely being conurbated, on {{convert|1,840|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "Geo Background"/> Baoding is among 13 Chinese cities with a population of over 10 million, ranking seventh.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:最新中国城市人口数量排名（根据2010年第六次人口普查）|url=http://www.elivecity.cn/html/yijuyanjiu/yijuyanjiu1/645.html|publisher=www.elivecity.cn|year=2012|accessdate=2014-05-28}}</ref>

==History==
Baoding is a city with a history dating back to the [[Western Han Dynasty]]. It was destroyed by the [[Mongol]]s in the 13th century, but after the Mongols established the [[Yuan Dynasty]], it was rebuilt. It acquired the name "Baoding" during the [[Yuan dynasty]] — the name is roughly interpreted as "protecting the capital", referring to the city's proximity to [[Beijing]]. Baoding served for many years as the capital of [[Zhili Province|Zhili]], and was a significant centre of culture in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and early [[Qing Dynasty]]. During the [[Boxer rebellion]], Boxer rebels killed a Turk, two Swiss, and an Italian in Baoding.

On August 1, 1949, the people's Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. In August 9, the administrative inspector's office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as the administrative inspector's office of the county district.

In May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin.

In January 1966, the provincial capital was moved from Tianjin to Baoding.

In February 1968, the provincial capital moved to Shijiazhuang.

In December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city.

In April 2017, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council announced the decision to transform Baoding's [[Xiong County|Xiong]], [[Rongcheng County|Rongcheng]], and [[Anxin County|Anxin]] counties into [[Xiong'an New Area]], a new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and quality of life, following the success of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai's Pudong New Area.

==Geography==
Baoding is located in the west-central portion of Hebei province and lies on the [[North China Plain]], with the [[Taihang Mountains]] to the west. Bordering prefecture-level cities in the province are [[Zhangjiakou]] to the north, [[Langfang]] and [[Cangzhou]] to the east, and Shijiazhuang and [[Hengshui]] to the south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and [[Shanxi]] to the west.

Elevations in Baoding's administrative area decrease from northwest to southeast. The western parts are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than {{convert|1000|m}} tall; this area includes parts of Laishui, Yi, Mancheng, Shunping, Tang and Fuping Counties as well as the entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = "Geo Background"/> The highest peak is [[Mount Waitou]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=歪头山}}), with an elevation of {{convert|2286|m}}.<ref name = "Geo Background"/> Moving southeast from this area, one encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture's area.<ref name = "Geo Background"/> Further to the east lies generally flat terrain of {{convert|30|to|100|m|ft|sigfig=2}} elevation. Here the primary rivers are the [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], [[Yishui River|Yishui]] ({{lang|zh|易水}}), [[Cao River|Cao]] ({{lang|zh|漕河}}), [[Longquan River|Longquan]] ({{lang|zh|龙泉河}}), [[Tang River|Tang]] ({{lang|zh|唐河}}), and [[Sha River]]s. [[Baiyangdian Lake]], the largest natural lake in northern China, can be found nearby.

===Climate===
Baoding has a continental, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa''),<ref>Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. (2007). [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png "Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification"]. Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. 11: 1633-1644. ISSN 1027-5606.</ref> characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, about 60% of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre {{convert|513|mm|1}} per annum. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|−3.2|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|26.8|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|12.9|°C|1}}. There are 2,500 to 2,900 hours of bright sunshine annually, and the frost-free period lasts 165−210 days.

The [[Jingshi Expressway]] connects the two cities, and Baoding is also the western terminus of the [[Baojin Expressway]] linking Baoding with [[Tianjin]], which is one out of two nearest ports ([[Huanghua]] is the other one). The [[Jingguang Railway]] provides frequent services to [[Beijing West railway station]]. On 30 December 2012, a new [[Baoding railway station|Baoding station]] was opened, while the old train station was closed for passengers.<ref>{{cite web

==Culture==
[[File:ZhiLiGovernorMansion.jpg|thumb|A courtyard in the mansion of the governor of Zhili]]
[[File:Baoding1.jpg|thumb|Another street of Baoding]]
Perhaps the best-known item to supposedly originate in Baoding are [[Baoding Balls]], which can be used to relax one's keyboard hand and strengthen one's wrist. The most famous local specialty food is the [[Donkey Burger]] ({{zh|s=驴肉火烧}}).

[[Anxin County]] is home to the Quantou Village Music Association ({{zh|labels=no|s=圈头村音乐会}}), a well known traditional music group performing on ''[[Guan (instrument)|guan]]'' (oboes), ''[[sheng (instrument)|sheng]]'' (mouth organs), and percussion. The village of Quantou is located on an island in [[Lake Baiyangdian]].

The city's streets follow a rough grid pattern, although this is less obvious in the older part of the city. The traditional main street of old Baoding is Yuhua Road, running from the city's centre to its eastern edge — most of Baoding's historic buildings are located in this area, along with some of its larger shopping centres. Other major streets include Dongfeng Road and Chaoyang Avenue. There is a [[ring road]] around the city.

Baoding is home to [[Hebei University]], [[North China Electric Power University]] with other 3 universities and 12 colleges.
