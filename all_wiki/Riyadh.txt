'''Riyadh''' ([[Arabic]]: الرياض, [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]]: ''ar-Riyāḍ'', [[Literal translation|lit.]]: 'The Gardens' {{IPA-ar|ar.riˈjaːdˤ|}} <small>[[Najdi Arabic|Najdi]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA-ar|er.rɪˈjɑːðˤ|}}) is the capital of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the largest city on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Located in the center of the [[An Nafud|an-Nafud]] desert, on the eastern part of the [[Najd]] [[plateau]], the city sits at an average of {{convert|600|m}} above sea level,<ref>{{cite web|date=8 December 2018|title=Geographic Location of Riyadh|url=https://riyadh.sa/en/city/l/AboutRiyadh/item/li/city/13521|access-date=24 May 2019|publisher=Riyadh Development Authority}}</ref> and receives around 5 million [[Tourism in Saudi Arabia|tourists]] each year, making it the [[List of cities by international visitors|forty-ninth]] most visited city in the world and the 6th in the [[Middle East]]. Riyadh had a population of 7.6 million people in 2019, making it the most populous city in Saudi Arabia, [[List of largest cities|3rd most populous]] in the [[Middle East]], and [[List of metropolitan areas in Asia|38th most populous]] in [[Asia]].<ref name="maaal"/> 

The first mentioning of the city by the name ''Riyadh'' was in 1590, by an early Arab chronicler.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} In 1737, Deham Ibn Dawwas, who was from the neighboring [[Manfuha]], settled in and took control of the city. Deham built a wall around the city, and the best known source of the name ''Riyadh'' is from this period, thought to be referring to the earlier oasis towns that predated the wall built by Ibn Dawwas.{{sfn|Al-Oteibi|1993|p=163}} In 1744, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab|Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab]] formed an alliance with the Emir of Dir'iyah, [[Muhammad bin Saud]], and in 1774, they took Riyadh from Deham. However their state, now known as the ''[[Emirate of Diriyah|First Saudi State]]'', came to a collapse in 1818. Turki ibn Abdullah founded the ''[[Emirate of Nejd|Second Saudi State]]'' in the early 19th century and made Riyadh his capital in 1825. However, his reign over the city was disrupted by a joint [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman–]][[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Rashidi]] alliance. Finally, in the early 20th century, '[[Ibn Saud|Abdulaziz ibn Saud]], known in the west simply as Ibn Saud, retrieved his ancestral [[Emirate of Nejd|kingdom of Najd]] in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926 with the final [[Saudi conquest of Hejaz]].{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} After this he named his kingdom [[Saudi Arabia]] in September 1932{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} with Riyadh as the capital.{{sfn|Facey|1992|p=271}}

Riyadh is the political and administrative centre of Saudi Arabia. The [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia|Consultative Assembly]] (also known as the ''Shura'' or ''Shura Council''), the [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia]], the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and the [[Supreme Judicial Council of Saudi Arabia]] are all situated in the city. Alongside these four bodies that form the core of the [[legal system of Saudi Arabia]], the headquarters of other major and minor governmental bodies are also located in Riyadh.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moon|first=Carol|title=LibGuides: A Guide to Saudi Arabia Politics: 1.Government of Saudi Arabia|url=https://slulibrary.saintleo.edu/c.php?g=368413&p=2487969|access-date=2020-07-25|website=slulibrary.saintleo.edu|language=en}}</ref> The city hosts 112 [[Diplomatic mission|foreign embassies]], most of which are located in the ''as-Safarat'' district or Diplomatic Quarter ([[Arabic]]: حي السفارات, [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]]: ''Hayy as-Safarat'', [[Literal translation|lit.]]: 'District of Embassies') in the western reaches of the city.

Riyadh also holds great economic significance, as it hosts the headquarters of many banks and major companies, such as the [[National Commercial Bank (Saudi Arabia)|National Commercial Bank]] (NCB), [[Alinma Bank]] and the [[SABB (Saudi bank)|Saudi Arabian British Bank]] (SABB). [[Highway 65 (Saudi Arabia)|Highway 65]], known locally as the King Fahd Road, runs through some of these important centers in the city, including the [[King Abdullah Financial District]], one of the world's largest financial districts, the [[Al Faisaliyah Center|Faisaliyah Center]] and the [[Kingdom Centre|Kingdom Center]]. Riyadh is one of the world's fastest-growing cities in population and is home to many [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. Riyadh has been designated a [[global city]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The World According to GaWC 2016|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html}}</ref>

The city is divided into 15 municipal districts, which are overseen by the Municipality of Riyadh ([[Arabic]]: أمانة الرياض, [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]]: ''Amanat ar-Riyad'', [[Literal translation|lit.]] 'Protectorate of Riyadh') headed by the mayor; and the [[Royal Commission for Riyadh]] which is chaired by the Governor of the Province, [[Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud]]. As of July 2020, The mayor is Faisal bin Abdulaziz bin Mohammed bin Ayyaf Al-Muqrin.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-11-26|title=Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz appointed as Riyadh mayor by royal decree|url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1590146/saudi-arabia|access-date=2020-07-25|website=Arab News|language=en}}</ref> Most of the population of the Riyadh Province is concentrated around Riyadh, as the rest of the province is mostly desert, with few, small cities connected by small two- to four-lane highways, such as [[Wadi ad-Dawasir]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Riyadh}}

===Early history===
During the [[Jahiliyya|Pre-Islamic era]] the city at the site of modern Riyadh was called ''Hajr'' ({{lang-ar|حجر}}), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of [[Banu Hanifa]].{{sfn|Sonbol|2012|p=99}} Hajr served as the capital of the province of [[Al-Yamamah]], whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern [[Arabia]] during the [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid]] eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the [[Abbasid Empire]] in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the [[Ukhaydhirites]], who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby [[Al-Kharj]]. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveler [[Ibn Battuta]] wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as "the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to the [[Bani Hanifa]], and reports that he continued on with their leader to [[Mecca]] to perform the [[Hajj]].

Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were ''Migrin'' (or ''Muqrin'') and ''Mi'kal'', though the name ''Hajr'' continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name ''Riyadh'' comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring [[Manfuha]], took control of Riyadh.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the various oasis town in the area, making them effectively a single city. The name "Riyadh," meaning "gardens" refers to these earlier oasis towns.{{sfn|Al-Oteibi|1993|p=163}}

===First Saudi State===
[[File:1922 map Riyadh by Philby.png|thumb|1922 map of Riyadh]]
In 1744, [[Muhammad ibn Abdel Wahhab|Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab]] formed an alliance with [[Muhammad ibn Saud]], the ruler of the nearby town of [[Diriyah]]. Ibn Saud then set out to conquer the surrounding region with the goal of bringing it under the rule of a single Islamic state. Ibn Dawwas of Riyadh led the most determined resistance, allied with forces from [[al-Kharj|Al Kharj]], [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al Ahsa]], and the [[Banu Yam]] clan of [[Najran]]. However, Ibn Dawwas fled and Riyadh capitulated to the Saudis in 1774, ending long years of wars, and leading to the declaration of the [[First Saudi State]], with Diriyah as its capital.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}}

The First Saudi State was destroyed by forces sent by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], acting on behalf of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Ottoman forces razed the Saudi capital [[Diriyah]] in 1818.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|p=258}} They had maintained a garrison at [[Najd]]. This marked the decline of the House of Saud for a short time.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}} [[Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad]] became the first Amir of the [[Second Saudi State]]; the cousin of Saud bin Saud, he ruled for 19 years till 1834, leading to the consolidation of the area though they were notionally under the control of the Muhammad Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}} In 1823, Turki ibn Abdallah chose Riyadh as the new capital.<ref name=Report>{{cite book|title=The Report: Saudi Arabia 2008|year = 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&pg=PA208|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=978-1-902339-00-9|page=208}}</ref> Following the assassination of Turki in 1834, his eldest son Faisal killed the assassin and took control, and refused to be controlled by the [[Viceroy of Egypt]]. Najd was then invaded and Faisal taken captive and held in [[Cairo]]. However, as [[Egypt]] became independent of the Ottoman Empire, Faisal escaped after five years of incarceration, returned to Najd and resumed his reign, ruled till 1865, and consolidated the reign of House of Saud.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}}

Following the death of Faisal, there was rivalry among his sons which situation was exploited by [[Rashidi dynasty|Muhammad bin Rashid]] who took most of Najd, signed a treaty with the Ottomans and also captured [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Hasa]] in 1871. In 1889, [[Abdul Rahman bin Faisal]], the third son of Faisal again regained control over Najd and ruled till 1891, whereafter the control was regained by Muhammad bin Raschid.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=14}}

Internecine struggles between Turki's grandsons led to the fall of the Second Saudi State in 1891 at the hand of the rival [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] clan, which ruled from the northern city of [[Ha'il]]. The [[al-Masmak]] fort dates from that period.<ref name=Report/>

Abdul Rahman bin Faisal al-Saud had sought refuge among a tribal community on the outskirts of Najd and then went to [[Kuwait]] with his family and stayed in exile. However, his son [[Ibn Saud|Abdul Aziz]] retrieved his ancestral kingdom of Najd in 1902 and consolidated his rule by 1926, and further expanded his kingdom to cover "most of the Arabian Peninsula."{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} He named his kingdom as [[Saudi Arabia]] in September 1932{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}} with Riyadh as the capital.{{sfn|Facey|1992|p=271}} King Abdul Aziz died in 1953 and his son Saud took control as per the established succession rule of father to son from the time Muhammad bin Saud had established the Saud rule in 1744. However, this established line of succession was broken when King Saud was succeeded by his brother King Faisal in 1964. In 1975, Faisal was succeeded by his brother King Khalid. In 1982, King Fahd took the reins from his brother. This new line of succession is among the sons of King Abdul Aziz who has 35 sons; this large family of Ibn Saud hold all key positions in the large kingdom.{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=15}}

===Modern history===
From the 1940s, Riyadh mushroomed from a relatively narrow, spatially isolated town into a spacious metropolis.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} When [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] came to power, he made it his objective to modernize Riyadh, and began developing Annasriyyah, the royal residential district, in 1950.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} Following the example of American cities, new settlements and entire neighbourhoods were created on [[grid plan]]s, and connected by high-capacity main roads to the inner areas. The grid pattern in the city was introduced in 1953.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=124}} The population growth of the town from 1974 to 1992 averaged 8.2 percent per year.

The mayor is Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz. Bin Abdulaziz was appointed in 2019 by royal decree <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arabnews.com/node/1590146/saudi-arabia |title=Prince Faisal bin Abdulaziz appointed as Riyadh mayor by royal decree |website=Arab News | date=November 27, 2019}}</ref> and succeeds Tariq bin Abdul Aziz Al-Faris. Riyadh is now the administrative, and to a great extent the commercial hub of the Kingdom. According to the Saudi Real Estate Companion, most large companies in the country establish either sole headquarters or a large office in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Saudi-Real-Estate-Companion-Essential-ebook/dp/B01DTNO0SC|title=Saudi Real Estate Companion: Essential Real Estate Skills for the Saudi Arabian Market|last1=Mueller|first1=H.

According to the [[Global Financial Centres Index]], Riyadh ranked at 77 in 2016–2017. Though the rank moved up to 69 in 2018, diversification in the economy of the capital is required in order to avoid what the [[World Bank]] called a "looming poverty crisis" brought on by lingering low oil prices and rich state benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/21/saudi-arabia-is-backsliding-in-effort-to-build-global-financial-center.html|title=Saudi Arabia is stumbling in its efforts to build a global financial center|publisher=CNBC|access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref>

=== Climate ===

Riyadh has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen Climate Classification]] ''BWh''), with long, extremely hot summers and short, very mild winters. The average high temperature in August is {{convert|43.6|C|F}}. The city experiences very little precipitation, especially in summer, but receives a fair amount of rain in March and April. It is also known to have [[dust storm]]s during which the dust can be so thick that visibility is under {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. On 1 and 2 April 2015, a massive dust storm hit Riyadh, causing suspension of classes in many schools in the area and cancellation of hundreds of flights, both domestic and international.

===City districts===
[[File:Riyadh Saudi Arabia 10Mar2018 SkySat.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Riyadh]]
[[File:KING FAHD ROAD FEB1.JPG|thumb|King Fahd Road]]
Riyadh is divided into fourteen branch municipalities,<ref name="a">{{cite web|url=https://www.alriyadh.gov.sa/en/riyadh/riyadhmunic/Pages/home.aspx|title=Interactive Map of Riyadh's branch municipalities|publisher=Riyadh Municipal Government|language=ar}}</ref> in addition to the Diplomatic Quarter. Each branch municipality in turn contains several districts, amounting to over 130 in total, though some districts are divided between more than one branch municipality. The branch municipalities are Al-Shemaysi, [[Irqah]], Al-Ma'athar, Al-Olayya, Al-Aziziyya, Al-Malaz, Al-Selayy, Nemar, Al-Neseem, Al-Shifa, Al-'Urayja, Al-Bat'ha, Al-Ha'ir, Al-Rawdha, and Al-Shimal ("the North"). [[Olaya (Riyadh)|Olaya District]] is the commercial heart of the city,<ref>{{cite book|title=MEED|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-NHAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Economic East Economic Digest, Limited|page=4}}</ref> with accommodation, entertainment, dining and shopping options. The [[Kingdom Centre]], [[Al Faisaliyah Center|Al Faisalyah]] and Al-Tahlya Street are the area's most prominent landmarks.

The city had a population of 40,000 inhabitants in 1935 and 83,000 in 1949.{{sfn|Elsheshtawy|2008|p=122}} The city has experienced very high rates of population growth, from 150,000 inhabitants in the 1960s to over seven million, according to the most recent sources. As of 2017, the population of Riyadh is composed of 64.19% Saudis, while non-Saudis account for 35.81% of the population. [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] are the largest minority population at 13.7%, followed by [[Pakistanis]] at 12.4%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riyadh City |url=http://www.arriyadh.com/ar/AboutArriy/Content/getdocument.aspx?f=/openshare/ar/AboutArriy/Content/riyadhStat_1437.doc_cvt.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/LjqbD|url-status=dead|publisher=Saudi Arabia- Ministry of Interior |archive-date=27 March 2017 |access-date=25 May 2019}}</ref>

==Landmarks and architecture==

===Vernacular architecture of Old Riyadh===
The old town of Riyadh within the city walls did not exceed an area of 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and therefore very few significant architectural remnants of the original walled oasis town of Riyadh exist today. The most prominent is the [[Masmak fort]] and some parts of the original wall structure with its gate which have been restored and reconstructed. There are also a number of traditional mud-brick houses within these old limits, but they are for the most part dilapidated.

Expansion outside the city walls was slow to begin with, although there were some smaller oases and settlements surrounding Riyadh. The first major construction beyond the walls was King Abdulaziz's [[Murabba Palace]]. It was constructed in 1936, completed in 1938, and a household of 800 people moved into it in 1938. The palace is now part of a bigger complex called [[King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre|The King Abdulaziz Historical Centre]].

There are other traditional villages and towns in the area around traditional Riyadh which the urban sprawl reached and encompasses. These include [[Diriyah]], Manfuha and Wadi Laban. Unlike in the early days of development in Riyadh during which vernacular structures were razed to the ground without consideration, there is a new-found appreciation for traditional architecture. The [[Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage]] is making efforts to revitalize the historic architecture in Riyadh and other parts of the kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scta.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx|title=SCTH - default|work=scta.gov.sa}}</ref>

;Ain Heet Cave

Ain Heet cave has an underground lake (150 meters deep) situated at the face of Mount Al Jubayl in Wadi As Sulay in a small village called Heet in Riyadh. Between Riyadh and Al Kharj road, it is one of the easily accessible caves in the area of Riyadh.

===Archaeological sites===
The archeological sites at Riyadh which are of historical importance, in which the Municipality of Riyadh is involved, are the five old gates on the old walls of Riyadh. These are the eastern gate of Thumaira, the northern gate of Al-Suwailen, the southern gate of Dukhna, the western gate of Al-Madhbah and the south-western gate of Shumaisi. There are also four historic palaces: [[Masmak Castle|Musmak Palace]], [[Murabba Palace]] (palace of King Abdul Aziz), Atiqah Palace (belongs to Prince [[Muhammad bin Abdul-Rahman|Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman]]) and Al Shamsiah Palace (belongs to [[Saud Al Kabeer bin Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Faisal Al Saud|Saud Al Kabeer]]).{{sfn|Farsy|1990|p=22}}

==== Turaif district ====
{{Main|Al-Turaif District}}

The [[Turaif district]], is another important archaeological site inscribed in [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] on 31 July 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1329/|title=At-Turaif District in ad-Dir'iyah|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sauditourism.sa/en/ExploreKSA/AttractionSites/Diriyah/Pages/TuraifDistrict.aspx|title=Turaif District|website=www.sauditourism.sa|language=en-us|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> It was founded in the 15th century bearing an architectural style of Najdi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/1418806/saudi-arabia|title=Al-Turaif: How Saudi Arabia is bolstering future tourism by reviving past treasures|date=11 December 2018|website=Arab News|language=en|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> There are some Historic palaces and monuments in Al-Turaif district include: Salwa Palace, Saad bin Saud Palace, The Guest House and At-Turaif Bath House, and Imam Mohammad bin Saud Mosque.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldheritagesite.org/list/Turaif+Quarter|title=Turaif Quarter - World Heritage Site - Pictures, Info and Travel Reports|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>[[File:Masmak castle.jpg|right|thumb|Masmak Fortress]]

====Masmak Fortress====
{{Main|Masmak fort}}
This fortress was built around 1865 under the reign of [[Mohammed ibn Abdullah ibn Rasheed]] (1289-1315 AH), the ruler of [[Ha'il]] to the north, who had wrested control of the city from the rival clan of [[Al Saud]]. In January 1902 [[Ibn Saud]], who was at the time living in exile in [[Kuwait]], succeeded in capturing the Masmak fortress from its Rashid garrison. The event, which restored Saudi control over Riyadh, has acquired almost mythical status in the history of Saudi Arabia. The story of the event is often retold, and has as its central theme the heroism and bravery of the King Abd Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. 
The Masmak Fortress is now a museum and is in close proximity to the Clock Tower Square, also known to English-speaking residents as [[Chop Chop Square]], referring to the capital punishment that takes place there.

===Contemporary architecture===

====Kingdom Centre====
{{Main|Kingdom Centre}}
Designed by the team of [[Ellerbe Becket]] and [[Omrania and Associates|Omrania]], the tower is built on 94,230&nbsp;square metres of land. The Kingdom Centre is owned by a group of companies including [[Kingdom Holding Company]], headed by [[Al-Waleed bin Talal]], a prince of the Saudi royal family, and is the headquarters of the holding company. The project cost 2&nbsp;billion Saudi Arabian Riyals and the contract was undertaken by El-Seif. The Kingdom Centre is the winner of the 2002 [[Emporis Skyscraper Award]], selected as the "best new skyscraper of the year for design and functionality". A three-level shopping centre, which also won a major design award, fills the east wing. The large opening is illuminated at night in continuously changing colours. The shopping centre has a separate floor for women only to shop where men are not allowed to enter.

The Kingdom Tower has 99 stories and is the third tallest structure in the country (behind [[Abraj Al Bait|Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel]] in Mecca and [[Burj Rafal]] in Riyadh), rising to 300 m. A special aspect of the tower is that it is divided into two parts in the last one third of its height and is linked by a sky-bridge walkway, which provides stunning views of Riyadh.{{sfn|Jordan|2011|p=98}}

====Burj Rafal Hotel Kempinski====
{{Main|Burj Rafal}}

Burj Rafal, located on King Fahd Road, is the tallest skyscraper in Riyadh at 307.9 meters (1,010 feet) tall. The tower was designed and engineered by P & T Group. Construction began in 2010 and was completed 2014. The project was considered a success, with 70% of the residential units already sold by the time the skyscraper was topped out. The tower contains 474 residential condominium units and a 349-room 5-star Kempinski hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/riyadh/burj-rafal/9554/ |title=Burj Rafal |publisher=The Skyscraper Center |access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref>

====Burj Al Faisaliyah====

{{Main|Al Faisaliyah Center}}
Al Faisaliyah Centre (Arabic: برج الفيصلية) is the first skyscraper constructed in Saudi Arabia, and is the third tallest building in Riyadh after the Burj Rafal and the [[Kingdom Centre]]. The golden ball that lies atop the tower is said to be inspired by a ballpoint pen, and contains a restaurant; immediately below this is an outside viewing deck. There is a shopping centre with major world brands at ground level. Al Faisaliyah Centre also has a hotel at both sides of the tower while the main building is occupied by office. The Al Faisaliyah Tower has 44 stories.{{sfn|Jordan|2011|p=98}} It was designed by [[Foster and Partners]].

====Riyadh TV Tower====
{{Main|Riyadh TV Tower}}
The Riyadh TV Tower is a 170&nbsp;meter high television tower located inside the premises of the Saudi Ministry of Information. It is a vertical cantilever structure which was built between 1978 and 1981. The first movie made in 1983 by the TV tower group and named "1,000 Nights and Night" had Mohammed Abdu and Talal Mmdah as the main characters. At that time, there were no women on TV because of religious restrictions. Three years later, Abdul Khaliq Al-Ghanim produced a TV series called "Tash Ma Tash," which earned a good reaction from audiences in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. This series created a media revolution back in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://structurae.net/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0000282|title=Riyadh Television Tower|access-date=19 January 2014|publisher=Structurae.net}}</ref>

===Museums and collections===
In 1999, a new central museum was built in Riyadh, at the eastern side of the [[King Abdul Aziz Historical Centre]]. The [[National Museum of Saudi Arabia]] combined several collections and pieces that had up until then been scattered over several institutions and other places in Riyadh and the Kingdom. For example, the meteorite fragment known as the "Camel's Hump",  recovered in 1966 from the [[Wabar craters|Wabar site]], that was on display at the [[King Saud University]] in Riyadh became the new entry piece of the National Museum of Saudi Arabia.

The [[Royal Saudi Air Force Museum]], or Saqr Al-Jazira, is located on the East Ring Road of Riyadh between exits 10 and 11. It contains a collection of aircraft and aviation-related items used by the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] and [[Saudia]] (Saudi Arabian Airlines).

On 29 February 2020, the world's richest thoroughbred horse race will take place at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack in Riyadh. The Saudi Cup is a new race for thoroughbreds aged four and up, to be run at weight-for-age terms over 1800m (9f). The prize money is US$20m with a prize of US$10m to the winner and prize money down to tenth place. The Saudi Cup is perfectly positioned between the Pegasus World Cup and the Dubai World Cup to attract the best horses from around the world to compete for horse racing's richest prize. Putting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the international horseracing map, the Saudi Cup will also hold an undercard of international races on both dirt and the new turf course.
