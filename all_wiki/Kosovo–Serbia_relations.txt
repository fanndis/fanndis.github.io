[[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status|{{Kosovo-note}}}} unilaterally [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] from [[Serbia]] in 2008, a move which Serbia rejects. Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as an independent state, it continues to claim it as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]]. Initially there were no relations between the two; however, in the following years there has been increased [[Belgrade-Pristina negotiations|dialogue]] and cooperation between the two sides.

The [[European Union]]-facilitated negotiations resulted in the [[Brussels Agreement (2013)|2013 Brussels Agreement]] on the normalization of relations between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia. The agreement pledged both sides not to block the other in the [[Potential enlargement of the European Union|EU accession process]], defined the structure of the police and local elections in all parts of Kosovo, and also established the proposal of the [[Community of Serb Municipalities]].

The [[United States]]-mediated diplomatic talks agreed on the interconnection of air, train and road traffic, while both parties signed the [[2020 Kosovo–Serbia agreement|2020 agreement]] on the normalisation of economic relations. Kosovo and Serbia are expected to become part of the [[single market]], known as the [[Mini Schengen Zone]].

Commenting on the event, President Vučić called the Kosovo state and police terrorists, and that they were out to take over northern Kosovo.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vučić: Teroristi hteli da pokažu moć i podršku Zapada|publisher=B92|url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2018&mm=03&dd=26&nav_category=640&nav_id=1373908}}</ref>

===Trade sanctions (2018–2020)===
On 6 November 2018, Kosovo announced a 10% tax on goods imported from [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. The official justification for the new [[tariff]] was unfair trade practices and destructive behaviour aimed at Kosovo.<ref>{{cite news|date=2018-11-06|title=Kosovo Imposes Customs Tariffs on Serbia, Bosnia|language=en|publisher=balkaninsight.com|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2018/11/06/kosovo-imposes-customs-tariffs-for-serbia-and-bosnia-and-herzegovina-11-06-2018/}}</ref>

On 21 November 2018, Kosovo announced an increase in the tax rate to 100%. It is believed that the new policy was a response to Kosovo's third failed bid for [[Interpol]] membership, a result widely blamed on Serbian campaigning by Kosovar public officials. On the day of the announcement, the Deputy Prime Minister [[Enver Hoxhaj]] publicly tweeted: “Serbia is continuing its aggressive campaign against Kosovo in the int’l stage. (...) To defend our vital interest, Government of Kosovo has decided today to increase the customs tariff to 100%. (...)”<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-slaps-100-percent-tariffs-on-serbia-bosnia-to-defend-vital-interest-/29613285.html/|title=Kosovo Slaps 100 Percent Tariffs On Serbia, Bosnia To 'Defend Vital Interest'|date=2018-11-21|publisher=rferl.org/|language=en}}</ref>

On 1 April 2020, Kosovo abolished the 100% tax.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kosovo Lifts 100 Percent Tariff On Serbia; Belgrade Calls It 'Fake News'|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-lifts-serbia-tariffs-belgrade/30521305.html|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=en|access-date=2020-05-07}}</ref>

===Belgrade-Pristina flights===
On 20 January 2020, Serbia and Kosovo agreed to restore flights between their capitals for the first time in more than two decades.<ref name=flight1>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/world/europe/serbia-kosovo-flights-resume.html|title=Serbia-Kosovo Flights to Resume Under U.S.-Brokered Deal|date=2020-01-20|publisher=The New York Times|language=en}}</ref><ref name=flight2>{{cite news|url=https://www.euronews.com/2020/01/21/kosovo-serbia-flights-to-restart-after-two-decades-thecube|title=Kosovo-Serbia flights to restart after two decades|date=2020-01-25|publisher=Euronews|language=en}}</ref> [[Eurowings]], the no-frills subsidiary of German flag-carrier [[Lufthansa]], will fly between [[Belgrade]] and [[Pristina]].<ref name=flight2></ref> The deal came after months of diplomatic talks by [[Richard Grenell]], the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Germany|United States ambassador to Germany]], who was named special envoy for Serbia-Kosovo relations by President [[Donald Trump]] the year before.<ref name=flight1></ref>

===Energy===
In April 2020 Kosovo's Transmission System Operator, [[KOSTT]], was formally separated from [[Elektromreža Srbije]] through a vote by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, [[ENTSO-E]], which paved the way for Kosovo to become an independent regulatory zone for electricity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kostt gains independence from Serbia|url=https://prishtinainsight.com/kostt-gains-independence-from-serbian-electricity-transmission-system/|website=Prishtinainsight.com|access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref> 

The agreement was criticized in Serbia, who accused Pristina and Tirana of pursuing a “Greater Albania of energy”. Marko Djuric, the Serbian government's liaison for Kosovo released a statement saying that "Serbia is the owner and builder of the power grids in Kosovo and Metohija, for which there is abundant evidence".<ref>{{cite web|title=Kosovo moves to join Albanian grid.

==Minorities==
{{Main|Serbs of Kosovo|Albanians in Serbia}}
Since the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, a large portion of Kosovo Serbs have been displaced from their homes, like other minorities throughout the province. A significant portion of Serbian Orthodox churches, as well as Serbian cemeteries and homes, have been demolished or vandalised.

The Serbian Government promised suspended Serb prison workers from [[Lipljan]] money if they were to leave the Kosovo institutions, which they were working in, so they did. However they were never paid, so staged a continued a blockade of the Co-ordination Centre in [[Gračanica, Kosovo|Gračanica]]. They claim that [[Belgrade]], the Kosovo Ministry specifically, has not paid them money promised for leaving the Kosovo institutions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=02&nav_id=49015 |title=News - Society - Kosovo Serb prison workers continue protest |publisher=B92 |date=2 April 2008 |access-date=28 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607013205/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=04&dd=02&nav_id=49015 |archive-date=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Serbs have also responded by forming their [[Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija|own assembly]].

In September 2013, the Serb government dismantled the Serb minority assemblies in Mitrovica, Leposavić, Zvecan and Zubin Potok as part of an agreement with the government of Kosovo.<ref name="balkaninsight.com"/> At the same time, the President of Kosovo signed a law that granted amnesty to ethnic Serbs in Kosovo for past acts of resistance to Kosovo law enforcement authorities.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Kosovo pays considerable attention to the [[Albanians in Serbia|Albanian minority in Serbia]]. The Albanian minority in Serbia has voiced support for more rights in line with the rights of Serbs in Kosovo. In 2013, Isa Mustafa, then one of the leaders of opposition in Kosovo, referring to the Brussels Agreement said that "Once the programme for implementing the agreement is finished, Kosovo and Serbia have to open a discussion about the issue of the rights that Albanians who live in Presevo and in Serbia enjoy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/presevo-asks-pristina-for-support|title=Serbia's Presevo Albanians Ask Pristina for Support|publisher=BalkanInsight|date=17 May 2013|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref>
