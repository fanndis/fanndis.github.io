'''Lollapalooza''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|l|ɒ|l|ə|p|ə|ˈ|l|uː|z|ə}} (Lolla) is an annual four-day [[music festival]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois, at [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], founded in 1991 and since expanded to other countries. Performances include but are not limited to [[alternative rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic music]]. Lollapalooza has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups and various visual artists. The four-day music festival in Chicago's Grant Park hosts an estimated 400,000 people each year{{When|date=August 2020}} and sells out annually.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kot |first1=Greg |title=Lollapalooza is healthy, despite slow ticket sales this year and (the fest owners hope) here to stay |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/lollapalooza/ct-ent-lollapalooza-2019-20190724-c7hl3bcss5h5vjhzlya55me7wq-story.html |access-date=3 August 2019 |work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> Lollapalooza is considered one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world and one of the longest running in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 50 best music festivals in the world |url=https://www.timeout.com/london/music/the-50-best-music-festivals-in-the-world |website=Time Out London |access-date=3 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Briones |first1=Isis |title=12 Amazing Things You Can't Miss Out On At Chicago's Lollapalooza |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/isisbriones/2019/07/28/lollapalooza-chicago-things-to-do/#4dc866c391e4 |access-date=3 August 2019 |work=Forbes |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, its Brazilian edition was the world's third most grossing festival, with revenues of $14.5 million.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Watson|first=Amy|date=2020-01-23|title=Highest grossing festivals 2019|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/306095/highest-grossing-festivals-worldwide/|access-date=2020-08-02|website=[[Statista]]|language=en}}</ref>

Conceived and created in 1991 by [[Jane's Addiction]] singer [[Perry Farrell]] as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled.<ref name="usatoday">The Associated Press.

In 2005, Farrell and the [[William Morris Agency]] partnered with [[Austin, Texas]]–based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now [[C3 Presents]]) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in Chicago at Grant Park. In 2014, [[Live Nation Entertainment]] bought a controlling interest in C3 Presents.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6414053/live-nation-completes-deal-for-c3-presents Live Nation Completes Deal for C3 Presents] - Billboard, 22 December 2014</ref>

In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would remain in Chicago while also debuting outside the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in [[Chile]]'s capital [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] on April 2–3, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago-based company Lotus.

==Etymology==
The word—sometimes alternatively spelled and pronounced as ''lollapalootza'' or ''lalapaloosa''<ref>{{cite book |last=Appleton |first=Victor |title=Tom Swift and His Big Tunnel |year=1916 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/19tom10.txt |chapter=Chapter XIV: Mysterious Disappearances}}</ref>—or "lallapaloosa" ([[P. G. Wodehouse]], "Heart of a Goof") dates from a late 19th century/early 20th century American [[idiomatic]] phrase meaning "an extraordinary or unusual thing, person, or event; an exceptional example or instance".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lollapalooza |title=Lollapalooza |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2013-08-12}}</ref> Its earliest known use was in 1896.<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lollapalooza |title=Lollapalooza |dictionary=Merriam-Webster |access-date=2015-07-31}}</ref>  In time the term also came to refer to a large lollipop.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">Hilburn, Robert. [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-22/entertainment/ca-30_1_pop-music-review "POP MUSIC REVIEW – 'Lollapalooza' – Festival Concert With '60s Concept Isn't the Hoped-For Happening"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. July 22, 1991.</ref>  Farrell, searching for a name for his festival, liked the [[Phonaesthetics|euphonious]] quality of the by-then-antiquated term upon hearing it in a [[Three Stooges]] short film.<ref name="history">Grimes, Taylor and Longton, Jeff. [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/lollapalooza/2007/story.jsp "Lollapalooza History Timeline"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. 2007.</ref> Paying homage to the term's double meaning, a character in the festival's original logo holds one of the lollipops.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/>

The word has also caused a slang suffix to appear in event-planning circles as well as in news and opinion shows that is used synonymously with other suffixes like "a-go-go", "o-rama", etc.  The suffix "(a)palooza" is often used to imply (often in hyperbolic language) that an entire event or crowd was made over that term, e.g.: "Parks"-apalooza, popular Chicago sushi restaurant "Roll"-apalooza, etc.

==History==

===Creation===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lollapalooza1991.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster of the inaugural Lollapalooza festival, of its first date in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in 1991.]] -->

Inspired by events such as Britain's [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] – which Lollapalooza cofounder [[Perry Farrell]] had been due to play in 1990 <ref>janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes-addiction/1990-08-24/1091/</ref> – Farrell, [[Ted Gardner]], Don Muller, and [[Marc Geiger]] conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell's band [[Jane's Addiction]].<ref>Reynolds, Simon. [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/arts/pop-music-a-woodstock-for-the-lost-generation.html "POP MUSIC; A Woodstock for the Lost Generation"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. August 4, 1991.</ref>

Unlike previous festivals such as [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]], [[A Gathering of the Tribes]] (also an influence on Lollapalooza) and the [[US Festival]], which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991. The inaugural Lollapalooza lineup was made up of artists from [[alternative rock]] (such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] who were the second headliners),  [[industrial music]] (such as [[Nine Inch Nails]]) and [[hip hop music|rap]] ([[Ice-T]] rapped and used the platform to launch [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]], his [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band). The premiere in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on July 18, 1991 was covered by a report on [[MTV]] which ended by journalist Dave Kendall saying "Lollapalooza could be the tour of the summer",<ref>{{cite web |first=dave |last=Kendall|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DGJd77uzjw |title= A week in rock (presented by Kurt Loder) - report on Lollapalooza's premiere in Phoenix |publisher=youtube|date=July 1991 |access-date=2 September 2019}}</ref> the tour finished off in [[Seattle]] on August 28, 1991.

Another key concept was the inclusion of nonmusical features.<ref>Parvaz, D. [http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/136299_lollapalooza23.html "Lollapalooza: Then and Now"]. ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. August 23, 2003.</ref> Performers such as the [[Jim Rose Circus|Jim Rose Circus Side Show]], an alternative freak show, and the [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monks stretched the boundaries of rock culture. There was a tent for display of art pieces, [[virtual reality]] games, and information tables for political and environmental non-profit groups, promoting counter-culture and political awareness.<ref>Wiederhorn, Jon. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459531/20030114/farrell_perry.jhtml "Corporate Sponsors May Be Key To Lollapalooza's Return"]. [[MTV]].com. January 15, 2003.</ref> "Basically, I'm bored," Farrell said at the time. "I just want to see things that are unexpected and slightly bizarre. The way [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus|Barnum & Bailey]] perceived putting on a show ... well, they had a different angle."<ref>{{cite magazine|first= James |last= Halbert |title= Nasy habits |magazine= [[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |issue= 30 |date= August 2001 |page= 59}}</ref>

===Success and decline===
The inaugural edition in 1991 was a surprise massive success. For [[Dave Grohl]] of Nirvana who saw it in Los Angeles while mixing ''Nevermind'', the festival helped change the mentalities in the music industry.  [[The Butthole Surfers]] opened the day playing in front of a big audience and Siouxsie and the Banshees "were like the Led Zeppelin of that scene". "It felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all".<ref>{{cite web|first=Brent |last=DiCrescenzo|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/dave-grohl-of-foo-fighters-extended-interview-lollapalooza-2011|title=Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters Extended interview Lollapalooza 2011|publisher=Timeout.com |date=28 July 2011|access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref> That year, Farrell also coined the term "Alternative Nation".<ref name="altguitar">di Perna, Alan. "Brave Noise—The History of Alternative Rock Guitar". ''Guitar World''. December 1995.</ref> The explosion of [[alternative rock]] in the early 1990s propelled Lollapalooza forward; the 1992 and 1993 festivals leaned heavily on [[grunge]] and alternative acts, and usually featured an additional rap artist.<ref>Nager, Larry.

July 13, 2003.</ref> Punk rock standbys like [[Moshing|mosh pits]] and [[crowd surfing]] became part of the canon of the concerts. These years saw great increases in the participatory nature of the event with the inclusion of booths for open-microphone readings and oratory, television-smashing pits and tattooing and piercing parlors.<ref>Moses, Robert.

[[File:Lollapalooza Chicago Skyline.jpg|thumb|right|Lollapalooza with the [[Chicago skyline]] backdrop.]]

Grunge band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] was scheduled to headline at the festival in 1994, reportedly being offered nearly $10 million to do it.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jeff|last=Craig|title=Cobain conspiracy?|url=http://www.canoe.com:80/JamMusicArtistsN/nirvana.html|date=February 7, 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991109094228/http://www.canoe.com:80/JamMusicArtistsN/nirvana.html|access-date=July 24, 2020|archive-date=1999-11-09}}</ref> However, Cobain turned it down, and the band officially dropped out of the festival on April 7, 1994.<ref name="history"/> Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s body was discovered in [[Seattle]] the next day. Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]], made guest appearances at several shows, including the [[Philadelphia]] show at [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park|FDR Park]] (usually taking time given to her by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] vocalist/guitarist [[Billy Corgan]]), speaking to the crowds about the loss, then singing a minimum of two songs.<ref name="history"/> Farrell worked with rock poster artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans (T.A.Z.)]] to create a series of posters and the complete graphic decoration for the 1994 event, including two 70 foot tall Buddha statues that flanked the main stage.

In 1996, Farrell, who had been the soul of the festival, decided to focus his energy to produce his new festival project, [[Enit Festival|ENIT]], and did not participate in producing Lollapalooza.<ref name="history"/> Many fans saw the addition of [[Metallica]] in 1996 as contrary to the festival's prior practice of featuring "non-mainstream" artists,<ref name="history"/> and described the crowds attracted by Metallica as being singularly focused on the headliner without respect for the other performing artists.<ref name=rolling-stone-australia-oct-1996>{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Andrew|title=You Am I: "Time is on Our Side"|journal=Rolling Stone Australia|date=October 1996|issue=527|url=http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/flashback-you-am-i-time-is-on-our-side/2633-page-3|access-date=2015-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120081352/http://rollingstoneaus.com/music/post/flashback-you-am-i-time-is-on-our-side/2633-page-3|archive-date=2015-11-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Moreover, festival cofounder Farrell felt that Metallica's macho image violated his peaceful vision for the festival,<ref>{{cite news|last=Farber|first=Jim|title=Perry Farrell brings back Lollapalooza & legendary band,too|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2003-07-13/entertainment/18248130_1_sacred-acts-classic-albums-strays|newspaper=Daily News|date=July 13, 2003}}</ref> for alternative culture of the early 1990s was generally against macho behavior.<ref>For example, see Mimi Schippers, ''Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2002. (Especially Chapter 1, and page 14.)</ref> Farrell quit the tour in protest.<ref>Pillsbury, Glenn T. ''Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity''. New York: Routledge, 2006. See page 143.</ref>

Responding to the controversial Metallica tour, Lollapalooza made efforts to revive its relevance to audiences. The festival booked eclectic acts such as [[country music|country]] superstar [[Waylon Jennings]] in 1996, and emphasized heavily [[electronica]] groups such as [[The Orb]] and [[The Prodigy]] in 1997.<ref name="history"/> 1997, however, would prove to be the final tour from the initial series of Lollapalooza tours. The festival failed to find a suitable headliner in 1998, and therefore announced Lollapalooza's cancellation.<ref>[http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4613736-1.html "Lollapalooza Cancelled"]. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. April 6, 1998.</ref> The cancellation served as a signifier of alternative rock's declining popularity. In light of the festival's troubles that year, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now."<ref>Weisbard, Eric. "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven". ''Spin''. July 1998.</ref>

===Revival and rebirth===
[[File:Lollapalooza Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|Lollapalooza Welcome Sign in Grant Park, Chicago.]]

In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane's Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in 30 cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices.<ref name="history"/> Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. It was cancelled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country.<ref name="usatoday"/> Farrell partnered with Capital Sports & Entertainment (now [[C3 Presents]]), which co-owns and produces the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], to produce Lollapalooza.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/63172/pixies-weezer-panic-set-for-lollapalooza "Pixies, Weezer, Panic Set For Lollapalooza"].

It returned to Chicago on August 4–6, 2006.

=== Tickets and pricing ===
Tickets to the flagship and original Lollapalooza edition, in [[Chicago]], are usually sold out extremely quickly. In the 2016 Lollapalooza, the four-day general passes sold out in about one day after they started the sale. The one-day passes sold even more quickly: they were gone less than three hours after organizers revealed the lineup for the four-day music festival.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Tracy |last=Swartz |date=March 23, 2016 |title=Lollapalooza 1-day general admission passes sell out in under 3 hours |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-lollapalooza-one-day-passes-sell-out-20160323-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> Because of this phenomenon, people who cannot buy the passes try to get them through alternatives sources such as [[Craigslist]] and [[StubHub]]. This is a common practice, although the prices tend to be significantly higher on these websites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/C-Notes/July-2013/Lollapalooza-Tickets/ |title=Where to Buy Lollapalooza Tickets Online |work=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]] |access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> In 2018, the festival experienced unusually slower sales so they released the lineup about 8 hours earlier.

In its earliest editions, the official passes used to cost $31.50. However, with its growth and prominent relevance on the music scenario, Lollapalooza passes' prices have been increasing substantially over the years. Comparing the weekend passes for Lollapalooza 2016, which cost $335, not including taxes and fees, with the ones for Lollapalooza 2015, which cost $275, the increase was more than 20%.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Adamczyk|first=Alicia |title=Lollapalooza 2016 Will Last 4 Days, Cost 20% More |url=http://time.com/money/4135166/lollapalooza-2016-tickets-more-expensive-extra-day/ |website=[[Money (magazine)|Money]] |access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref> The price from 2015 to 2018 has remained the same without any increases.

===Other===
On August 7, 2012, Perry Farrell announced that Lollapalooza will be debuting in [[Tel Aviv, Israel]]. Farrell described Israel as an "international music community that listens to everything we all listen to, but the artists weren't traveling there so it was an opportunity."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lollapalooza music festival coming to Israel|url = http://www.jta.org/2012/08/08/arts-entertainment/lollapalooza-music-festival-coming-to-israel|website = Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date = 2015-12-13}}</ref> The event was scheduled for August 20–22, 2013 in [[Hayarkon Park]], the city's largest urban park.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/perry-farrell-will-bring-lollapalooza-2013-israel/|title=Perry Farrell Will Bring Lollapalooza 2013 to Israel|publisher=Daniel Kreps |date=August 7, 2012}}</ref> However, the event has been postponed to an unknown date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=300707 |title=Report: Lollapalooza festival cancels Israel plans |publisher=Jpost.com |access-date=2013-08-12}}</ref> While there was no definitive reasoning for the cancellation of the Israel date, various news sources report there are often financial challenges that attribute to producing a large-scale show with international artists within the political situation in the Mideast.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lollapalooza Israel Canceled: 'We're Sorry' {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1521648/lollapalooza-israel-canceled-were-sorry|website = Billboard|access-date = 2015-12-13}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Recording engineer, guitarist, and journalist [[Steve Albini]] has criticized Lollapalooza for its corporatization of popularized "alternative" music.  In a 1993 interview, Albini commented:

<blockquote> Lollapalooza is the worst example of corporate encroachment into what is supposed to be the underground. It is just a large scale marketing of bands that pretend to be alternative but are in reality just another facet of the mass cultural exploitation scheme. I have no appreciation or affection for those bands and I have no interest in that whole circle. If Lollapalooza had [[The Jesus Lizard|Jesus Lizard]] and the [[Melvins]] and [[Fugazi]] and [[Slint]] then you could make a case that it was actually people on the vanguard of music. What it really is the most popular bands on MTV that are not heavy metal.<ref name="obsolete.com">{{cite web |url=http://obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/bigblack.html |title=Steve Albini 1993 |publisher=Obsolete.com |access-date=2013-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205205919/http://www.obsolete.com/convulsion/interviews/convulse/bigblack.html |archive-date=1998-12-05 }}</ref></blockquote>

Both [[The Jesus Lizard]] and the [[Melvins]] have subsequently performed at the event.<ref name="Lollapalooza 1995">{{cite web |url=http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1995 |title=Lollapalooza 1995 |publisher=Lineup.lollapalooza.com |access-date=2013-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806172859/http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1995 |archive-date=2013-08-06 }}</ref><ref name="Lollapalooza 1996">{{cite web |url=http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1996 |title=Lollapalooza 1996 |publisher=Lineup.lollapalooza.com |access-date=2013-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806185026/http://lineup.lollapalooza.com/past/1996 |archive-date=2013-08-06 }}</ref>

In April 2010, it was reported that [[Illinois Attorney General]] [[Lisa Madigan]] had launched an [[antitrust]] investigation into the festival for imposing [[radius clause]]s on acts, contractually stipulating that they could not perform in cities within 300 miles of Chicago—including cities as far as [[Detroit]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Milwaukee]]—for up to six months prior, and three months after Lollapalooza.<ref name=rollingstone-lolla>{{cite web|title=Attorney General Investigates Lollapalooza|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/attorney-general-investigates-lollapalooza-20100625|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=lat-coachellaafterall>{{cite web|title=So maybe Coachella's booking rules aren't so egregious after all|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/06/so-maybe-coachellas-booking-rules-arent-so-egregious-after-all.html|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=24 June 2014}}</ref>
