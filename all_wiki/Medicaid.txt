'''Medicaid''' in the United States is a federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], including nursing home care and personal care services. The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as "a government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care."<ref>[[America's Health Insurance Plans]] (HIAA), p. 232</ref> 

Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for people with low income in the United States, providing free health insurance to 74 million low-income and disabled people (23% of Americans) as of 2017.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://econofact.org/evidence-on-the-value-of-medicaid|title=Evidence on the Value of Medicaid  |last=Gottlieb|first=Joshua D. |last2=Shepard|first2=Mark | name-list-style = vanc |date=2017-07-02|work=Econofact|access-date=2017-07-05  }}</ref><ref name=NPR_Medicaid >{{ cite news | last=Terhune | first=Chad | date=2018-10-18 | title=Private Medicaid Plans Receive Billions In Tax Dollars, With Little Oversight | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/10/18/657862337/private-medicaid-plans-receive-billions-in-tax-dollars-with-little-oversight | department=Health Shots | publisher=[[NPR]] | access-date=2018-10-18 | quote=...Medicaid, the nation's public insurance program that assists 75 million low-income Americans.}}</ref><ref name=US-Pop>{{cite report | title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2017 | url=https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0100000US | access-date=2018-10-18 | publisher=United States Census Bureau, Population Division | date=2017-12-01 | quote=Estimated United States population as of July 1, 2017 = 325,719,178 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213010033/https://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/PEP/2017/PEPANNRES/0100000US | archive-date=February 13, 2020 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  It is a [[means test|means-tested]] program that is jointly funded by the state and federal governments and managed by the states,<ref name=":3" /> with each state currently having broad leeway to determine who is eligible for its implementation of the program.

However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v.

Beginning in the 1980s, many states received waivers from the federal government to create [[Medicaid managed care]] programs. Under managed care, Medicaid recipients are enrolled in a private health plan, which receives a fixed monthly premium from the state. The health plan is then responsible for providing for all or most of the recipient's healthcare needs. Today, all but a few states use managed care to provide coverage to a significant proportion of Medicaid enrollees. As of 2014, 26 states have contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) to deliver long-term care for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The states pay a monthly capitated rate per member to the MCOs that provide comprehensive care and accept the risk of managing total costs.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/states-turn-managed-care-constrain-medicaid-long-term-care-costs |title=States Turn to Managed Care To Constrain Medicaid Long-Term Care Costs |date=April 9, 2014 |access-date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, roughly 80% of enrollees are enrolled in managed care plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Delivery-Systems/Managed-Care/Managed-Care-site.html|title=Managed Care|publisher=medicaid.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220125540/https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/delivery-systems/managed-care/managed-care-site.html|archive-date=2016-02-20|url-status=dead|access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref> Core eligibility groups of poor children and parents are most likely to be enrolled in managed care, while the aged and disabled eligibility groups more often remain in traditional "[[fee for service]]" Medicaid.

Because the service level costs vary depending on the care and needs of the enrolled, a cost per person average is only a rough measure of actual cost of care. The annual cost of care will vary state to state depending on state approved Medicaid benefits, as well as the state specific care costs. 2008 average cost per senior was reported as $14,780 (in addition to Medicare), and a state by state listing was provided.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In a 2010 national report for all age groups, the per enrolled average cost was calculated to $5,563 and a listing by state and by coverage age is provided.<ref>{{cite web|website=KFF.org|url=http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-payments-per-enrollee/|title=Medicaid pyments per enrollee|date=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Healthcare in the United States}}
The [[Social Security Amendments of 1965]] created Medicaid by adding Title XIX to the [[Social Security Act]], 42 U.S.C. §§&nbsp;1396 et seq. Under the program, the federal government provides matching funds to states to enable them to provide medical assistance to residents who meet certain eligibility requirements. The objective is to help states provide medical assistance to residents whose incomes and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services. Medicaid serves as the nation's primary source of health insurance coverage for low-income populations.

States are not required to participate. Those that do must comply with federal Medicaid laws under which each participating state administers its own Medicaid program, establishes eligibility standards, determines the scope and types of services it will cover, and sets the rate of payment.  Benefits vary from state to state, and because someone qualifies for Medicaid in one state, it does not mean they will qualify in another.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=U.S. Social Security Administration, Office of Retirement and Disability Policy|title= Annual Statistical Supplement|date=2011|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2011/medicaid.html|access-date=October 19, 2012}}</ref> The federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) monitors the state-run programs and establishes requirements for service delivery, quality, funding, and eligibility standards.

The [[Medicaid Drug Rebate Program]] and the [[Health Insurance Premium Payment Program]] (HIPP) were created by the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990]] (OBRA-90). This act helped to add Section 1927 to the Social Security Act of 1935 which became effective on January 1, 1991. This program was formed due to the costs that Medicaid programs were paying for outpatient drugs at their discounted prices.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidDrugRebateProgram/|publisher=HHS|title=Medicaid Drug Rebate Program Overview|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214143730/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidDrugRebateProgram/|archive-date=December 14, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993]] (OBRA-93) amended Section 1927 of the Act as it brought changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program,<ref name="autogenerated3" /> as well as requiring states to implement a [[Medicaid estate recovery]] program to sue the estate of decedents for long-term-care-related costs paid by Medicaid, and giving states the option of recovering all non-long-term-care costs, including full medical costs.<ref name=":9">{{cite web|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/daltcp/reports/estaterec.htm |title=Medicaid Estate Recovery|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|date=April 2005}}</ref> (Estate recovery, when the state recovers all medical costs for people 55 and older, extends to the expanded Medicaid coverage that is part of the ACA.)

Medicaid also offers a Fee for Service (Direct Service) Program to schools throughout the United States for the reimbursement of costs associated with the services delivered to special education students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Delivery-Systems/Fee-for-Service.html|title=Fee for Service (Direct Service) Program|publisher=Medicaid.gov|access-date=August 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813142149/http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Delivery-Systems/Fee-for-Service.html|archive-date=August 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Federal law mandates that every disabled child in America receive a "free appropriate public education." Decisions by the United States Supreme Court and subsequent changes in federal law make it clear that Medicaid must pay for services provided for all Medicaid-eligible disabled children.

A 2016 study found that residents of Kentucky and Arkansas, which both expanded Medicaid, were more likely to receive health care services and less likely to incur emergency room costs or have trouble paying their medical bills.

A 2016 [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|DHHS]] study found that states that expanded Medicaid had lower premiums on exchange policies, because they had fewer low-income enrollees, whose health on average is worse than that of those with higher income.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/upshot/how-expanding-medicaid-may-lower-insurance-premiums.html |title=How Expanding Medicaid Can Lower Insurance Premiums for All |last=Sanger-katz |first=Margot |date=August 25, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref>

The Census Bureau reported in September 2019 that states that expanded Medicaid under ACA had considerably lower uninsured rates than states that did not. For example, for adults between 100% and 399% of poverty level, the uninsured rate in 2018 was 12.7% in expansion states and 21.2% in non-expansion states. Of the 14 states with uninsured rates of 10% or greater, 11 had not expanded Medicaid.<ref name="Census_2018" />  A July 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) indicated that states enacting Medicaid expansion exhibited statistically significant reductions in mortality rates.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Sarah|last2=Altekruse|first2=Sean|last3=Johnson|first3=Norman|last4=Wherry|first4=Laura|date=July 2019|title=Medicaid and Mortality: New Evidence from Linked Survey and Administrative Data|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|series=NBER Working Paper No. 26081|doi=10.3386/w26081|s2cid=164463149}}</ref>

== State implementations ==
States may bundle together the administration of Medicaid with other programs such as the [[Children's Health Insurance Program]] (CHIP), so the same organization that handles Medicaid in a state may also manage the additional programs. Separate programs may also exist in some localities that are funded by the states or their political subdivisions to provide health coverage for indigents and minors.

State participation in Medicaid is voluntary; however, all states have participated since 1982 when Arizona formed its [[Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System]] (AHCCCS) program. In some states Medicaid is subcontracted to private health insurance companies, while other states pay providers (i.e., doctors, clinics and hospitals) directly.  There are many services that can fall under Medicaid and some states support more services than other states.  The most provided services are intermediate care for mentally handicapped, prescription drugs and nursing facility care for under 21-year-olds.  The least provided services include institutional religious (non-medical) health care, respiratory care for ventilator dependent and PACE (inclusive [[elderly care]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dáil|first=Paula vW.|title=Women and Poverty in 21st Century America|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-4903-3|page=137|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4903-3|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130128155831/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-4903-3|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-28}}</ref>

Most states administer Medicaid through their own programs. A few of those programs are listed below:
* Arizona: [[Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System|AHCCCS]]
* California: [[Medi-Cal]]
* Connecticut: [[HUSKY D]]
* Maine: MaineCare
* Massachusetts: [[MassHealth]]
* New Jersey: [[NJ FamilyCare]]
* Oregon: [[Oregon Health Plan]]
* Oklahoma: [[Soonercare]]
* Tennessee: [[TennCare]]
* Washington [[Apple Health]]
* Wisconsin: [[BadgerCare]]

=== Differences by state ===
Medicaid is managed by the states, and each one has varying criteria on how to qualify for the program, what services are covered, and how physicians and care providers are reimbursed through the program. Differences between states are often influenced by the political ideologies of the state and cultural beliefs of the general population.

[[Medicaid estate recovery]] regulations also vary by state.  (Federal law gives options as to whether non-long-term-care-related expenses, such as normal health-insurance-type medical expenses are to be recovered, as well as on whether the recovery is limited to probate estates or extends beyond.)<ref name=":9" />

==== Political influences ====
Several political factors influence the cost and eligibility of tax-funded health care, according to  a study conducted by Gideon Lukens,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lukens |first1=G. |title=State Variation in Health Care Spending and the Politics of State Medicaid Policy |journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law |date=23 September 2014 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1213–1251 |doi=10.1215/03616878-2822634 |pmid=25248962 }}</ref> which found salient factors affecting eligibility included "party control, the ideology of state citizens, the prevalence of women in legislatures, the line-item veto, and physician interest group size," and which supported the generalized hypothesis that Democrats favor generous eligibility policies, while Republicans do not. When the Supreme Court allowed states to decide whether to expand Medicaid or not in 2012, northern states, in which Democrat legislators predominated, disproportionately did so, often also extending existing eligibility.
Certain states in which there is a Republican-controlled legislature may be forced to expand Medicaid in ways extending beyond increasing existing eligibility in the form of waivers for certain Medicaid requirements so long as they follow certain objectives. In its implementation, this has meant using Medicaid funds to pay for low-income citizens’ health insurance; this private-option was originally carried out in Arkansas but was adopted by other Republican-led states.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Shanna |title=Opting In, Opting Out: The Politics of State Medicaid Expansion |journal=The Forum |date=1 January 2015 |volume=13 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/for-2015-0011 }}</ref> However, private coverage is more expensive than Medicaid and the states would not have to contribute as much to the cost of private coverage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zaloshnja |first1=Eduard |last2=Miller |first2=Ted R. |last3=Coben |first3=Jeffrey |last4=Steiner |first4=Claudia |title=How Often Do Catastrophic Injury Victims Become Medicaid Recipients? |journal=Medical Care |date=June 2012 |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=513–519 |doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e318245a686 |pmid=22270099 |jstor=23216705 }}</ref>

Certain groups of people, such as migrants, face more barriers to health care than others due to factors besides policy, which can still be very challenging, such as status, transportation and knowledge of the healthcare system (including eligibility).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mojtabai |first1=Ramin |last2=Feder |first2=Kenneth A. |last3=Kealhofer |first3=Marc |last4=Krawczyk |first4=Noa |last5=Storr |first5=Carla |last6=Tormohlen |first6=Kayla N. |last7=Young |first7=Andrea S. |last8=Olfson |first8=Mark |last9=Crum |first9=Rosa M. |title=State variations in Medicaid enrollment and utilization of substance use services: Results from a National Longitudinal Study |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |date=June 2018 |volume=89 |pages=75–86 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2018.04.002 |pmid=29706176 |pmc=5964257 }}</ref>

==== Eligibility and coverage ====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2020}}
Medicaid eligibility policies are very complicated. In general, a person's Medicaid eligibility is linked to their eligibility for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which provides aid to children whose families have low or no income, and to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for the aged, blind and disabled. States are required under federal law to provide all AFDC and SSI recipients with Medicaid coverage. Because eligibility for AFDC and SSI essentially guarantees Medicaid coverage, examining eligibility/coverage differences per state in AFDC and SSI is an accurate way to assess Medicaid differences as well. SSI coverage is largely consistent by state, and requirements on how to qualify or what benefits are provided are standard. However AFDC has differing eligibility standards that depend on:

#Perceived Incentive for Welfare Migration. Not only do social norms within the state affect its determination of AFDC payment levels, but regional norms will affect a state's perception of need as well. 

==== Reimbursement for care providers ====
Beyond the variance in eligibility and coverage between states, there is a large variance in the reimbursements Medicaid offers to care providers; the clearest examples of this are common orthopedic procedures. For instance, in 2013, the average difference in reimbursement for 10 common orthopedic procedures in the states of New Jersey and Delaware was $3,047.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lalezari |first1=Ramin M. |last2=Pozen |first2=Alexis |last3=Dy |first3=Christopher J. |title=State Variation in Medicaid Reimbursements for Orthopaedic Surgery |journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery |date=February 2018 |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=236–242 |doi=10.2106/JBJS.17.00279 |pmid=29406345 |url=https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7654&context=open_access_pubs }}</ref> The discrepancy in the reimbursements Medicaid offers may affect the type of care provided to patients.

Medicaid payments currently assist nearly 60% of all nursing home residents and about 37% of all childbirths in the United States. The federal government pays on average 57% of Medicaid expenses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Loss of income and medical insurance coverage during the [[2008 recession|2008–2009 recession]] resulted in a substantial increase in Medicaid enrollment in 2009. Nine U.S. states showed an increase in enrollment of 15% or more, resulting in heavy pressure on state budgets.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/health/policy/01medicaid.html|title=Recession Drove Millions to Medicaid in '09, Survey Finds|last=Sack|first=Kevin | name-list-style = vanc |date=2010-09-30|work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] reported that for 2013, Medicaid recipients were 40% white, 21% black, 25% Hispanic, and 14% other races.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-enrollment-by-raceethnicity/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D|title=Medicaid Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity|work=The Henry J.

== Comparisons with Medicare ==
Unlike Medicaid, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is a [[social insurance]] program funded at the federal level<ref>[http://www.medicare.gov/LongTermCare/Static/Home.asp Medicare.gov – Long-Term Care<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418222026/http://www.medicare.gov/LongTermCare/Static/Home.asp |date=April 18, 2006 }}</ref> and focuses primarily on the older population.  As stated in the CMS website,<ref name=":3" /> Medicare is a [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] program for people age 65 or older, people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and (through the [[End Stage Renal Disease Program]]) people of all ages with [[end-stage renal disease]].  The Medicare Program provides a Medicare part A which covers hospital bills, Medicare Part B which covers medical insurance coverage, and Medicare Part D which covers prescription drugs.

Medicaid is a program that is not solely funded at the federal level. States provide up to half of the funding for Medicaid. In some states, counties also contribute funds. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid is a [[means-tested]], [[needs-based]] [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] or [[Social security#Social protection|social protection]] program rather than a [[social insurance]] program. Eligibility is determined largely by income. The main criterion for Medicaid eligibility is limited income and financial resources, a criterion which plays no role in determining Medicare coverage. Medicaid covers a wider range of health care services than Medicare.

Some people are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare and are known as [[Medicare dual eligible]] or medi-medi's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DualEligible/|title=Dual Eligible|website=www.cms.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103023029/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/DualEligible/|archive-date=January 3, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://seniorquote.com/medi-medi-dual-eligibility/|title=Medi-Medi Dual Eligibility - Medicare, Medicaid and You - SeniorQuote |website=seniorquote.com}}</ref> In 2001, about 6.5 million people were enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid.

== Benefits ==
There are two general types of Medicaid coverage. "Community Medicaid" helps people who have little or no medical insurance. Medicaid nursing home coverage pays all of the costs of nursing homes for those who are eligible except that the recipient pays most of his/her income toward the nursing home costs, usually keeping only $66.00 a month for expenses other than the nursing home.

Some states operate a program known as the [[Health Insurance Premium Payment Program]] (HIPP).  This program allows a Medicaid recipient to have private health insurance paid for by Medicaid. As of 2008 relatively few states had premium assistance programs and enrollment was relatively low. Interest in this approach remained high, however.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7782.pdf|title=Choosing Premium AssistanceH: What does State experience tell us?|last=Alker|first=Joan|date=2008|publisher=The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]|name-list-style=vanc}}</ref>

Included in the Social Security program under Medicaid are dental services. They are optional for people older than 21 years but required for people eligible for Medicaid and younger than 21.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Dental-Care.html|title=Dental Coverage Overview|publisher=Medicaid|access-date=December 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205140516/http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Dental-Care.html|archive-date=December 5, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Minimum services include pain relief, restoration of teeth and maintenance for dental health.

If a condition requiring treatment is discovered during an oral screening, the state is responsible for paying for this service, regardless of whether or not it is covered on that particular Medicaid plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidDentalCoverage/Downloads/dentalguide.pdf|title=Dental Guide|publisher=HHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230040607/https://www.cms.gov/MedicaidDentalCoverage/Downloads/dentalguide.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Dental ===
Children enrolled in Medicaid are individually entitled under the law to comprehensive preventive and restorative dental services, but dental care utilization for this population is low.

== Eligibility ==
Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage or nursing home coverage to certain categories of low-asset people, including children, pregnant women, parents of eligible children, people with disabilities and elderly needing nursing home care. Medicaid was created to help low-asset people who fall into one of these eligibility categories "pay for some or all of their medical bills."<ref>[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/ "Medicaid Eligibility: Overview,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105024055/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/ |date=January 5, 2008 }} from the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) website</ref>

While Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) set out the general rules under which Medicaid operates, each state runs its own program. Under certain circumstances, an applicant may be denied coverage. As a result, the eligibility rules differ significantly from state to state, although all states must follow the same basic framework.

As of 2013, Medicaid is a program intended for those with low income, but a low income is not the only requirement to enroll in the program. Eligibility is ''categorical''—that is, to enroll one must be a member of a category defined by statute; some of these categories include low-income children below a certain wage, pregnant women, parents of Medicaid-eligible children who meet certain income requirements, low-income disabled people who receive [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) and/or [[Social Security Disability]] (SSD), and low-income seniors 65 and older. The details of how each category is defined vary from state to state.

=== PPACA income test standardization ===
As of 2019, when Medicaid has been expanded under the PPACA, eligibility is determined by an income test using [[Adjusted gross income|Modified Adjusted Gross Income]], with no state-specific variations and a prohibition on asset or resource tests.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/eligibility/index.html|title=Eligibility|website=www.medicaid.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref>

=== Non-PPACA eligibility ===
While Medicaid expansion available to adults under the PPACA mandates a standard income-based test without asset or resource tests, other eligibility criteria such as assets may apply when eligible outside of the PPACA expansion,<ref name=":6" /> including coverage for eligible seniors or disabled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familiesusa.org/1115-waiver-element-asset-tests|title=1115 Waiver Element: Asset Tests|date=2017-11-09|website=Families USA|language=en|access-date=2019-06-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119102248/http://familiesusa.org/1115-waiver-element-asset-tests|archive-date=January 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> These other requirements include, but are not limited to, assets, age, pregnancy, disability,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id-dd.com/medicaremedicaid/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20141115034713/http://www.id-dd.com/medicaremedicaid/|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 November 2014|title=Medicare/Medicaid|website=ID-DD Resources|access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref> blindness, income and resources, and one's status as a U.S. citizen or a lawfully admitted immigrant.<ref name=":4" />

As of 2015, asset tests varied; for example, eight states did not have an asset test for a buy-in available to working people with disabilities, and one state had no asset test for the aged/blind/disabled pathway up to 100% of the FPL.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-financial-eligibility-for-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-in-2015-report/|title=Medicaid Financial Eligibility for Seniors and People with Disabilities in 2015 - Report|last=Watts|first=Molly O'Malley|last2=Cornachione|first2=Elizabeth|date=2016-03-01|website=The Henry J.

More recently, many states have authorized financial requirements that will make it more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage. In [[Wisconsin]], nearly a quarter of Medicaid patients were dropped after the state government imposed premiums of 3% of household income.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.policymattersohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Making-Medicaid-work-1.pdf|title=Making Medicaid Work|website=www.policymattersohio.org}}</ref> A survey in Minnesota found that more than half of those covered by Medicaid were unable to obtain prescription medications because of co-payments.<ref name=":5" />

The [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]] requires anyone seeking Medicaid to produce documents to prove that he is a United States citizen or resident alien. An exception is made for Emergency Medicaid where payments are allowed for the pregnant and disabled regardless of immigration status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/95414.shtml|title=Pregnant Illegal Aliens Overwhelming Emergency Medicaid|date=2007-03-14|website=Newsmax.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609135250/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/14/95414.shtml|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead|access-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Healthcare for Wisconsin Residents|url=http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/Publications/p-10164.pdf|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services|access-date=October 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130165600/http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/Publications/p-10164.pdf|archive-date=November 30, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Special rules exist for those living in a nursing home and disabled children living at home.

==== Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries ====
Once someone is approved as a beneficiary in the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program, they may automatically be eligible for Medicaid coverage (depending on the laws of the state they reside in).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/medicaid.htm|title=Medicaid Information|last=ORDP.OPDR|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>

==== Five year "look-back" ====
The DRA created a five-year "look-back period."  That means that any transfers without fair market value (gifts of any kind) made by the Medicaid applicant during the preceding five years are penalizable.

The penalty is determined by dividing the average monthly cost of nursing home care in the area or State into the amount of assets gifted. Therefore, if a person gifted $60,000 and the average monthly cost of a nursing home was $6,000, one would divide $6000 into $60,000 and come up with 10. 10 represents the number of months the applicant would not be eligible for medicaid.

All transfers made during the five-year look-back period are totaled, and the applicant is penalized based on that amount after having already dropped below the Medicaid asset limit.  This means that after dropping below the asset level ($2,000 limit in most states), the Medicaid applicant will be ineligible for a period of time. The penalty period does not begin until the person is eligible for medicaid but for the gift.<ref>42 U.S.C. 1396p</ref>

Elders who gift or transfer assets can be caught in the situation of having no money but still not being eligible for Medicaid.

====Immigration status====
{{see also|Immigration to the United States}}

Legal permanent residents (LPRs) with a substantial work history (defined as 40 quarters of Social Security covered earnings) or military connection are eligible for the full range of major federal means-tested benefit programs, including Medicaid (Medi-Cal).<ref name=RL33809>{{cite report|title=RL33809 Noncitizen Eligibility for Federal Public Assistance: Policy Overview |date=December 12, 2016|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33809.html}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> LPRs entering after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years, after which their coverage becomes a state option, and states have the option to cover LPRs who are children or who are pregnant during the first five years. Noncitizen SSI recipients are eligible for (and required to be covered under) Medicaid. Refugees and asylees are eligible for Medicaid for seven years after arrival; after this term, they may be eligible at state option.

Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are not eligible for most federal benefits, regardless of whether they are means tested, with notable exceptions for emergency services (e.g., Medicaid for emergency medical care), but states have the option to cover nonimmigrant and unauthorized aliens who are pregnant or who are children, and can meet the definition of "lawfully residing" in the United States. Special rules apply to several limited noncitizen categories: certain "cross-border" American Indians, Hmong/Highland Laotians, parolees and conditional entrants, and cases of abuse.

Aliens outside the United States who seek to obtain visas at US consulates overseas, or admission at US ports of entry, are generally denied entry if they are deemed "likely at any time to become a public charge."<ref name=R43220>{{cite report|title=R43220 Public Charge Grounds of Inadmissibility and Deportability: Legal Overview |date=February 6, 2017|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|url=https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R43220.html}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Aliens within the United States who seek to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident (LPR), or who entered the United States without inspection, are also generally subject to exclusion and deportation on public charge grounds. Similarly, LPRs and other aliens who have been admitted to the United States are removable if they become a public charge within five years after the date of their entry due to causes that preexisted their entry.

A 1999 policy letter from immigration officials defined "public charge" and identified which benefits are considered in public charge determinations, and the policy letter underlies current regulations and other guidance on the public charge grounds of inadmissibility and deportability. Collectively, the various sources addressing the meaning of public charge have historically suggested that an alien's receipt of public benefits, per se, is unlikely to result in the alien being deemed to be removable on public charge grounds.

=== Children and SCHIP ===
A child may be eligible for Medicaid regardless of the eligibility status of his parents. Thus, a child may be covered by Medicaid based on his individual status even if his parents are not eligible. Similarly, if a child lives with someone other than a parent, he may still be eligible based on its individual status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/Downloads/MedicaidataGlance05.pdf|title=CMS.hhs.gov|website=hhs.gov|access-date=December 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228045355/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidEligibility/Downloads/MedicaidataGlance05.pdf|archive-date=February 28, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

One-third of children and over half (59%) of low-income children are insured through Medicaid or [[SCHIP]].  The insurance provides them with access to preventive and primary services which are used at a much higher rate than for the uninsured, but still below the utilization of privately insured patients.  As of 2014, rate of uninsured children was reduced to 6% (5 million children remain uninsured).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/childrens-health-coverage-the-role-of-medicaid-and-chip-and-issues-for-the-future/ |title=Children's Health Coverage: The Role of Medicaid and CHIP and Issues for the Future |first1=Elizabeth |last1=Cornachione |first2=Robin |last2=Rudowitz |first3=Samantha |last3=Artiga |date=June 27, 2016 |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] }}</ref>

=== HIV ===
Medicaid provided the largest portion of federal money spent on health care for people living with [[HIV]]/AIDS until the implementation of Medicare Part D when the prescription drug costs for those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid shifted to Medicare.  Unless low income people who are HIV positive meet some other eligibility category, they are not eligible for Medicaid assistance unless they can qualify under the "disabled" category to receive Medicaid assistance — as, for example, if they progress to [[AIDS]] ([[T-cell]] count drops below 200).<ref>"Medicaid and HIV/AIDS," Kaiser Family Foundation, fact sheet, [http://kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/medicaid-and-hivaids/ kff.org]</ref> The Medicaid eligibility policy contrasts with the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA) guidelines which recommend therapy for all patients with T-cell counts of 350 or less, or in certain patients commencing at an even higher T-cell count.  Due to the high costs associated with HIV medications, many patients are not able to begin [[antiretroviral]] treatment without Medicaid help.  More than half of people living with AIDS in the US are estimated to receive Medicaid payments. Two other programs that provide financial assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS are the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)]] and the [[Supplemental Security Income]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Unlike Medicare, which is solely a federal program, Medicaid is a joint federal-state program. Each state administers its own Medicaid system, but this system must conform to federal guidelines for the state to receive Federal matching funds. Financing of Medicaid in American Samoan, Puerto Rico, Guam, and The US Virgin Islands is instead through a block grant.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dcreport.org/2019/06/11/puerto-ricos-post-maria-medicaid-crisis/ |title = Puerto Rico's Post-Maria Medicaid Crisis|date = June 11, 2019}}</ref> The Federal government matches state funding according to the [[Federal Medical Assistance Percentages]].<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title11/1101.htm SSA.gov], Social Security Act.

Medicaid payments currently assist nearly 60% of all nursing home residents and about 37% of all childbirths in the United States. The federal government pays on average 57% of Medicaid expenses.

On November 25, 2008, a new federal rule was passed that allows states to charge premiums and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants.<ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/ search: 42 CFR Parts 447 and 457] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310235019/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/ |date=March 10, 2012 }}</ref> This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while the federal government will save nearly $1.4 billion.

After Medicaid was enacted, some states repealed their [[filial responsibility laws]], but most states still require children to pay for the care of their impoverished parents.

A 2019 review by Kaiser Family Foundation of 324 studies on Medicaid expansion concluded that "expansion is linked to gains in coverage; improvements in access, financial security, and some measures of health status/outcomes; and economic benefits for states and providers."<ref name=":7" />

=== Privatization and automation of Medicaid in Indiana ===

In 2006, Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a contract outsourcing and automating Indiana's welfare program in an effort to reduce fraud, cut spending, and help recipients move off of welfare programs. It was a $1.3 billion contract meant to last ten years, but within 3 years, IBM and Indiana sued each other for breaching the contract. The state claimed that IBM had not improved the welfare system after many complaints from welfare recipients. The court ruled that IBM was responsible for $78 million in damages to the state. IBM claims to have invested significant resources to bettering the welfare system of Indiana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ibm-indiana-penalty-20170807-story.html|title=Judge: IBM owes Indiana $78M for failed welfare automation|agency=Associated Press|website=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> 

Privatization and automation can have catastrophic consequences when not implemented properly. In this case, due to long automated calls, untrained workers, mismanagement of documents, poor data collection, and a variety of other issues, this contract cost millions in damages and created a great amount of stress for those who relied on welfare programs such as medicaid to survive. The state sought to eliminate personal relationships by automating the system and making sure that no singular person would oversee a specific case. The new automated application system was extremely rigid and any deviation would result in denial of benefits. Many poor and working-class people lost their benefits and had to enter a grueling process to prove their eligibility.<ref name=":8" /> This solution was technologically deterministic in that it sought to solve major societal issues simply by automating processes that were deemed ineffective. Eliminating human connection and face to face interaction completely, especially when dealing with a government program, can create far more problems than it solves.{{tone inline|date=July 2020}} The resulting legal battle between the state and a private corporation demonstrates the issue of a submerged state and begs the question of who becomes responsible for government welfare and Medicaid after privatization?{{tone inline|date=July 2020}}

A study printed in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law introduces the issue of a "submerged" state when welfare programs are privatized. The study analyzed medicaid self-reported enrollment numbers under a privatized system that "obscured" the role of the government. It concluded that privatized welfare systems that create new administrative structures decrease the self-reported medicaid enrollment numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tallevi|first=Ashley|date=2018-04-01|title=Out of Sight, Out of Mind? Measuring the Relationship between Privatization and Medicaid Self-Reporting|journal=Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law|volume=43|issue=2|pages=137–183|doi=10.1215/03616878-4303489|pmid=29630705|issn=0361-6878}}</ref> Many people who rely on welfare programs and are legally eligible for aid could potentially miss out on benefits due to the outsourcing of management. It could be argued that it is crucial that the state remain the primary authority and administrators of welfare programs. Otherwise, as described in chapter two of ''Automating Inequality,'' families could be caught in the crossfire and potentially be put in life-threatening situations. There could be systems of privatization that work efficiently, but they require study and careful implementation, otherwise there could be life changing consequences for individuals and families.{{tone inline|date=July 2020}}
