'''United Progressive Alliance''' ('''UPA''') is a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]] political parties in [[India]] formed after the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionaffairs.com/parties/UPA.html |title=United Progressive Alliance, UPA, UPA Performance General Election 2009, UPA Tally, UPA in Lok Sabha Elections 2009, India Elections 2009, General Elections, Election Manifesto, India Election News, India Elections Results, Indian Election Schedule, 15th Lok Sabha Elections, General Elections 2009, State Assembly Elections, State Assembly Elections Schedule, State Assembly Election Results|work=electionaffairs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205005205/http://electionaffairs.com/parties/UPA.html|archivedate=5 February 2012}}</ref> The largest member party of the UPA is the [[Indian National Congress|INC]], whose President [[Sonia Gandhi]] is chairperson of the UPA. It formed a government with support from some other left-aligned parties in [[2004 Indian general election|2004]], after no single party could get the majority on its own.

==History==
The UPA was formed soon after the [[2004 Indian general election|2004 general elections]] when it had become clear that no party had won an absolute majority. The hitherto ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) had won 181 seats<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/12/stories/2008071260391200.htm Small parties, independents in great demand] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7IN06jn?url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/12/stories/2008071260391200.htm |date=28 May 2009 }}.</ref> in the 543-member [[14th Lok Sabha]], as opposed to the UPA's tally of 218 seats.

The [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] with 59 MPs (excluding the [[speaker of the Lok Sabha]]), the [[Samajwadi Party]] with 39 MPs and the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] with 19 MPs were other significant blocks that opted to support UPA at various phases of its rule.<ref>Originally the SP had [http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx 39 MPs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831102348/http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx |date=31 August 2009 }}. [http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jul/25upavote1.htm 6 MPs defied party whip] and have been expelled from the party. </ref><ref>[http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx Lok Sabha members] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831102348/http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx |date=31 August 2009}}</ref> The UPA did not enjoy a simple majority on its own in the parliament, rather it has relied on the external support to ensure that it enjoys the confidence of the Indian parliament similar to the formula adopted by the previous minority governments of the [[United Front (India)|United Front]], the NDA, the Congress government of [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], and earlier governments of [[V. P. Singh]] and [[Chandra Shekhar]].

An informal alliance had existed prior to the elections as several of the current constituent parties had developed seat-sharing agreements in many states. However, it was only after the election that the results of negotiations between parties were announced. The UPA government's policies were initially guided by a [[common minimum programme]] that the alliance hammered out with fruitful consultations with [[Jyoti Basu]] and [[Harkishan Singh Surjeet]] of the 59-member Left Front.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Congress_pins_hopes_on_Jyoti_Basu/articleshow/3228282.cms |work=The Times of India |title=Congress pins hopes on Jyoti Basu }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Hence, government policies were generally perceived as centre-left, reflecting the [[Centrism|centrist]] policies of the INC.

During the tenure of [[Jharkhand]] Chief Minister [[Madhu Koda]], the constituents of the UPA were, by mutual consent, supporting his government.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/sep/14jhar5.htm Madhu Koda to be next Jharkhand CM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103105644/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/sep/14jhar5.htm |date=3 January 2008 }}. Retrieved 26 March 2007.</ref>

On 22 July 2008, the UPA narrowly survived a [[2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence|vote of confidence]] in the parliament brought on by the Left Front withdrawing their support in protest at the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7519860.stm|title=Indian government survives vote|publisher=BBC News|date=22 July 2008|accessdate=5 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007055456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7519860.stm|archive-date=7 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The Congress party and its leaders along with then SP leader Amar Singh were accused for cash for vote scam (see: [[Cash-for-votes scandal]]) in which they were accused for buying votes in Lok Sabha to save the government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cash-for-votes-scam-amar-singh-secrets/1/147148.html|title=Cash-for-votes scam: The deadly secrets of sting Singh : Cover Story - India Today|work=intoday.in|access-date=19 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180203/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cash-for-votes-scam-amar-singh-secrets/1/147148.html|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/feature/2011/2008-cash-for-vote-scam-rocks-in-2011.html|title=Cash For Vote Scam - Amar Singh - Supreme Court - Sudheendra Kulkarni - Swamajwadi Party - BJP|work=www.oneindia.com|access-date=19 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707031328/http://news.oneindia.in/feature/2011/2008-cash-for-vote-scam-rocks-in-2011.html|archive-date=7 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/cashforvote-scam-2008-court-orders-further-probe/1017051/|title=Cash-for-vote scam 2008: Court orders further probe|work=indianexpress.com|access-date=19 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090341/http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/cashforvote-scam-2008-court-orders-further-probe/1017051/|archive-date=9 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the Indian General Election in 2009, the UPA won 262 seats, of which the INC accounted for 206.

==Initial support==
Initially, UPA was given external support from the Left Front which totalled 59 MPs. Similar external support was also promised by several smaller parties that were not a member of any coalition, including the Samajwadi Party with 39 MPs, the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party with 4 MPs, the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] with 3 MPs, and [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] with 19 MPs, who promised to support the government if it faced a [[vote of confidence]]. Nevertheless, these parties were not a part of the government. The UPA thus [[2004 election#May 13: India|had at least 335 MPs]] out of 543 supporting it at the time of its formation.

The Left parties, despite ideological differences with the Congress, supported the UPA to ensure a [[Secularism in India|secular government]].<ref>"[http://www.rediff.com/election/2004/may/13basu.htm Secular govt a priority: Basu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103210024/http://www.rediff.com/election/2004/may/13basu.htm |date=3 January 2008 }}." Rediff Election Bureau 13 May 2004.</ref>

===Withdrawals===

====Telangana Rashtra Samithi====

The [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi]] (TRS) was the first party to quit the alliance, first when its ministers quit the Andhra Pradesh government, and finally when an official withdrawal was done at the national level by its president [[Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao|K. Chandrashekar Rao]], who resigned his Lok Sabha seat.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-23/india/27808570_1_upa-government-trs-telengana-rashtra-samithi TRS withdraws support to the UPA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729043330/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-23/india/27808570_1_upa-government-trs-telengana-rashtra-samithi |date=29 July 2013 }}. Retrieved 26 March 2007.</ref>

====Bahujan Samaj Party====

On 21 June 2008, the Bahujan Samaj Party, or the BSP, with 18 seats, announced withdrawal of its support after the Congress starting opposing the UP government where the BSP was the ruling party. Their leader Mayawati said that she wouldn't enter an electoral alliance with either the Congress or the BJP. She also accused both parties of misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation or the CBI and attempting to implicate her in the Taj Corridor Case. She also accused Congress of making false promises to help the people of Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal regions as they were suffering from drought.

====Left Front====

On 8 July 2008, [[Prakash Karat]], the general secretary of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI (M)), announced that the Left Front would be withdrawing support over the decision by the government to go ahead with the Indo-US nuclear deal, a [[Section 123 Agreement]] with the United States.<ref name="expressindia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Left-pulls-out-will-meet-President-Patil-on-Wednesday/332876/ |title=Left pulls out, will meet President Patil on Wednesday |publisher=expressindia.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012044135/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Left-pulls-out-will-meet-President-Patil-on-Wednesday/332876/ |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}</ref>

====Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party====
On 4 January 2009, Mehbooba Mufti, president of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party]] announced the withdrawal of the PDP from the UPA given that the Congress had decided to support the [[Omar Abdullah]]-led [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] Government in [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu & Kashmir]] after the [[2008 Jammu and Kashmir state assembly elections|2008 state elections]].<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pdp-withdraws-from-upa-unfortunate-says.../406523/ PDP withdraws from UPA], ''[[The Indian Express]]''. 5 January 2009</ref>

====Pattali Makkal Katchi====
On 26 March 2009, PMK declared that it would join the AIADMK led front and withdrew from the UPA and the party president declared that two union ministers of his party will resign shortly.

====All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen====
On 12 November 2012, Barrister [[Asaduddin Owaisi]], leader of the [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|AIMIM]] announced the decision of the party's executive and declared that his party would now go after the state government for its "communal" and "anti-people" policies. Addressing a news conference, Owaisi said his party was compelled to take the decision due to "the communal behaviour of [[Kiran Kumar Reddy]]'s government in [[Andhra Pradesh]]". Giving a detailed account of communal riots in the state and Hyderabad since 2010, he alleged that the Congress government not only turned a blind eye to MIM's demands to withdraw cases against innocent Muslims and take action against the guilty but pandered to the [[Sangh Parivar]]. The MIM's decision came after the government allegedly allowed construction of a canopy over a temple abutting the historic [[Charminar]] in alleged violation of court orders to maintain status quo. Owaisi criticised the chief minister for ignoring the high court order to maintain status quo.<ref name="The Times of India"/><ref name="dnaindia.com"/>

====All India Trinamool Congress====

On 18 September 2012, [[All India Trinamool Congress|AITC]] Chief, [[Mamata Banerjee]], announced her decision to withdraw support to the UPA after the AITC's demands of rollback of reforms including [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] in retail, increase in the price of diesel and limiting the number of subsidised cooking gas cylinders for households, were not met.<ref name="Monetcontrol.com"/><ref name="NDTV"/>

==Controversies==
The winter session of parliament in October 2008 came under intense criticism from the Left parties and the BJP to demand a full-fledged winter session instead of what was seen as the UPA to having "scuttled the voice of Parliament" by bringing down the sittings to a record low of 30 days in the year. The tensions between the UPA and the opposition parties became evident at an all-party meeting convened by Lok Sabha speaker [[Somnath Chatterjee]] when the leader of opposition, [[LK Advani]] questioned the status, timing and schedule of the current session of parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Left-joins-BJP-to-sing-chorus-against-UPA/374896/|title=Left joins BJP to sing chorus against UPA|author=Political Bureau|work=The Financial Express|access-date=17 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615133502/http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Left-joins-BJP-to-sing-chorus-against-UPA/374896|archive-date=15 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Karunanidhi had said he felt "let down" by the "lukewarm" response of the Centre and had demanded amendments in the resolution on Sri Lanka.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

One of the amendments was to "declare that [[genocide]] and [[war crime]]s had been committed and inflicted on the [[Eelam Tamils]] by the [[Sri Lankan Army]] and the administrators".

The second one was "establishment of a credible and independent international commission of investigation in a time-bound manner into the allegations of war crimes, [[crimes against humanity]], violations of international [[human rights law]], violations of [[international humanitarian law]] and crime of genocide against the Tamils". Karunanidhi said Parliament should adopt the resolution incorporating these two amendments.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-19/india/37843259_1_dmk-chief-karunanidhi-sri-lankan-tamils-humanitarian-law-and-crime |work=The Times of India |title=DMK pulls out of UPA govt over Sri Lanka Tamils issue – ''The Times of India'' |access-date=1 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529171837/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-19/india/37843259_1_dmk-chief-karunanidhi-sri-lankan-tamils-humanitarian-law-and-crime |archive-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The UPA has also been criticised for its alleged involvement in a number of scams such as the [[CWG scam|Commonwealth Games Scam]] of 2010, the [[2G spectrum case]], and the [[Coalgate scam]]. Apart from the above-mentioned scams, the UPA has been under intense fire for the alleged [[doles]] handed out to the son-in-law of the Gandhi family, Robert Vadra, by different state governments run by the UPA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realty.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/regulatory/cag-raps-haryana-govt-for-showing-undue-favours-to-robert-vadra/46696475|title=CAG raps Haryana govt. for showing undue favours to Robert vadra|work=The Economic Times|access-date=30 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109090341/http://realty.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/regulatory/cag-raps-haryana-govt-for-showing-undue-favours-to-robert-vadra/46696475|archive-date=9 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
