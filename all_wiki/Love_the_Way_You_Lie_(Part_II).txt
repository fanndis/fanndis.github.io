"'''Love the Way You Lie (Part II)'''" is a song by the [[Barbadians|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]] from her fifth [[studio album]] ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). It features the American rapper [[Eminem]], who wrote the song alongside [[Skylar Grey]] and the producer [[Alex da Kid]]. It is the sequel to the 2010 hit single "[[Love the Way You Lie]]", which appears on Eminem's seventh studio album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]''. It received positive reviews from critics and was performed for at the [[American Music Awards of 2010]] on November 21, 2010, as part of a medley with "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]" and "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]".

==Background==
Following the release and commercial success of "[[Love the Way You Lie]]" in 2010, [[Eminem]] wanted to record an alternative version with [[Rihanna]] as the lead vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muhammad|first=Latifah|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2010/10/19/rihanna-eminem-love-the-way-you-lie-sequel|title=Rihanna and Eminem to make a Love the Way You Lie sequel|work=The Boombox|publisher=[[AOL Inc.]]|date=October 19, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref> In an interview for [[MTV]], Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's no way you can outdo that, so why compete with it?".<ref name=sun/> She said when she first heard the original [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter [[Skylar Grey]], her reservations about recording it went away.<ref name=sun/> While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.<ref name=sun>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2010/10/30/15890306-wenn-photo.html|title=Rihanna worried about Eminem duet sequel|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|publisher=Mention|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>

"Love the Way You Lie" and "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" were based on a demo written and recorded in late 2009 by Grey.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dombrowski|first=Chris|title=Going to Grammys|url=http://theworldlink.com/news/local/article_4f9bdb96-30fe-11e0-9f4b-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=July 17, 2011|newspaper=The World|date=February 5, 2011}}</ref> Grey said "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I have a little bit of a launching pad to put out my own stuff." Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on ''Loud'', saying "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision if I was going to let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna's album, too."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.idolator.com/5755462/love-the-way-you-lie-skylar-grey | title=Who Did "Love The Way You Lie" Better: Rihanna Or Skylar Grey? | first=Robbie | last=Daw | work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] | date=February 1, 2011}}</ref>  The demo track by Grey, titled "Love the Way You Lie (Part III)", is on her [[extended play]] ''[[The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey]]'', which was released on January 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/01/05/skylar-grey-unveils-buried-sessions-artwork/ |title=Skylar Grey Unveils 'Buried Sessions' Artwork |work=Rap-Up  |date=January 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671UCck5I?url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/01/05/skylar-grey-unveils-buried-sessions-artwork/ |archivedate=April 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The piano and drums version, which features Eminem, appears as the final song on the standard edition of ''Loud'', while the piano version, which excludes Eminem's part in the song, appears as a bonus track on the [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] edition of ''Loud''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Rihanna Initially Against 'Love The Way You Lie (Part II)' With Eminem|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651117/20101029/eminem.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref> "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" is a mid-tempo song,<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|title=Rihanna, 'Love The Way You Lie Part II'&nbsp;– Composition Sheet Music|work=Musicnotes.com|publisher=[[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]}}</ref> which incorporates the musical genres of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[R&B]].

With the balance of vocals neatly flipped and extra cavernous beats ramping up the drama, it wallows ever-deeper in the tortured relationship sketched out in Part I. Eminem at points is practically screaming with rage, and sounding, frankly, mental. The contrast with Rihanna's smoothly pitched pain (“Maybe I’m a masochist/Try to run but I don’t wanna never leave”) is delicious."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/rihanna/11718|title=Album Review: Rihanna - Loud |work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that “''Loud'' works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, maintaining the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until it gets to 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It's sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It's purely theatrical, but it's also, for a moment, raw.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pareles|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/16/arts/music/16choice.html|title=Critics Choice - New CDs|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref> Christopher Richards of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that "With 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever."<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Chris|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/15/AR2010111506697.html|title=Rihanna's new albums: 'Loud,' yes, but what's clear?|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}</ref> James Skinner of [[BBC Online]] viewed 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited about him in the first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and ''Loud'' itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting."<ref>{{cite news|last=Skinner|first=James|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/x5fd |title=Music – Review of Rihanna – Loud|publisher=BBC|date=November 15, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref>

Steve Jones of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave a mixed review of the collaboration,  commenting, "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a tortured relationship from his ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' album."<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Steve|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-11-16-listen16_ST_N.htm|title=Listen Up: Rihanna is living out 'Loud' on new album|work=[[USA Today]]|date=November 16, 2010|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' writer Thomas Conner gave a negative review of the song, stating, "She collaborated with [[Eminem]] this summer on the controversial 'Love the Way You Lie', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on ''Loud'' with "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", an extension of the melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people."<ref>{{cite news|last=Conner|first=Thomas|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article|title='Loud' a well-deserved party for Rihanna|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=John Barron|date=November 12, 2010|accessdate=November 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DAw10jQo?url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article|archivedate=December 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
