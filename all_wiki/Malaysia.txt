'''Malaysia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Malaysia.ogg|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|z|i|ə|,_|-|ʒ|ə}} {{respell|mə|LAY|zee|ə|,_-|zhə}}; {{IPA-ms|məlejsiə|lang}}) is a country in [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[federation|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] consists of [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|thirteen states and three federal territories]], separated by the [[South China Sea]] into two regions, [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Borneo]]'s [[East Malaysia]]. Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime [[Malaysia–Thailand border|border]] with [[Thailand]] and maritime borders with [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Indonesia]]. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with [[Brunei]] and Indonesia and a maritime border with the [[Philippines]] and Vietnam. [[Kuala Lumpur]] is the national capital and largest city while [[Putrajaya]] is the seat of the federal government. With a population of over 32&nbsp;million, Malaysia is the world's [[List of countries by population|43rd-most populous country]]. The southernmost point of continental [[Eurasia]] is in [[Tanjung Piai]]. In the [[tropics]], Malaysia is one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]], home to a number of [[Wildlife of Malaysia|endemic species]].

Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the [[British Malaya|British Empire]], along with the British [[Straits Settlements]] protectorate. Peninsular Malaysia was unified as the [[Malayan Union]] in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1948 and achieved independence on 31 August 1957. Malaya united with [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]] on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore was [[Singapore in Malaysia|expelled]] from the federation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=290|isbn=978-1-107-50718-0}}</ref>

The country is [[Ethnic groups in Malaysia|multi-ethnic]] and [[Culture of Malaysia|multi-cultural]], which has a significant effect on its politics. About half the population is ethnically [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]], with minorities of [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]], [[Malaysian Indian|Indians]], and [[Orang Asal|indigenous peoples]]. The country's official language is [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], a standard form of the [[Malay language]]. English remains an active second language. While recognising [[Islam]] as the country's [[established religion]], the constitution grants [[freedom of religion]] to non-Muslims. The government is modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]] and the legal system is based on [[common law]]. The [[head of state]] is an [[Elective monarchy|elected monarch]], chosen from among the [[Monarchies of Malaysia|nine state sultans]] every five years. The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]].

After independence, the Malaysian [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew at an average of 6.5% per annum for almost 50 years. The economy has traditionally been fuelled by its natural resources but is expanding in the sectors of science, tourism, commerce and [[Medical tourism in Malaysia|medical tourism]]. Malaysia has a [[newly industrialised country|newly industrialised]] [[market economy]], ranked third-largest in Southeast Asia and [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|33rd-largest in the world]].<ref name="GDP IMF">{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2019/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=57&pr.y=17&sy=2019&ey=2019&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512%2C668%2C914%2C672%2C612%2C946%2C614%2C137%2C311%2C546%2C213%2C674%2C911%2C676%2C314%2C548%2C193%2C556%2C122%2C678%2C912%2C181%2C313%2C867%2C419%2C682%2C513%2C684%2C316%2C273%2C913%2C868%2C124%2C921%2C339%2C948%2C638%2C943%2C514%2C686%2C218%2C688%2C963%2C518%2C616%2C728%2C223%2C836%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C962%2C156%2C142%2C626%2C449%2C628%2C564%2C228%2C565%2C924%2C283%2C233%2C853%2C632%2C288%2C636%2C293%2C634%2C566%2C238%2C964%2C662%2C182%2C960%2C359%2C423%2C453%2C935%2C968%2C128%2C922%2C611%2C714%2C321%2C862%2C243%2C135%2C248%2C716%2C469%2C456%2C253%2C722%2C642%2C942%2C643%2C718%2C939%2C724%2C734%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C726%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C144%2C336%2C146%2C263%2C463%2C268%2C528%2C532%2C923%2C944%2C738%2C176%2C578%2C534%2C537%2C536%2C742%2C429%2C866%2C433%2C369%2C178%2C744%2C436%2C186%2C136%2C925%2C343%2C869%2C158%2C746%2C439%2C926%2C916%2C466%2C664%2C112%2C826%2C111%2C542%2C298%2C967%2C927%2C443%2C846%2C917%2C299%2C544%2C582%2C941%2C474%2C446%2C754%2C666%2C698&s=NGDPD&grp=0&a= |title=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2019 |date=15 October 2019 |website=IMF.org |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> It is a founding member of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]], [[East Asia Summit|EAS]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] and a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

Nearly 4,000 species of fungi, including lichen-forming species have been recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with the largest number of species in Malaysia, the [[Ascomycota]] and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the [[Basidiomycota]] are only partly surveyed: [[bracket fungi]], and mushrooms and [[toadstool]]s have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain very poorly known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.<ref>Lee, S.S.; Alias, S.A.; Jones, E.B.G.; Zainuddin, N. and Chan, H.T.

Malaysia's road network is one of the most comprehensive in Asia and covers a total of {{convert|144,403|km|mi|0}}. The main national road network is the [[Malaysian Federal Roads System]], which span over {{convert|49,935|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Most of the federal roads in Malaysia are 2-lane roads. In town areas, federal roads may become 4-lane roads to increase traffic capacity. Nearly all federal roads are paved with [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] except for parts of the [[Skudai–Pontian Highway]] which are paved with [[concrete]], while parts of the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] linking Klang to Kuala Lumpur are paved with [[asphalt]]. Malaysia has over {{convert|1798|km|mi|0}} of highways and the longest highway, the [[North–South Expressway (Malaysia)|North–South Expressway]], extends over {{convert|800|km|mi|0}} on the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, connecting major urban centres like [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Penang]] and [[Johor Bahru]]. In 2015, the government announced a RM27&nbsp;billion (US$8.23&nbsp;billion) [[Pan-Borneo Highway]] project to upgrade all [[trunk road]]s to [[Dual carriageway|dual-carriageway expressways]], bringing the standard of East Malaysian highways to the same level of quality as Peninsular highways.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Mody |first=Ashoka |title= Infrastructure strategies in East Asia: the untold story |publisher= The World Bank |year= 1997 |page=35 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jSVNQi3UZKgC |isbn= 978-0-8213-4027-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/10/17/fadillah-says-pan-borneo-highway-to-be-built-under-ukas-initiative/ |title=Fadillah says Pan Borneo Highway to be built under Ukas initiative |author=Pim Lim How |work=The Borneo Post |location= Kuching |date=17 October 2014 |access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>

There are currently {{convert|1833|km|mi}} of [[Rail transport in Malaysia|railways in Malaysia]], of which {{convert|767|km|mi|abbr=on}} are [[double track]]ed and [[Electrified railways|electrified]]. Rail transport in Malaysia comprises [[heavy rail]] ([[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|KTM]]), [[light rapid transit]] and [[monorail]] ([[Rapid Rail]]), and a [[funicular]] railway line ([[Penang Hill Railway]]). Heavy rail is mostly used for intercity passenger and freight transport as well as some urban public transport, while LRTs are used for intra-city urban public transport. There are two [[commuter rail]] services linking Kuala Lumpur with the [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]]. The sole monorail line in the country is used for public transport in Kuala Lumpur, while the only funicular railway line is in Penang. A [[rapid transit]] project, the [[KVMRT]], is currently under construction to improve Kuala Lumpur's public transport system. The railway network covers most of the 11 states in Peninsular Malaysia. In East Malaysia, only the state of Sabah has railways. The network is also connected to the [[State Railway of Thailand|Thai railway]] {{RailGauge|1000mm}} network in the north. If the [[Burma Railway]] is rebuilt, services to Myanmar, India, and China could be initiated. Malaysia also operated the [[KTM ETS]], (commercially known as "ETS", short for 'Electric Train Service') an [[inter-city rail]] passenger service operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] Berhad using electric multiple-unit trains. The KTM ETS is the second electric train service to be operated by the Malaysian railway company, after the [[KTM Komuter]] service. The line length is 755&nbsp;km ([[Padang Besar, Malaysia|Padang Besar]] – [[Gemas]]) and additional 197&nbsp;km from Gemas to [[Johor Bahru]] Sentral which is under construction.

Malaysia has [[List of airports in Malaysia|118 airports]], of which 38 are paved. The [[flag carrier|national airline]] is [[Malaysia Airlines]], providing international and domestic air services. Major international routes and domestic routes crossing between Peninsula Malaysia and East Malaysia are served by Malaysia Airlines, [[AirAsia]] and [[Malindo Air]] while smaller domestic routes are supplemented by smaller airlines like [[MASwings]], [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]] and [[Berjaya Air]]. Major cargo airlines include [[MASkargo]] and [[Transmile Air Services]]. Kuala Lumpur International Airport is the main and busiest airport of Malaysia. In 2014, it was the world's [[List of the world's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|13th busiest airport by international passenger traffic]], recording over 25.4&nbsp;million international passenger traffic. It was also the world's [[List of the world's busiest airports by passenger traffic|20th busiest airport by passenger traffic]], recording over 48.9&nbsp;million passengers. Other major airports include [[Kota Kinabalu International Airport]], which is also Malaysia's second busiest airport and busiest airport in East Malaysia with over 6.9&nbsp;million passengers in 2013, and [[Penang International Airport]], which serves Malaysia's second largest urban area, with over 5.4&nbsp;million passengers in 2013.

Malaysia has a multi-ethnic, multicultural, and multilingual society. The original culture of the area stemmed from indigenous tribes that inhabited it, along with the [[Malay people|Malays]] who later moved there. Substantial influence exists from [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] and [[Indian Culture|Indian]] culture, dating back to when foreign trade began. Other cultural influences include the [[Persian culture|Persian]], [[Arabic culture|Arabic]], and [[British culture|British]] cultures. Due to the structure of the government, coupled with the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] theory, there has been minimal [[cultural assimilation]] of ethnic minorities.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |author=Raghavan, R.|title=Ethno-racial marginality in West Malaysia: The case of the Peranakan Hindu Melaka or Malaccan Chitty community |volume=133 |issue= 4 |pages=438–458 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41018027|doi=10.1163/22134379-90002605  |year=1977 |access-date=7 October 2010|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In 1971, the government created a "National Cultural Policy", defining Malaysian culture.

Some cultural disputes exist between Malaysia and neighbouring countries, notably [[Indonesia]]. The two countries have a similar cultural heritage, sharing many traditions and items.
