The '''Bangladesh Army''' ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশ সেনাবাহিনী}}, ''Bangladesh Senabahini'') is the [[land warfare]] branch, and the largest of the three [[Armed Services|armed services]] of [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]]. The primary mission of the Army is to provide necessary forces and capabilities to deliver the Bangladeshi government's security and defence strategies, and most notably, defending the nation's territorial integrity against external attack. Control of personnel and operations is administered by the Department of the Army, [[Armed Forces Division]].<ref name="auto">{{cite news|last1=Ashraf|first1=Ahmed|script-title=bn:বাংলাদেশ সেনাবাহিনীতে যোগ দেয়ার আগে যে বিষয়গুলো জানতে হবে |trans-title=Things to know before joining the Bangladesh Army |url=http://bangla.newspaper1971.com/2016/05/06/bangladesh-army/|access-date=6 May 2016|work=Newspaper1971 Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506215758/http://bangla.newspaper1971.com/2016/05/06/bangladesh-army/|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In addition to its primary mission the Bangladesh Army is also constitutionally obligated to assist the government and its civilian agencies during times of domestic national emergency. This additional role is commonly referred to as "aid to civil administration".

=== Early history ===
The martial tradition of Bengal has its roots in the army of Kings and their chiefs who were called Senapati or Mahasenapati. Armies were composed of infantry, cavalry, war elephants and war boats. The arrival of Muslims and the establishment of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] further strengthened the military. The sultanate had well organised disciplined armies. During [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule Cannons and artillery were introduced to Bengal.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military|title=Military|last1=Uddin Khan|first1=Saleh|last2=Waheduzzaman|first2=Syed|website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923051005/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military|archive-date=23 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> During the Colonial Rule of the British, Bengal was principally a bulwark of British power and trade in the South Asian region. The British under [[Robert Clive]] defeated a 50,000 strong Bengal Army of Nawab Siraj-ud-daullah in the [[Battle of Plassey|Palashi(Plassey)]] in 1757 and later the forces of Nawab [[Mir Qasim]] at the [[Battle of Buxar]] in 1764. The [[Bengal Army|Army of Bengal]] was formed, which later became part of a united [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] from 1895 to 1947. The eastern part of the British India was a prominent place for military and police recruitment, with entire horse-mounted cavalry and lancer units being recruited there prior to the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Bengal Sepoy Mutiny]] of 1857.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/1857-war-and-the-unsung-heroes-of-bengal/article5466809.ece|title=1857 War and the unsung heroes of Bengal|last=Ganesan|first=V.

In 1916, the British Government created Bengali Double Company. The soldiers were trained in Karachi and shipped to the Bagdad. They fought in the war and after the war helped crush a rebellion by Kurds in 1919.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangali_Paltan|title=Bangali Paltan |website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208122400/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangali_Paltan|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the Second World War, British Armed Forces Eastern Command created an auxiliary force who were part engineers and part infantry named as Indian Pioneer Corps. Most of the soldiers were recruited from both West and [[East Bengal]]. This force assisted the main war effort by building roads, airfields, fortifications and, when needed, fought the Japanese in an infantry role. These force was organised in company groups attached to various regiments of Indian Army in direct support role. Captain [[Abdul Gani (soldier)|Abdul Gani]] was a Company Commander in the Burma front and led his troops in battle. After the war these Pioneer Troops were concentrated in Jalna, India, waiting to be demobilised and return home. In 1946 Captain Ghani the then Adjutant and Quartermaster of Indian Pioneer Corps Centre at Jalna envisioned and generated the idea of forming an Infantry regiment out of the Pioneer soldiers from East Bengal who would be returning home demobilised, to the Centre Commander. After receiving permission from the Chief of Staff of Pakistan Army General Sir [[Frank Messervy]], he organised his men to form the nucleus of an Infantry Regiment, the [[Bangali Paltan]] (Platoon).<ref name=":0" />

===Pakistan period===
At the time of the creation of Pakistan Ghani got the approval of the then newly appointed Commander in Chief to Pakistan Army General Messervey to form the East Bengal Regiment composed solely of youths from East Bengal, would be East Pakistan. On 17 August 1947 General Messervey while bidding farewell to the Pioneer Corps soldiers from Bombay the General endorsed the views of Captain Ghani and said' you will prove to the world that Bengali soldiers are equally competent as other nations of the world.' With these inspiring words Captain Ghani moved to Dhaka in September 1947 with two Pioneer Companies and was temporarily located in Pilkhana now the Headquarters of Border Guards Bangladesh. He was later told by the administration to find a suitable place to accommodate the soldiers. He moved to the north of the Capital and found Kurmitola as the perfect place for a cantonment. Toiling day in and day out the barracks were constructed and jungles cleared, parade ground prepared.<ref name=":0" />

On 15 February 1948 the flag of First East Bengal Regiment the pioneer of Bangladesh Army was raised with Captain Ghani on the lead of all the affairs though the first commanding officer was British Lt Col V J E Patterson.<ref name=":0" /> and Major Abdul Waheed Choudhury <ref>https://factsndates.blogspot.com/2013/09/british-indian-army-and-former-pakistan.html</ref> a Bengali Officer from Pakistan Army Headquarters, Rawalpindi  was designated as the  [[Officer commanding|Officer Commanding]] of the East Bengal Regiment, East Bengal Regiment. After the raising of the first battalion the second battalion was approved Captain Gani began to recruit the personnel for the regiment. On 7 February 1949 the flag of the Second East Bengal was raised with the newly recruited soldiers and from personnel from First East Bengal. Before the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, a total of 8 battalions of the East Bengal Regiment were formed.<ref name=":0" />

===Liberation war 1971===
{{further|Bangladesh Liberation War}}

In 1970 [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] lead [[Bangladesh Awami League]] to win the General Elections of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army which was then in power refused to handover power and unrest broke out. On 25 March 1971 [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] cracked down on the civilian population of East Pakistan through the start of [[Operation Searchlight]]<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The |website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201163536/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Proclamation_of_Independence|title=Proclamation of Independence |website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213011405/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Proclamation_of_Independence|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Pakistan Army and allied paramilitaries killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and uniformed personnel. As a result, in March 1971, Bengali soldiers in East Pakistan revolted and the Bangladesh Liberation War started. There was a Bangladesh Army Sector Commanders Conference during 11–17 July 1971. The conference was held three months after the oath of the newly formed Bangladesh Government at [[Meherpur District|Meherpur]], Kushtia. During this conference the structure and formation as well as resolving issues surrounding the organisation of the various sectors, strategy and reinforcements of the Bangladeshi forces was determined. It was of considerable historical importance from a tactical point of view, as it determined the command structure of the Bangladeshi forces throughout [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

This conference was presided over by the Bangladesh interim government in exile, headed by then Prime Minister [[Tajuddin Ahmed]] and Colonel (Retd.) [[M. A. G. Osmani]] was made the chairman of the ''Joint Chiefs of Staff'' of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. M. A. G. Osmani was reinstated into active duty from his retirement. Principal participants of this conference included: Squadron Leader [[M. Hamidullah Khan]], Major [[Ziaur Rahman]], Major [[Mohammad Abdul Jalil|Abdul Jalil]], Captain [[ATM Haider]], Lt. Col. [[MA Rab]] and Major [[Khaled Mosharraf]].
As a result of this meeting, Bangladesh was divided into [[List of sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sectors]].<ref name=":0" /> These sectors were placed under the control of Sector Commanders, who would direct the guerilla war against [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani occupation forces]]. For better efficiency in military operations each of the sectors were also divided into a number of sub-sectors. As a point of note, the 10th Sector was under direct command of the Commander-in-Chief and included the Naval Commando Unit as a C-in-C's special force.<ref name=":0" />

Following the conference a period of prolonged guerrilla warfare was launched by [[Bangladesh Forces]], which continued for a number of months. A further restructuring was undertaken and the Bangladesh Forces were organised into three brigade size combat groups:<ref name=":0" />
* ''K Force'', under Major [[Khaled Mosharraf]], was created with 4th, 9th and 10th [[East Bengal Regiment]].
* ''S Force'', under Major [[K M Shafiullah]], was created with 2nd and 11th [[East Bengal Regiment]].
* ''Z Force'', under Major [[Ziaur Rahman]], was created with 1st, 3rd and 8th [[East Bengal Regiment]].

=== Post 1971: The emergence of the Bangladesh Army ===
During the sensitive and formative years after the end of the war, personnel of the [[Mukti Bahini]] were absorbed into different branches of Bangladesh Army. In 1974 Bangladeshi soldiers and officers repatriated from Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation war were absorbed into Bangladesh Army.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzhuAAAAMAAJ&q=mukti+bahini+absorbed+in+Bangladesh+army|title=Evolution of national strategy of India|last=Nanda|first=Ravi|date=1987-12-01|publisher=Lancers Books|isbn=9788170950004|location=|pages=67|language=en}}</ref>

During the 1972-73 tenure, engineers, signals, army services, ordnance, military police, remount veterinary and farm and medical corps was established in Bangladesh Army. Bangladesh military academy was established in Cumilla cantonment in 1974. On 11 January 1975, the passing out parade of the first Bangladesh Army short course took place. In 1975 the [[President Guard Regiment|President Guard Regiment (PGR)]] was established.

There were suspicion among the army personnel of the formation of the paramilitary [[Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini|Jatiya Rakhi Bahini]] and the addition of civilian Mukti Bahini members in it.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj-gDQAAQBAJ&q=mukti+bahini+absorbed+in+Bangladesh+army&pg=PA51|title=India Bangladesh Domestic Politics: The River Ganges Water Issues|last=Pandey|first=Punam|date=2016-11-26|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789811023712|location=|pages=51|language=en}}</ref> These suspicions and misconceptions laid the foundation and formed the bedrock of disputes between professional army officers and the ruling administration which led to a very bloody chapter in the history of newly independent Bangladesh.

=== Coups, uprisings and assassinations ===
{{further|Military coups in Bangladesh}}

On [[15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|15 August 1975]] a few sacked army officers, disgruntled junior officers and NCOs secretly planned and assassinated President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his entire family at his personal residence in Dhanmondi, Dhaka, except for his two daughters ([[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Sheikh Rehana]]) who were abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur|title=Rahman, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur |website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213024229/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Rahman,_Bangabandhu_Sheikh_Mujibur|archive-date=13 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Five of those responsible officers were executed in January 2010 while others are still absconding and are outside Bangladesh.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-123827|title=5 Bangabandhu killers hanged|date=2010-01-28|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216081400/http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-123827|archive-date=16 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman a new government, led by [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad|Khandkar Mushtaq Ahmed]] and supported by the coup plotters, was set in place.

Three months later on [[3 November 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état|3 November 1975]], several senior officers and NCO's led by Maj. Gen. [[Khaled Mosharraf]] and Colonel [[Shafaat Jamil]] led their own forces to remove Khandakar Mushtaq's government from power whom they believed was an unlawful government in the first place. That same day the same group of disgruntled army personnel who assassinated Sheikh Mujib and had jailed politicians involved with the [[Bangladesh Liberation war]], assassinated [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], [[Tajuddin Ahmed]], [[Muhammad Mansur Ali]] and [[AHM Qamaruzzaman]] in Dhaka Central Jail.

On 7 November 1975, a short but highly organised uprising concentrated only in Dhaka, formed by members of the [[Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal]] (National Socialist Party) and members of enlisted personnel led by Lt. Col. (Retd.) [[Abu Taher]] also resulted in the killing of several army and air force officers and soldiers including Major General [[Khaled Mosharraf]], Major [[ATM Haider]]. Colonel [[Shafaat Jamil]] was arrested and forcibly retired. Colonel Abu Taher released Major General Ziaur Rahman who was imprisoned by Khaled Mosharraf. Ziaur Rahman took promotion to Lieutenant General and appointed himself as the Chief of Army Staff and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. He then executed Lt. Col.

=== Chattogram Hill Tracts Conflict ===

{{Main|Chittagong Hill Tracts Conflict}}
The Chattogram Hill Tracts Conflict was the political  and military conflict between the Government of Bangladesh and the [[Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samiti]] (United People's Party of the Chattogram Hill Tracts) and its armed wing, the [[Shanti Bahini]] over the issue of autonomy and the rights of the tribes of the Chattogram Hill Tracts. The Shanti Bahini launched an insurgency against government forces in 1977, and the conflict continued for twenty years until the Bangladesh government and the PCJSS signed the [[Chattogram Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] in 1997.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Hill_Tracts_Peace_Accord,_1997|title=Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord, 1997 |website=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201183555/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chittagong_Hill_Tracts_Peace_Accord,_1997|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-President of Bangladesh Major General Ziaur Rahman created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust among the local tribes against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of tribal people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] by the then Pakistan government in 1962. Displaced tribesmen did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many tribesmen and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bangalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unpo.org/article/19900|title=UNPO: Chittagong Hill Tracts: Local Human Rights Group Releases Report on Worrying Situation in Bangladesh|website=unpo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208231404/http://unpo.org/article/19900|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/cht-struggle-for-peace-1013|title=CHT- Struggle for peace|date=2013-12-02|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174938/http://www.thedailystar.net/cht-struggle-for-peace-1013|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Peace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]] [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] and her [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]].<ref name="CV3">{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] of the [[Awami League]].<ref name="CV3"/> The [[Chattogram Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.<ref>[http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205108/http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php |date=8 July 2008 }}</ref>

Following the 1975 coup, additional personnel were absorbed into the regular army when the martial law government abolished the [[Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini]]. Under Zia's rule, Bangladesh was divided into five military regions. When Ershad assumed power in 1982, army strength had stabilised at about 70,000 troops. Starting in 1985, the army had experienced another spurt in growth. As of mid-1988, it had about 90,000 troops (although some observers believed the number was closer to 80,000), triple the 1975 figure.<ref name=cs>Douglas C. Makeig. "Army".

Bangladesh Armed Forces participated in the Gulf war in 1991 [[Operation Desert Storm]] alongside other multinational forces under Allied Command. The Bangladesh Army brought in a contingent of Engineers and undertook the task of clearing mines and bombs in Kuwait. This assistance took place under the operational code name "Operation Kuwait Punargathan (OKP)" in English "Operation Rebuilding Kuwait (ORK)".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/42847 |title=Bangladesh-Kuwait joint effort to fight terrorism |work=The Independent |location=Dhaka |access-date=2017-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208235857/http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/42847 |archive-date=8 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Bangladesh Army structure is similar to the armies of the [[Commonwealth Nations]]. However, major changes have taken place following the adoption of US Army tactical planning procedures, training management techniques and [[noncommissioned officer]] educational systems.

{{Main|Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force}}

The Bangladesh Army has been actively involved in a number of United Nations Peace Support Operations (UNPSO) since its formation in the 1970s. Its first deployments came in 1988, when it participated in two operations – UNIIMOG in Iraq and UNTAG in Namibia<ref name=Momen>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/bangladesh&theworld/bd_world18.htm |title=Bangladesh-UN Partnership |last1=Momen |first1=Nurul |date=2006 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=2 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813092611/http://thedailystar.net/suppliments/2006/15thanniv/bangladesh%26theworld/bd_world18.htm |archive-date=13 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad|President HM Ershad]] initiated these deployments for the first time, starting with the contribution to UNIIMOG in [[Iraq]].

Later, as part of the UNIKOM force deployed to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia following the [[Gulf War]] the Bangladesh Army sent a mechanised infantry battalion (approx. 2,193 personnel). Since then, the Bangladesh Army has been involved in up to thirty different UNPKOs in as many as twenty five countries.<ref name=Momen/> This has included activities in [[Angola]], Namibia, [[Cambodia]], Somalia, [[Sudan]], Eritrea, [[Uganda]], Rwanda, [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], Mozambique, former [[Yugoslavia]], Liberia, [[Haiti]], Tajikistan, [[Western Sahara]], Sierra Leone, [[Kosovo]], Georgia, East Timor, [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Côte d'Ivoire and [[Ethiopia]].

As a result of its contributions to various UN peacekeeping operations, up to 88 Bangladesh soldiers have lost their lives (as of February 2009).<ref name=Momen/> However, the performance of Bangladesh's contingents has been described as being of the "highest order" and the appointment of several senior Bangladesh military officers as the Commander of UN peacekeeping missions and Senior Military Liaison Officers, may be seen as further recognition of the Bangladesh Army's growing esteem in the peacekeeping community.<ref name=Momen/> In January 2004, [[BBC]] described the Bangladeshi UN Force as "Cream of UN Peacekeepers".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3763640.stm | work=BBC News | first=Roland | last=Buerk | title=The cream of UN peacekeepers | date=18 January 2006}}</ref>

Bangladesh Army has specialised its peacekeeping operation capabilities around the world through participation in numerous peacekeeping and nation building operations. It has created '''BIPSOT''' ([[Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support Operation Training]]) which specialises in the training of peacekeepers for employment in all types of UNPSO (UN Peace Support Operations). This institute fulfills the requirement of UNDPKO as per U.N. General Assembly resolution which outlines 'the necessity and responsibility of every nation to train their armed forces before any deployment.
