The series, a contemporary [[prequel]] to  [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', (based on [[Robert Bloch]]'s [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]]) depicts the lives of [[Norman Bates]] ([[Freddie Highmore]]) and his mother [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]] ([[Vera Farmiga]]) prior to the events portrayed in the film, albeit in a different fictional town (White Pine Bay, [[Oregon]], as opposed to Fairvale, [[California]]) and in a modern-day setting.<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|title=Review: 'Bates Motel' a twisty, moody modern prequel to 'Psycho'. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/18/entertainment/la-et-st-bates-motel-20130318 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=McNamara |first=Mary |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427060255/http://articles.latimes.com/2013/mar/18/entertainment/la-et-st-bates-motel-20130318 |archivedate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name="starpulse">{{cite web|title='Bates Motel': An Intriguing Contemporary Prequel To 'Psycho' |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alan_Danzis/2013/03/18/bates_motel_review_an_intriguing_conte |website=Starpulse |first=Alan |last=Danzis |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322072731/http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alan_Danzis/2013/03/18/bates_motel_review_an_intriguing_conte |archivedate=March 22, 2013}}</ref> However, the final season loosely adapts the plot of ''Psycho''.

Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero begins to distance himself from the Bates family after he suspects Norma is lying to him about her husband's death.

===Season 4===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 4)}}
The fourth season follows Norma as she becomes increasingly fearful of Norman, going to great lengths to find him the professional help he needs. This complicates their once unbreakable trust as Norman struggles to maintain his grip on reality. Meanwhile, Sheriff Romero once again finds himself drawn into Norma and Norman's lives.  He agrees to marry Norma because his insurance will enable her to place Norman in an expensive psychiatric hospital.

===Season 5===
{{Main|Bates Motel (season 5)}}
The fifth season begins two years after the death of Norma. Publicly happy and well-adjusted, Norman struggles at home, where his blackouts are increasing and "Mother" threatens to take him over completely.
