'''GLAAD''' is an American [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] [[media monitoring]] organization, founded as a protest against defamatory coverage of [[LGBT]] people. Its agenda has since extended to the entertainment industry and its portrayal of these groups. The movement is now known by its initials only, as its full name could be taken as excluding [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] issues.

==History==
Formed in [[New York City]] in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the ''[[New York Post]]''{{'}}s defamatory and sensationalized [[AIDS]] coverage, GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as [[homophobic]] reporting.  Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after-hours at the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].  The founding group included film scholar [[Vito Russo]]; Gregory Kolovakos, then on the staff of the NYS Arts Council and who later became the first executive director; Darryl Yates Rist; [[Allen Barnett (writer)|Allen Barnett]];<ref name="Barnett">{{cite web|title=Barnett, Allen (1955–1991)|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|accessdate=March 25, 2013|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/barnett_a.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015085839/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/barnett_a.html|archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref> [[Jewelle Gomez]], the organization's first treasurer; and film critic [[Marcia Pally]], who later served as acting Board chair. <ref>[https://archive.org/details/gaycommunitynews1432gayc/page/3/mode/1up ''Politics of Ego: GLAAD Saga Unravelled'', in Gay Community News, p.3 (March 1-7, 1987)]</ref> Some members of GLAAD went on to become the early members of [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 1987, after a meeting with GLAAD, ''[[The New York Times]]'' changed its editorial policy to use the word "gay" instead of harsher terms referring to homosexuality.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.claynewsnetwork.com/2009/03/26/glaad-for-clay-aiken/ |title=GLAAD for Clay Aiken |publisher=Claynewsnetwork.com |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528101434/http://claynewsnetwork.com/2009/03/26/glaad-for-clay-aiken/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 |url-status=live }}</ref> GLAAD advocated that the ''[[Associated Press]]'' and other television and print news sources follow. GLAAD's influence soon spread to [[Los Angeles]], where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way LGBT people were portrayed on screen.<ref>{{cite newspaper|date=2016-05-02|first=Tre'vell|last=Anderson|title=Here is why Hollywood also has an LGBT diversity issue|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-glaad-studio-lgbt-20160502-snap-htmlstory.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2020-06-13}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' has named GLAAD as one of Hollywood's most powerful entities,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amiannoying.com/%28S%28w3qmj555gowyo22cuk3dlbvf%29%29/collection.aspx?collection=366 |title=Entertainment Weekly's 101 Most Influential People (1992) |publisher=Amiannoying.com |date=1976-11-25 |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419070859/http://www.amiannoying.com/(S(43aaeuu0nzfzqv2q4zqrrz45))/collection.aspx?collection=366 |archive-date=2012-04-19 |url-status=live }}</ref> and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described GLAAD as "possibly one of the most successful organizations lobbying the media for inclusion".<ref>[[#MC04|Myers and Cress 2004]]: 200</ref>

Within the first five years of its founding in New York as the ''Gay and Lesbian Anti-Defamation League'' (soon after changed to "Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation" after legal pressure by the [[Anti-Defamation League]]), GLAAD chapters had been established in Los Angeles and other cities, with the LA chapter becoming particularly influential due to its proximity to the California entertainment industry. GLAAD/NY and GLAAD/LA would eventually vote to merge in 1994, with other city chapters joining soon afterward; however, the chapters continue to exist, with the ceremonies of the GLAAD Media Awards being divided each year into three ceremonies held in New York City, Los Angeles and [[San Francisco]].

Following the 2011 resignation of [[Jarrett Barrios]] from the GLAAD presidency, Mike Thompson served as interim president until the announcement of Herndon Graddick, previously GLAAD's Vice-President of Programs and Communications, to the presidency on April 15, 2012. Graddick is the younger son of [[Charles Graddick]] of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], a circuit court judge and the former [[Attorney General of Alabama]].

In 2013, [[Jennifer Finney Boylan]] was chosen as the first openly transgender co-chair of GLAAD's National Board of Directors.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reynolds |first=Daniel |url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/media/2013/11/08/glaad-appoints-first-transgender-cochair |title=GLAAD Appoints First Transgender Cochair |publisher=Advocate.com |date=2013-11-08 |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111083544/http://www.advocate.com/politics/media/2013/11/08/glaad-appoints-first-transgender-cochair |archive-date=2013-11-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Name change===
On March 24, 2013, GLAAD announced that it had formally dropped the "Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation" from their name and would now be known only as GLAAD to reflect their work more accurately; the name change was a commitment to incorporate [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people in their efforts to support the LGBT community in its entirety.<ref name="Peeples">{{cite news|first=Jase|last=Peeples|title=GLAAD Affirms Commitment To Trans and Bi People, Alters Name|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=March 24, 2013|accessdate=March 25, 2013|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/2013/03/24/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-and-bi-people-alters-name|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327032957/http://www.advocate.com/politics/2013/03/24/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-and-bi-people-alters-name|archive-date=March 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2016, Spirit Day is the world's largest and most-visible anti-bullying campaign.<ref name=":1" />

The campaign works to bring anti-bullying resources to classrooms all around the world by inspiring educators to take action against bullying through hosting events and rallies. The campaign also created a GLAAD's Spirit Day kit for use in classrooms, which is available in 6 languages.<ref name=":1" />

On social media, people are encouraged to wear purple or go purple online in order to stand united against bullying. Huge media companies such as NBC Universal and Viacom show support for Spirit Day on the airwaves. They even change their on-air logo to purple for the day. They also enlist talent who wear purple during the day's broadcast.<ref name=":1" />

More than 1.5 billion media impressions annually are seen in support of the campaign. The hashtag #Spirit Day has become a trending topic on Twitter and Facebook every year. On social media, people such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and President Barack Obama have shown their support for the campaign.<ref name=":1" />
