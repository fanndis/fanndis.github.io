In early February, Linette played for the first time as a member of [[Poland Fed Cup team]]. She defeated [[Anne Kremer]] in straight sets, but lost her three other matches.

In May, she made her first appearance in a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament, playing in the qualifying rounds.

===2012===
Starting the season with several early exits, Magda Linette reached her first singles final in over 18 months at the $10k event of Florence in May but lost to [[Anaïs Laurendon]].

===2020: Thailand Open title and top 40===
In February, Linette won the [[2020 Thailand Open|Thailand Open]], rising to a career-high ranking of No. 33.

==Playing style==
Linette is a defensive player, whose game is played primarily from the baseline, and who can be described as a [[counterpuncher]]. Her strengths on court are her speed, footwork, court coverage, and anticipation. Her strongest groundstroke is her two-handed backhand, which is hit flat and with depth, and which is responsible for many of the winners she accumulates on court. Her forehand is also strong, and is hit with topspin, making it a safe and reliable shot. Due to her doubles experience, Linette has solid volleying skills, and will choose to finish points off at the net. She is capable of introducing drop shots and sliced backhands into points, constantly breaking up an opponent's rhythm, and to attempt to draw unforced errors out of aggressive players. Her serve is not particularly strong, with her first serve averaging 95 mph (153 km/h) and her second serve averaging 80 mph (130 km/h), but is reliable, meaning that, whilst she does not ace frequently, double faults are also uncommon. She is a strong player on return, also, effectively neutralising strong first serves with a backhand down-the-line or a cross-court forehand. Linette's increased success in recent years has come as a result of her altering her game style away from being a grinding counterpuncher, to actively creating opportunities to hit winners on the court.

'''Notes'''
*<sup>1</sup> <small>The first [[WTA Premier tournaments|Premier 5]] event of the year has switched back and forth between the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]] and the [[Qatar Ladies Open|Qatar Open]] since 2009. Dubai was classified as a Premier 5 event from 2009–2011 before being succeeded by Doha for the 2012–2014 period. In 2015, Dubai regained its Premier 5 status while Doha was demoted to Premier status. The two tournaments have since alternated status every year.</small>
*<sup>2</sup> <small>In 2014, the [[Pan Pacific Open]] was downgraded to a Premier event and replaced by the [[Wuhan Open]].</small>
* <sup>3</sup> <small>2009: WTA Ranking–1008, 2010: WTA Ranking–194.</small>
