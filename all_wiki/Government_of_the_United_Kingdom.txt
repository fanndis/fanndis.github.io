{{Politics of the United Kingdom}}

The '''Government of the United Kingdom''', formally and commonly referred to as '''Her Majesty's Government''',{{efn|group=note|name=a|Also referred to as the '''British Government''' or the '''UK Government'''}} is the [[central government]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/government-and-opposition1/her-majestys-government/ Her Majesty's Government] Retrieved 28 June 2010</ref><ref name="direct1">[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073438 Overview of the UK system of government : Directgov – Government, citizens and rights].

[[Minister of the Crown|Ministers of the Crown]] are [[responsible government|responsible]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House]] in which they sit; they make statements in that House and take questions from members of that House. For most senior ministers this is usually the elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] rather than the [[House of Lords]]. The government is [[Fusion of powers|dependent on Parliament]] to make [[primary legislation]],<ref>{{Cite web |year=2013 |title=Legislation |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/legislation/ |access-date=27 January 2013 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref> and since the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-terms Parliaments Act 2011]], [[Elections in the United Kingdom#General elections|general elections]] are held every five years to elect a new House of Commons, unless there is a successful [[vote of no confidence]] in the government or a [[Supermajority#United Kingdom|two-thirds vote]] for a [[snap election]] (as was the case in [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]]) in the House of Commons, in which case an election may be held sooner. After an election, the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarch]] (currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) selects as prime minister the leader of the party most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons, usually by possessing a majority of MPs.<ref name="parliament1">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmjust/396/396we02.htm House of Commons – Justice Committee – Written Evidence].

Under the [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]], [[Executive (government)|executive authority]] lies with the monarch, although this authority is exercised only by, or on the advice of, the prime minister and the cabinet.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governmentcitizensandrights/UKgovernment/Centralgovernmentandthemonarchy/DG_073442 The monarchy : Directgov – Government, citizens and rights]. Archived direct.gov.uk webpage. Retrieved on 29 August 2014.</ref> The Cabinet members advise the monarch as members of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. In most cases they also exercise power directly as leaders of the [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]], though some Cabinet positions are [[sinecure]]s to a greater or lesser degree (for instance [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] or [[Lord Privy Seal]]).

The government is occasionally referred to with the [[metonym]] Westminster, due to that being where many of the offices of the government are situated, especially by members in the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] in order to differentiate it from their own.

==History==
The United Kingdom is a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the reigning monarch (that is, the king or queen who is the head of state at any given time) does not make any open political decisions. All political decisions are taken by the government and Parliament. This constitutional state of affairs is the result of a long history of constraining and reducing the political power of the monarch, beginning with [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.

Since the start of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]'s reign in 1901, the prime minister has always been an elected member of Parliament (MP) and therefore directly accountable to the House of Commons. A similar convention applies to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellor of the exchequer]]. It would likely be politically unacceptable for the budget speech to be given in the Lords, with MPs unable to directly question the Chancellor, especially now that the Lords have very limited powers about money bills. The last chancellor of the exchequer to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman|Lord Denman]], who served as interim chancellor of the exchequer for one month in 1834.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ The Parliament Acts – UK Parliament].

==Her Majesty's Government and the Crown==
{{Main|Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom}}
The [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]], currently [[Elizabeth II]], is the [[head of state]] and the [[sovereign]], but not the [[head of government]]. The monarch takes little direct part in governing the country and remains neutral in political affairs. However, the authority of the state that is vested in the sovereign, known as [[the Crown]], remains as the source of executive power exercised by the government.

In addition to [[Act of Parliament|explicit statutory authority]], the Crown also possesses a body of powers in certain matters collectively known as the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]]. These powers range from the authority to issue or withdraw passports to declarations of war. By long-standing convention, most of these powers are delegated from the sovereign to various ministers or other officers of the Crown, who may use them without having to obtain the consent of Parliament.

The prime minister also has weekly meetings with the monarch, who "has a right and a duty to express her views on Government matters...These meetings, as with all communications between The Queen and her Government, remain strictly confidential. Having expressed her views, The Queen abides by the advice of her ministers."<ref>{{Cite web |year=2013 |title=Queen and Prime Minister |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414023100/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandPrimeMinister.aspx |archive-date=14 April 2010 |access-date=27 January 2013 |publisher=The British Monarchy}}</ref>

Royal prerogative powers include, but are not limited to, the following:

===Domestic powers===
* The power to appoint (and in theory, dismiss) a [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]. This power is exercised by the monarch themself. By convention they appoint (and are expected to appoint) the individual most likely to be capable of commanding the confidence of a majority in the House of Commons.
* The power to appoint and dismiss other [[Minister of the Crown|ministers]]. This power is exercised by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.
* The power to assent to and enact laws by giving [[royal assent]] to [[Bill (law)|bills]] passed Parliament, which is required in order for a law to become effective (an [[Act (document)|act]]). This is exercised by the monarch, who also theoretically has the power to refuse assent, although no monarch has refused assent to a bill passed by Parliament since [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1708.
* The power to give and to issue commissions to [[commissioned officer]]s in the [[British Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].
* The power to command the Armed Forces. This power is exercised by the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]] in the Queen's name.
* The power to appoint members to [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].
* The power to issue, to suspend, cancel, recall, impound, withdraw or revoke British passports and the general power to provide or deny British passport facilities to British citizens and British nationals. This is exercised in the United Kingdom (but not necessarily in the [[Isle of Man]], [[Channel Islands]] or [[British Overseas Territories]]) by the [[Home Secretary]].
* The power to pardon any conviction (the [[royal prerogative of mercy]]).
* The power to grant, cancel and annul any [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]].
* The power to create corporations (including the status of being a city, with its own corporation) by [[Royal Charter|royal charter]], and to amend, replace and revoke existing charters.

===Foreign powers===
* The power to make and ratify [[Treaty|treaties]].
* The power to [[Declaration of war by the United Kingdom|declare war]] and [[Peace treaty|conclude peace]] with other nations.
* The power to deploy the Armed Forces overseas.
* The power to [[Diplomatic recognition|recognise states]].
* The power to credit and receive diplomats.

Even though the United Kingdom has no single constitutional document, the government published the above list in October 2003 to increase transparency, as some of the powers exercised in the name of the monarch are part of the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/21/uk.freedomofinformation Mystery lifted on Queen's powers | Politics]. The Guardian. Retrieved on 12 October 2011.</ref> However, the complete extent of the royal prerogative powers has never been fully set out, as many of them originated in ancient custom and the period of [[absolute monarchy]], or were modified by later constitutional practice.

Cabinet Office 2009</ref> and their [[Executive agency|executive agencies]]. There are also an additional 20 [[British government departments#Non-ministerial departments|non-ministerial departments]] with a range of further responsibilities.

In theory a government minister does not have to be a member of either House of Parliament. In practice, however, convention is that ministers must be members of either the House of Commons or House of Lords in order to be accountable to Parliament. From time to time, prime ministers appoint non-parliamentarians as ministers. In recent years such ministers have been appointed to the House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Maer |first=Lucinda |date=2017-09-04 |title=Ministers in the House of Lords |url=https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05226}}</ref>

==Government in Parliament==
Under the British system, the government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. It requires the support of the House of Commons for the maintenance of [[Loss of supply|supply]] (by voting through the government's budgets) and to pass [[primary legislation]]. By convention, if a government [[Motion of no confidence|loses the confidence]] of the House of Commons it must either resign or a general election is held. The support of the Lords, while useful to the government in getting its legislation passed without delay, is not vital. A government is not required to resign even if it loses the confidence of the Lords and is defeated in key votes in that House. The House of Commons is thus the [[responsible house]].

The prime minister is held to account during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] (PMQs) which provides an opportunity for MPs from all parties to question the PM on any subject. There are also departmental questions when ministers answer questions relating to their specific departmental brief. Unlike PMQs both the cabinet ministers for the department and junior ministers within the department may answer on behalf of the government, depending on the topic of the question.

During debates on legislation proposed by the government, ministers—usually with departmental responsibility for the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]—will lead the debate for the government and respond to points made by MPs or Lords.

Committees<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/committees/ Committees – UK Parliament]. Parliament.uk (21 April 2010). Retrieved on 12 October 2011.</ref> of both the House of Commons and House of Lords hold the government to account, scrutinise its work and examine in detail proposals for legislation. Ministers appear before committees to give evidence and answer questions.

Government ministers are also required by convention and the [[Ministerial Code (United Kingdom)|Ministerial Code]],<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125173150/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/409215/ministerialcodemay2010.pdf Ministerial Code]. Cabinet Office 2010</ref> when Parliament is sitting, to make major statements regarding government policy or issues of national importance to Parliament. This allows MPs or Lords to question the government on the statement. When the government instead chooses to make announcements first outside Parliament, it is often the subject of significant criticism from MPs and the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker of the House of Commons]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Speakers' statements on ministerial policy announcements made outside the House |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05647.pdf |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716034414/http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-05647.pdf |archive-date=16 July 2011 |access-date=2010-11-29 |df=dmy-all}}.

==Location==
[[File:Larry the cat outside 10 Downing St.jpg|alt=|thumb|Main entrance of [[10 Downing Street]], the residence and offices of the First Lord of HM Treasury]]
The prime minister is based at [[10 Downing Street]] in [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], London. Cabinet meetings also take place here. Most [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]] have their headquarters nearby in [[Whitehall]].

==Devolved governments==
{{Main|Devolution in the United Kingdom}}
Since 1999, certain areas of central government have been devolved to accountable governments in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. These are not part of Her Majesty's Government, and are directly accountable to their own institutions, with their own authority under the Crown; in contrast, there is no devolved government in England.

==Local government==
[[File:Old Fire Station Oxford 1.jpg|thumb|right|Refurbishment notice at Old Fire Station, [[Oxford]], showing HM Government support.]]
{{Main|Local government in England|Local government in Scotland|Local government in Wales|Local government in Northern Ireland}}

Up to three layers of elected local authorities (such as county, district and [[Parish councils in England|parish Councils]]) exist throughout all parts of the United Kingdom, in some places merged into [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. They have limited local tax-raising powers. Many other authorities and agencies also have statutory powers, generally subject to some central government supervision.

== Limits of government power ==
{{see also|Act of Parliament (UK)}}
The government's powers include general executive and statutory powers, [[delegated legislation]], and numerous powers of appointment and patronage. However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, [[local authorities]], and the charity commissions) are legally more or less independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under [[Common Law|common law]] or granted and limited by act of Parliament, and are subject to [[European Union law]] and the [[Politics of the European Union#Competencies|competencies]] that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the courts by [[judicial review]].

Nevertheless, magistrates and mayors can still be arrested for and put on trial for corruption, and the government has powers to insert commissioners into a local authority to oversee its work, and to issue directives that must be obeyed by the local authority, if the local authority is not abiding by its statutory obligations.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 December 2014 |title=Secretary of State sends in commissioners to Tower Hamlets |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/secretary-of-state-sends-in-commissioners-to-tower-hamlets |access-date=10 April 2015 |website=[[Gov.uk]]}}</ref>

By contrast, as in [[European Union]] (EU) member states, EU officials cannot be prosecuted for any actions carried out in pursuit of their official duties, and foreign country diplomats (though not their employees) and foreign [[members of the European Parliament]]<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 2014 |title=The Immunity of Members of the European Parliament |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2014/509981/IPOL_IDA%282014%29509981_EN.pdf |access-date=10 April 2015 |publisher=[[European Union]]}}</ref> are immune from prosecution in the UK under any circumstance. As a consequence, neither EU bodies nor diplomats have to pay taxes, since it would not be possible to prosecute them for tax evasion. This caused a dispute in recent years when the US ambassador to the UK claimed that London's [[congestion charge]] was a tax, and not a charge (despite the name), and therefore he did not have to pay it – a claim the [[Greater London Authority]] disputed.

Similarly, the monarch is totally immune from criminal prosecution and may only be sued with her permission (this is known as [[sovereign immunity]]). The monarch, by law, is not required to pay income tax, but [[Queen Elizabeth II]] has voluntarily paid it since 1993, and also pays local rates voluntarily. However, the monarchy also receives a substantial grant from the government, the [[Sovereign Support Grant]], and Queen Elizabeth II's inheritance from her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], was exempt from [[inheritance tax]].

In addition to legislative powers, HM Government has substantial influence over local authorities and other bodies set up by it, by financial powers and grants. Many functions carried out by local authorities, such as paying out housing benefit and council tax benefit, are funded or substantially part-funded by central government.

Neither the central government nor local authorities are permitted to sue anyone for [[defamation]]. Individual politicians are allowed to sue people for defamation in a personal capacity and without using government funds, but this is relatively rare (although [[George Galloway]], who was a [[backbench]] MP for a quarter of a century, has sued or threatened to sue for defamation a number of times). However, it is a criminal offence to make a false statement about any election candidate during an election, with the purpose of reducing the number of votes they receive (as with libel, opinions do not count).
