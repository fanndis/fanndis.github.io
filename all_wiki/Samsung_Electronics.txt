==History==
===1969–1987: Early years===
Samsung Electric Industries was established as an industrial part of [[Samsung]] Group in 19 January<!-- Do not change to 1938, Samsung was founded in 1938 but Samsung Electronics was not founded until 1969 as the reference states -->69 in [[Suwon]], South Korea.<ref name="Samsung">{{Cite web |title=History – Corporate Profile – About Samsung – Samsung |url=http://www.thegadgetbase.com/2014/10/samsung.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302044719/http://www.thegadgetbase.com/2014/10/samsung.html |archive-date=2 March 2018 |access-date=10 July 2011}}</ref> At the time, Samsung Group was known to the South Korean public as a trading company specialized in fertilizers and sweeteners. Despite the lack of technology and resources, fallen short even than the domestic competitors, Samsung Group improved its footing in the manufacturing industry by cooperating with the Japanese companies, a decision that instigated a significant amount of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese]] public outcry and huge backlashes from the competitors fearing the outright subordination of the industry by the Japanese. The strategy was able to take off only after the government and Samsung declared that the company would exclusively focus on exports. [[Toshio Iue]], the founder of [[Sanyo]], played a role as an advisor to [[Lee Byung-chul]], Samsung's founder, who was a novice in the electronics business. December the same year, Samsung Electric established a [[joint venture]] named Samsung-Sanyo Electric with [[Sanyo]] and [[Sumitomo Corporation]]. This is the direct predecessor of today's Samsung Electronics.<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 April 2008 |title=삼성전자의 태동, 외국기술과의 합작 |url=http://www.etnews.com/200804270009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104130001/http://www.etnews.com/200804270009 |archive-date=4 November 2018 |access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref>

The joint venture's early products were electronic and electrical appliances including televisions, [[calculator]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, air conditioners and washing machines. In 1970, Samsung established the joint venture Samsung-NEC with Japan's [[NEC|NEC Corporation]] and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] to manufacture [[home appliances]] and [[Professional audiovisual industry|audiovisual devices]]. Samsung-NEC later became Samsung SDI, the group's display and battery business unit. In 1973, Samsung and Sanyo created Samsung-Sanyo Parts, the predecessor of [[Samsung Electro-Mechanics]]. By 1981, Samsung Electric had manufactured over 10 million [[Black and white television|black-and-white televisions]].

In 1974, Samsung Group expanded into the [[semiconductor]] business by acquiring Korea Semiconductor, who was on the verge of bankruptcy whilst building one of the first chip-making facilities in the country at the time. Soon after, Korea Telecommunications, an electronic switching system producer and a Samsung Group company, took over the semiconductor business and became Samsung Semiconductor & Communications.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 April 2012 |title=삼성 반도체사업 40년, 도전과 창조의 역사 |url=https://www.samsungsemiconstory.com/20 |access-date=10 June 2020 |website=삼성반도체이야기 |language=ko}}</ref>

In February 1983, Lee, along with the board of the Samsung industry and corporation agreement and help by sponsoring the event, made an announcement later dubbed the "Tokyo declaration", in which he declared that Samsung intended to become a [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) vendor. One year later, Samsung announced that it successfully developed a 64 [[Kilobit|kb]] DRAM, reducing the technological gap between the companies from [[First World|first-world]] countries and the young electronics maker from more than a decade to approximately four years. In the process, Samsung used technologies imported from [[Micron Technology]] of U.S for the development of DRAM and [[Sharp Corporation]] of Japan for its [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] and [[Read-only memory|ROM]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Korean system of innovation and the semiconductor industry:a governance perspective |url=http://www.oecd.org/korea/2098646.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517111730/http://www.oecd.org/korea/2098646.pdf |archive-date=17 May 2018 |access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref> In 1988, Samsung Electric Industries merged with Samsung Semiconductor & Communications to form Samsung Electronics,<ref>{{Cite web |title=연혁 {{!}} 회사소개 {{!}} Samsung 대한민국 |url=http://www.samsung.com/sec/aboutsamsung/company/history/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422202318/http://www.samsung.com/sec/aboutsamsung/company/history/ |archive-date=22 April 2018 |access-date=22 April 2018 |website=Samsung sec |language=ko}}</ref> as before that, they had not been one company and had not been a leading corporation together, but they were not rivals, as they had been in talks for a time, until they finally merged.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, Samsung sold personal computers under the Leading Technology brand. However, the equipment was manufactured by Samsung, and the FCC filings from this period typically refer to Samsung products.<ref>https://fccid.io/A3LCEA455</ref>

===1988–1995: Consumer struggles===
In 1988, Samsung Electronics launched its first mobile phone in the South Korean market.<ref name="Michell1">{{Cite book |last=Michell |first=Tony |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgZim29J3awC&q=Samsung+Electronics%3A+And+the+Struggle+For+Leadership+of+the+Electronics+Industry+AuthorIty+Michell |title=Samsung Electronics: And the Struggle For Leadership of the Electronics Industry |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-470-82266-1 |page=153}}</ref> Sales were initially poor, and by the early 1990s, Motorola held a market share of over 60 percent in the country's mobile phone market compared to just 10 percent for Samsung.<ref name=Michell1/> Samsung's mobile phone division also struggled with poor quality and inferior products until the mid-1990s, and exit from the sector was a frequent topic of discussion within the company.<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 July 1995 |title=Koreans Seen Buying More U.S. Concerns |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/international-business-koreans-seen-buying-more-us-concerns.html |url-status=live |access-date=6 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110073729/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/international-business-koreans-seen-buying-more-us-concerns.html |archive-date=10 November 2012}}</ref>

===1995–2008: Component manufacturing and design strategy===
Lee Kun-Hee decided that Samsung needed to change strategy. The company shelved the production of many under-selling product lines and instead pursued a process of designing and manufacturing components and investing in new technologies for other companies. In addition, Samsung outlined a 10-year plan to shrug off its image as a "budget brand" and to challenge [[Sony Corporation|Sony]] as the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer. It was hoped that, in this way, Samsung would gain an understanding of how products are made and give a technological lead sometime in the future. This patient [[vertical integration]] strategy of manufacturing components has borne fruit for Samsung in the late 2000s.<ref name="businessweek">{{Cite news |last=Burrows |first=Peter |date=16 November 2009 |title=Moto Droid off to a Good Start.

A complementary brand leadership strategy was also initiated by chairman Lee when he declared 1996 to be the "Year of Design Revolution" at Samsung. His objective was to build Samsung design capabilities as a competitive asset and transform the company into a global brand-design leader. However, this effort required major changes in corporate culture, processes and systems. By integrating a comprehensive [[design management]] system and strategy into the corporate culture, Samsung was successful in developing an award-winning product design portfolio by the late 1990s, resulting in significant brand equity growth.<ref name="Samsung3A">Chung, K.; Hardy, T.; So, S., ″Strategic Realization″ [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229945575_Strategic_Realization_Building_Fundamental_Design_Values] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916054012/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229945575_Strategic_Realization_Building_Fundamental_Design_Values |date=16 September 2017 }}, ''Design Management Journal'', Winter 2000, pp.65–9</ref><ref name="Nussbaum, B. 1997">Nussbaum, B., "The Hungriest Tiger", ''Business Week'', 2 June 1997, p.99</ref><ref name="Samsung4A">Delaney, M.; Hardy, T.; McFarland, J.; Yoon, G., ″Global Localization″, ''Innovation'', Summer 2002, pp.46–9</ref>

As Samsung shifted away from consumer markets, the company devised a plan to sponsor major sporting events. One such sponsorship was for the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]], Japan.<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 April 2007 |title=Samsung Extends Sponsorship of Olympic Games until 2016 |publisher=Sportbusiness |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/161740/samsung-extends-sponsorship-of-olympic-games-until-2016 |url-status=live |access-date=23 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917143400/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/161740/samsung-extends-sponsorship-of-olympic-games-until-2016 |archive-date=17 September 2011}}</ref>

===Relationship with Best Buy Co., Inc.===
{{advert|section|date=July 2017}}
{{update|section|date=April 2018}}
[[Best Buy]] and Samsung joined together to create the Samsung Experience Shop, a store-in-a-store which allows customers to test the company's newest products, as well as get training in mobile products they already own. In summer 2013, more than 1,400 Best Buy and Best Buy Mobile stores have established the Samsung Experience Shop. About 460 square feet of space are dedicated for the SES, with the company's placement at Best Buy's entrance, as well as its sign visible in any part of the store.<ref name="PalencharTWICE">{{Cite news |last=Palenchar |first=Joseph |title=Analysts See Potential in Samsung, Best Buy Tie-Up |agency=TWICE |issue=28}}</ref> The purpose of the Samsung Experience Shop is to make Samsung's products, i.e. the Galaxy, more accessible to customers.

The first Samsung Experience Shops began rolling out across Best Buy locations in the United States in May 2013. In May 2014, Best Buy announced its plans to add 500 new Samsung Entertainment Experience Shops. While the previous Samsung Experience locations focus primarily on showcasing and providing support for Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, cameras, and tablets, these new locations will showcase and support the company's home theater products.

Unlike the Samsung Experience Shop, the Samsung Entertainment Experience will be run by Samsung trained Best Buy associates. The new centers are expected to finish rolling out across Best Buys in the US by January 2015.<ref name="Belz">{{Cite news |last=Belz |first=Adam |date=2 May 2014 |title=Best Buy Signs New Store-within-a-store Deals with Samsung, Sony |work=San Jose Mercury News}}</ref>

==Design==
In the early 1990s, Samsung began considering the importance of physical design in its products. When chairman Lee declared 1996 'The Year of Design Revolution', a comprehensive global design program was initiated with the goal of design being a strategic asset and competitive advantage for the company.<ref name="Samsung3B">Chung, K.; Hardy, T.; So, S., ″Strategic Realization″ [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229945575_Strategic_Realization_Building_Fundamental_Design_Values] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916054012/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229945575_Strategic_Realization_Building_Fundamental_Design_Values |date=16 September 2017 }}, ''Design Management Journal'', Winter 2000, pp.65–9</ref><ref name="Nussbaum, B. 1997">Nussbaum, B., "The Hungriest Tiger", ''Business Week'', 2 June 1997, p.99</ref><ref name="Samsung4B">Delaney, M.; Hardy, T.; McFarland, J.; Yoon, G., ″Global Localization″, ''Innovation'', Summer 2002, pp.46–9</ref>Located in the company's high-rise headquarters in Gangnam (south of Seoul) the corporate design center includes more than 900 full-time designers. In 1971 there were only two designers in the whole company, whose number rose to 510 in 2005.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In addition to the corporate design center in Seoul, there are design centers located in Tokyo, San Francisco and London.<ref>Dr. K.J. Freeze and Prof. Dr. K.W. Chung (2008): Design Strategy at Samsung Electronics: Becoming a Top-Tier Company, Design Management Institute, Boston, USA (page 6)</ref> 

The company overhauls its design over a two-year cycle. For the first year, it scrutinizes design trends of the world, followed by product strategies. It then maps out new design plans during the second year.

Since 2006, it has won as many as 210 awards from international design institutions.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It received the iF (International Forum) and IDEA design awards. Working with partners, Samsung was the winner in eight categories in the 2009 IDEA awards, hence receiving the most awards.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nussbaum |first=Bruce |date=1 August 2009 |title=Samsung Beats Apple in the IDEA/BusinessWeek Design Awards |url=http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2009/08/samsung_beats_a.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112075916/http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/NussbaumOnDesign/archives/2009/08/samsung_beats_a.html |archive-date=12 November 2012 |access-date=10 July 2013 |website=Bloomberg BusinessWeek}}</ref>

In the 2010 iF Material Awards, the company won the Gold Award for five of its products including the external hard disk drive. The iF Material Awards are given by the International Forum Design GmbH of Hannover, a design award for design materials and process technologies. In 2010, the German company selected a total of 42 products in the areas of home appliance, furniture, and industrial design. Samsung won the awards in five categories including external hard disk, full-touch screen phone, "side-by-side" refrigerator, compact digital camera, and laser printer toner.<ref>{{Cite news |date=26 April 2010 |title=Samsung Products Win iF Awards |publisher=JoongAng Daily |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2919659 |url-status=live |access-date=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126071117/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2919659 |archive-date=26 November 2010}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
All Samsung mobile phones and MP3 players introduced on the market after April 2010 are free from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Policy on target substances – Chemical Management – Environment – Sustainability – About Samsung |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/chemicalmanagement/policyontargetsubstances.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814191147/http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/sustainability/environment/chemicalmanagement/policyontargetsubstances.html |archive-date=14 August 2010 |access-date=2 August 2010 |publisher=Samsung Electronics}}</ref>

The company is listed in [[Greenpeace]]'s Guide to Greener Electronics, which rates electronics companies on policies and practices to reduce their impact on the climate, produce greener products, and make their operations more sustainable. In November 2011, Samsung was ranked seventh out of 15 leading electronics manufacturers with a score of 4.1/10.<ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics">{{Cite web |title=Guide to Greener Electronics – Greenpeace International |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112022636/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |archive-date=12 November 2011 |access-date=16 November 2011}}</ref> In the newly re-launched guide, Samsung moved down two places (occupying fifth position in October 2010), but scored maximum points for providing verified data and its greenhouse gas emissions. It also scored well for its Sustainable Operations, with the guide praising its relatively good e-waste take-back programme and information. However, the company was criticized for not setting an ambitious target to increase its use of renewable energy and for belonging to a trade association which has commented against energy efficiency standards.<ref name="Guide to Greener Electronics" />

In June 2004, Samsung was one of the first major electronics companies to publicly commit to eliminate PVC and BFRs from new models of all their products.

===DRAM price fixing===
{{main|DRAM price fixing}}
In December 2010, the European Commission fined six LCD panel producers, including Samsung, a total of €648,925&nbsp;million for operating as a cartel. The company received a full reduction of the potential fine for being the first firm to assist EU anti-trust authorities.<ref name="Antitrust: Commission fines six LCD panel producers €648 million for price fixing cartel">{{Cite web |title=Antitrust: Commission fines six LCD panel producers €648 million for price fixing cartel |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-10-1685_en.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510144611/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-10-1685_en.htm |archive-date=10 May 2013 |access-date=18 April 2013 |publisher=European Commission}}</ref>

On 19 October 2011, Samsung was fined €145.73&nbsp;million for being part of a price cartel of ten companies for [[DRAM]]s, which lasted from 1 July 1998 to 15 June 2002. Like most of the other members of the cartel, the company received a 10% reduction for acknowledging the facts to investigators. Samsung had to pay 90% of their share of the settlement, but Micron avoided payment as a result of having initially revealed the case to investigators. Micron remains the only company that avoided all payments from reduction under the settlement notice.<ref name="Antitrust: Commission fines DRAM producers €331 million for price cartel; reaches first settlement in a cartel case">{{Cite web |title=Antitrust: Commission fines DRAM producers € 331 million for price cartel; reaches first settlement in a cartel case |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/586 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707041505/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP%2F10%2F586 |archive-date=7 July 2010 |access-date=22 April 2012 |publisher=European Commission}}</ref>

In Canada, the price fix was investigated in 2002. A recession started to occur that year, and the price fix ended. However, in 2014, the Canadian government reopened the case and investigated silently after the EU's success. Sufficient evidence was found and presented to Samsung and two other manufacturers during a [[class action lawsuit]] hearing. The companies agreed upon a $120&nbsp;million agreement, with $40&nbsp;million as a fine, and $80&nbsp;million to be paid back to Canadian citizens who purchased a computer, printer, MP3 player, gaming console or camera between April 1999 and June 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Canadian DRAM Class Action |url=http://www.themoneyismine.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915090924/http://themoneyismine.com/ |archive-date=15 September 2015 |access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref>

On 2 September, Samsung suspended sales of the Note 7 and announced a worldwide "product exchange program"<ref name="consumerist-pep" /> in which customers would be able to exchange their Note 7 for another Note 7, a [[Galaxy S7]], or an [[Galaxy S7 Edge|S7 Edge]] (the price difference being refunded). They would also receive a gift card from a participating carrier.<ref name="consumerist-pep" /> On 1 September, the company released a statement saying it had received 35 reports of battery failure, which, according to an unnamed Samsung official, "account for less than 0.2 percent of the entire volume sold".<ref name="guard-delay-test">[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/samsung-delays-galaxy-note-7-quality-testing Samsung delays shipments of Galaxy Note 7 for quality control testing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903074708/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/samsung-delays-galaxy-note-7-quality-testing |date=3 September 2016 }}, 31 August 2016.

On 4 November 2016, Samsung recalled 2.8&nbsp;million top-load washing machines sold at home appliance stores between 2011 and 2016 because the machine's top could unexpectedly detach from the chassis during use that could be caused by excessive vibration.<ref>[https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2016/samsung-recalls-top-load-washing-machines Samsung Recalls Top-Load Washing Machines Due to Risk of Impact Injuries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104205412/https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2016/samsung-recalls-top-load-washing-machines |date=4 November 2016 }} U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 4 November 2016</ref>

In March 2016, soccer star [[Pelé]] filed a lawsuit against Samsung in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]], seeking $30&nbsp;million in damages, claiming violations under the [[Lanham Act]] for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of his right of publicity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pelé IP Ownership LLC v.
