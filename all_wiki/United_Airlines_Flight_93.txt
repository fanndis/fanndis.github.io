'''United Airlines Flight 93''' was a [[Domestic flight|domestic scheduled passenger flight]] that was [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by four [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists on board, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. It crashed into a field in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people on board were killed, including the four hijackers. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-222]], was flying [[United Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning flight from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] in [[New Jersey]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]] in [[California]].

The hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The captain and first officer struggled with the hijackers, which was transmitted to Air Traffic Control. [[Ziad Jarrah]], who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of [[Washington, D.C.]], the U.S. capital. [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] and [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol Building]].<ref>"'We Have Some Planes'". 9/11 Commission Report. National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. 2004. Retrieved October 1, 2013.</ref> 

After the hijackers took control of the plane, the pilots may have taken measures such as de-activating the autopilot in order to hinder the hijackers. Several passengers and flight attendants learned from phone calls that suicide attacks had already been made by hijacked airliners on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]] and [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. Many of the passengers then attempted to retake the plane from the hijackers. During the struggle, the hijackers crashed the plane into a field near a reclaimed strip mine in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]], near [[Indian Lake, Pennsylvania|Indian Lake]] and [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]], about {{convert|65|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh]] and {{convert|130|mi|km}} northwest of Washington, D.C. rather than cede control of the plane. A few people witnessed the impact from the ground, and news agencies began reporting the event within an hour.

Four "muscle" hijackers were trained to storm the cockpit and overpower the crew, and three accompanied Jarrah on Flight{{nbs}}93.

Of the four aircraft hijacked, Flight{{nbs}}93 was the only aircraft that broadcast a distress call. It is likely that because the pilots had been warned of the WTC hijackings and to beware of a cockpit intrusion, when they came under attack, they purposely keyed the microphone so sounds of the struggle would be heard by officials on the ground. Cleveland Center air traffic controller John Werth believed it was not just a call for help, but a warning as well.<ref>''Flight 93: The Story, the Aftermath, and the Legacy of American Courage on 9/11'', pp 81–82</ref>

The exact time at which Flight{{nbs}}93 came under the hijackers' control cannot be determined. Officials believe that at 09:28, the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers to the rear of the plane at the same time to minimize any chance that either the crew or the passengers would interfere with the attack.<ref name="Staff" /> The other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, but Flight{{nbs}}93 had only four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible [[20th hijacker]]. The [[9/11 Commission]] believed that [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] was the likely candidate for this role, but was unable to participate as he had been denied entry into the United States one month earlier.<ref name="Chap1" /> With many passengers saying in phone calls that they saw only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believed Jarrah remained seated until after the cockpit was seized and passengers were moved to the back of the aircraft and then took over the flight controls out of sight of the passengers.<ref name="Chap1" />

The flight transcript suggests that at least two hijackers were in the cockpit. Ziad Jarrah was identified as the pilot and is heard calling another hijacker "Saeed",<ref>[[s:en:Flight 93 Cockpit Transcript|Flight 93 Cockpit Transcript]] at [[Wikisource]]</ref> indicating that [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], who also trained in flight simulators, was helping Jarrah with the controls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=File:Flight_93_Cockpit_Transcript.djvu&page=7|title=File:Flight 93 Cockpit Transcript.djvu – Wikisource, the free online library|website=en.wikisource.org|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref>

Flight number "93" was discontinued by United Airlines after the hijacking. United has many nonstop flights from Newark to San Francisco. As of May 2016, there is still an 8:00 A.M. flight from Newark to San Francisco, which still uses a [[Boeing 757]], but it is now Flight 497. It was reported in May 2011 that United was reactivating flight numbers 93 and [[United Airlines Flight 175|175]] as a codeshare operated by Continental, sparking an outcry from some in the media and the [[labor union]] representing United pilots.<ref name="TIME-Romero-2011">{{cite magazine |date= May 18, 2011|url = http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/18/flight-number-flub-unitedcontinental-accidentally-reinstates-flights-93-and-175/|title = Flight Number Flub: United/Continental Accidentally Reinstates Flights 93 and 175|magazine = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]| access-date = February 14, 2015 | last=Romero| first= Frances }}</ref><ref name="WSJ-McCartney-2011">{{cite news |date= May 18, 2011|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/middleseat/2011/05/18/bad-mistake-united-revives-sept-11-flight-numbers/?mod=google_news_blog|title = Bad Mistake: United Revives Sept. 11 Flight Numbers|newspaper = The Wall Street Journal| access-date = February 14, 2015 | last=McCartney| first= Scott }}</ref><ref name="USA-Today-Mutzabaugh-2011">{{cite news |title= Unions slam United for mistakenly reinstating 9/11 flight numbers|first= Ben |last=Mutzabaugh|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2011/05/unions-slam-united-for-accidentally-reinstating-911-flight-numbers/170842/1 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=May 18, 2011 |access-date= February 14, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104202329/http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2011/05/unions-slam-united-for-accidentally-reinstating-911-flight-numbers/170842/1 |archive-date=January 4, 2014 }}</ref> United said the reactivation was a mistake and said the numbers were "inadvertently reinstated", and would not be reactivated.<ref name="TIME-Romero-2011"/>

The [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) stated to the 9/11 Commission that fighters would have intercepted Flight{{nbs}}93 before it reached its target in Washington, D.C., but the commission disagreed, saying that "NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed" and concluding that had it not crashed it probably would have arrived in Washington by 10:23.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |chapter=We Have Some Planes |chapter-url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |year=2004 |title=9/11 Commission Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |access-date=September 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>"Although US military forces had been alerted about the hijackings, and two Air Force F-16 jet fighters were airborne in the area, no official authorization to shoot down Flight 93 was given until the aircraft had crashed.
