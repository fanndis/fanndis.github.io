The '''2015 United Kingdom general election debates''' were a series of four live television programmes featuring the leaders of seven main [[United Kingdom|British]] parties that took place during the run-up to the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election]].  They each featured different formats and participants.

The first was a one-on-one programme between [[David Cameron]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]), and [[Ed Miliband]], [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]). The second featured Cameron, Miliband, [[Nick Clegg]], [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] ([[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]), [[Nigel Farage]] ([[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]), [[Natalie Bennett]] ([[Green Party of England and Wales]]), [[Nicola Sturgeon]], [[First Minister of Scotland]] ([[Scottish National Party|SNP]]), and [[Leanne Wood]] ([[Plaid Cymru]]).  The third debate featured the leaders of the five opposition parties: Miliband, Farage, Bennett, Sturgeon, and Wood.  The final programme's participants were Cameron, Miliband, and Clegg. Only the Labour Party's Miliband participated in all four events.

The formats and participants were arrived at after a lengthy process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-30955379|title=Election 2015: Seven-party TV debate plan announced|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/election-debate-plan|title=BBC - Broadcasters to stick to Election debate plan - Media centre|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-31912311|title=Politics Live: Campaign countdown - BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Following the result of the election, a survey of 3,019 people, carried out by Panelbase, found that 38% of voters considered the debates to have influenced their voting intention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32673439|title=Election 2015: TV debates 'most influential' for voters|author=Emma Thelwell|date=9 May 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>[http://www.otherlines.tv/documents/oletv-general-election-poll.pdf Otherlines.tv PDF file]</ref>

==Background==
The first series of televised [[2010 United Kingdom general election debates|leaders' debates]] in the United Kingdom were held in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|previous election]]. Broadcasters proposed another series of televised debates in the run up to the 2015 election, although in a different format. The suggestion was that the debates should take place during the early stages of the campaign, before April.<ref name=Huffington>{{cite web|title=Will There Be Election Debates In 2015, And Who Will Fight Them? |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/23/tories-2015-election-debates-ukip-snp_n_2004740.html |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> Cameron suggested that the televised debates should take place before the campaign itself, as he felt that the 2010 debates overshadowed the rest of the campaign; he was, however, still positive towards them taking place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameron: 'I Want Televised Leaders Debates'|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1147902/cameron-i-want-televised-leaders-debates|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30997410|title=David Cameron: Timing vital for TV election debates|work=BBC News}}</ref>

There was media speculation from individuals such as [[Michael Crick]] of [[Channel 4 News]] as to who may be included in the debates. He suggested that if [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] did not receive sufficient coverage, they could make a legal case against broadcasters that under-represent the party, if the leaders of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are included.<ref name=Huffington /><ref>{{cite web|title=After Rotherham, Ukip aims to top the 2014 Euro poll|url=http://blogs.channel4.com/michael-crick-on-politics/after-rotherham-ukip-aims-to-top-the-2014-euro-poll/2031|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Can UKIP become a serious political party?|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/09/will-ukip-make-the-transition-from-pressure-group-to-serious-political-party/|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] had dismissed the call for UKIP's participation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-dont-put-ukip-in-general-election-tv-debate-8457116.html|accessdate=21 August 2013|work=standard|title=David Cameron: Don't put Ukip in general election TV debate}}</ref> The [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Ed Miliband]] said in January 2013 that the composition of each debate was a matter for the media organisations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9840430/Ukip-could-get-a-place-in-TV-election-debates.html|accessdate=21 August 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Ukip could get a place in TV election debates|location=London|first=Tim|last=Ross|date=31 January 2013}}</ref>

In the run-up to the [[2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament election, 2014]], there were two debates between the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] [[Nick Clegg]] and the [[UK Independence Party]] leader [[Nigel Farage]]. According to polling, Mr Farage is reported to have comfortably won both debates<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-26843996|accessdate=19 May 2014|work=BBC News|title=Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage in heated BBC debate over EU}}</ref> and this prompted further speculation that Farage could or should be invited to take part in the debates ahead of the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2014/mar/27/has-nigel-farage-booked-place-2015-election-debates|accessdate=19 May 2014|work=The Guardian|title=Has Nigel Farage booked himself a place in the 2015 election debates?}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4080488.ece|accessdate=19 May 2014|work=The Times|title=Cameron ponders TV debate with Farage in run-up to 2015 election}}</ref> UKIP won the European elections, topping the poll. This further strengthened Farage's case and increased calls for UKIP to be represented in such TV debates.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/european-elections-ukip-set-for-landmark-win-9391409.html|work=The Independent|title=European elections: Ukip set for landmark win}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24058104|work=BBC News|title='UKIP could win Euro election', says Barroso}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ede4bc38-b8ef-11e3-98c5-00144feabdc0.html|work=Financial Times|title=Ukip will win most votes in European elections says pollster}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/04/uk-eu-election-britain-idUKKBN0DK0E920140504|agency=Reuters|title=UKIP to top Europe vote despite perceived racism – polls}}</ref>

In October 2014, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky News announced joint plans for three debates, one with just the leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties, a second also including the Liberal Democrats, and a third including UKIP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1352008/news-organisations-reveal-leaders-debate-plan|title=Leaders React To Plan For Election Debates|publisher=Sky News}}</ref> Several other parties represented in the Commons complained at their exclusion from this plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/13/nigel-farage-2015-leaders-debates-bbc-itv-sky-news|title=Nigel Farage invited to take part in 2015 TV leaders' debates|author=Jason Deans|work=The Guardian}}</ref> On 30 October the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] were informed by the BBC that their requests to be included in TV debates was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/29/bbc-refuses-include-green-party-televised-leader-debates-general-election|title=BBC refuses to include Green party in general election TV leader debates|author=Patrick Wintour|work=The Guardian}}</ref> However, the Green Party did not give up, and were boosted by the existence of a petition in support of their inclusion with over 275,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/260000-people-sign-petition-to-include-green-party-in-election-debates-9856948.html|title=260,000 people sign petition to include Green Party in election debates|work=The Independent}}</ref>

[[David Cameron]] then said that he would not take part unless the Greens did.  As a result of this combined pressure, ITV and the BBC published revised plans in January 2015, including the Greens, as well as the SNP and Plaid Cymru (who only stand in Scotland and Wales respectively).  Many of the [[List of political parties in Northern Ireland|Northern Irish political parties]] then made statements requesting their inclusion in the debates. [[Sinn Féin]] sought legal advice,<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> while the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] wrote to the BBC and ITV demanding their inclusion.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-30949900|title=Election 2015: NI parties not included in TV election debate plans|work=BBC News}}</ref> [[George Galloway]], the sole MP for the [[Respect Party]], also argued for his inclusion, on the basis that Respect then had the same number of MPs as the Greens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30953672|title=Election 2015: George Galloway on Respect in TV debates|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.respectparty.org/2015/01/23/george-galloway-threatens-legal-action-to-join-tv-election-debates/|title=George Galloway threatens legal action to join TV election debates|work=The Respect Party - Peace, Justice & Equality|access-date=28 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128151951/http://www.respectparty.org/2015/01/23/george-galloway-threatens-legal-action-to-join-tv-election-debates/|archive-date=28 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The DUP's formal complaint was rejected by the BBC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-31757974|title=BBC Trust rejects DUP's appeal to be included in TV election debates|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Proposals===

====May 2014====
On 9 May—almost exactly a year before the election date—[[David Cameron]] proposed a five-way debate, with the leaders of "all the main parties"{{^|which five did he mean?}}. This would be followed up by a separate "head to head" debate between himself and Labour's [[Ed Miliband]].This itself was an adjustment from an earlier proposal of Cameron for three debates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/election-2015-david-cameron-suggests-fiveway-debate-between-party-leaders-9347387.html|title=Election 2015: David Cameron suggests five-way debate between party leaders|work=The Independent}}</ref>

====October 2014====
During October 2014, all four main broadcasters, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky announced joint plans for multi-platform party leader debates in the run up to the 2015 general election. Three debates would have taken place within the six-week campaign period, at a time when the parties were to be setting out their policies, to help further engage the audience with the election. The proposal entailed debates at fortnightly intervals on 2 April, 16 April and 30 April at locations around the UK.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/leader-debates|title=BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Sky join forces for party leader debates proposal |publisher=BBC Media Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/13/farage-leaders-debate-broadcasters_n_5975478.html|title=Ukip's Nigel Farage Invited To Take Part In Election 2015 Leaders Debates By Broadcasters |work=[[The Huffington Post|The Huffington Post UK]]}}</ref>

* The First Debate was to be a "head to head" debate between [[David Cameron]] and [[Ed Miliband]].
* The Second Debate was to follow the pattern of the 2010 debates, between the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders.
* The third Debate would have had the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and UKIP leaders.

====January 2015====
In January 2015, ITV and the BBC published revised plans for the television election debates to include seven main UK political parties' leaders.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30935369 |title=Election 2015: Broadcasters expected to offer new TV debates plan|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The revised proposals would see the debates being held on Thursdays: 2, 16, and 30 April 2015, during the general election campaign.

The proposals issued were for:
* Two seven-way debates including representatives of the Conservative Party, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru one hosted by BBC, and the other by ITV.
* A debate that would be 'head-to-head' between [[David Cameron]] and [[Ed Miliband]], jointly hosted by Channel 4 and Sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/22/general-election-tv-debates-seven-parties|title=Revised plan for election TV debates proposes including seven parties|author=John Plunkett|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

Warnings were given from all the broadcasters that if the leaders failed to turn up an 'empty chair' would be used instead.

====February 2015====
On 23 February 2015, the broadcasters agreed on three debates:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/election-debates-order|title=BBC - Order of party leaders' televised General Election debates announced - Media centre|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/feb/23/itv-to-air-first-party-leaders-tv-debate-on-2-april|title=ITV to air first party leaders' TV debate on 2 April|author=John Plunkett|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

* 2 April: ITV - Debate between the party leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the SNP, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru.
* 16 April: BBC - A second debate between the seven party leaders above.
* 30 April: Sky and Channel 4 - Head-to-head debate between the Leader of the Conservative Party and the Leader of the Labour Party.

====March 2015====
On 4 March 2015 [[David Cameron]] stated, in what was described as a "final offer",<ref name="bbc.co.uk2">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31928638|title=David Cameron 'accepts single multi-party TV debate'|work=BBC News}}</ref> that he would only participate in a single debate, involving the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the SNP, the Green Party, Plaid Cymru and possibly the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). He also said that the debate must occur before the start of the short campaign, i.e. before 30 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/mar/05/cameron-ducks-tv-debate-with-just-miliband-reaction-politics-live-blog#block-54f7fca8e4b0260c5f4a09b6|title=David Cameron ducks TV debate with just Miliband - reaction: Politics Live|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=The Guardian}}</ref> His announcement effectively ruled out the proposed one on one debate between [[Ed Miliband]] and the Prime Minister, and raised the prospect of Cameron being "empty chaired" in debates involving other party leaders but not him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31742155|title=Election 2015: Cameron agrees to just one TV debate|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/05/pm-empty-chaired-broadcasters-set-to-go-ahead-debates|title= PM faces being 'empty-chaired' as TV debates are expected to go ahead|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> On 6 March, the broadcasters confirmed that they intended to go ahead with all three debates.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://corporate.sky.com/media-centre/news-page/2015/broadcasters-to-stick-to-election-debate-plan|title=Broadcasters to Stick to Election Debate Plan|publisher=[[BSKYB]]}}</ref> In response to the possibility of Cameron being "empty chaired", Ofcom warned that broadcasters had to be careful about impartiality rules.<ref name="patrickfoster">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-03-17/broadcasters-offer-to-scrap-two-election-debates-to-persuade-david-cameron-to-take-part-in-one|title=Radio Times - TV news and guide, TV and radio listings, film reviews guide|author=Patrick Foster|work=Radio Times}}</ref>

[[The Daily Telegraph|''The Telegraph'']] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', in association with [[Google]] and [[YouTube]], then announced that they intended to hold an internet-broadcast live debate, which was planned to feature [[David Cameron]], [[Ed Miliband]], [[Nick Clegg]], [[Nigel Farage]],and [[Natalie Bennett]], and had issued an invitation to the five party leaders. The debate was to be held on 26 or 27 March (before the short campaign, as favoured by the Conservatives). The Liberal Democrats nominally expressed their intention to participate; however there was concern that the absence of the SNP might prove to be an obstacle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/debates/11462718/Party-leaders-challenged-to-take-part-in-Telegraphs-digital-debate.html|title=Party leaders challenged to take part in Telegraph's digital debate|date=11 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11463804/David-Cameron-and-Ed-Miliband-clash-as-pressure-over-debates-mounts-live.html|title=David Cameron and party leaders indicate they will take part in digital election debate: as it happened|date=11 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> UKIP categorically agreed to participate.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Conservative chairman [[Grant Shapps]] expressed that he was in favour.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> However, without any formal agreement forthcoming, the organisers wrote to [[David Cameron]] on 17 March asking for his commitment.<ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/> The debate did not take place.

That day, the Conservatives accepted the offer of a single, 7-way debate to be broadcast on ITV on 2 April,<ref name="bbc.co.uk1"/><ref name="patrickfoster"/> with the other two planned debates cancelled.<ref name="andrewsparrow"/> According to the Conservatives, they were approached with a new 4-programme plan,<ref name="andrewsparrow">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/mar/17/douglas-alexander-labours-election-chief-at-labourlist-conference-politics-live-blog|title=Cameron accepts TV debate in April: Politics Live blog|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=The Guardian}}</ref> which was reported to be:

* 26 March on Sky/Channel 4: Leaders' interviews with Cameron and Miliband interviewed sequentially by [[Jeremy Paxman]], with studio audience.
* 2 April on ITV: Debate with the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru and DUP.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/19/nick-clegg-election-debate-main-parties|title=Nick Clegg backs election debate between the four main parties|author=Frances Perraudin|work=The Guardian}}</ref>
* 16 April: Debate with the "challenger parties", ''i.e.'' SNP, UKIP, Plaid Cymru, Greens and DUP.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
* 30 April on BBC: ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' with Cameron, Miliband and Clegg taking questions from audience sequentially.

The Liberal Democrats accepted these proposals, but [[Nick Clegg]] has said he still hoped for a four-way leaders debate involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and UKIP (as the four main parties as defined by Ofcom).<ref name="ReferenceB"/> However, Labour and UKIP responded that they are only aware of the prior proposal from the broadcasters for three debates, which they still supported.<ref name="bbc.co.uk2"/><ref name="andrewsparrow"/> The SNP, likewise, called on Cameron to take part in the three debates previously proposed.<ref name="andrewsparrow"/> Commentators argued that the new proposed format would be better for the Conservatives than having three debates including a head-to-head with Miliband.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/03/exclusive-tories-agree-to-broadcasters-debate-proposal/|title=Exclusive: Tories agree to TV debate offer|work=Spectator Blogs}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/tv-debates-will-miliband-and-cameron-ever-meet-screen|title=TV debates: Will Miliband and Cameron ever meet on screen?|work=New Statesman}}</ref>

Negotiations continued, with the broadcasters offering to include Labour in the 16 April debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/19/broadcasters-pile-pressure-david-cameron-second-live-election-debate|title=Broadcasters pile pressure on Cameron over second live election debate|author=Patrick Wintour|work=The Guardian}}</ref> A final settlement was reached on 21 March. The agreed schedule was only a slight modification of the 17 March proposal, with the "challenger party" debates now featuring [[Ed Miliband]] instead of a representative from the DUP, with resistance from the DUP.<ref name="bbc.co.uk3"/> The final plan was thus:

* 26 March on Sky/Channel 4: Leaders' interviews, with Cameron and Miliband interviewed sequentially by Paxman, with a studio audience.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/battle-for-number-10|title= Cameron & Miliband Live: The Battle for Number 10|date=21 March 2015|work= Channel 4 Press Release|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>	
* 2 April on ITV: Debate with the leaders of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru chaired by Julie Etchingham.<ref name="bbc.co.uk3">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32001383|title=Election debates agreement reached|work=BBC News}}</ref>
* 16 April on BBC: Debate with the "challenger parties", ''i.e.'' Labour, UKIP, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens, chaired by David Dimbleby.<ref name="bbc.co.uk3"/>
* 30 April on BBC: ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' with Cameron, Miliband and Clegg taking questions from the audience sequentially, chaired by Dimbleby.

===Impact===
The controversies around the initial planned exclusion of the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] from the debates coincided with rapid increases in membership of the Green parties, and increase in their opinion poll ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/21/green-surge-party-that-will-decide-election|title=The Green surge: is this the party that will decide the election?|author=John Harris|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The party referred to this increase as "[[Green Party of England and Wales#Natalie Bennett (2012–)|The Green Surge]]", their membership surpassing that of UKIP or the Liberal Democrats by mid-January.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/15/green-party-membership-surge-leaders-debates|title=Green membership surge takes party past Lib Dems and Ukip|author=Rowena Mason|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

==''Cameron & Miliband: The Battle for Number 10'' (26 March)==
Channel 4, Sky and the BBC News Channel broadcast the first programme on 26 March. Miliband, having won the toss, chose to go second,<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11497752/Last-PMQs-before-the-election-Live.html|title= Election TV debate - as it happened, March 26, 2015|date=27 March 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> so this programme consisted of [[Jeremy Paxman]] interviewing Cameron, Cameron facing questions from a studio audience (moderated by [[Kay Burley]]), Miliband facing the audience, and finally Paxman interviewing Miliband.

The programme was recorded in Studios 4 & 5 at [[Sky Campus|Sky Studios]] in [[Isleworth]].

===Response===
Average viewing figures for the show were 2.6 million on Channel 4 (11.7% of the TV audience) and 322,000 on [[Sky News]].<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-32055903|title=Politics Live: 27 March - BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Several hundred complaints were received by Channel 4 and Ofcom claiming the programme was biased against Miliband.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The [[Democratic Unionist Party]], which is a [[Northern Irish]] [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] party, was not included on the television debates. [[Nigel Dodds]], the Deputy Leader for the Party, said that:
<blockquote>It is wrong that Northern Ireland should be excluded [from the TV debates], after all the Democratic Unionist Party has 8 MPs currently in the outgoing parliament and we're going to play a very crucial role in the next parliament. We're bigger than four of the other parties that were included in the debate, so I think that it's only fair and proper that all regions of the United Kingdom are represented.<ref>{{cite news|title=DUP: Wrong that N.
