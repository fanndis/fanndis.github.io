The '''Commonwealth Chair-in-Office (CIO)''' is the [[Chairman-in-Office|Chair-in-Office]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and is one of the main leadership positions in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].  It is held by the host chairperson of the previous [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), and is maintained until the next CHOGM.<ref name=comm>{{cite web|title=Our History |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-history#88|website=The Commonwealth|publisher=The Commonwealth|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref> Currently, the incumbent Chair-in-Office is also the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]

The primary responsibility of the Chair-in-Office is to host the CHOGM, but their roles can be expanded.  For example, after the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2002|2002 CHOGM]], the incumbent, previous, and next Chairmen-in-Office formed a [[Triumvirate|troika]] in an attempt to resolve the ongoing dispute over [[Zimbabwe]]'s membership of the Commonwealth.

The position was created after the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1999|1999 CHOGM]], with [[Thabo Mbeki]] becoming the first Chair-in-Office.  However, Mbeki did very little to develop the position,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} leaving it virtually vacant until the next CHOGM in 2002, when the troika was created.  Even after [[John Howard]] became Chair, the troika's first meeting was in London, in the presence of the [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The third Chair, [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], did more to invigorate the role of the position after taking over in 2003.<ref name="Abuja Notebook">{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |author-link=Derek Ingram (journalist) |date=January 2004 |title=Abuja Notebook |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=373 |pages=7–10 |doi=10.1080/0035853042000188157 }}</ref>

Since the assumption of the role at the 2009 CHOGM, representatives from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], including the Prime Ministers, have attended Commonwealth meetings, including 2011 [[Commonwealth Day]] celebrations where [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]], the first woman to chair the Commonwealth, gave the keynote address. [[Sri Lanka]] was due to host the Commonwealth Economic Forum in 2011 but it was held instead in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], due to accusations of [[Alleged war crimes during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War|alleged war crimes]] committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed giving this reason for relocation|date=December 2019}}

As [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Julia Gillard]] succeeded Persad-Bissessar as the second female Chair at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|2011 CHOGM]]. Julia Gillard was in-turn succeeded by [[Kevin Rudd]] after she resigned as [[Prime Minister of Australia]] on 27 June 2013. Rudd went on to lose the [[2013 Australian federal election|Australian federal election]] in September 2013, and consequently was succeeded as CCiO by the new prime minister [[Tony Abbott]]. Abbott remained in the position until Commonwealth leaders met for the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2013|23rd]] time on 15 November 2013, where he was succeeded by the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] of [[Sri Lanka]] [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], who was succeeded by [[Maithripala Sirisena]] in 2015.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/president-will-be-c-wealth-chairman-next-two-years-gl President will be C' wealth Chairman for next two years.
