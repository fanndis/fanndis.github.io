A preterm birth can be brought on by being [[labor induction|induced]], or can occur spontaneously. Preterm births can cause a range of problems.<ref name="SaigalDoyle2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Saigal S, Doyle LW | s2cid = 17256481 | title = An overview of mortality and sequelae of preterm birth from infancy to adulthood | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608 | pages = 261–9 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18207020 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60136-1 }}</ref><ref name="BMJ">{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Courtney |last2=Velji |first2=Zain |last3=Hanly |first3=Ciara |last4=Metcalfe |first4=Amy |title=Risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ Open |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=e015402  |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-015402 |pmid=28679674 |pmc=5734267 |date=1 June 2017}}</ref>

The main categories of causes of preterm birth are preterm [[labor induction]] and spontaneous preterm labor. Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labour]], true labor is accompanied by [[Cervical dilation|cervical dilatation]] and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both [[fetus]] and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.

A review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urquhart C, Currell R, Harlow F, Callow L | title = Home uterine monitoring for detecting preterm labour | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD006172 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28205207 | pmc = 6464057 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006172.pub4 }}</ref> The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal [[antenatal care]].<ref name=":1" />

===Complications===

====Mortality and morbidity====
In the U.S. where many [[neonatal infection]]s and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.<ref>

The earliest [[gestational age]] at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the [[limit of viability]]. As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years, the limit of viability has reduced to approximately 24 weeks.<ref name="Kaempf2006">

====Specific risks for the preterm neonate====
Preterm infants usually show physical signs of prematurity in reverse proportion to the gestational age. As a result, they are at risk for numerous medical problems affecting different organ systems.

*Cardiovascular complications may arise from the failure of the ductus arteriosus to close after birth: [[patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA).
*Respiratory problems are common, specifically the [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]] (RDS or IRDS) (previously called hyaline membrane disease). Another problem can be [[Bronchopulmonary dysplasia|chronic lung disease]] (previously called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD).
*Gastrointestinal and metabolic issues can arise from [[neonatal hypoglycemia]], feeding difficulties, [[rickets]] of prematurity, [[hypocalcemia]], [[inguinal hernia]], and [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).
*Hematologic complications include [[anemia of prematurity]], [[thrombocytopenia]], and [[hyperbilirubinemia]] (jaundice) that can lead to [[kernicterus]].
*Infection, including [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[urinary tract infection]] {{ref|1}}

Identifying women at high risk of giving birth early would enable the health services to provide specialized care for these women to delay the birth or make sure they are in the best place to give birth (for example a hospital with a special care baby unit). Risk scoring systems have been suggested as a possible way of identifying these women. However, there is no research in this area so it is unclear whether the risk scoring systems would prolong pregnancy and reduce the numbers of preterm births or not.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davey MA, Watson L, Rayner JA, Rowlands S | title = Risk-scoring systems for predicting preterm birth with the aim of reducing associated adverse outcomes | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = CD004902 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26490698 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004902.pub5 | pmc = 7388653 }}</ref>

===Infection===
The frequency of infection in preterm birth is inversely related to the gestational age. ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, and spontaneous abortion.<ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lis R, Rowhani-Rahbar A, Manhart LE | title = Mycoplasma genitalium infection and female reproductive tract disease: a meta-analysis | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 418–26 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25900174 | doi = 10.1093/cid/civ312 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Infectious microorganisms can be ascending, hematogeneous, iatrogenic by a procedure, or retrograde through the Fallopian tubes. From the deciduas they may reach the space between the [[amnion]] and [[chorion]], the [[amniotic fluid]], and the fetus. A [[chorioamnionitis]] also may lead to [[sepsis]] of the mother. Fetal infection is linked to preterm birth and to significant long-term handicap including [[cerebral palsy]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schendel DE | title = Infection in pregnancy and cerebral palsy | journal = Journal of the American Medical Women's Association | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 105–8 |year = 2001 | pmid = 11506145 }}</ref>

It has been reported that asymptomatic [[colonization]] of the decidua occurs in up to 70% of women at term using a [[DNA probe]] suggesting that the presence of micro-organism alone may be insufficient to initiate the infectious response.

As the condition is more prevalent in black women in the US and the UK, it has been suggested to be an explanation for the higher rate of preterm birth in these populations. It is opined that bacterial vaginosis before or during pregnancy may affect the decidual inflammatory response that leads to preterm birth. The condition known as [[aerobic vaginitis]] can be a serious risk factor for preterm labor; several previous studies failed to acknowledge the difference between aerobic vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis, which may explain some of the contradiction in the results.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Donders G, Bellen G, Rezeberga D | year = 2011 | title = Aerobic vaginitis in pregnancy | journal = BJOG | volume = 118 | issue = 10| pages = 1163–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.03020.x | pmid = 21668769 | s2cid = 7789770 }}</ref>

A review into prophylactic antibiotics (given to prevent infection) in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (13–42 weeks of pregnancy) found a reduction in the number of preterm births in women with bacterial vaginosis. These antibiotics also reduced the number of waters breaking before labor in full-term pregnancies, reduced the risk of infection of the lining of the womb after delivery (endometritis), and rates of gonococcal infection. However, the women without bacterial vaginosis did not have any reduction in preterm births or pre-labor preterm waters breaking. Much of the research included in this review lost participants during follow-up so did not report the long-term effects of the antibiotics on mothers or babies.

===Fetal fibronectin===
[[Fetal fibronectin]] (fFN) has become an important biomarker—the presence of this glycoprotein in the cervical or vaginal secretions indicates that the border between the chorion and deciduas has been disrupted. A positive test indicates an increased risk of preterm birth, and a negative test has a high predictive value.<ref name=Goldenberg2008/> It has been shown that only 1% of women in questionable cases of preterm labor delivered within the next week when the test was negative.<ref>

In humans, the usual definition of preterm birth is birth before a [[gestational age]] of 37 complete weeks.<ref name=Steer2005>

One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on [[ventilator]]s. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.

==Prevention==
Historically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth. Increasingly primary interventions that are directed at all women, and secondary intervention that reduce existing risks are looked upon as measures that need to be developed and implemented to prevent the health problems of premature infants and children.<ref name=Iams2008>

Many countries have established specific programs to protect pregnant women from hazardous or night-shift work and to provide them with time for prenatal visits and paid pregnancy-leave.

Neonatalogists work with the family as a whole instead of just the neonate or baby whose systems are to immature to actually swallow food so babies between 23-28 weeks are fed through a neonatal gastric tube from the babies nose to the stomach. In some neonates, there are disabilities from varying conditions of the baby this depends on the gestational age the babies delivered a.uUsually, women with severe enough preeclampsia will deliver earlier than normal and those mothers worry greatly because of all of their rumors about NICUs and babies needing wheelchairs glasses and also needing medicines for seizures and ADD/ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, [[anxiety disorder]]s.

====Cervical assessment by ultrasound====
There is tentative evidence that ultrasound measurement of the length of the cervix in those with preterm labor can help adjust management and results in the extension of pregnancy by about 4 days.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berghella |first1=V |last2=Saccone |first2=G |title=Cervical assessment by ultrasound for preventing preterm delivery. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=25 September 2019 |volume=9 |pages=CD007235 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007235.pub4 |pmid=31553800 |pmc=6760928}}</ref>

===Reducing existing risks===
Women are identified to be at increased risk for preterm birth on the basis of their past obstetrical history or the presence of known risk factors. Preconception intervention can be helpful in selected patients in a number of ways. Patients with certain uterine anomalies may have a surgical correction (i.e. removal of a [[uterine septum]]), and those with certain medical problems can be helped by optimizing medical therapies prior to conception, be it for asthma, diabetes, hypertension and others.

====Multiple pregnancies====
In [[multiple pregnancy|multiple pregnancies]], which often result from use of [[assisted reproductive technology]], there is a high risk of preterm birth. [[Selective reduction]] is used to reduce the number of fetuses to two or three.<ref name=ACOG2017>{{cite web |title=Opinion Number 719: Multifetal Pregnancy Reduction |url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Ethics/Multifetal-Pregnancy-Reduction |publisher=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Committee on Ethics. |date=September 2017}}</ref><ref name=Zipori2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zipori Y, Haas J, Berger H, Barzilay E | title = Multifetal pregnancy reduction of triplets to twins compared with non-reduced triplets: a meta-analysis | journal = Reproductive Biomedicine Online | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 296–304 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28625760 | doi = 10.1016/j.rbmo.2017.05.012 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=Evans2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans MI, Andriole S, Britt DW | title = Fetal reduction: 25 years' experience | journal = Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 69–82 |year = 2014 | pmid = 24525884 | doi = 10.1159/000357974 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

====Reducing indicated preterm birth====
A number of agents have been studied for the secondary prevention of indicated preterm birth. Trials using low-dose [[aspirin]], [[fish oil]], vitamin C and E, and calcium to reduce preeclampsia demonstrated some reduction in preterm birth only when low-dose aspirin was used.<ref name=Iams2008/> Even if agents such as calcium or [[antioxidant]]s were able to reduce preeclampsia, a resulting decrease in preterm birth was not observed.<ref name=Iams2008/>

====Reducing spontaneous preterm birth====
Reduction in activity by the mother—pelvic rest, limited work, bed rest—may be recommended although there is no evidence it is useful with some concerns it is harmful.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McCall CA, Grimes DA, Lyerly AD | s2cid = 9069311 | title = "Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 121 | issue = 6 | pages = 1305–8 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23812466 | doi = 10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f }}</ref> Increasing medical care by more frequent visits and more education has not been shown to reduce preterm birth rates.<ref name="East2019" /> Use of nutritional supplements such as omega-3 [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s is based on the observation that populations who have a high intake of such agents are at low risk for preterm birth, presumably as these agents inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines. A randomized trial showed a significant decline in preterm birth rates,<ref>

=====Antibiotics=====

While antibiotics can get rid of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, this does not appear to change the risk of preterm birth.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brocklehurst P, Gordon A, Heatley E, Milan SJ | title = Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = CD000262 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23440777 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000262.pub4| pmc = 4164464 }}</ref> It has been suggested that chronic chorioamnionitis is not sufficiently treated by antibiotics alone (and therefore they cannot ameliorate the need for preterm delivery in this condition).<ref name=Iams2008/>

=====Progestogens=====

[[Progestogen]]s, often given in the form of [[progesterone (medication)|progesterone]] or [[hydroxyprogesterone caproate]], relaxes the uterine musculature, maintains cervical length, and has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus exerts activities expected to be beneficial in reducing preterm birth. Two meta-analyses demonstrated a reduction in the risk of preterm birth in women with recurrent preterm birth by 40–55%.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dodd JM, Jones L, Flenady V, Cincotta R, Crowther CA | s2cid = 43862120 | title = Prenatal administration of progesterone for preventing preterm birth in women considered to be at risk of preterm birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = CD004947 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23903965 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004947.pub3}}</ref><ref>

=====Cervical cerclage=====

In preparation for [[childbirth]], the woman's [[cervix]] shortens. Preterm cervical shortening is linked to preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. [[Cervical cerclage]] is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical cerclage and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix and a history of preterm birth.<ref name=Iams2014/><ref>

==Management==
[[File:Premature birth Alberta, Canada.jpg|thumb|Preterm birth at 32 weeks and 4 days with a weight of 2,000 g attached to medical equipment]]

Tertiary interventions are aimed at women who are about to go into preterm labor, or rupture the membranes or bleed preterm. The use of the [[Fetal fibronectin|fibronectin test]] and ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and reduces false-positive diagnosis. While treatments to arrest early labor where there is progressive cervical dilatation and effacement will not be effective to gain sufficient time to allow the fetus to grow and mature further, it may defer delivery sufficiently to allow the mother to be brought to a specialized center that is equipped and staffed to handle preterm deliveries.<ref>

===Steroids===
Severely premature infants may have underdeveloped lungs because they are not yet producing their own [[pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]]. This can lead directly to [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|respiratory distress syndrome]], also called hyaline membrane disease, in the neonate. To try to reduce the risk of this outcome, pregnant mothers with threatened premature delivery prior to 34 weeks are often administered at least one course of [[glucocorticoids]], a steroid that crosses the placental barrier and stimulates the production of surfactant in the lungs of the baby.<ref name=ACOG2016/> Steroid use up to 37 weeks is also recommended by the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].<ref name=ACOG2016/> Typical glucocorticoids that would be administered in this context are [[betamethasone]] or [[dexamethasone]], often when the pregnancy has reached [[Fetal viability|viability]] at 23 weeks.

In cases where premature birth is imminent, a second "rescue" course of steroids may be administered 12 to 24 hours before the anticipated birth. There are still some concerns about the efficacy and side effects of a second course of steroids, but the consequences of RDS are so severe that a second course is often viewed as worth the risk. A 2015 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crowther CA, McKinlay CJ, Middleton P, Harding JE | title = Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 7 | pages = CD003935 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26142898 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003935.pub4 | pmc = 7104525 }}</ref>

Beside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular bleeding, [[necrotising enterocolitis]], and [[patent ductus arteriosus]].<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts D, Brown J, Medley N, Dalziel SR | title = Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD004454 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28321847 | pmc = 6464568 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004454.pub3 }}</ref> A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery, but there are some concerns about applicability of this recommendation to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.<ref name=":2" /> It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brownfoot FC, Gagliardi DI, Bain E, Middleton P, Crowther CA | title = Different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD006764 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23990333 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006764.pub3 | pmc = 4164475 }}</ref>

Concerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants. There is ongoing discussion about when steroids should be given (i.e. only antenatally or postnatally too) and for how long (i.e. single course or repeated administration). Despite these unknowns, there is a consensus that the benefits of a single course of prenatal glucocorticosteroids vastly outweigh the potential risks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994AntenatalSteroidPerinatal095html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: The Effect of Corticosteroids for Fetal Maturation on Perinatal Outcomes |access-date=2017-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709174327/https://consensus.nih.gov/1994/1994antenatalsteroidperinatal095html.htm |archive-date=9 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |title=The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Program: Antenatal Corticosteroids Revisited: Repeat Courses |access-date=2017-07-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118011125/https://consensus.nih.gov/2000/2000AntenatalCorticosteroidsRevisted112html.htm |archive-date=18 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="pmid28786098">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shepherd E, Salam RA, Middleton P, Makrides M, McIntyre S, Badawi N, Crowther CA | title = Antenatal and intrapartum interventions for preventing cerebral palsy: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 8 | pages = CD012077 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28786098 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD012077.pub2 | pmc = 6483544 }}</ref>

=== Antibiotics ===
The routine administration of antibiotics to all women with threatened preterm labor reduces the risk of the baby to get infected with [[Streptococcus agalactiae|group B streptococcus]] and has been shown to reduce related mortality rates.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schrag S, Gorwitz R, Fultz-Butts K, Schuchat A | title = Prevention of perinatal group B streptococcal disease.

===Neonatal care===

===Economics===
Preterm birth is a significant cost factor in healthcare, not even considering the expenses of long-term care for individuals with disabilities due to preterm birth. A 2003 study in the US determined neonatal costs to be $224,400 for a newborn at 500–700 g versus $1,000 at over 3,000 g. The costs increase exponentially with decreasing gestational age and weight.<ref>

=== Effect of the coronavirus pandemic ===
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], a drastic drop in the rate of premature births has been reported in many countries, ranging from a 20% reduction to a 90% drop in the starkest cases.  Studies in Ireland and Denmark first noticed the phenomenon, and it has been confirmed elsewhere.  There is no universally accepted explanation for this drop as of August 2020.  Hypotheses include additional rest and support for expectant mothers staying at home, less air pollution due to shutdowns and reduced car fumes, and reduced likelihood to catch other diseases and viruses in general due to the lockdowns.<ref>{{cite news |last=Preston |first=Elizabeth |date=July 19, 2020 |title=During Coronavirus Lockdowns, Some Doctors Wondered: Where Are the Preemies? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/health/coronavirus-premature-birth.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 2, 2020 }}</ref>
