The '''Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review''' ('''QDDR''') is a study by the [[United States Department of State]], first started in 2009 and intended to be done every four years, that analyzes the short-, medium-, and long-term blueprint for the [[Foreign policy of the United States|United States' diplomatic and development efforts abroad]].  It seeks to plan on a longer-term basis than the usual year-to-year, appropriations-based practice, and to integrate diplomacy and development missions under one planning process.<ref name="fp070909" /> It similarly seeks to correlate the department’s missions with its capacities and identify shortfalls in resourcing.<ref name="wi-hrc">{{cite news | url=http://washingtonindependent.com/51237/clinton-speech-signals-transformation-at-state | title=Clinton Speech Signals Transformation at State | author=Ackerman, Spencer | publisher=[[The Washington Independent]] | date=2009-07-15 | accessdate=2009-11-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210221048/http://washingtonindependent.com/51237/clinton-speech-signals-transformation-at-state | archive-date=2010-02-10 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Finally, it is also a precursor to core institutional reforms and corrective changes.<ref name="wi-hrc" />  The first such review was completed as year 2010 drew to a close.  A second such review began being conducted during 2014 and was released in April 2015.

==Objectives==
The final report of the QDDR lays out, in the department's own words:
*The baseline: An assessment of (1) the range of global threats, challenges and opportunities both today and over the next two decades that should inform our diplomatic and development strategies; and (2) the current status of our approaches to diplomacy and development, with emphasis on the relationship between diplomacy and development in our existing policies and structures.
*The ends: A clear statement of our overarching foreign policy and development objectives, our specific policy priorities, and our expected results, with an emphasis on the achievable and not merely the desirable.
*The ways: A set of recommendations on the strategies needed to achieve these results, including the timing and sequencing of decisions and implementation.
*The means: A set of recommendations on (1) the tools and resources needed to implement the strategy; and (2) management and organizational reforms that will improve outcomes and efficiency.
*The metrics: A set of recommendations on performance measures to assess outcomes, and—where feasible—impacts.
*The links: An assessment of how the results and recommendations of this review fit into broader interagency, whole-of-government approaches, and into the Administration’s larger foreign policy framework.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/july/125956.htm | title=The Department of State's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review | publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] | date=2009-07-10 | accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>

==Announcement and initial reception==
On July 10, 2009, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] announced the initiative at a State Department [[town hall meeting]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/july/125949.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714232937/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/july/125949.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-07-14 | title=Town Hall Meeting to Announce the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) | author=[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary Rodham]] | publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] | date=2009-07-10 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref> The most ambitious of Clinton's departmental reforms, it is modeled after the [[U.S. Defense Department]]'s [[Quadrennial Defense Review]], which Clinton was familiar with from her days as a [[United States Senator]] on the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]].<ref name="cbs071709">{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/17/opinion/diplomatic/main5169849.shtml | title=Hillary Clinton's 6-Month Checkup | author=Wolfson, Charles | publisher=[[CBS News]] | date=2009-07-17 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref><ref name="govexec"/>  Previously the [[American Academy of Diplomacy]] had determined that the Secretary of State “lacks the tools – people, competencies, authorities, programs and funding – to execute the President’s foreign policies.”<ref name="wi-hrc"/>  More fundamentally, the department did not even have a methodology in place to know how under-resourced it was.<ref name="wi-hrc"/>

She appointed [[United States Deputy Secretary of State|Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Jacob Lew]], [[Director of Policy Planning]] [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] Administrator to undertake the review.<ref name="qddr-briefing">{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/s/dmr/remarks/2009/125950.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714234743/http://www.state.gov/s/dmr/remarks/2009/125950.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-07-14 | title=Briefing on Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review | publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] | date=2009-07-10 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>  At the time of the announcement, that was the Acting USAID Administrator, Alonzo Fulgham.<ref name="qddr-briefing"/>  (On November 10, 2009, [[Rajiv Shah]] was nominated to be USAID Administrator.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/11/131786.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112121219/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/11/131786.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-11-12 | title=Nomination of Dr. Rajiv Shah as USAID Administrator | author=[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary Rodham]] | publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] | date=2009-11-10 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>)

The [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] also conducts an assessment process,<ref name="govexec">{{cite news | url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0709/071509l1.htm | title=State Department launches quadrennial review | author=Long, Emily | magazine=[[Government Executive]] | date=2009-07-15 | accessdate=2009-11-13 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226052622/http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0709/071509l1.htm | archive-date=2009-12-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref> the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which is similar to the Defense's review.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/gc_1208534155450.shtm | title=Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>  The [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] also has something of a similar mechanism.<ref name="govexec"/>  However, the State Department has fewer employees available to conduct such an intensive review as the Pentagon; less than a dozen are expected to be assigned to the QDDR staff,<ref name="govexec"/> while the Defense Department employs about 100 people for theirs.<ref name="fp070909">{{cite news | url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/07/09/clinton_to_launch_new_development_initiative | title=Clinton to launch new development initiative | author=Rozen, Laura | magazine=[[Foreign Policy]] | date=2009-07-09 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>  The State Department also has less institutional experience with long-range planning, being more focused towards the management of immediate diplomatic crises,<ref name="govexec"/> although the State Department created the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] in 1947 to integrate long-range planning into the policy-making process. The disparity of resources between State and Defense and the allocation thereof raised questions about State's capacity to implement the planned review.<ref name="govexec"/>

Former U.S. Ambassador [[Ronald E. Neumann]] said that the QDDR was “an intelligent measure” and that Secretary Clinton’s “focus on resources is important and has been too often neglected by secretaries of state who focused only on policy. She understood she’s not going to manage effectively with a busted institution.”<ref name="wi-hrc"/>  The [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]] commended the creation of the QDDR, calling it "an important step toward elevating and strengthening the civilian-led tools of diplomacy and
development."<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS193435+10-Jul-2009+PRN20090710 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122083924/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS193435%2B10-Jul-2009%2BPRN20090710 |archivedate=2010-01-22 |title=USGLC Commends Secretary Clinton's Call for Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development... |agency=[[Reuters]], [[PRNewswire]] |publisher=[[U.S. Global Leadership Campaign]] |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-11-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The [[Project on National Security Reform]] said it was important for the QDDR to meld a top-down approach to managing resources to a bottom-up approach of examining the needs of each embassy abroad.<ref name="govexec"/>  [[The Heritage Foundation]] was skeptical, predicting that "the final QDDR product will repeat past mistakes by maintaining a focus on the traditional official government instruments of foreign aid and will fail to achieve the true integration of all the tools of U.S. foreign and security policy."<ref name="heri">{{cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/ForeignAid/wm2659.cfm | title=State Department Strategy Review Flawed from Start | author=Dale, Helle C. | author2=Roberts, James M. | publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] | date=2009-10-20 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>  The [[Cato Institute]] was also skeptical, saying that the model, the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review, had produced "a series of vacuous documents that commingle vague, unsubstantiated claims about great historical shifts underway ... with threat inflation.

==The first review==
The QDDR held its first meetings in October 2009 at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington]], hosted by the [[U.S. Global Leadership Coalition]].<ref name="heri"/><ref name="pol101409"/>  There, Deputy Secretary Lew took care to say that the review process was not cover for an attempt by the State Department to absorb USAID.<ref name="pol101409">{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1009/QDDR_powwow.html | title=QDDR powwow | author=Rozen, Laura | newspaper=[[Politico]] | date=2009-10-14 | accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref>  Some 400 people attended, with many confused by the process and uncertain how they could influence it.<ref name="pol101409"/>

The first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review was completed in December 2010 and was entitled ''Leading Through Civilian Power''; it was presented by Secretary Clinton and USAID Administrator Shah, to employees of both organizations gathered at a town hall meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/pix/2010/12/153130.htm |title=Photos: Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref>  The 150-page document outlined three key factors that would affect the State Department in coming years:  limited financial resources due to U.S. budgetary constraints and political realities; a rapidly shifting global landscape that features power being spread across many countries and the prevalence of non-national actors; and the ability to respond to problems caused by weak states and incipient or actual conflict with a flexible corps of civilian expertise.<ref name="csm-qddr1"/>

The review also stressed one of Clinton's signature issues, the role of women around the world.  It mentioned women and girls over a 130&nbsp;times and embraced what became known as "[[the Hillary Doctrine]]" by saying, "The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States."<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Valerie M. Hudson|last=Hudson |first=Valerie M. |last2=Leidl |first2=Patricia |title=The Hillary Doctrine: Sex and American Foreign Policy |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |location=New York |year=2015 |isbn=0-231-16492-0 |pages=4, 53}}</ref>

The review set forth a possible bureaucratic overhaul of the State Department, with a number of goals:
* elevation of "civilian power"
* focus on conflict prevention
* elevation of U.S. ambassadors in coordinating work of all abroad-tasked U.S. agencies
* focus on the issues and needs of particular key 'regional hubs' in the world
* defuse crises before violence; team with Defense Department if that fails
* give USAID the Obama administration's global health and agriculture initiatives
* create an undersecretary for civilian security
* create bureaus for energy resources and counterterrorism
* create new coordinator position for cyber issues<ref name="csm-qddr1"/><ref name="wapo-qddr1">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/15/AR2010121507474.html | title=State Dept. review calls for emphasis on averting global crises | author=Sheridan, Mary Beth | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2010-12-16 | accessdate=2011-01-04}}</ref>

Policy-planning director [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]], the lead architect of the review, said that “What we’re trying to say to Congress is, we get it. We realize we’ve got to prove to you and to the American people that we are good stewards of your money.”<ref name="csm-qddr1">{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2010/1215/Hillary-Clinton-s-vision-for-foreign-policy-on-a-tight-budget | title=Hillary Clinton's vision for foreign policy on a tight budget | author=LaFranchi, Howard | newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date=2010-12-15 | accessdate=2011-01-15}}</ref>  The U.S. Global Leadership Coalition viewed the release favorably, saying “The QDDR represents a bold step toward implementing a smart-power foreign policy by elevating our civilian power and ensuring effective, results-driven programs.”<ref name="csm-qddr1"/>

The review would then go to Congress for its review, upon which prospect State Department officials expressed hopefulness;<ref name="wapo-qddr1"/> they also wanted Congress to approve making the QDDR a required, regular part of the State Department process.<ref name="csm-qddr1"/>  Clinton said, “I am determined that this report will not merely gather dust, like so many others.”<ref name="csm-qddr1"/>

===Changes at State===
In implementing changes under the first review, State expanded the scope of two undersecretaries.  The [[Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights]] succeeds the [[Under Secretary for Democracy and Global Affairs]] with a new [[Bureau of Counterterrorism]] (formerly the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j|title=Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights|publisher=}}</ref>  The [[Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment]] succeeds the Under Secretary for Economic, Energy, and Agricultural Affairs and included the new [[Bureau of Energy Resources]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e|title=Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment|publisher=}}</ref>

==Proposed legislation==
In June 2012, Senators [[John Kerry]], [[Ben Cardin]], and [[Marco Rubio]] introduced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act of 2012, proposed legislation that would    update U.S. foreign policy and assistance programs to reflect the ongoing challenges in the world by setting clear diplomatic and development priorities, assuring that U.S. efforts would be effective and efficient, and clarifying the way progress is evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/kerry-cardin-rubio-introduce-qddr-review-act |title=Press Release &#124; Press &#124; Chairman’s Press & Photos &#124; Newsroom &#124; United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations |publisher=Foreign.senate.gov |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>  It passed in the Senate during 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/3341 |title=S.3341 - 112th Congress (2011-2012): Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review Act of 2012 &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>

==Kerry tenure==
Once John Kerry became Secretary of State, speculation began on whether the department would conduct a second QDDR review.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/08/20/foggy_bottom_review_john_kerry_qddr | title=Foggy Bottom Review | author=Norris, John | magazine=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]] | date=2013-09-01 | accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref>  In February 2014, Kerry appointed [[Tom Perriello|Thomas Perriello]] to be Special Representative for the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/dmr/qddr | title=The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR): Leading Through Civilian Power | publisher=U.S. Department of State | accessdate=2014-12-26}}</ref> and then Kerry announced the public launch of the review in April 2014, with the goal being to "identify emerging policy and management priorities and the organizational capabilities needed to maximize the impact and efficiency of this nation's diplomacy and development investments."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/04/225009.htm |title=Secretary of State John Kerry To Launch the 2014 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) |publisher=State.gov |date=2014-04-21 |accessdate=2016-07-18}}</ref>
