==Early life and education==
Sunstein was born on September 21, 1954, in [[Waban, Massachusetts]], to Marian (née Goodrich), a teacher, and Cass Richard Sunstein, a builder, both Jewish.<ref name=bork1/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19400512&id=jnIbAAAAIBAJ&pg=2669,1581238|title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search}}</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/04/mondoweiss-is-a-hate-site/ Washington Post: ""Mondoweiss" is a hate site (Update)" by  David Bernstein] May 4, 2015</ref> He graduated in 1972 from [[Middlesex School]]. He has said that as a teenager, he was briefly infatuated with the works of [[Ayn Rand]], though her "contempt[] toward most of humanity" soon turned him away.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sunstein|first=Cass R.|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/04/09/ayn-rand-siren-selfishness/|title=The Siren of Selfishness|journal=New York Review of Books|date=2020-04-09|access-date=2020-03-19|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref>

In 1975, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from [[Harvard College]], where he was a member of the [[Varsity team|varsity]] [[Squash (sport)|squash]] team and the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. In 1978, Sunstein received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard Law School]], where he was executive editor of the ''[[Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review]]'' and part of a winning team of the [[Ames Moot Court Competition]]. He served as a [[law clerk]] first for Justice [[Benjamin Kaplan]] of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] (1978–1979) and later for [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] (1979–1980).<ref>[http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/3552/cv Cass R. Sunstein : Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906105108/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/3552/cv |date=2013-09-06 }}</ref>

==Career==
Sunstein joined the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] in the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Justice Department]] as an attorney-advisor (1980–1981) and then took a job as an assistant professor of law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] (1981–1983), where he also became an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science (1983–1985). In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its "distinguished service" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.

Sunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course "Elements of the Law", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]]. In the fall of 2008, he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and began serving as the director of its Program on Risk Regulation:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2008/02/19_sunstein.php |title=HLS: News: Sunstein to join Harvard Law School faculty |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref>

<blockquote>The Program on Risk Regulation will focus on how law and policy deal with the central hazards of the 21st century. Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>

On January 7, 2009, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Sunstein would be named to head the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weisman |first1=Jonathan |last2=Bravin |first2=Jess |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123138051682263203 |title=Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 8, 2009 |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivereform.org/SunsteinOIRA.cfm |title=Choices for OIRA: Reinvigorating Protection of Health, Safety, and the Environment |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> and environmentalists.<ref>https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new-regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/</ref> Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views. On September 9, 2009, the Senate voted for [[cloture]]<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress – 1st Session|url=http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=1&vote=00273|publisher=U.S. Senate| date=9 September 2009|access-date=8 July 2014}}</ref> on Sunstein's nomination as Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. The motion passed in a 63–35 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57–40 vote.

In his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.

Sunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary'' (2005), ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'' (2006), and, co-authored with [[Richard Thaler]], ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' (2008).

Sunstein's 2006 book, ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'', explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of [[prediction market]]s, [[open-source software]], and [[wiki]]s. Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]].

Sunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that

<blockquote>People often make poor choices – and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>

The ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|access-date=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|access-date=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|access-date=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref> The "Nudge" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said:
<blockquote>We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behavior changes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | access-date=April 28, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Contributing to the anthology ''Our American Story'' (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He cited the concepts of self-government and equal dignity of human beings, but focused in particular on stories: "an emphasis on what happened before and after the firing shots in Concord and the courageous response of the embattled farmers maintains continuity with the historical facts and offers us something on which we can build."<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Claybourn |editor-first1=Joshua |editor-link1=Joshua Claybourn |title=Our American Story: The Search for a Shared National Narrative |date=2019 |publisher=Potomac Books |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=978-1640121706 |pages=151–159 }}</ref>

Sunstein is a contributing editor to ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The American Prospect]]'' and is a frequent witness before [[United States Congressional committee|congressional committees]]. He played an active role in opposing the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]] in 1998.

In recent years, Sunstein has been a guest writer on ''[[The Volokh Conspiracy]]'' [[Weblog|blog]] as well as the blogs of law professors [[Lawrence Lessig]] ([[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]) and [[Jack Balkin]] ([[Yale Law School|Yale]]). He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a "Sunstein number" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erdős number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–36 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>

He is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990). He received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Copenhagen Business School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-management-society-and-communication|title=Department of Management, Society and Communication - CBS - Copenhagen Business School|date=6 January 2017}}</ref>

==Views==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}

===Legal philosophy===
Sunstein is a proponent of [[judicial minimalism]], arguing that judges should focus primarily on deciding the case at hand, and avoid making sweeping changes to the law or decisions that have broad-reaching effects. Some view him as [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldstein |first=Tom |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-next-justice?page=0,3 |title=The Next Justice: What to expect in the coming months |work=The New Republic |date=April 9, 2010 |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> despite Sunstein's public support for [[George W. Bush]]'s judicial nominees [[Michael W. McConnell]] and [[John G. Roberts]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Tim |url=http://theamericanscene.com/2007/11/14/sunstein-on-the-second-amendment |title=Sunstein on the Second Amendment |publisher=The American Scene |date=November 14, 2007 |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> as well as providing strongly maintained theoretical support for the death penalty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162&context=public_law_and_legal_theory|title=Is Capital Punishment Morally Required? The Relevance of Life-Life Tradeoffs|author=Cass Sunstein|date=2005}}</ref> Conservative libertarian legal scholar [[Richard A. Epstein]] described Sunstein as "one of the more conservative players in the Obama administration."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/epstein-criticizes-sunsteins-critics|title=Epstein Criticizes Sunstein's Critics|last=Epstein|first=Richard}}</ref>

Much of his work also brings [[behavioral economics]] to bear on law, suggesting that the "rational actor" model will sometimes produce an inadequate understanding of how people will respond to legal intervention.

Sunstein has collaborated with academics who have training in behavioral economics, most notably [[Daniel Kahneman]], [[Richard Thaler]], and [[Christine M. Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

According to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.
"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him," argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |access-date=2013-08-07}}</ref>

Sunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term "[[choice architecture|choice architect]]."<ref name=Nudge />

===Military commissions===
In 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, "Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions" and that "President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground." Sunstein scorned as "ludicrous" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5–3 vote.

===First Amendment===
In his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace "disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document."<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to "reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views."<ref name="Cass R. Sunstein 1995, p. 119">Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', p. 119</ref> He is concerned by the present "situation in which like-minded people speak or listen mostly to one another,"<ref>Cass Sunstein, Republic.com 2.0 (Princeton University Press, 2007), p. xii</ref> and thinks that in "light of astonishing economic and technological changes, we must doubt whether, as interpreted, the constitutional guarantee of free speech is adequately serving democratic goals."<ref>Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', p. xi</ref> He proposes a "New Deal for speech [that] would draw on [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis']] insistence on the role of free speech in promoting political deliberation and citizenship."<ref name="Cass R. Sunstein 1995, p. 119" />

=== Animal rights ===
Some of Sunstein's work has addressed the question of animal rights, as he co-authored a book dealing with the subject, has written papers on it, and was an invited speaker at "Facing Animals," an event at Harvard University described as "a groundbreaking panel on animals in ethics and the law."<ref name="Facing Animals">[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2586700172704318361&ei=o8XjSpPAKpXdlQf1-vGtBQ&q=May+9%2C+2007%2C+speech+at+Harvard&hl=en&client=firefox-a Facing Animals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629062643/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2586700172704318361&ei=o8XjSpPAKpXdlQf1-vGtBQ&q=May+9,+2007,+speech+at+Harvard&hl=en&client=firefox-a |date=2011-06-29 }} May 9, 2007 speech at Harvard from Google video</ref> "Every reasonable person believes in animal rights," he says, continuing that "we might conclude that certain practices cannot be defended and should not be allowed to continue, if, in practice, mere regulation will inevitably be insufficient – and if, in practice, mere regulation will ensure that the level of animal suffering will remain very high."<ref name="law.uchicago.edu">{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/157.crs_.animals.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220134847/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/files/157.crs_.animals.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-20 }}, Accessed July 22, 2009</ref>

Sunstein's views on animal rights generated controversy when Sen. [[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.

=== Taxation ===
Sunstein has argued, "We should celebrate tax day."<ref name="home.uchicago.edu">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:

<blockquote>
In what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public… There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/>
</blockquote>

Sunstein goes on to say:
<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between "negative" and "positive" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion – just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps – are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/></blockquote>

=== Marriage ===
In ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. "Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government," argues Sunstein. He continues, "the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people." He goes on further, "Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage," and refers to state-recognized marriage as an "official license scheme."<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>
Sunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>

=== "Conspiracy Theories" and government infiltration ===
Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled "Conspiracy Theories," dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from "cascades" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, "The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be."  They go on to propose that, "the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  |s2cid=55831850 }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, "Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action."<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as "extremist groups."

The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: "We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in [[counterspeech]], marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help." However, the authors advocate that each "instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5)."

Sunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting "nongovernmental officials"; they suggest that "government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes," further warning that "too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed."<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, "might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts." This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly responses.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Sunstein published frequently during the early stages of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that "a lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be" and that they have "an exaggerated sense of their own personal risk". He argued that "as of now, most people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease."

"Unless the disease is contained in the near future, it will induce much more fear, and much more in the way of economic and social dislocation, than is warranted by the actual risk," he wrote. "Many people will take precautionary steps (canceling vacations, refusing to fly, avoiding whole nations) even if there is no adequate reason to do that. Those steps can in turn increase economic dislocations, including plummeting stock prices." He referred to this tendency—prioritizing a lower probability of contracting a particular disease rather than the potentially greater social harms of economic recession—as "probability neglect," a term that he invented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus}}</ref>

A few weeks later, Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that "on the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can't Be Too Careful}}</ref>{{primary inline|date=May 2020}}

=== Star Wars ===

In 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that "Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down," comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as "the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan}}</ref>

"''Star Wars''," he writes, "is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world." This, he argues, is evident even if one "can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke." As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the "hidden message and the real magic of ''Star Wars''" is "its rousing tribute to human freedom."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Sunstein stated that he felt "over the moon about ''Star Wars''." The film franchise, in his view, "casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture," and includes many "puzzles" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:

:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don’t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels

Sunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as "episodes."<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==

==Honors==
In July 2017, Sunstein was elected a [[Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA), the United Kingdom's [[national academy]] for the humanities and social sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elections to the British Academy celebrate the diversity of UK research|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/elections-british-academy-celebrate-diversity-uk-research|website=British Academy|access-date=29 July 2017|date=2 July 2017}}</ref>

In 2018 he was awarded the [[Holberg Prize]] for having "reshaped our understanding of the relationship between the modern regulatory state and constitutional law.
