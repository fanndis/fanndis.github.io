{{short description|Termination of a pregnancy in the United States}}

[[Abortion]] is legal throughout the [[United States]] and its territories, although restrictions and accessibility vary from state to state. Abortion is a controversial and divisive issue in the society, culture and politics of the U.S., and various [[Abortion law|anti-abortion laws]] have been in force in each state since at least 1900. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has generally defended access to abortion, whereas the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has generally sought to restrict abortion access or criminalize abortion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Joshua C.|title=Striving to Rollback or Protect Roe: State Legislation and the Trump-Era Politics of Abortion|journal=Publius: The Journal of Federalism|year=2020|volume=50|issue=3|pages=370–397|language=en|doi=10.1093/publius/pjaa015}}</ref>

Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decisions of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decriminalized abortion nationwide in 1973, abortion was already legal in several states, but the decision in the former case imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject. It established a minimal period during which abortion is legal (with more or fewer restrictions throughout the pregnancy). That basic framework, modified in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), remains nominally in place, although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state, as many [[County|counties]] have no abortion providers.<ref name="Doan3">{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation: The Abortion Wars and Strategies of Political Harassment|date=2007|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472069750|page=57|author1=Alesha Doan}}</ref> ''Planned Parenthood v.

The main actors in the abortion debate are often [[framing (psychology)|framed]] as [[United States abortion-rights movement|pro-choice]], believing that a woman is entitled to choose whether to continue her pregnancy, versus [[United States anti-abortion movement|pro-life]], believing that the fetus has a sacred right to live, though most Americans are found to agree with some positions of each side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148880/Plenty-Common-Ground-Found-Abortion-Debate.aspx|title=Plenty of Common Ground Found in Abortion Debate|last=Saad|first=Lydia|date=August 8, 2011|publisher=Gallup.com|access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> A 2018 [[Gallup survey]] found the percentages of "pro-choice" or "pro-life" respondents were equal (at 48%), but more considered abortion morally wrong (48%) than morally acceptable (43%).

==Terminology==
{{Main|Abortion}}
The abortion debate most commonly relates to the "[[induced abortion]]" of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense.<ref>According to the Supreme Court's decision in ''Roe v. Wade'':
<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.

(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.

(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>

Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as "knowing destruction" or "intentional expulsion or removal".</ref> Some also use the term "elective abortion", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=Katie |title= Why We Should Stop Using the Term "Elective Abortion"|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics |volume=20 |issue=12 |pages=1175–1180 |date=December 20, 2019 |doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175 |pmid=30585581 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

In medical parlance, "abortion" can refer to either [[miscarriage]] or abortion until the fetus is viable. After viability, doctors call an abortion a "termination of pregnancy".

When the United States first became independent, most states applied English [[common law]] to abortion. This meant it was not permitted after [[quickening (medical)|quickening]], or the start of [[fetal movement]]s, usually felt 15–20 weeks after conception.<ref>Levene, Malcolm et al. ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0632051639&id=FHXtDkLzOHEC&pg=RA2-PA8&lpg=RA2-PA8&ots=fkQG1qvn5i&dq=%22quickening%22+and+obese&num=100&sig=-Xgmp3WR71poUh1qJ3oke-5XTOM#PRA2-PA8,M1 Essentials of Neonatal Medicine]'' (Blackwell 2000), page 8.

Abortion has existed in America since [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. The earliest settlers would often encourage abortions before the "quickening" stage in the pregnancy. There were many reasons given for this, including not having resources to bear children. It was not until the late 1800s{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2020}} when states began to make abortions illegal. One reason given for the legislation was that abortions had been performed with dangerous methods and were often surgical. Because of this, many states decided to forbid abortions. As technology advanced and abortion methods improved, abortions still remained illegal. Women would resort to illegal unsafe methods, also known as "[[Unsafe abortion|back alley]]" abortions.

Abortions became illegal by statute in Britain in 1803 with ''[[Lord Ellenborough's Act]].'' Various anti-abortion statutes that codified or expanded common law began to appear in the United States in the 1820s. In 1821, a [[Connecticut]] law targeted [[apothecary|apothecaries]] who sold "poisons" to women for purposes of inducing an abortion, and [[New York (state)|New York]] made post-quickening abortions a felony and pre-quickening abortions a misdemeanor in 1829.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buell|first=Samuel|date=1991|title=Criminal Abortion Revisited|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2798&context=faculty_scholarship|journal=New York University Law Review|volume=66:1774|issue=6|pages=1774–831|via=duke.edu|pmid=11652642}}</ref> Other legal scholars have pointed out that some of the early laws punished not only the doctor or abortionist, but also the woman who hired them.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Suzanne M. |last1=Alford |url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1011 |title=Is Self-Abortion a Fundamental Right? |volume=52 |journal=Duke Law Journal |pages=1011–29 |issue=5 |year=2003 |jstor=1373127 |pmid=12964572 |access-date=2007-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122060327/https://law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1011 |archive-date=2019-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of anti-abortion laws. [[Physician]]s, who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge.  Science had discovered that [[Fertilisation|conception]] inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. Quickening was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of [[gestation]] than any other step. Many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.<ref name="Mohr3536">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these "irregulars" were considered a nuisance to public health.<ref name="Mohr34">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

Despite campaigns to end the practice of abortion, [[abortifacient]] advertising was highly effective. Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates suggest between 20% and 25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended in abortion.<ref name="Mohr7682">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

Before the start of the 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant [[out of wedlock]]. Out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and well over 60% of the married women already had at least one child.<ref name="Mohr100101">{{cite book|title=Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy|author=James C.

In the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War era]], much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning [[women's rights movement]].

Though the medical profession expressed hostility toward feminism, many feminists of the era were also opposed to abortion.<ref>Gordon, Sarah Barringer.

However, physicians remained the loudest voice in the anti-abortion debate, and they carried their agenda to state legislatures around the country, advocating not only anti-abortion laws, but also laws against birth control. This movement presaged the modern debate over women's body rights.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=B|title=Population control I: Birth of an ideology. |journal=International Journal of Health Services|year=1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=523–40|pmid=9285280|doi=10.2190/bl3n-xajx-0yqb-vqbx|s2cid=39035850}}</ref> A campaign was launched against the movement and the use and availability of [[contraceptive]]s.

Criminalization of abortion accelerated from the late 1860s, through the efforts of concerned legislators, doctors, and the [[American Medical Association]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/abortionuslegal/a/abortion.htm |title=Abortion History: A History of Abortion in the United States |access-date=July 7, 2006 |last=Lewis |first=Jone Johnson |work=Women's History section of About.com|publisher=About.com}}</ref> In 1873, [[Anthony Comstock]] created the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], an institution dedicated to supervising the [[morality]] of the public.

In 1900, abortion was a felony in every state.

=== Sherri Finkbine ===
One notable case dealt with a woman named [[Sherri Finkbine]]. Born in the area of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Sherri had 4 healthy children. However, during her pregnancy with her 5th child, she had found that the child might have severe deformities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://advocatesaz.org/2012/08/15/sherri-finkbines-abortion-its-meaning-50-years-later/|title=Sherri Finkbine's Abortion: Its Meaning 50 Years Later|date=August 15, 2012|work=Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona|access-date=December 2, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Finkbine had been taking sleeping pills that contained a drug called [[Thalidomide]] which was also very popular in several countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/thalidomide-the-connectio_b_8881702.html|title=Thalidomide: The Connection Between a Statue in Trafalgar Square, a 1960s Children's Show Host and the Abortion Debate|last=Braun|first=Whitny|date=December 29, 2015|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref> She had later learned that the drug was causing fetal deformities and she wanted to warn the general public. Finkbine strongly wanted an abortion, however the [[abortion law]]s of Arizona limited her decision. In Arizona, an abortion could only occur if the mother's life was in danger. She met with a reporter from ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' and told her story. While Sherri Finkbine wanted to be kept anonymous, the reporter disregarded this idea. On August 18, 1962, Finkbine traveled to [[Sweden]] where she was able to obtain a legal abortion. It was also confirmed that the child would have been very much deformed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/body-health/reproduction/|title=Click - Debating Reproductive Rights - Reproductive Rights and Feminism, History of Abortion Battle, History of Abortion Debate, Roe v.

===Pre-''Roe'' precedents===
In 1964, [[Gerri Santoro]] of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion, and her photo became the symbol of an [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion-rights movement]]. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as "[[Jane Collective|Jane]]" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find "Jane".<ref>{{cite web

In 1965, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Griswold v.

Terms Used in Reference to the Fetus. No. 1.

In 1967, [[Colorado]] became the first state to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical [[disability]] of the woman. Similar laws were passed in [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[North Carolina]]. In 1970, [[Hawaii]] became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman,<ref>{{cite news| title=Medicine: Abortion on Request | date=March 9, 1970 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878789,00.html | access-date=October 15, 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> and New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy.

Vuitch]]''. The court upheld the law, deeming that "health" meant "psychological and physical well-being", essentially allowing abortion in Washington, D. C. By the end of 1972, 13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while [[Mississippi]] allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and [[Alabama]] and [[Massachusetts]] allowed abortions only in cases where the woman's physical health was endangered. In order to obtain abortions during this period, women would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to one where it was legal. The legal position prior to ''Roe v. Wade'' was that abortion was illegal in 30 states and legal under certain circumstances in 20 states.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/22/charts-how-roe-v-wade-changed-abortion-rights/ |title=CHARTS: How Roe v.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. In 1966, the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]] assigned Monsignor [[James T. McHugh]] to document efforts to reform abortion laws, and anti-abortion groups began forming in various states in 1967. In 1968, McHugh led an advisory group which became the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYZQBc9426QC&pg=PA140 |page=140 |title=The Politics of Abortion and Birth Control in Historical Perspective |editor=Donald T.

===''Roe v. Wade''===
{{Main|Roe v. Wade}}
[[File:USSC justice group photo-1973 current.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[United States Supreme Court]] membership in 1973.]]
Prior to ''Roe v. Wade'', 30 states prohibited abortion without exception, 16 states banned abortion except in certain special circumstances (e.g., rape, incest, health threat to mother), 3 states allowed residents to obtain abortions, and New York allowed abortions generally.<ref>[https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue Lessons from Before Roe: Will Past be Prologue?] The Guttmacher Policy Review, Vol. 6 Iss. 1, March 1, 2003. Retrieved January 11, 2017.</ref> Early that year, on January 22, 1973, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' invalidated all of these laws, and set guidelines for the availability of abortion. ''Roe'' established that the [[right of privacy]] of a woman to obtain an abortion "must be considered against important state interests in regulation".<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', {{ussc|410|113|1973|source=j|pin=154}} "We, therefore, conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified, and must be considered against important state interests in regulation."</ref> ''Roe'' established a "[[Gestation#Humans|trimester]]" (i.e., 12 week) threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing "viability" (likelihood of survival outside the uterus) over the course of a pregnancy, such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy.

In deciding ''Roe v. Wade'', the Supreme Court ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] (in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state). In its opinion, it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the Constitution. The Court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases:<blockquote>State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.<ref>''Roe v. Wade'', [https://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011130053106/http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113] (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved April 14, 2011.</ref></blockquote>

The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being.

A central issue in the ''Roe'' case (and in the wider abortion debate in general) is whether human life or personhood begins at conception, birth, or at some point in between. The Court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue, noting: "We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer." Instead, it chose to point out that historically, under English and American [[common law]] and statutes, "the unborn have never been recognized ... as persons in the whole sense", and thus, the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the Fourteenth Amendment. So, rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point, the court simply declared that the State has a "compelling interest" in protecting "potential life" at the point of viability.

====''Doe v. Bolton''====
{{Main|Doe v. Bolton}}
Under ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', state governments may not prohibit [[Late termination of pregnancy|late terminations of pregnancy]] when "necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother", even if it would cause the demise of a viable fetus.<ref>{{ussc|name=Roe v. Wade|volume=410|page=113|pin=164|year=1973}} ("If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during [the third trimester], except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.")</ref> This rule was clarified by the 1973 judicial decision ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', which specifies "that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors — physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age — relevant to the well-being of the patient".<ref>{{ussc|name=Doe v.

===Later judicial decisions===
In the 1992 case of ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', the Court abandoned ''Roe's'' strict trimester framework but maintained its central holding that women have a right to choose to have an abortion before viability.<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}}</ref> ''Roe'' had held that statutes regulating abortion must be subject to "[[strict scrutiny]]" — the traditional Supreme Court test for impositions upon fundamental [[U.S. Constitution|Constitutional]] rights. ''Casey'' instead adopted the lower,   [[undue burden]] standard for evaluating state abortion restrictions,<ref>{{ussc|name=Planned Parenthood v. Casey|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=878}} ("(a) To protect the central right recognized by ''Roe v. Wade'' while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore, a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.")</ref> but re-emphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the [[United States Constitution|constitution]]: "Constitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the [[Fourteenth Amendment Due Process|Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It declares that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.' The controlling word in the cases before us is 'liberty'."<ref>''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'', {{ussc|505|833|1992|source=j|pin=846}}</ref>

The Supreme Court continues to grapple with cases on the subject. On April 18, 2007, it issued a ruling in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', involving a federal law entitled the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]] which President [[George W. Bush]] had signed into law. The law banned [[intact dilation and extraction]], which opponents of abortion rights referred to as "partial-birth abortion", and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to 2.5 years. The United States Supreme Court upheld the 2003 ban by a narrow majority of 5-4, marking the first time the Court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since 1973. The opinion, which came from justice Anthony Kennedy, was joined by Justices [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Clarence Thomas]], and the two recent appointees, [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]].

In the case of ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'', the Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision on June 27, 2016 swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function. The Texas legislature enacted in 2013 restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain "admitting privileges" at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities. The Court struck down these two provisions "facially" from [[Texas House Bill 2|the law at issue]]—that is, the very words of the provisions were invalid, no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation. According to the Supreme Court, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion belongs with the courts, and not the legislatures.<ref name="20160627SCOTUSDenniston">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2016/06/opinion-analysis-abortion-rights-reemerge-strongly/|title=Whole Woman's Health v.

The Supreme Court ruled similarly in ''[[June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo]]'' on June 29, 2020, in a 5–4 decision that a Louisiana state law, modeled after the Texas law at the center of ''Whole Woman's Health'', was unconstitutional.<ref name="nytimes june medical decision"/> Like Texas' law,  the Louisiana law required certain measures for abortion clinics that, if having gone into effect, would have closed five of the six clinics in the state. The case in Louisiana was put on hold pending the result of ''Whole Woman's Health'', and was retried based on the Supreme Court's decision. While the District Court ruled the law unconstitutional, the Fifth Circuit found that unlike the Texas law, the burden of the Louisiana law passed the tests outlined in ''Whole Woman's Health'', and thus the law was constitutional. The Supreme Court issued an order to suspend enforcement of the law pending further review, and agreed to hear the case in full in October 2019. It was the first abortion-related case to be heard by President [[Donald Trump]]'s appointees to the Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-to-review-ruling-on-louisiana-abortion-law/2019/10/04/85eaf2b0-e6ab-11e9-a6e8-8759c5c7f608_story.html | title = Supreme Court to review ruling on Louisiana abortion law | first= Robert | last= Barnes | date =  October 4, 2019 | access-date = October 4, 2019 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}</ref> The Supreme Court found the Louisiana law unconstitutional for the same reasons as the Texas one, reversing the Fifth Circuit.

==Current legal status{{anchor|Current_legal_situation}}==

===Federal legislation===
Since 1995, led by congressional [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of [[intact dilation and extraction]], commonly known as partial birth abortion. Such measures passed twice by wide margins, but [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] [[veto]]ed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable, since the ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'' decision defined "health" in vague terms, justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion. Congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes.

The [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act|Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002]] ("BAIPA") was enacted August 5, 2002 by an Act of Congress and signed into law by George W. Bush. It asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion. A "born-alive infant" is specified as a "person, human being, child, individual". "Born alive" is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural, induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.

On October 2, 2003, with a vote of 281-142, the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] approved the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] to ban partial-birth abortion, with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman. Through this legislation, a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure. A woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure. On October 21, 2003, the [[United States Senate]] passed the bill by a vote of 64-34, with a number of Democrats joining in support. The bill was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on November 5, 2003, but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law. The Supreme Court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' on April 18, 2007, signaling a substantial change in the Court's approach to abortion law.<ref name="nyt-greenhouse">{{cite news | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | author-link = Linda Greenhouse | work = The New York Times | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | date = April 19, 2007 | access-date = January 3, 2010 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html}}</ref> The 5-4 ruling said the ''Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act'' does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion.

The current judicial interpretation of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] regarding abortion, following the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]'s 1973 landmark decision in ''Roe v. Wade'', and subsequent companion decisions, is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees. States have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions, require parental notification for minors, and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure.<ref>[http://www.lawserver.com/abortion Interactive maps comparing U.S. abortion restrictions by state], LawServer</ref>

The official report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, issued in 1983 after extensive hearings on the [[Human Life Amendment]] (proposed by Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] and [[Thomas Eagleton]]), stated that

{{quote|Thus, the [Judiciary] Committee observes that no significant legal barriers of any kind whatsoever exist today in the United States for a mother to obtain an abortion for any reason during any stage of her pregnancy.<ref>Report, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, on Senate Joint Resolution 3, 98th Congress, 98-149, June 7, 1983, p. 6.</ref>}}

One aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the [[fetus]] is "[[Fetal viability|viable]]" outside the womb as a measure of when the "life" of the fetus is its own (and therefore subject to being protected by the state). In the majority opinion delivered by the court in ''Roe v. Wade'', viability was defined as "potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. Viability is usually placed at about [[Prenatal Development|seven months]] (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks". When the court ruled in 1973, the then-current medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as 24 weeks. Advances over the past three decades allow survival of some babies born at 22 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Perinatal Management of Extreme Preterm Birth before 27 weeks of gestation A Framework for Practice |url=https://hubble-live-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/bapm/attachment/file/182/Extreme_Preterm_28-11-19_FINAL.pdf |website=British Association of Perinatal Medicine |access-date=December 4, 2019 |date=October 2019}}</ref>

The legality of abortion is frequently a major issue in nomination battles for the U.S. Supreme Court. Nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings, as the issue may come before them as judges.

The [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], commonly known as "[[Laci Peterson|Laci]] and Conner's Law" was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush on April 1, 2004, allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother (one for the mother and one for the fetus). It specifically bans charges against the mother and/or doctor relating to abortion procedures. Nevertheless, it has generated much controversy among pro-abortion rights advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion.

The [[Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act]] is a [[United States Congress]] bill to ban late-term abortions nationwide after 20 weeks post-[[fertilization]] on the basis that the fetus is capable of feeling pain during an abortion at and after that point of pregnancy. The bill was first introduced in Congress in 2013. It successfully passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2013, 2015, and 2017, but has yet to pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Opponents of the bill reject the claims made by the bill's supporters regarding fetal development, and argue that such a restriction would endanger women's health.

===Number of abortions===
The annual number of legal induced abortions in the US doubled between 1973 and 1979, and peaked in 1990. There was a slow but steady decline throughout the 1990s. Overall, the number of annual abortions decreased by 6% between 2000 and 2009, with temporary spikes in 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last=D.

By 2011, abortion rate in the nation dropped to its lowest point since the Supreme Court legalized the procedure. According to a study performed by Guttmacher Institute, long-acting contraceptive methods had a significant impact in reducing unwanted pregnancies. There were fewer than 17 abortions for every 1,000 women of child-bearing age. That was a 13%-decrease from 2008's numbers and slightly higher than the rate in 1973, when the Supreme Court's ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision legalized abortion. The study indicated a long-term decline in the abortion rate.<ref name=Somashekhar>{{cite news|last=Somashekhar|first=Sandhya|title=Study: Abortion rate at lowest point since 1973|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/study-abortion-rate-at-lowest-point-since-1973/2014/02/02/8dea007c-8a9b-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html?hpid=z2|access-date=February 3, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Moon>{{cite news|last=Moon|first=Angela|title=U.S. abortion rate hits lowest level since 1973: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/02/us-abortionrate-decline-idUSBREA110NV20140202|access-date=February 3, 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=February 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Bassett>{{cite news|last=Bassett|first=Laura|title=U.S. Abortion Rate Hits Lowest Point Since 1973|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/02/abortion-rate-_n_4704986.html|access-date=February 3, 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=February 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Jayson>{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|title=Abortion rate at lowest level since 1973|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/02/02/abortion-recession-medication/5087945/|access-date=February 3, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=February 2, 2014}}</ref>

===Abortion and religion===
A majority of abortions are obtained by religiously identified women. According to the Guttmacher Institute, "more than 7 in 10 U.S. women obtaining an abortion report a religious affiliation (37% protestant, 28% Catholic, and 7% other), and 25% attend religious services at least once a month. The abortion rate for protestant women is 15 per 1,000 women, while Catholic women have a slightly higher rate, 20 per 1,000."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Rachel K|title=Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion|journal=Obstetrics & Gynecology|date=June 2011|volume=117|issue=6|pages=1358–1366|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31821c405e|pmid=21606746|s2cid=21593113}}</ref>

===Abortions and ethnicity===
Abortion rates tend to be higher among minority women in the U.S. In 2000–2001, due to lower access to health care and contraception, the rates among black and Hispanic women were 49 per 1,000 and 33 per 1,000, respectively, vs. 13 per 1,000 among non-Hispanic white women. Note that this figure includes all women of reproductive age, including women that are not pregnant. In other words, these abortion rates reflect the rate at which U.S. women of reproductive age have an abortion each year.<ref>Guttmacher.org{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/characteristics.html |title=Get "In the Know": Questions About Pregnancy, Contraception and Abortion |access-date=April 26, 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311171704/http://www.guttmacher.org/in-the-know/characteristics.html |archive-date=March 11, 2008 }}</ref>

===When women have abortions (by gestational age)===
According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2011, most (64.5%) abortions were performed by ≤8 weeks' gestation, and nearly all (91.4%) were performed by ≤13 weeks' gestation. Few abortions (7.3%) were performed between 14 and 20 weeks' gestation or at ≥21 weeks' gestation (1.4%). From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of all abortions performed at ≤8 weeks' gestation increased 6%.

Americans have been equally divided on the issue; a May 2018 [[Gallup poll]] indicated that 48% of Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" and 48% described themselves as "pro-life".{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} A July 2018 poll indicated that 64% of Americans did not want the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, while 28% did.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx | title=Gallup: Abortion | publisher=[[Gallup poll]]| date=June 22, 2007 }}</ref> The same poll found that support for abortion being generally legal was 60% during the first trimester, dropping to 28% in the second trimester, and 13% in the third trimester.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/235469/trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx |title = Trimesters Still Key to U.S. Abortion Views|date = June 13, 2018}}</ref>

Support for the legalization of abortion has been consistently higher among more educated adults than less educated,{{ r | Gallop_Ed_level_2010 }} and in 2019, 70% of college graduates support abortion being legal in all or most cases, compared to 60% of those with some college, and 54% of those with a high school degree or less.{{ r | PEW_2019 }}

In January 2013, a majority of Americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a poll by [[NBC News]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref name=NBCWSJpoll>{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Mark |url=http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/21/16626932-nbcwsj-poll-majority-for-first-time-want-abortion-to-be-legal?lite |title=NBC/WSJ poll: Majority, for first time, want abortion to be legal |publisher=NBC News |date=January 21, 2013 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> Approximately 70% of respondents in the same poll opposed ''Roe v.

Gallup declared in May 2010 that more Americans identifying as "pro-life" is "the new normal", while also noting that there had been no increase in opposition to abortion. It suggested that political polarization may have prompted more Republicans to call themselves "pro-life".<ref>{{cite web|last=Saad |first=Lydia |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/128036/New-Normal-Abortion-Americans-Pro-Life.aspx |title=The New Normal on Abortion: Americans More "Pro-Life" |publisher=Gallup |date=May 14, 2010 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> The terms "pro-choice" and "pro-life" do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, seven in ten Americans described themselves as "pro-choice" while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life".

===By circumstance or reasons===
According to Gallup's long-time polling on abortion, the majority of Americans are neither strictly "pro-life" or "pro-choice"; it depends upon the circumstances of the pregnancy. Gallup polling from 1996 to 2009 consistently reveals that when asked the question, "Do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances, legal only under certain circumstances, or illegal in all circumstances?", Americans repeatedly answer 'legal only under certain circumstances'. According to the poll, in any given year 48-57% say legal only under certain circumstances (for 2009, 57%), 21-34% say legal under any circumstances (for 2009, 21%), and 13-19% illegal in all circumstances (for 2009, 18%), with 1-7% having no opinion (for 2009, 4%).<ref name="gallup1"/>

* A June 2000 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' survey found that, although 57% of polltakers considered abortion to be murder, half of that 57% believed in allowing women access to abortion. The survey also found that, overall, 65% of respondents did not believe abortion should be legal after the first trimester, including 72% of women and 58% of men. Further, the survey found that 85% of Americans polled supported abortion in cases of risk to a woman's physical health, 54% if the woman's mental health was at risk, and 66% if a congenital abnormality was detected in the fetus.<ref>Rubin, Allisa J.

* An April 2006 [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris]] poll on ''Roe v. Wade'', asked, "In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that states' laws which made it illegal for a woman to have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy were unconstitutional, and that the decision on whether a woman should have an abortion up to three months of pregnancy should be left to the woman and her doctor to decide. In general, do you favor or oppose this part of the U.S. Supreme Court decision making abortions up to three months of pregnancy legal?", to which 49% of respondents indicated favor while 47% indicated opposition.

==Abortion financing==
[[File:State abortion funding.svg|thumb|State Medicaid coverage of medically necessary abortion services.<br />'''Navy blue''': Medicaid covers medically necessary abortion for low-income women through legislation<br />'''Royal blue''': Medicaid covers medically necessary abortions for low-income women under court order<br />'''Gray''': Medicaid denies abortion coverage for low-income women except for cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment.]]
The abortion debate has also been extended to the question of who pays the medical costs of the procedure, with some states using the mechanism as a way of reducing the number of abortions. The cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location, facility, timing, and type of procedure. In 2005, a non-hospital abortion at 10 weeks' gestation ranged from $90 to $1,800 (average: $430), whereas an abortion at 20 weeks' gestation ranged from $350 to $4,520 (average: $1,260). Costs are higher for a medical abortion than a first-trimester surgical abortion.

===Medicaid===
The [[Hyde Amendment]] is a federal legislative provision barring the use of federal Medicaid funds to pay for abortions except for rape and incest.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Hyde Amendment | publisher = National Committee for a Human Life Amendment | date = April 2008 | url = http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf | access-date = January 23, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091116133030/http://www.nchla.org/datasource/ifactsheets/4FSHydeAm22a.08.pdf | archive-date = November 16, 2009 }} text and history</ref> The provision, in various forms, was in response to ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since 1976, and represented the first major legislative success by the [[pro-life movement]]. The law requires that states cover abortions under Medicaid in the event of rape, incest, and life endangerment. Based on the federal law:
* 32 states and D. C. fund abortions through Medicaid only in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. SD covers abortions only in the cases of life endangerment, which does not comply with federal requirements under the Hyde Amendment. IN, UT, and WI have expanded coverage to women whose physical health is jeopardized, and IA, MS, UT, and VA also include fetal abnormality cases.
* 17 states (AK, AZ, CA, CT, HI, IL, MD, MA, MN, MT, NJ, NM, NY, OR, VT, WA, WV) use their own funds to cover all or most "medically necessary" abortions sought by low-income women under Medicaid, 12 of which are required by State court orders to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|author=Francis Roberta W.|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|work=Equal Rights Amendment|access-date=September 13, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417234051/http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm|archive-date=April 17, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Private insurance===
* 5 states (ID, KY, MO, ND, OK) restrict insurance coverage of abortion services in private plans: OK limits coverage to life endangerment, rape or incest circumstances; and the other four states limit coverage to cases of life endangerment.
* 11 states (CO, KY, MA, MS, NE, ND, OH, PA, RI, SC, VA) restrict abortion coverage in insurance plans for public employees, with CO and KY restricting insurance coverage of abortion under any circumstances.
* U.S. laws also ban federal funding of abortions for federal employees and their dependents, Native Americans covered by the Indian Health Service, military personnel and their dependents, and women with disabilities covered by Medicare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/womenshealth/upload/3269-02.pdf |title=Women's Health Policy Facts |year=2008 |access-date=January 2, 2009 |publisher=The Henry J.

===[[Mexico City policy]]===
Under this policy, US federal funding to NGOs that provide abortion is not permitted.

==Positions of U.S. political parties==
Though members of both major political parties come down on either side of the issue, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] is often seen as being [[anti-abortion]], since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers unborn fetuses to have an inherent right to life. [[Republicans for Choice]] represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 9% of Republicans favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances.<ref name="zogby1">{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603220555/http://www.zogby.com/search/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1060 |date=June 3, 2008 }} (archived from [http://www.zogby.com/search/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1060 the original] on June 3, 2008)</ref> Of Republican National Convention delegates in 2004, 13% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 38% believed that it should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 17% of all Republican voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 38% believed that it should not be permitted.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/politics/20040829_gop_poll/2004_gop_results.pdf |title=The New York Times/CBS News Poll 2004 Republican National Delegate Survey (Q29)|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] platform considers abortion to be a woman's right. [[Democrats for Life of America]] represents the minority of that party. In 2006, pollsters found that 74% of Democrats favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances.<ref name="zogby1"/> Of Democratic National Convention delegates in 2004, 75% believed that abortion should be generally available, and 2% believed that abortion should not be permitted. The same poll showed that 49% of all Democratic voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it, while 13% believed that it should not be permitted.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/politics/20040724poll/20040724_delegates_poll_results.pdf |title=The New York Times/CBS News Poll 2004 Democratic National Delegate Survey (Q29)| work=The New York Times}}</ref>

The [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] of the United States supports legal abortion as a woman's right.

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] platform (2012) states that "government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration".<ref>[http://www.lp.org/platform National Platform of the Libertarian Party, 1.4 Abortion], adopted in Convention, May 2012.</ref> Abortion is a [[libertarian perspectives on abortion|contentious issue]] among Libertarians, and the Maryland-based organization [[Libertarians for Life]] opposes the legality of abortion in most circumstances.

The issue of abortion has become deeply politicized: in 2002, 84% of state [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] platforms supported the right to having an abortion while 88% of state [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] platforms opposed it. This divergence also led to [[Christian Right]] organizations like [[Christian Voice (USA)|Christian Voice]], [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Moral Majority]] having an increasingly strong role in the Republican Party. This opposition has been extended under the Foreign Assistance Act: in 1973 [[Jesse Helms]] introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas, and in 1984 the [[Mexico City Policy]] prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions. The "Mexico City Policy" was revoked by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] and subsequently reinstated by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]]. President [[Barack Obama]] overruled this policy by Executive Order on January 23, 2009,{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} and it was reinstated on January 23, 2017, by President Donald Trump.

==Effects of legalization==
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Winter 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The 2013 winter issue of ''[[Ms. magazine]]'' was about abortion rights ]]
The risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since legalization in 1973, due to increased physician skills, improved medical technology, and earlier termination of pregnancy.<ref name="BeforeAfter" /> From 1940 through 1970, deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from nearly 1,500 to a little over 100.<ref name="BeforeAfter">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490220075032 |title=Induced Termination of Pregnancy Before and After Roe v Wade: Trends in the Mortality and Morbidity of Women |year=1992 |last1=Coble |first1=Yank D. |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=268 |issue=22 |page=3231}}</ref> According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of women who died in 1972 from illegal abortion was thirty-nine.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Lilo T. |last1=Strauss |first2=Joy |last2=Herndon |first3=Jeani |last3=Chang |first4=Wilda Y. |last4=Parker |first5=Sonya V. |last5=Bowens |first6=Suzanne B. |last6=Zane |first7=Cynthia J. |last7=Berg |journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |pmid=15562258 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5309a1.htm |year=2004 |last8=Berg |first8=CJ |title=Abortion surveillance--United States, 2001 |volume=53 |issue=9 |pages=1–32}}</ref>

The [[Roe effect]] is an hypothesis which suggests that since supporters of abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having fewer children, the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion. The [[legalized abortion and crime effect]] is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime, because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals.

Since ''Roe v. Wade'', there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision. In the 2011 election season, Mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion. The personhood amendment defined personhood as "every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning or the functional equivalent thereof". If passed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in the state.<ref name="Mississippi and Personhood">{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/08/mississippi-personhood-amendment_n_1082546.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Mississippi 'Personhood' Amendment Vote Fails | date=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

On July 11, 2012, a Mississippi federal judge ordered an extension of his temporary order to allow the state's only abortion clinic to stay open. The order will stay in place until U.S. District Judge [[Daniel Porter Jordan III]] can review newly drafted rules on how the Mississippi Department of Health will administer a new abortion law. The law in question came into effect on July 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Rich|title=Judge lets Mississippi's only abortion clinic stay open -- for now|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

According to a 2019 study, if ''Roe v. Wade'' is reversed and abortion bans are implemented in trigger law states and states considered highly likely to ban abortion, "increases in travel distance are estimated to prevent 93,546 to 143,561 women from accessing abortion care."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Caitlin|last2=Jones|first2=Rachel|last3=Upadhyay|first3=Ushma|date=July 31, 2019|title=Predicted changes in abortion access and incidence in a post-Roe world|journal=Contraception|volume=100|issue=5|pages=367–373|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2019.07.139|pmid=31376381|issn=0010-7824|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Unintended live birth==
Although it is uncommon, women sometimes give birth in spite of an attempted abortion.<ref name=RCOG_Term>{{cite journal|title=Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality|journal=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|quote=" Live birth following medical termination of pregnancy before 21+6 weeks of gestation is very uncommon. Nevertheless, women and their partners should be counselled about this unlikely possibility and staff should be trained to deal with this eventuality. Instances of recorded live birth and survival increase as gestation at birth extends from 22 weeks. In accordance with prior RCOG guidance, feticide should be routinely offered from 21+6 weeks of gestation.Where the fetal abnormality is not compatible with survival, termination of pregnancy without prior feticide may be preferred by some women. In such cases, delivery management should be discussed and planned with the parents and all health professionals involved and a written care plan agreed before termination takes place.
