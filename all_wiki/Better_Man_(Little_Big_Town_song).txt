==Background==
[[File:191125 Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.png|thumb|150px|American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] is the sole writer of "Better Man", which was written for her 2012 album [[Red (Taylor Swift album)|''Red'']] but not included on the final tracklist.|alt=]]

The song was written about the breakup of a relationship by [[Taylor Swift]].

==Critical reception==
Kevin John Coyne of ''Country Universe'' rated the song "A", saying that "It’s a concept that is grounded in so much truth that I’m amazed I’ve never heard it approached this way before" and "The writers do a great job of capturing both why [the song's narrator] stayed so long and why she had to leave, and all of the conflicting feelings that go along with that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2016/10/27/single-review-little-big-town-better-man/|title=Single Review: Little Big Town, "Better Man"|last=Coyne|first=Kevin John|date=October 27, 2016|work=Country Universe|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Taste of Country]] writer Billy Dukes also praised the song, saying that "This song isn’t as jarring as some of the quartet’s most recent hits. In fact, the mistreatment of women is only vaguely alluded to — there’s no one line that burns the hair off the back of your neck. Jay Joyce’s arrangement is soft but not stark. It’s among his more mainstream productions. Still, it’s clear Fairchild’s protagonist is reeling from a love that went very, very wrong."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/little-big-town-better-man/|title=Little Big Town, ‘Better Man’ [Listen]|last=Dukes|first=Billy|work=[[Taste of Country]]|accessdate=February 18, 2017}}</ref> [[Taste Of Country|Taste of Country]] ranked it the 42nd best country song of the 2010s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/best-country-songs-2010s/|title=It's Official: We've Picked the 50 Best Country Songs of the 2010s|last=Dukes|first=Billy|website=Taste of Country|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>
