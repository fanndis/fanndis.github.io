===1969–1990: Incorporation and growth as a regional power===
[[File:Walmartlogo2.png|thumb|Logo used 1964–1981]]

The company was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] as '''Wal-Mart, Inc.''' on October 31, 1969, and changed its name to '''Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.''' in 1970. The same year, the company opened a home office and first distribution center in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Arkansas]]. It had 38{{nbsp}}stores operating with 1,500 employees and sales of $44.2{{nbsp}}million. It began trading stock as a [[Public company|publicly held company]] on October 1, 1970, and was soon listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. The first [[stock split]] occurred in May 1971 at a price of $47 per share. By this time, Walmart was operating in five states: Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, and Oklahoma; it entered Tennessee in 1973 and Kentucky and Mississippi in 1974. As the company moved into Texas in 1975, there were 125{{nbsp}}stores with 7,500 employees and total sales of $340.3{{nbsp}}million.<ref name="timeline" />

In the 1980s, Walmart continued to grow rapidly, and by the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, there were 1,198 stores with sales of $15.9{{nbsp}}billion and 200,000 associates.<ref name="timeline" />

This year also marked the completion of the company's satellite network, a $24{{nbsp}}million investment linking all stores with two-way voice and data transmissions and one-way video communications with the Bentonville office.

In 2005, Walmart reported {{US$|312.4{{nbsp}}billion}} in sales, more than 6,200 facilities around the world—including 3,800 stores in the United States and 2,800 elsewhere, employing more than 1.6{{nbsp}}million associates. Its U.S. presence grew so rapidly that only small pockets of the country remained more than {{convert|60|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the nearest store.<ref>{{cite conference |first = Matthew |last = Zook |author2 = Graham, Mark |editor-first = Stanley D. |editor-last = Brunn |title = Wal-Mart Nation: Mapping the Reach of a Retail Colossus |book-title = Wal-Mart World: The World's Biggest Corporation in the Global Economy |pages = 15–25 |publisher = Routledge |year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-415-95137-1 }}</ref>

As Walmart rapidly expanded into the world's largest corporation, many critics worried about its effect on local communities, particularly small towns with many "[[Small business|mom and pop]]" stores. There have been several studies on the economic impact of Walmart on small towns and local businesses, jobs, and taxpayers. In one, Kenneth Stone, a professor of economics at [[Iowa State University]], found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening.<ref name="Rural">Stone, Kenneth E. (1997). "[https://www.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/stone/10yrstudy.pdf Impact of the Wal-Mart Phenomenon on Rural Communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120110527/http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/faculty/stone/10yrstudy.pdf |date=January 20, 2016 }}".

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in September 2005, Walmart used its logistics network to organize a rapid response to the disaster, donating $20{{nbsp}}million, 1,500 truckloads of merchandise, food for 100,000 meals, and the promise of a job for every one of its displaced workers.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/05/AR2005090501598.html |title = Wal-Mart at Forefront of Hurricane Relief |date = September 6, 2005 |work = The Washington Post |access-date = March 10, 2009 |author = Barbaro, Michael |author2 = Gillis, Justin |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090604185015/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/05/AR2005090501598.html |archive-date = June 4, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> An independent study by Steven Horwitz of [[St. Lawrence University]] found that Walmart, [[The Home Depot]], and [[Lowe's]] made use of their local knowledge about supply chains, infrastructure, decision makers and other resources to provide emergency supplies and reopen stores well before the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) began its response.<ref name="Kouzes 10">{{cite book |last1 = Kouzes |first1 = James |last2 = Posner |first2 = Barry |others = Mark Huffman, ConsumerAffairs.com |date = July 6, 2010 |title = The Challenge Continues, Participant Workbook: Enable Others to Act |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C2e7_FkKkJgC |publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] |page = 24 |isbn = 978-0-470-40284-9 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623200304/https://books.google.com/books?id=C2e7_FkKkJgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date = June 23, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> While the company was overall lauded for its quick response amidst [[Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina|criticism]] of FEMA, several critics were quick to point out that there still remained issues with the company's labor relations.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://money.cnn.com/2005/09/09/news/fortune500/walmart_image/index.htm |title = Wal-Mart redeems itself, but what's next |date = September 9, 2005 |publisher = CNN |access-date = March 10, 2009 |author = Bhatnagar, Parija |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091112103847/http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/09/news/fortune500/walmart_image/index.htm |archive-date = November 12, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2006, Walmart announced that it would remodel its U.S. stores to help it appeal to a wider variety of demographics, including more affluent shoppers. As part of the initiative, the company launched a new store in Plano, Texas, that included high-end electronics, jewelry, expensive wines and a sushi bar.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/14714027/ns/business-us_business/t/wal-mart-drop-one-size-fits-all-approach/#.W1c9sdhKhTY|title=Wal-Mart to drop one-size-fits-all approach|date=September 7, 2006|work=msnbc.com|access-date=July 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

On September 12, 2007, Walmart introduced new advertising with the [[slogan]], "''Save money. Live better.''", replacing "''Always Low Prices, Always''", which it had used for the previous 19 years. [[Global Insight]], which conducted the research that supported the ads, found that Walmart's [[price level]] reduction resulted in savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006, which equated to $957 per person or $2,500 per household (up 7.3 percent from the 2004 savings estimate of $2,329).<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/us-walmart-advertising-idUSWEN091820070912 |title = Wal-Mart rolling out new company slogan |work = Reuters |date = September 12, 2007 |access-date = December 7, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210111723/http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/12/us-walmart-advertising-idUSWEN091820070912 |url-status=live |archive-date = February 10, 2013 }}</ref>

On June 30, 2008, Walmart removed the hyphen from its logo and replaced the star with a ''Spark'' symbol that resembles a sunburst, flower, or star.

In September 2019, Walmart made the announcement that it would cease the sale of all e-cigarettes due to "regulatory complexity and uncertainty" over the products.

===2020s: Continuing growth and development===
[[File:Walmart Coronavirus notices.jpg|thumb|Signs on a Walmart indicated changes due to the Coronavirus]]

This decade, as with many other companies, started off very unorthodox and unusual, due to the large part to the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic]], including store closures, limited store occupancy and employment, along with social distancing protocols.

In March 2020, due to the pandemic, Walmart changed some of its employee benefits. Employees can now decide to stay home and take unpaid leave if they feel unable to work or uncomfortable coming to work. Additionally, Walmart employees who contract the virus will receive "up to two weeks of pay". After two weeks, hourly associates who are unable to return to work are eligible for up to 26 weeks in pay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-changes-walmart-starbucks-employee-benefits-2020-3|title=From Walmart to Burger King's parent company, these 14 retail companies are changing their benefits policies amid the coronavirus pandemic|last=Jiang|first=Irene|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> During this pandemic, people who work temporary receive $150 but for those who work full-time get a bonus of $300 issuing all of the employees more than $390M starting on June 5.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-27|title=Walmart pays another round of cash bonuses to US hourly employees working during pandemic|url=https://fox6now.com/2020/06/27/walmart-pays-another-round-of-cash-bonuses-to-us-hourly-employees-working-during-pandemic/|access-date=2020-06-28|website=FOX6Now.com|language=en}}</ref> Previously during the pandemic on April 2, the bonus cash totaling was more than $365.

==== Walmart Supercenter ====
<!-- Courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]]: [[Walmart Supercenters]] and [[Walmart Supercenter]] redirect here. -->
[[File:Walmart Supercenter, North Windham, CT.jpg|alt=A Walmart Supercenter store|thumb|A Walmart Supercenter in [[Windham, Connecticut]]]]
'''Walmart Supercenters''', branded simply as "Walmart", are [[hypermarket]]s with sizes varying from {{convert|69000|to|260000|sqft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, but averaging about {{convert|178000|sqft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.<ref name="2020 10-K" /> These stock general merchandise and a full-service supermarket, including meat and poultry, [[baking|baked goods]], [[delicatessen]], [[frozen food]]s, dairy products, garden [[produce]], and fresh seafood. Many Walmart Supercenters also have a garden center, [[pet store|pet shop]], [[pharmacy]], Tire & [[Oil change|Lube]] Express, optical center, [[Photographic processing|one-hour photo processing lab]], portrait studio, and numerous alcove shops, such as cellular phone stores, hair and nail salons, video rental stores, local bank branches (such as [[Woodforest National Bank]] branches in newer locations), and fast food outlets.

Many Walmart Supercenters have featured [[McDonald's]] restaurants, but in 2007, Walmart announced it would stop opening McDonald's restaurants at most of their newer stores, most likely due to nutritional concerns. Most locations that opened up after the announcement had Subway as their restaurants, and some McDonald's inside the stores were replaced with [[Subway (restaurant)|Subways]].<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/13/walmart-dumps-mcdonalds-f_n_64322.html |work = Huffington Post |first = Michelle |last = Kung |title = Walmart Dumps McDonald's For Subway As In-Store Restaurateur |date = September 13, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160831234228/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/09/13/walmart-dumps-mcdonalds-f_n_64322.html |archive-date = August 31, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> In some Canadian locations, [[Tim Hortons]] were opened. Recently, in several Supercenters, like the [[Tallahassee, Florida]], location, Walmart added [[Burger King]] to their locations, and the location in [[Glen Burnie, Maryland]], due to its past as a hypermarket called Leedmark, which operated from May 1991 to January 1994, boasts an [[Auntie Anne's]] and an Italian restaurant

Some locations also have fuel stations which sell gasoline distributed by [[Murphy USA]] (which spun off from [[Murphy Oil]] in 2013), [[Sunoco, Inc.]] ("Optima"), the [[Tesoro Corporation]] ("Mirastar"), USA Gasoline, and even now Walmart-branded gas stations.<ref name="CSNews_WMGas" />

The first Supercenter opened in Washington, Missouri, in 1988. A similar concept, [[Hypermart USA]], had opened a year earlier in [[Garland, Texas]]. All Hypermart USA stores were later closed or converted into Supercenters.

{{As of|2020|10|31|df=US|post=,}} there were 3,570 Walmart Supercenters in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.<ref name="Unit Counts & Square Footage" /><ref name="Unit Counts by Country" /> Hawaii is the only state to not have a Supercenter location. The largest Supercenter in the world, covering {{convert|260000|sqft|abbr=off|sp=us}} on two floors, is located in [[Crossgates Commons]] in [[Albany, New York]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.albany.com/news/walmart.cfm |title = Largest Walmart Supercenter In US Finds Home In Albany NY |publisher = Albany.com |access-date = December 23, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012220544/http://www.albany.com/news/walmart.cfm |archive-date = October 12, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

A typical supercenter sells approximately 120,000 items, compared to the 35 million products sold in Walmart's online store.<ref>{{cite news |last = Boyle |first = Matthew |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-12/wal-mart-to-discount-1-million-online-items-picked-up-in-stores |title = Wal-Mart to Discount One Million Online Items Picked Up in Stores |work = [[Bloomberg News]] |date = April 12, 2017 |access-date = April 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170412042938/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-12/wal-mart-to-discount-1-million-online-items-picked-up-in-stores |archive-date = April 12, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

The "Supercenter" name has since been phased out, with these stores now simply referred to as "Walmart", since the company introduced the new Walmart logo in 2008. However, the branding is still used in Walmart's Canadian stores (spelled as "Supercentre" in Canadian English).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://walmartcanada.ca/Pages/History/168/170/170 |title = Walmart Canada – Corporate Information |publisher = Walmartcanada.ca |access-date = April 24, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141204021716/http://walmartcanada.ca/Pages/History/168/170/170 |archive-date = December 4, 2014 }}</ref>

'''Walmart Discount Stores''', also branded as simply "Walmart", are discount department stores with sizes varying from {{convert|30000|to|206000|sqft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, with the average store covering {{convert|105000|sqft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.<ref name="2020 10-K" /> They carry [[general merchandise]] and limited [[grocery|groceries]]. Some newer and remodeled discount stores have an expanded grocery department, similar to Target's PFresh department. Many of these stores also feature a garden center, pharmacy, Tire & Lube Express, optical center, one-hour photo processing lab, portrait studio, a bank branch, a cell phone store, and a fast food outlet. Some also have gasoline stations.<ref name="CSNews_WMGas">{{cite news |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/Walmart-to-offer-customers-discount-gas-as-prices-rise.html |title = Walmart to Offer Customers Discount Gas As Prices Rise |publisher = [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg.com]] |date = August 29, 2012 |access-date = December 7, 2012 |author = Welch, David |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120907230614/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/wal-mart-to-offer-customers-discount-gas-as-prices-rise.html |url-status=live |archive-date = September 7, 2012 }}</ref> Discount Stores were Walmart's original concept, though they have since been surpassed by Supercenters.

In 1990, Walmart opened its first Bud's Discount City location in Bentonville. Bud's operated as a closeout store, much like [[Big Lots]]. Many locations were opened to fulfill leases in shopping centers as Walmart stores left and moved into newly built Supercenters. All of the Bud's Discount City stores had closed or converted into Walmart Discount Stores by 1997.<ref name="DSN Retailing Today 97">{{cite news |title = Wal-Mart shuttering 7-year old Bud's chain |url = http://www.nexis.com/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=5J0R-BSJ1-DYBW-21K0&csi=8399&oc=00240&perma=true |newspaper = DSN Retailing Today |date = August 4, 1997 |access-date = February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307161925/http://www.nexis.com/docview/getDocForCuiReq?lni=5J0R-BSJ1-DYBW-21K0&csi=8399&oc=00240&perma=true |archive-date = March 7, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

'''Walmart Express''' was a chain of smaller discount stores with a range of services from groceries to check cashing and gasoline service. The concept was focused on small towns deemed unable to support a larger store, and large cities where space was at a premium. Walmart planned to build 15 to 20 Walmart Express stores, focusing on Arkansas, North Carolina and Chicago, by the end of its fiscal year in January 2012. {{As of|2014|September|df=US|post=,}} Walmart re-branded all of its Express format stores to Neighborhood Markets in an effort to streamline its retail offer.

==== Initiatives ====
In September 2006, Walmart announced a pilot program to sell [[generic drug]]s at $4{{nbsp}}per prescription. The program was launched at stores in the [[Tampa, Florida]], area, and by January 2007 had been expanded to all stores in Florida. While the average price of generics is{{nbsp}}$29 per prescription, compared to{{nbsp}}$102 for name-brand drugs, Walmart maintains that it is not selling at a loss, or providing them as an act of charity—instead, they are using the same mechanisms of mass distribution that it uses to bring lower prices to other products.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6119292 |title = Walmart to Sell Generic Drugs for $4 |last = Silberner |first = Joanne |date = September 21, 2006 |publisher = [[All Things Considered]] ([[NPR]]) |access-date = March 10, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100127064901/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6119292 |archive-date = January 27, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Many of Walmart's low cost generics are imported from India, where they are made by drug makers that include [[Ranbaxy Laboratories|Ranbaxy]] and [[Cipla]].<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=326184 |title = Pharma firms boost Walmart revenues |newspaper = [[Business Standard]] |date = June 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130117025420/http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=326184 |archive-date = January 17, 2013 }}</ref>

These workers experienced harsh living conditions in tightly packed trailers outside of the work facility, physical threats, verbal abuse and were forced to work day-long shifts. Many of the workers were afraid to take action about the abuse due to the fact that the manager threatened the lives of their family members in the U.S. and Mexico if the abuse were to be reported. Eight of the workers confronted management at CJ's Seafood about the mistreatment; however, the management denied the abuse allegations and the workers went on strike. The workers then took their stories to Walmart due to their partnership with CJ's. While Walmart was investigating the situation, the workers collected 150,000 signatures of supporters who agreed that Walmart should stand by the workers and take action. In June 2012, the visa workers held a protest and day-long hunger strike outside of the apartment building where a Walmart board member resided. Following this protest, Walmart announced its final decision to no longer work with CJ's Seafood. Less than a month later, the Department of Labor fined CJ's Seafood "approximately $460,000 in back-pay, safety violations, wage and hour violations, civil damages and fines for abuses to the H-2B program. The company has since shut down."<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/mexican-guest-workers-gain-walmart-federal-response-louisiana-usa-2012 |title = Mexican guest workers gain Walmart, federal response, Louisiana, USA, 2012 |last = Capron |first = Christopher |date = November 11, 2012 |website = Global Nonviolent Action Database |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170929000345/https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/mexican-guest-workers-gain-walmart-federal-response-louisiana-usa-2012 |archive-date = September 29, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date = September 28, 2017 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Competition ===
In North America, Walmart's primary competitors include [[grocery store]]s and [[department store]]s like [[Aldi]], [[Lidl]], [[Kmart]], [[Kroger]], [[Ingles]], [[Publix]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Harris Teeter]], [[Meijer]], and [[Winn Dixie]] in the United States; [[Hudson's Bay Company|Hudson's Bay]], [[Loblaw Companies|Loblaw retail stores]], [[Sobeys]], [[Metro Inc.|Metro]], and [[Giant Tiger]] in Canada; and [[Comercial Mexicana]] and [[Soriana]] in Mexico. Competitors of Walmart's Sam's Club division are [[Costco]] and the smaller [[BJ's Wholesale Club]] chain. Walmart's move into the grocery business in the late 1990s set it against major supermarket chains in both the United States and Canada. Several smaller retailers, primarily [[Variety store|dollar stores]], such as [[Family Dollar]] and [[Dollar General]], have been able to find a small niche market and compete successfully against Walmart.<ref>{{cite news |author = Stilgoe, John |url = https://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/23/wal_mart_giant_can_be_tamed |title = Wal-Mart Giant Can Be Tamed |work = The Boston Globe |date = November 23, 2003 |access-date = January 11, 2006 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010529/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/23/wal_mart_giant_can_be_tamed/ |archive-date = March 28, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2004, Walmart responded by testing its own dollar store concept, a subsection of some stores called "Pennies-n-Cents."<ref>{{cite web |author = Berner, Robert |url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_19/b3882086.htm |title = Out-Discounting the Discounter |work = BusinessWeek |date = May 10, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120629083316/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_19/b3882086.htm |archive-date = June 29, 2012 }}</ref>

Walmart also had to face fierce competition in some foreign markets. For example, in Germany it had captured just 2{{nbsp}}percent of the German food market following its entry into the market in 1997 and remained "a secondary player" behind [[Aldi]] with 19{{nbsp}}percent.<ref name="Struggling In Germany">{{cite web |author = Ewing, Jack |url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_15/b3928086_mz054.htm |title = Wal-Mart: Struggling in Germany |work = BusinessWeek |date = April 11, 2005 |access-date = July 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060813111855/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_15/b3928086_mz054.htm |archive-date = August 13, 2006 }}</ref> Walmart continues to do well in the UK, where its Asda subsidiary is the second-largest retailer.<ref name="A Bumpy Ride in Europe">{{cite news |author = Fairlamb, David |author2 = Laura Cohn |url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_40/b3852011_mz001.htm |title = A Bumpy Ride in Europe = |work = BusinessWeek |date = October 6, 2003 |access-date = July 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060829135641/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_40/b3852011_mz001.htm |archive-date = August 29, 2006 }}</ref>

In May 2006, after entering the South Korean market in 1998, Walmart sold all 16{{nbsp}}of its South Korean outlets to [[Shinsegae]], a local retailer, for {{US$|882{{nbsp}}million}}. Shinsegae re-branded the Walmarts as [[E-mart]] stores.<ref name="NYT_wmt_skorea">{{cite news |author = Sang-Hun, Choe |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/business/worldbusiness/23shop.html |title = Wal-Mart Selling Stores and Leaving South Korea |work = The New York Times |date = May 23, 2006 |access-date = December 2, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090424182423/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/business/worldbusiness/23shop.html |archive-date = April 24, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Walmart struggled to export its brand elsewhere as it rigidly tried to reproduce its model overseas. In China, Walmart hopes to succeed by adapting and doing things preferable to Chinese citizens. For example, it found that Chinese consumers preferred to select their own live fish and seafood; stores began displaying the meat uncovered and installed fish tanks, leading to higher sales.<ref name="China_reinvent">{{cite web |url = http://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/walmart-low-prices-big-numbers/ |title = Walmart: Low Prices, Big Numbers |publisher = IndustryLeaders |access-date = December 16, 2012 |author = Ann, Carrie |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121113203758/http://www.industryleadersmagazine.com/walmart-low-prices-big-numbers/ |archive-date = November 13, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Due to its prominence in the [[Bible Belt]], Walmart is known for its "tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers".<ref name="Gilgoff">{{cite news |url = http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/24/7-religious-companies-besides-chick-fil-a/ |title = 9 religious companies (besides Chick-fil-A) |last = Gilgoff |first = Dan |date = July 24, 2012 |publisher = CNN |access-date = April 13, 2014 |quote = And the company's Arkansas roots helped sensitize it to the shopping habits of churchgoers.

But Walmart has been so successful with such material that it has now become a business threat to Christian booksellers. |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140205051508/http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/24/7-religious-companies-besides-chick-fil-a/ |archive-date = February 5, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="Sellers">{{cite magazine |url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/may/17.40.html |title = Deliver Us from Wal-Mart? |last = Sellers |first = Jeff M. |date = April 22, 2005 |magazine = [[Christianity Today]] |access-date = April 13, 2014 |quote = Indeed, based in the Bible Belt town of Bentonville, Arkansas, Wal-Mart has a tradition of tailoring its service to churchgoing customers.

In 2006, Walmart took steps to expand its U.S. customer base, announcing a modification in its U.S. stores from a "one-size-fits-all" merchandising strategy to one designed to "reflect each of six demographic groups—African-Americans, the affluent, empty-nesters, Hispanics, suburbanites, and rural residents."<ref name="Reuters 06">{{cite news |title = Report: Wal-Mart to adopt new custom-fit retail approach |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/07/report-wal-mart-to-adopt-new-custom-fit-retail-approach.html |agency = Reuters |date = September 7, 2006 |access-date = February 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033321/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/07/report-wal-mart-to-adopt-new-custom-fit-retail-approach.html |archive-date = March 7, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Around six months later, it unveiled a new slogan:'' "Saving people money so they can live better lives"''.

Following the [[Killing of Walter Wallace|fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr.]] in October 2020, Walmart temporarily removed gun and ammunition displays in thousands of stores across the U.S. from sales floors, grounding their reason in concerns of civil unrest. Company spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement that "We have seen some isolated civil unrest and as we have done on several occasions over the last few years, we have moved our firearms and ammunition off the sales floor as a precaution for the safety of our associates and customers." Firearms and ammunition will still be available for purchase on request, but the duration of the removal of both from the sales floor remains undetermined.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2020-10-30|title=Walmart pulls guns from display over 'civil unrest' concerns|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54738047|access-date=2020-10-30}}</ref>

==== Big data analytics ====
As the largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart collects and analyzes a large amount of consumer data. The [[big data]] sets are [[Data mining|mined]] for use in [[predictive analytics]], which allow the company to optimize operations by predicting customer's habits.

==== Cash handling ====
in 2016, Walmart began a drive to automate much of the cash handling process. Walmart began replacing employees who count currency by hand with machines that count 8 bills per second and 3,000 coins a minute. The processing machines, located in the back of stores, allow cashiers to process the money for electronic depositing.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Nassauer|first=Sarah|date=July 19, 2017|title=Robots Are Replacing Workers Where You Shop|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/robots-are-replacing-workers-where-you-shop-1500456602|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Nassauer|first=Sarah|date=July 1, 2018|title=Target, Walmart Automate More Store Tasks|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-walmart-automate-more-store-tasks-1530453600|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

== Charity ==
Sam Walton believed that the company's contribution to society was the fact that it operated efficiently, thereby lowering the [[cost of living]] for customers, and, therefore, in that sense was a "powerful force for good", despite his refusal to contribute cash to philanthropic causes.<ref>{{cite book |last = Lichtenstein |first = Nelson |title = The Retail Revolution: How Wal-Mart Created a Brave New World of Business |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ot0-dSuyF8wC&q=%E2%80%9CWe+feel+very+strongly%2C%E2%80%9D+he+wrote%2C+%E2%80%9Cthat+Wal-Mart+really%C2%A0is+not%2C+and%C2%A0should+not%C2%A0be%2C+in+the+charity+business.%E2%80%9D&pg=PA279 |publisher = Macmillan |access-date = August 1, 2013 |page = 279 |date = July 21, 2009 |isbn = 978-1-4299-8971-8 }}</ref> Having begun to feel that his wealth attracted people who wanted nothing more than a "handout", he explained that while he believed his family had been fortunate and wished to use his wealth to aid worthy causes like education, they could not be expected to "solve every personal problem that comes to [their] attention".

== Economic impact ==
Kenneth Stone, Professor of Economics at Iowa State University, in a paper published in ''Farm Foundation'' in 1997, found that some small towns can lose almost half of their retail trade within ten years of a Walmart store opening. He compared the changes to previous competitors small town shops have faced in the past—from the development of the railroads and the Sears Roebuck catalog to shopping malls. He concludes that small towns are more affected by "discount mass merchandiser stores" than larger towns and that shop owners who adapt to the ever-changing retail market can "co-exist and even thrive in this type of environment."<ref name="Rural" />

One study found Walmart's entry into a new market has a profound impact on its competition. When a Walmart opens in a new market, median sales drop 40 percent at similar high-volume stores, 17 percent at supermarkets and 6 percent at drugstores, according to a June 2009 study by researchers at several universities and led by the Tuck School of Business at [[Dartmouth College]].<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0704-soda-wars-20100703,0,5230113.story |title = Wal-Mart Impact: Pop Price War Warns of Wal-Mart Impact for Chicago |author = Julie Wernau |newspaper = Chicago Tribune |date = July 4, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723082249/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-0704-soda-wars-20100703,0,5230113.story |archive-date = July 23, 2010 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> A [[Loyola University Chicago]] study suggested that the impact a Walmart store has on a local business is correlated to its distance from that store.

David Merriman, Joseph Persky, Julie Davis and Ron Baiman did a study in ''[[Economic Development Quarterly]]'' outlining the impacts of Walmart in [[Chicago]]. The study draws from three annual surveys of enterprises within a four-mile radius of a new Chicago Walmart and it "shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store". The study illustrated how approximately 300 jobs were lost due to the opening of the store, which is about equivalent to Walmart's employment in the area. The overall findings of this study reinforce the "contention that large-city Walmarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market" as this is one of the first studies of Walmarts economic impacts on local economies.<ref>Economic Development Quarterly Vol 26, Issue 4, pp. 321 – 333 First Published September 3, 2012</ref>

With over 2.3 million employees worldwide, Walmart has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve [[wage|low wages]], [[Occupational safety and health|poor working conditions]], inadequate [[health care]], and issues involving the company's strong [[trade union|anti-union]] policies. In November 2013, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) announced that it had found that in 13{{nbsp}}U.S. states, Wal-Mart had pressured employees not to engage in strikes on Black Friday, and had illegally disciplined workers who had engaged in strikes.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-nlrb-walmart-20131119,0,1499317.story#axzz2lfbzVSap |title = Fully staffed NLRB investigates complaints against Wal-Mart |first = Alana |last = Semuels |work = latimes.com |access-date = November 26, 2013 |date = November 19, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131126221724/http://www.latimes.com/business/money/la-fi-mo-nlrb-walmart-20131119,0,1499317.story#axzz2lfbzVSap |archive-date = November 26, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Critics point to Walmart's high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved.

In March 2018, Walmart was sued by former Director of Business Development Tri Huynh for claims of reporting misleading e-commerce performance results in favor of the company. Huynh stated the company's move was an attempt to regain lost ground to competitor [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/retail/whistle-blower-claims-walmart-cheated-in-race-with-amazon/|title=Whistle-blower claims Walmart cheated in race with Amazon {{!}} Seattle Times|website=www.seattletimes.com/|language=en-US|access-date=Nov 8, 2019}}</ref>

In September 2018, Walmart was sued by [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] alleging that Walmart denied requests from pregnant employees to limit heavy lifting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2018/09/24/502120.htm|title=U.S. Lawsuit Accuses Walmart of Bias Against Pregnant Employees|date=September 24, 2018|work=Insurance Journal|access-date=September 25, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

In May 2019, the [[Center for Inquiry]] filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia alleging consumer fraud and the endangering of its customers' health due to Walmart's practice of "selling [[Homeopathy|homeopathic [products]]] alongside real medicine, in the same sections in its stores, under the same signs," according to Nicholas Little, CFI's vice president and general counsel.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Fidalgo |first1=Paul |year=2019 |title=CFI Sues Walmart for Fraud for Selling Homeopathic Fake Medicine |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |page=5 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicolefisher/2019/05/31/americas-largest-retailer-sued-for-selling-fake-medicine/|title=America's Largest Retailer Sued For Selling Fake Medicine|last=Fisher|first=Nicole|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>

In July 2019, the Walmart [[subreddit]] was flooded with pro-union memes in a protest to the firing of an employee who posted confidential material to the subreddit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/walmart-employees-post-union-memes-to-mess-with-corporate.html|title=Walmart Workers Realize Corporate Is Spying on Them, Retaliate With Union Memes|last=Feldman|first=Brian|date=July 12, 2019|website=Intelligencer|language=en|access-date=July 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb8y9a/the-walmart-subreddit-has-been-flooded-with-pro-union-memes|title=The Walmart Subreddit Has Been Flooded With Pro-Union Memes|last1=Jr|first1=Edward Ongweso|last2=Koebler|first2=Jason|date=July 11, 2019|website=Vice|language=en-US|access-date=July 13, 2019}}</ref> Many of these posts were angry with Walmart surveying its staff on the Internet.

===2010s crime problem===
According to an August 2016 report by ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', aggressive cost-cutting decisions that began in 2000 when Lee Scott took over as CEO of the company led to a significant increase in crime in stores across the United States. These included the removal of the store's famed greeters, who are in part seen as a theft deterrent at exits, the replacement of many cashiers with self-checkout stations, and the addition of stores at a rate that exceeded the hiring of new employees, which led to a 19% increase in space per employee from a decade previous. While these decisions succeeded in increasing profits 23% in the decade that followed, they also led to an increase in both theft and violent crime.<ref name=":1" />

In 2015, under CEO [[Doug McMillon]], Walmart began a company-wide campaign to reduce crime that included spot-checking receipts at exits, stationing employees at self-checkout areas, eye-level security cameras in high-theft areas, use of data analytics to detect credit fraud, hiring off-duty police and private security officers, and reducing calls to police with a program by which first-time offenders caught stealing merchandise below a certain value can avoid arrest if they agree to go through a theft-prevention program.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-walmart-crime/ |title = Walmart's Out-of-Control Crime Problem is Driving Police Crazy |last = Pettypiece |first = Shannon |magazine = Bloomberg Businessweek |date = August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818000539/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-walmart-crime/ |archive-date = August 18, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

However, some law enforcement professionals have said the improvements are coming too slowly. A longtime police veteran in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stated, "It's ridiculous—we are talking about the biggest retailer in the world. I may have half my squad there for hours." A police captain in Port Richey, Florida, stated, "They recognize the problem and refuse to do anything about it."<ref name=":1" />

Law enforcement agencies across the United States have noted a burden on resources created by a disproportionate number of calls from Walmart. Experts have criticized the retailer for shifting its security burden onto the taxpayers. Across three Florida counties, approximately 9,000 police calls were logged to 53 Walmart stores but resulted in only a few hundred arrests.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2016/public-safety/walmart-police/|title=Tampa Bay Walmarts get thousands of police calls leaving taxpayers to pay the bill.|access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref> In [[Granite Falls, North Carolina]], 92% of [[larceny]] calls to local police were from the Walmart store there.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wsoctv.com/news/9-investigates/walmart-has-become-crime-magnet-in-many-north-carolina-cities/695879615|title=Walmart has become crime magnet in many North Carolina cities|last=Faherty|first=Dave|date=February 9, 2018|work=WSOC|access-date=February 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The trend is similar in rural, suburban, and urban areas. Police are called to Walmart stores 3 to 4 times as much as similar retailers such as Target.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/crime-and-courts/4303214-analysis-police-called-disproportionately-walmart-stores|title=Analysis: Police called disproportionately to Walmart stores|access-date=February 12, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Experts say the chain and its razor-thin profit margins rely heavily on police to protect its bottom line. Walmart Supercenters top the list of those most visited by police.<ref name=":2" />

The police captain in Port Richey, Florida, said that Target stores more often have uniformed security, as well as more visible staff in any case. Another comparison might be shopping malls which often have security patrols and off-duty police officers. J.R. Roberts, a former director for risk management at Valor Security Services (which provides mall security) says: "Shopping centers all have security; they know it's an expense, but one they know pays dividends because people feel safer going to their stores."<ref name=":1" />

In addition to hundreds of thousands of petty crimes, more than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings, stabbings, shootings, and murders occurred at the 4,500 Walmarts in the U.S. in 2016.<ref name=":1" /> In 2019, 23 people were killed in a [[2019 El Paso shooting|mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas]].<ref name="Curbs"/><ref name="NYT23"/>

On June 27, 2020, a shooting occurred at a Walmart distribution center in [[Red Bluff, California]], United States. One employee was killed, four other employees were wounded, and the shooter was killed by officers.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Jenny|last2=Fazio|first2=Marie|date=2020-06-27|title=2 Dead in Shooting at Walmart Distribution Center in California, Official Says|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/us/walmart-shooting-red-bluff-california.html|access-date=2020-06-28|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Two dead, four injured in Walmart distribution center shooting|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/two-dead-four-injured-walmart-distribution-center-shooting-n1232348|access-date=2020-06-28|website=NBC News|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Desk|first=Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content|title=2 killed, 4 injured in shooting at Walmart distribution center in California|url=https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/least-3-injured-shooting-walmart-california/GXCU5YELERH3NIHV7YLS73IS7Y/|access-date=2020-06-28|website=KIRO|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-27|title=2 Dead In Shooting At Walmart Distribution Center In Red Bluff, Authorities Say|url=https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2020/06/27/reports-of-active-shooter-at-walmart-distribution-center-in-red-bluff/|access-date=2020-06-28|language=en-US}}</ref>
