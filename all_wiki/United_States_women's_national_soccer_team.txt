The '''United States women's national soccer team''' ('''USWNT''') represents the [[United States]] in international women's [[Association football|soccer]]. The team is the most successful in international women's soccer, winning four [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] titles (including the first Women's World Cup in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]]), four [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medals]] (including the first Olympic women's soccer tournament in [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|1996]]), and eight [[CONCACAF Women's Championship|CONCACAF Gold Cups]]. It medaled in every World Cup and Olympic tournament in women's soccer history from 1991 to 2015, before being knocked out in the quarterfinal of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The team is governed by [[United States Soccer Federation]] and competes in [[CONCACAF]] (the Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football).

==History==
{{Main|History of the United States women's national soccer team}}

===Origins in the 1980s===

The passing of [[Title IX]] in 1972, which outlawed gender-based discrimination for federally-funded education programs, spurred the creation of college soccer teams across the United States at a time when women's soccer was rising in popularity internationally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chuck |first=Elizabeth |date=July 5, 2015 |title=A Level Playing Field: Why the USA Is So Strong in Women's Soccer |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/level-playing-field-why-usa-so-strong-womens-soccer-n385346 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=June 11, 2019}}</ref> The U.S. Soccer Federation tasked coach [[Mike Ryan (soccer coach)|Mike Ryan]] to select a roster of college players to participate in the 1985 [[Mundialito (women)|Mundialito]] tournament in Italy, its first foray into women's international soccer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Caitlin |year=2019 |title=The National Team: The Inside Story of the Women Who Changed Soccer |pages=4–6 |publisher=[[Abrams Books|Abrams Press]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4197-3449-6 |oclc=1090417335 |ref=harv}}</ref> The team played its [[1985 United States women's national soccer team|first match]] on August 18, 1985, losing 1–0 to [[Italy women's national football team|Italy]], and finished the tournament in fourth place after failing to win its remaining matches against [[Denmark women's national football team|Denmark]] and [[England women's national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |date=August 18, 2005 |title=U.S. WNT Flashback – 20th Anniversary of First-Ever Match: Player Reflections |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/16/02/34/u-s-wnt-flashback-20th-anniversary-of-first-ever-match-player-reflections |publisher=United States Soccer Federation (USSF) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406234815/http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2014/03/16/02/34/u-s-wnt-flashback-20th-anniversary-of-first-ever-match-player-reflections |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=June 11, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Wahl-2019">{{cite news |last=Wahl |first=Grant |authorlink=Grant Wahl |date=June 6, 2019 |title=How the Women's World Cup and USWNT Were Built From Scratch |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2019/06/06/first-womens-world-cup-1991-uswnt-usa-sepp-blatter |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=June 11, 2019}}</ref>

Despite the tournament loss, the [[1985 United States women's national soccer team|first match]] against Italy is where the United States’ famous “Oosa Oosa Oosa Ah!” chant was born. During the match, the style of play and athleticism of the United States ultimately won over the Italian fans. To the team's surprise, the Italians began cheering for the US, which they pronounced as “oosa.” Such surprising support from the Italians impressed the United States so much that the team decided to adopt the Italians' endearing mispronunciation as its new chant that it would use to conclude its pre-game huddles. From then on, the United States has concluded each pre-game huddle with the same chant, “Oosa Oosa Oosa Ah!” as a call back to where it all began in 1985 that honors the [[History of the United States women's national soccer team|legacy]] of those who came before.<ref>{{Cite web|title=WNT Dictionary|url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2019/04/wnt-dictionary|website=www.ussoccer.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-30}}</ref>

Following the 1988 tournament, FIFA announced plans for a new women's tournament, named the [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1st FIFA World Championship for Women's Football for the M&M's Cup]] until it was retroactively given the "World Cup" name.

=== In popular culture ===
The story of the U.S. women's national team has been featured in several mainstream works. 

A narrative nonfiction book covering the entire history of the team from 1985 to 2019 called ''"The National Team: The Inside Story of the Women Who Changed Soccer"'' was named one of Vanity Fair's best books of 2019 and made NPR's 2019 year-end books list.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2019/07/the-best-books-of-2019-so-far |title=The Best Books of 2019 |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=August 18, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#tags=for+sports+lovers%7Cladies+first&view=covers&year=2019 |title=NPR’s Book Concierge |publisher=NPR |accessdate=December 18, 2019}}</ref>  A book about the team's 1999 Women's World Cup campaign, ''"Girls of Summer: The U.S. Women's Soccer Team and How It Changed the World"'' was released in 2001 and in 2020 Netflix announced a film based on the book.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#tags=for+sports+lovers%7Cladies+first&view=covers&year=2019 |title=Netflix Plots Movie About 1999 U.S. Women’s Soccer Team |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=May 12, 2020}}</ref> 

The team was the focus of the 2005 documentary ''[[Dare to Dream: The Story of the U.S. Women's Soccer Team]]'' produced by HBO. Another documentary about the 1999 World Cup-winning team called "''The 99ers''" was produced by former player [[Julie Foudy]] and [[ESPN Films]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/espnw/nine-for-ix/story/_/id/8948907/nine-ix-film-summary-director-99ers |title=Nine for IX: 'The 99ers' |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=December 18, 2019}}</ref>

===Attendance===
The 1999 World Cup final, in which the USA defeated China, set a world attendance record for a women's sporting event of 90,185 in a sellout at the Rose Bowl in Southern California.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/womensworldcup/usa1999/ |title=FIFA Women's World Cup – USA 1999 Overview |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> The record for Olympic women's soccer attendance was set by the 2012 Olympic final between the USWNT and Japan, with 80,023 spectators at Wembley Stadium.<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Fletcher |title=Olympics football: USA beat Japan to secure gold in Wembley thriller |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/olympics/18914350 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=August 9, 2012 |accessdate=October 18, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924231358/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/olympics/18914350| archive-date=September 24, 2015| url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Collective bargaining ==
In recent years, the players of the USWNT have waged an escalating legal fight with the United States Soccer Federation over gender discrimination. Central to their demands is equal pay. The players point to their lower paychecks as compared to the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. men's national team]], despite their higher record of success in recent years.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uswnt-wage-discriminatory-suit-us-soccer_us_56fd33c3e4b0a06d5804ecac |title=USWNT Files Lawsuit Against U.S. Soccer In Fight For Equal Pay |last=Spies-Gans |first=Juliet |date=March 31, 2016 |work=HuffPost|access-date=March 8, 2019 }}</ref>

In April 2016, five players filed a wage-discrimination action against the U.S. Soccer Federation with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/espnw/sports/article/15102506/ |title=Women's national team files wage-discrimination action vs. US Soccer Federation |publisher=ESPN|access-date=March 9, 2019}}</ref> The group consisted of [[Hope Solo]], [[Carli Lloyd]], [[Alex Morgan]], [[Megan Rapinoe]], and [[Becky Sauerbrunn]].

One year later, in April 2017, it was announced that a new [[Collective agreement|collective bargaining agreement]], or CBA, with U.S soccer had been made. The agreement stated that the players would have an increased base pay and improved match bonuses. These changes could increase their previous pay from $200,000 to $300,000. This 2017 CBA, however, does not guarantee the U.S national women's team equal pay with the men's national team. The CBA's five-year term, through 2021, ensured that the next negotiation would not become an issue for the team in its next major competitions. On top of this CBA, U.S Soccer had agreed to pay the players for two years' worth of unequal per-diem payments.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-soccer-labor-deal-contract.html |title=Long Days, Google Docs and Anonymous Surveys: How the U.S. Soccer Team Forged a Deal |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=April 5, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

On March 8, 2019, all 28 members of the U.S. team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Team Sues U.S. Soccer for Gender Discrimination |last=Das |first=Andrew |date=March 8, 2019 |work=The New York Times|access-date=March 8, 2019  |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court in Los Angeles, accused the Federation of "institutional gender discrimination."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/653-us-womens-soccer-complaint/f9367608e2eaf10873f4/optimized/full.pdf#page=1 |title=Case No. 2:19-CV-01717 |last=Winston & Strawn LLP |date=March 8, 2019 }}</ref> The lawsuit claims that the discrimination affects not only the amount the players are paid but also their playing, training, and travel conditions. In May 2020, several key parts of the case were dismissed, with federal judge [[R. Gary Klausner]] noting that the team had agreed to take higher base compensation and other benefits in their most recent CBA instead of the bonuses received by the men's national team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/05/02/849492863/federal-judge-dismisses-u-s-womens-soccer-team-s-equal-pay-claim |title=Federal Judge Dismisses U.S. Women's Soccer Team's Equal Pay Claim |last=Cater |first=Franklyn |website=NPR |date=May 2, 2020 |access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>

The women's national team boasts the first six players in the history of the game to have earned 200 [[cap (sport)|caps]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} These players have since been joined in the 200-cap club by several players from other national teams, as well as by five more Americans: Kate Markgraf, Abby Wambach, Heather O'Reilly, Carli Lloyd and Hope Solo. Kristine Lilly and Christie Rampone are the only players to earn more than 300 caps.

In March 2004, [[Mia Hamm]] and [[Michelle Akers]] were the only two women and the only two Americans named to the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the 125 greatest living football players chosen by [[Pelé]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s centenary observances.

The [[USWNT All-Time Best XI]] was chosen In December 2013 by the United States Soccer Federation:
* Goalkeeper: Briana Scurry
* Defenders: Brandi Chastain, Carla Overbeck, Christie Rampone, Joy Fawcett
* Midfielders: Kristine Lilly, Michelle Akers, Julie Foudy
