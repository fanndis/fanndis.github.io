Dnipro is a powerhouse of Ukraine's [[business]] and [[Politics of Ukraine|politics]] and is the native city of many of the country's most important figures. Much of Ukrainian politics continues to be defined by the legacies of [[Leonid Kuchma]], [[Pavlo Lazarenko]] and [[Yulia Tymoshenko]], whose intermingled political careers started in Dnipropetrovsk.

In 1918, the [[Central Council of Ukraine]] proposed to change the name of the city to ''Sicheslav''; however, this was never finalised.<ref>[http://ukrweekly.com/uwwp/rada-approves-historic-bills-to-part-with-soviet-legacy/ Rada approves historic bills to part with Soviet legacy], [[The Ukrainian Weekly]] (17 April 2015)</ref>

A monastery was founded by [[Byzantine]] monks on [[Monastyrskyi Island]], probably in the 9th century (870 AD). The [[Tatar]]s destroyed the monastery in 1240.<ref name="dp">{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/eng/guide/?pageid=240 |title=Welcome to Dnipropetrovsk!

At the beginning of the 15th century, [[Tatar]] tribes inhabiting the right bank of the Dnieper were driven away by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. By the mid-15th century, the [[Nogais|Nogai]] (who lived north of the [[Sea of Azov]]) and the [[Crimean Khanate]] invaded these lands.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crimean Khanate agreed to a border along the Dnieper, and farther east along the [[Samara River (Dnieper)]], i.e. through what is today the city of Dnipro. It was in this time that a new force appeared: the free people, the [[Cossacks]]. They later became known as [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] (Zaporizhia – the lands south of Prydniprovye, translate as "The Land Beyond the Weirs [Rapids]"). This was a period of raids and fighting causing considerable devastation and [[depopulation]] in that area; the area became known as the [[Wild Fields]].

The Zaporozhian village of ''Polovytsia'' was founded in the late-1760s, between the settlements of Stari (Old) and Novi (New) Kodaky. It was located at the present centre of the city to the West to district of Central Terminal and the ''Ozyorka'' farmers market.<ref name = eugene/>

Cossacks and the Russian army had fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] for control of this area in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. The [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] ended this war in July 1774, and in May 1775 the Russian army destroyed the [[Zaporozhian Host|Zaporozhian Sich]], thus eliminating the political autonomy of Cossacks. In 1775, Prince [[Grigory Potemkin|Grigori Potemkin]] was appointed governor of [[Novorossiya]], and after the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, he started founding cities in the region and encouraging foreign settlers.

Prior to 1926 the city currently called ''Dnipro'' was known as ''Ekaterinoslav'', which could be approximately rendered as "the glory of Catherine", with reference to [[Catherine the Great]], who reigned as [[Empress of Russia]] from 1762 to 1796.

S. Montefiore: Prince of Princes – The Life of Potemkin</ref>

On 22 January 1784 Catherine the Great signed an Imperial Ukase stating the following, "the gubernatorial city under name of Yekaterinoslav to be by better convenience on the right bank of [[Dnieper]] near Kaidak" ("губернскому городу под названием Екатеринослав быть по лучшей удобности на правой стороне реки Днепр у Кайдака…").<ref name=ukrssr/> Construction started on the site of Zaporizhian [[sloboda]] '''Polovytsia''' that had existed at least since 1740s.<ref name=ukrssr/> Here were the wintering estates of the Cossack officers Mykyta Korzh, Lazar Hloba, and others.<ref name=ukrssr/>

The ceremonial laying the foundation of Yekaterinoslav as the centre of the [[Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty]] took place on 20 May 1787 on the hill where Zhovtneva Square is now.<ref name=ukrssr/> The population of ''Yekaterinoslav-Kil'chen'' were (according to some sources) transferred to the new site. Potemkin had extremely ambitious plans for the city. In drafting and construction of the city took part prominent Russian architects [[Ivan Starov]], [[Vasily Stasov]], [[Andreyan Zakharov]].<ref name=ukrssr/> The city's development started along [[Dnieper]] from two opposite ends divided by deep ravines.<ref name=ukrssr/> It was to be about {{convert|30|by|25|km|0|abbr=on}} in size, and included<ref name = eugene/> [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Dnipro|Transfiguration Cathedral]] (the claim that it was intended as the largest in the world probably results from confusing Potemkin's reference to [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|San Paulo-fuori-le-mura]] in Rome with [[St Peter's Basilica]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>); university (never built); botanical garden on Monastyrskyi Island and wide straight avenues through the city.

Nevertheless, the cathedral as originally designed was never to be built. The site for the Potemkin palace was bought from retired Cossack yesaul (colonel) Lazar Hloba, who owned much of the land near the city. Part of Lazar Hloba's gardens still exist and are now called Hloba Park.<ref name = eugene/>

A combination of yet another [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|Russo-Turkish war]] that broke out later in 1787, bureaucratic procrastination, defective workmanship, and theft resulted in what was built being less than originally planned. Construction stopped after the death of Potemkin (1791) and of his sponsor, Empress Catherine (1796), who was succeeded by her son Emperor [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] - known for his open antipathy to his mother's policies and undertakings. Plans were reconsidered and scaled back. The size of the cathedral was reduced, and construction finished only in 1835.

===The origin of industrial centre===
In 1794 in the city started to operate a big treasury-sponsored manufacture that consisted of two factories: cloth factory that was transferred here from town of Dubrovny [[Mogilev Governorate]] along with workers and serf-peasants and silk-stockings factory that was brought from village of Kupavna near [[Moscow]].<ref name=ukrssr/> The workers for silk stockings factory were bought at an auction for 16,000 rubles.<ref name=ukrssr/> In 1797 at the cloth factory worked 819 permanent workers among which were 378 women and 115 children.<ref name=ukrssr/> At the stockings factory a bigger portion of workers consisted of women.<ref name=ukrssr/> Those workers lived in barracks that were located where today is Lakes (Ozerna) Square and along Dnieper embankment where later appeared a factory sloboda.<ref name=ukrssr/> To those manufactures were also assigned 1,186 men of rural population who were settled along [[Mokra Sura River]] where later appeared Sursko-Lytovska (Sura-Lithuanian) Sloboda.<ref name=ukrssr/> Most of buildings for those factories were built out of wood on a draft of Russian architect [[Fyodor Volkov (architect)|Fyodor Volkov]].

Work conditions at those factories as well as during initial development of the city were harsh.<ref name=ukrssr/> People were dying in hundreds from cold, famine, and back-breaking work.<ref name=ukrssr/> Even Potemkin himself was forced to admit that fact.<ref name=ukrssr/> The factories did not always pay their workers on time and often underpay.<ref name=ukrssr/> The factory report of 26 March 1797 indicated about "inadequate" accommodations of workers dwellings.<ref name=ukrssr/> It was a hastily assembled housing suitable only for summertime.<ref name=ukrssr/>

From 1797 to 1802,<ref name=ukrssr/> the city was renamed as ''Novorossiysk'' by the Russian Emperor [[Paul I of Russia]],<ref name=ukrssr/> when it served as a centre of the <u>recreated</u> [[Novorossiya Governorate#Second establishment|Novorossiya Governorate]], and subsequently, till 1925, of the [[Ekaterinoslav Governorate]].

The city business in majority was based in processing of agricultural raw materials.<ref name=ukrssr/> Only in 1832 in the city was founded a small iron-casting factory of Zaslavsky, which became the first company of its kind.<ref name=ukrssr/> The factory only employed 15 workers.<ref name=ukrssr/>

Despite the bridging of the Dnieper in 1796 and the growth of trade in the early 19th century, Ekaterinoslav remained small until the 1880s, when the railway was built and industrialization of the city began.<ref name=ukrainetrek>{{cite web|url=http://ukrainetrek.com/Dnepropetrovsk_city.shtml|title=Ukrainetrek Dnepropetrovsk (City)|publisher=Ukrainetrek.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> The boom was caused by two men: [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]], a Welsh businessman who built an iron works at what is now [[Donetsk]] (then Yuzovka) in 1869–72, and developed the Donetsk coal deposits;<ref name = eugene/> and the Russian geologist [[Alexander Pol]], who discovered the [[Kryvyi Rih]] iron ore in 1866, during archaeological research.<ref name = eugene/>

The Donetsk coal was necessary for smelting pig-iron from the Kryvyi Rih ore, producing a need for a railway to connect Yozovka with Kryvyi Rih. Permission to build the railway was given in 1881, and it opened in 1884. The railway crossed the Dnieper at Ekaterinoslav. The city grew quickly; new suburbs appeared: Amur, Nyzhnodniprovsk and the factory areas developed. In 1897, Ekaterinoslav became the third city in the Russian Empire to have electric trams. The Higher Mining School opened in 1899, and by 1913 it had grown into the Mining Institute.<ref name = eugene/>

Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, among other things, resulted in widespread [[Revolution of 1905|revolts against the government]] in many places of Russia, Ekaterinoslav being one of the major hot spots.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Gerald|last=Surh|title=Ekaterinoslav City in 1905: Workers, Jews, and Violence]|date=27 October 2003|journal=International Labor and Working-Class History|volume=64|pages=139–166|doi=10.1017/S0147547903000231}}</ref> Dozens of people were killed and hundreds wounded.

From 1902 to 1933, the historian of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], [[Dmytro Yavornytsky]], was Director of the Dnipro Museum, which was later named after him. Before his death in 1940, Yavornytsky wrote a ''History of the City of Ekaterinoslav'', which lay in manuscript for many years. It was only published in 1989 as a result of the [[perestroika|Gorbachev reforms]].

===Closed city===
As early as July 1944, the State Committee of Defence in Moscow decided to build a large military machine-building factory in Dnipropetrovsk on the location of the pre-war aircraft plant. In December 1945, thousands of German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] began construction and built the first sections and shops in the new factory. This was the foundation of the Dnipropetrovsk Automobile Factory.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Театр им Горького 1.jpg|left|thumb|The city's 'Gorky' Theatre of Russian Drama was constructed during the Stalinist period.]]
[[Joseph Stalin]] suggested special secret training for highly qualified engineers and scientists to become rocket construction specialists.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1954 the administration of this automobile factory opened a secret design office with the name "Southern" (konstruktorskoe biuro Yuzhnoe – in Russian) to construct military [[missile]]s and rocket engines. Hundreds of talented physicists, engineers and machine designers moved from Moscow and other large cities in the Soviet Union to Dnipropetrovsk to join this "Southern" design office. In 1965, the secret Plant No. 586 was transferred to the Ministry of General Machine-Building of the USSR. The next year this plant officially changed its name to "the Southern Machine-building Factory" (Yuzhnyi mashino-stroitel’nyi zavod) or in abbreviated Russian, simply [[Yuzhmash]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Dnepr rocket lift-off 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[SS-18 Satan]] missile by [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]]]]
The first "General Constructor" and head of the "Southern" design office was [[Mikhail Yangel]], a prominent scientist and outstanding designer of space rockets, who managed not only the design office, but the entire factory from 1954 to 1971. Yangel designed the first powerful rockets and space military equipment for the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Soviet Ministry of Defence]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In 1951 the Southern Machine-building Factory began manufacturing and testing new military rockets for the battlefield. The range of these first missiles was only {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=off}}. By 1959 Soviet scientists and engineers developed new technology, and as a result, the "Southern" design office (KBYu – as abbreviated in Russian) started a new machine-building project making [[ballistic missile]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Under the leadership of Yangel, KBYu produced such powerful rocket engines that the range of these ballistic missiles was practically without limits. During the 1960s, these powerful rocket engines were used as launch vehicles for the first Soviet space ships. During Makarov's directorship, Yuzhmash designed and manufactured four generations of missile complexes of different types. These included space launch vehicles [[Kosmos (rocket family)|Kosmos]], [[Tsyklon-2]], [[Tsyklon-3]] and [[Zenit (rocket family)|Zenit]]. Under the leadership of Yangel's successor, V. Utkin, the KBYu created a unique space-rocket system called Energia-Buran. Yuzhmash engineers manufactured 400 technical devices that were launched in artificial satellites ([[Sputnik]]s). For the first time in the world space industry, the Dnipropetrovsk missile plant organised the serial production of space Sputniks. By the 1980s, this plant manufactured 67 different types of space ships, 12 space research complexes and four defence space rocket systems. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

These systems were used not only for purely military purposes by the Ministry of Defence, but also for space research, for global radio and television networks, and for ecological monitoring. Yuzhmash initiated and sponsored the international space program of socialist countries, called [[Interkosmos]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Parus from left bank.JPG|left|thumb|The unfinished 'Parus' hotel on the embankment has become a symbol of poor economic planning in the Soviet era.]]
On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union, KBYu had 9 regular and corresponding members of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], 33 full professors and 290 scientists holding a PhD They awarded scientific degrees and presided over a prestigious graduate school at KBYu, which attracted talented students of physics from all over the USSR. More than 50,000 people worked at Yuzhmash. At the end of the 1950s, Yuzhmash became the main Soviet design and manufacturing centre for different types of missile complexes. The Soviet Ministry of Defence included Yuzhmash in its strategic plans. The military rocket systems manufactured in Dnipropetrovsk became the major component of the newly born Soviet Missile Forces of Strategic Purpose. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

According to contemporaries, Yuzhmash was a separate entity inside the Soviet state.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} After a long period of competition with the Moscow centre of rocket construction of V. Chelomei (a successor of Koroliov), Yuzhmash rocket designs won in 1969. Since that time leaders of the Soviet military industrial complex preferred Yuzhmash rocket models. By the end of the 1970s, this plant became the major centre for designing, constructing, manufacturing, testing and deploying strategic and space missile complexes in the Soviet Union. The general designer and director of Yuzhmash supervised the work of numerous research institutes, design centres and factories all over the Soviet Union from Moscow, [[Leningrad]] and [[Kyiv]], to [[Voronezh]] and [[Yerevan]]. The Soviet state provided billions of Soviet [[ruble]]s to finance Yuzhmash projects.

Officially, Yuzhmash manufactured agricultural tractors and special kitchen equipment for everyday needs, such as mincing-machines or juicers for civilian Soviet households. In official reports for the general audience there was no information about the production of rockets or spaceships. However, hundreds of thousands of workers and engineers in the city of Dnipropetrovsk worked in this plant and members of their families (up to 60% of the city population) knew about the "real production" of Yuzhmash. This missile plant became a significant factor in the arms race of the Cold War. This is why the Soviet government approved of the KGB's secrecy about Yuzhmash and its products. According to the Soviet government's decision, the city of Dnipropetrovsk was officially closed to foreign visitors in 1959. No citizen of a foreign country (even of the socialist ones) was allowed to visit the city or district of Dnipropetrovsk. After the late 1950s ordinary Soviet people called Dnipropetrovsk "the rocket closed city." Only during [[perestroika]] was Dnipropetrovsk opened to foreigners again in 1987.

Journeys from Kryviy Rih took up to six hours in special railway carriages with grated windows. Some prisoners had to do this 14 or 15 times. After complaints by the ombudsman (Nina Karpacheva) the head of the State prison department of Ukraine (Vladimir Levochkin) arranged that finances were given for the provision of women's cells in Dnipropetrovsk Preliminary Prison, making the lives of the 15,000 unconvicted women-detainees easier from August 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1085176391|title=''Kievskie vedomosti'', 14 August 2000.|publisher=Khpg.org|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|City of regional significance (Ukraine)}}
The City of Dnipro is governed by the Dnipro City Council. It is a city municipality that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.

Administratively, the city is divided into "districts in city" ("raiony v misti"). Presently, there are 8 of them. [[Aviatorske]], an urban-type settlement located near the [[Dnipropetrovsk International Airport]], is also a part of Dnipro Municipality.

The City Council Assembly makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 12 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council was elected in 2015. The council has 29 standing commissions which play an important role in the oversight of the city and its merchants.

Dnipro has five single-mandate parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which members of parliament ([[People's Deputy of Ukraine|MPs]]) are elected to represent the city in [[Verkhovna Rada|Rada]]. At the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election|last (2014) general election]], were won by [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc|PPB]] and independent candidates with. In multimember districts city voted for Opposition Bloc, union of all political forces that did not endorse [[Euromaidan]].

In the last decades the city has generally supported candidates belonging to the [[Party of Regions]] and (in the 1990s) [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] in national and local elections. There was the same situation in presidential elections, with strong support for [[Leonid Kuchma]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. After the 2014 events of Euromaidan, which included mass demonstrations and clashes in the central city, Regions lost its influence, and Dnipropetrovsk supported [[Petro Poroshenko]].

Dnipro is also the seat of the oblast's local administration controlled by the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Council|Rada]]. The governor of the oblast is the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.

==Geography==
[[File:Dniepropetrowsk z lotu ptaka.jpg|left|thumb|An aerial view of Dnipro. The [[Dnieper River]], city's left and right banks, and a number of bridges can be seen.]]
The city is built mainly upon both banks of the Dnieper, at its confluence with the [[Samara River (Dnieper)|Samara River]]. In the loop of a major meander, the Dnieper changes its course from the north west to continue southerly and later south-westerly through Ukraine, ultimately passing [[Kherson]], where it finally flows into the [[Black Sea]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Nowadays both the north and south banks play home to a range of industrial enterprises and manufacturing plants. The airport is located about {{convert|15|km|1|abbr=on}} south-east of the city.

The centre of the city is constructed on the right bank which is part of the [[Dnieper Upland]], while the left bank is part of the [[Dnieper Lowland]]. The old town is situated atop a hill that is formed as a result of the river's change of course to the south. The change of river's direction is caused by its proximity to the [[Azov Upland]] located southeast of the city.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

One of the city's streets, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, links the two major architectural ensembles of the city and constitutes an important thoroughfare through the centre, which along with various suburban radial road systems, provides some of the area's most vital transport links for both suburban and inter-urban travel.

The city has four distinct seasons: a cold, snowy winter; a hot summer; and two relatively wet transition periods. However, according to other schemes (such as the Salvador Rivas-Martínez bioclimatic one), Dnipro has a Supratemperate bioclimate, and belongs to the Temperate xeric steppic thermoclimatic belt, due to high [[evapotranspiration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalbioclimatics.org/form/maps.htm |title=Bioclimatic & Biogeographic Maps of Europe |last=Rivas-Martínez |first=Salvador |year=2004 |publisher=University of León |access-date=1 May 2017}}</ref>
During the summer, Dnipro is very warm (average day temperature in July is {{convert|24|to|28|C}}, even hot sometimes {{convert|32|to|36|C}}. Temperatures as high as {{convert|36|C|0}} have been recorded in May. Winter is not so cold (average day temperature in January is {{convert|-4|to|0|C}}, but when there is no snow and the wind blows hard, it feels extremely cold. A mix of snow and rain happens usually in December.

The best time for visiting the city is in late spring (late April and May), and early in autumn: September, October, when the city's trees turn yellow. Other times are mainly dry with a few showers.<ref>''See also:'' [http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Europa/dnepropetrovsk.html klimadiagramme.de] – Climate in Dnipropetrovsk URL accessed on 20 March 2007</ref>

===Cityscape===
Dnipro is a primarily industrial city of around one million people; in being such it has developed into a large urban centre over the past few centuries to become, today, Ukraine's fourth-largest city after [[Kyiv]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Odessa|Odesa]].

[[File:Istorichnii myzei Dnipropetrovs'ka.JPG|thumb|Yavornytsky Historical Museum]]
Immediately after its foundation, Dnipro, or as it was then known Yekaterinoslav, began to develop exclusively on the right bank of the Dnieper River. At first the city developed radially from the central point provided by the Transfiguration Cathedral. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] structures of brick and stone construction were preferred and the city began to take on the appearance of a typical European city of the era. Of these buildings many have been retained in the city's older [[Sobornyi District, Dnipro|Sobornyi District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=52 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> Amongst the most important buildings of this era are the Transfiguration Cathedral, and a number of buildings in the area surrounding Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, including the [[Khrennikov House]].
[[File:Lenin statue in Dnipropetrovsk, lateral view.JPG|left|thumb|In the early 1950s, during the ongoing industrialisation of the city, much of Dnipropetrovsk's centre was rebuilt in the Stalinist style of [[Socialist Realism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=39 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> The statue of [[Lenin]] pictured here was removed in March 2014.<ref name="usatoday.comLmDg">[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/03/14/ukraine-crimea-referendum/6319183/ In East Ukraine, fear of Putin, anger at Kiev]<br />[http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/ukraine-day-after_783577.html Ukraine: the Day After]<br />[http://tsn.ua/ukrayina/sche-odnogo-lenyna-zvalili-v-dnypropetrovsku-363832.html Пам'ятник Леніну у Дніпропетровську остаточно перетворили в купу каміння "Monument to Lenin in Dnipropetrovsk finally turned into a pile of stones"]</ref>]]
Over the next few decades, until the October Revolution in 1917 the city did not change much in appearance and the predominant architectural style remained that of neo-classicism. Notable buildings built in the era preceding the Bolsheviks' rise to power and the establishment of communist Ukraine and later its absorption into the [[Soviet Union]], include the main building of the [[Dnipro Polytechnic]], which was built in 1899–1901,<ref>{{cite web|author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=932 |title=Национальный Горный Университет – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> the art-nouveau inspired building of the city's former Duma,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dneprotur.ucoz.com/photo/retrophotos/old_dnepropetrovsk/city_council/27-0-46 |title=Городская Дума – Старый Днепропетровск – Ретрофото – Фотоальбомы – Памятники, архитектура, история, туризм |publisher=Dneprotur.ucoz.com |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> the Dnipropetrovsk National Historical Museum, and the Mechnikov Regional Hospital.

Stalinist architecture (monumental soviet classicism) dominates in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnepr.com/main/sport_and_culture_dp/7847-ot-stalinskogo-ampira-do-brezhnevskogo-minimalizma.html |title=От "сталинского ампира" до "брежневского минимализма" " www.DNEPR.com – Главный портал города Днепропетровска |publisher=DNEPR.com |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>
Once the bolsheviks had taken power in Dnipropetrovsk the city was gradually purged of tsarist-era monuments and monumental architecture was stripped of Imperial coats of arms and other non-socialist symbolism. In 1917, a monument to [[Catherine the Great]] that stood in front of the Mining Institute was replaced with one of Russian academic [[Mikhail Lomonosov]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Вт, 12 марта 201307:51 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/out/attractions/oneplace/?place_id=1122 |title=Ломоносову М.В., памятник – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> Later, due to damage from the Second World War, a number of large buildings were reconstructed. The main railway station, for example, was stripped of its Russian-revival ornamentation and redesigned in the style of Stalinist social-realism,<ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] Центральный железнодорожный вокзал был уничтожен во время войны. Потребовалось строительство нового здания</ref> whilst the Grand Hotel Ukraine survived the war but was later simplified much in design, with its roof being reconstructed in a typical French mansard style as opposed to the ornamental Ukrainian baroque of the pre-war era. Other badly damaged buildings were, more often than not, demolished completely and replaced with new structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> This is one of the main reasons why much of Dnipro's central avenue, Akademik Yavornitskyi Prospekt, is designed in the style of Stalinist Social Realism.<ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] Центральный проспект почти полностью был разрушен. Практически его нужно было создать заново</ref> Many pre-revolution buildings were also reconstructed to suit new purposes. For example, the Emperor Nicholas II Commercial Institute in the city was reconstructed to serve as the administrative centre for the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, a function it fulfils to this day. Other buildings, such as the Potemkin Palace were given over to the proletariat, in this case as the students' union of the [[Oles Honchar Dnipro National University]].

After the death of Stalin and appointment of [[Khrushchev]], who had spent his early working years in Ukraine, as party secretary, the industrialisation of Dnipropetrovsk became even more profound, with the Southern (Yuzhne) Missile and Rocket factory being set up in the city. However, this was not the only development and many other factories, especially metallurgical and heavy-manufacturing plants, were set up in the city.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68>{{cite web|url=http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=68 |title=История Днепропетровска и Приднепровья |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> At this point Dnipropetrovsk became one of the most important manufacturing cities in the Soviet Union, producing many goods from small articles like screws and vacuum cleaners to aircraft engine pieces and ballistic missiles. As a result of all this industrialisation the city's inner suburbs became increasingly polluted and were gradually given over to large, unsightly industrial enterprises. At the same time the extensive development of the city's left bank and western suburbs as new residential areas began.<ref name=gorod.dp.ua-68/> The low-rise tenant houses of the Khrushchev era ([[Khrushchyovka]]s) gave way to the construction of high-rise prefabricated apartment blocks (similar to German [[Plattenbau]]s). In 1976 in line with the city's 1926 renaming a large monumental statue of [[Grigoriy Petrovsky]] was placed on the square in front of the city's station.<ref>[http://gorod.dp.ua/history/article_ru.php?article=67] В 1976 г. архитектурно-художественная композиция привокзальной площади была завершена постановкой памятника Г. И. Петровскому</ref> This statue was destroyed by an angry mob early 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Soviet-Era |title=Monument Torn Down in Eastern Ukraine |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-monument/27523767.html |website=rferl.org |language=en}}</ref>

To this day the city is characterised by its mix of architectural styles, with much of the city's centre consisting of pre-revolutionary buildings in a variety of styles, stalinist buildings and constructivist architecture, whilst residential districts are, more often than not, made up of aesthetically simple, technically outdated mid-rise and high-rise housing stock from the Soviet era. Despite this, the city does have a large number of 'private sectors' were the tradition of building and maintaining individual detached housing has continued to this day. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Since the independence of Ukraine in 1991 and the economic development that followed, a number of large commercial and business centres have been built in the city's outskirts.

The population of the city is about 1 million people. In 2011, the average age of the city's resident population was 40 years. The number of males declined slightly more than the number of females. The natural population growth in Dnipro is slightly higher than growth in Ukraine in general.

Between 1923 and 1933 the Ukrainian proportion of the population of Dnipropetrovsk increased from 16% to 48%.

The main forms of public transport used in Dnipro are [[tram]]s, [[bus]]es, electric [[trolley bus]]es and [[marshrutka]]s—private [[minibuses]]. In addition to this there are a large number of taxi firms operating in the city, and many residents have private cars.

The city's municipal roads also suffer from the same funding problems as the trams, with many of them in a very poor technical state. {{citation needed|date=July 2013}} It is not uncommon to find very large potholes and crumbling surfaces on many of Dnipro's smaller roads. Major roads and highways are of better quality. In recent years the situation has, however, been improving, with a number of new used trams bought from the German cities of Dresden and Magdeburg,<ref>{{cite web|author=вт, 12 марта 201307:52 |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/60242 |title=К нам привезли новые старые трамваи – Днепропетровск |publisher=Gorod.dp.ua |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> and a number of roads, including Schmidt Street and Moskovsky Street being reconstructed with modern road-building techniques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://34.ua/news/economic/transport/roads/85-remont-dorog-v-dnepropetrovske-na-16-avgusta-2011-goda.html |title=Ремонт дорог в Днепропетровске на 16 августа 2011 года |publisher=34.ua |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505093610/http://34.ua/news/economic/transport/roads/85-remont-dorog-v-dnepropetrovske-na-16-avgusta-2011-goda.html |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref>

===Suburban transportation===
[[File:Central bridge Dnipro.jpg|thumb|left|Bridges linking the city's right and left banks are heavily used.]]
Dnipro has some highways crossing through the city. The most popular routes are from [[Kiyv]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Zaporizhia]]. Transit through the city is also available. {{As of|2011}} the city is also seeing construction of a southern urban bypass, which will allow automobile traffic to proceed around the city centre. This is expected to both improve air quality and reduce transport issues from heavy freight lorries that pass through the city centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The largest bus station in eastern Ukraine is located in Dnipro, from where bus routes are available to all over the country, including some international routes to Russia, Poland, Germany, [[Moldova]] and [[Turkey]]. It is located near the city's central railway station.

In the summertime, there are some routes available by [[hydrofoil]]s on the [[Dnieper River]], whilst various tourist ships on their way down the river, (Kyiv–Kherson–Odessa) tend to make a stop in the city. Dnipro's river port is located close to the area surrounding the central railway station, on the banks of the river. It is a good example of constructivist architecture from the late period of the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:01 Вокзал 0022.jpg|right|thumb|Dnipro's main station is one of eastern Ukraine's largest]]

Two express passenger services run each day between [[Kyiv]] and Dnipro under the name 'Capital Express'. Other daytime services include suburban trains to towns and villages in the surrounding [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]. Most long-distance trains tend to run at night to reduce the amount of daytime hours spent travelling by each passenger.

Domestic connections exist between Dnipro and [[Kyiv]], [[Lviv]], [[Simferopol]], [[Odessa]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Truskavets]], [[Donetsk]], [[Kharkiv]] and many other smaller Ukrainian cities, whilst international destinations include, amongst others, [[Minsk]] in Belarus, Moscow's [[Kursky Rail Terminal|Kursky Station]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Vitebsky Rail Terminal|Vitebsky Station]] in Russia, [[Baku]]—the capital of Azerbaijan, and the Bulgarian seaside resort of [[Varna]].

=== Attractions ===
[[File:Monument of M. Gorky.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to the [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park]]
The city has a variety of theatres (plus an Opera) and museums of interest to tourists, including the [[Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum of Dnipropetrovsk|Dmytro Yavornytsky National Historical Museum]]. There are also several parks, restaurants and beaches.

The major streets of the city were renamed in honour of Marxist heroes during the Soviet era. Following the 2015 [[decommunization in Ukraine|law on decommunization]] these have been renamed.<ref name=decommupbbcU/><ref name="radiosvoboda.mobi"/>

The central thoroughfare is known as Akademik [[Dmytro Yavornytsky|Yavornytskyi]] Prospekt, a, wide and long boulevard that stretches east to west through the centre of the city. It was founded in the 18th century and parts of its buildings are the actual decoration of the city. In the heart of the city is Soborna Square, which includes the majestic cathedral founded by order of [[Catherine the Great]] in 1787.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

On the square, there are some remarkable buildings: the Museum of History, Diorama "Battle for the Dnieper River ([[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]])", and also the park in which one can rest in the hot summer. Walking down the hill to the [[Dnieper River]], one arrives in the large [[Taras Shevchenko]] Park (which is on the right bank of the river) and on Monastyrsky Island. This island is one of the most interesting places in the city. In the 9th century, the Byzantine monks based a monastery here.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

A few areas retain their historical character: all of Central Avenue, some street-blocks on the main hill (the Nagorna part) between Pushkin Prospekt and Embankment, and sections near Globa (formerly known as [[Chkalov]] park until it was recently renamed) and Shevchenko parks have been untouched for 150 years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Dnieper River keeps the climate mild.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} It is visible from many points in Dnipro. From any of the three hills in the city, one can see a view of the river, islands, parks, outskirts, river banks and other hills.

There was no need to build skyscrapers in the city in Soviet times. The major industries preferred to locate their offices close to their factories and away from the centre of town. Most new office buildings are built in the same architectural style as the old buildings. A number, however, display more modern aesthetics, and some blend the two styles.

===Sports===
[[File:УФХМР 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Rink bandy]] in Dnipro]]
[[FC Dnipro]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club, used to play in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]], and were the only Soviet team to win the USSR Federation Cup twice. The club was owned by the Privat Group. Note: A [[bandy]] team, a [[basketball]] team and others use the same name.

Other local football include: FC Lokomotyv Dnipropetrovsk and FC Spartak Dnipropetrovsk, both of which have large fan bases. [[SC Dnipro-1]] is another team emerged in 2017.

Recently the city built a new soccer stadium; the [[Dnipro-Arena]] has a capacity of 31,003 people and was built as a replacement for Dnipro's old stadium, [[Stadium Meteor]]. The [[Dnipro-Arena]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualification game between [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] and [[England national football team|England]] on 10 October 2009. The Dnipro Arena was initially chosen as one of the Ukrainian venues for their joint Euro 2012 bid with Poland. However, it was dropped from the list in May 2009 as the capacity fell short of the minimum 33,000 seats required by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/feedarticle/8499613|title=Kiev and Donetsk likely for Euro 2012, others uncertain|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630172347/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5it8f_MOzCKu2hxVHUUXwOvzetMIw |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2012  |accessdate=20 February 2016 }}</ref>
