==History==
[[File:Nordenskirker Maglebym17.jpg|thumb|left|Magleby Church baptismal font]]
The church was originally built in the Romanesque style in the second half of the 13th century. The rounded tops of bricked-in windows from this period can still be seen on either side of the nave. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the church was converted to the Gothic style with cross vaults, Gothic windows and a number of additions and extensions. The tower which dates back to the older parts of the church originally had a twin top but was later covered with a roof. <ref>{{cite web|url=  http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/praestoe/magleby-kirke-moenbo-hrd/

The crucifix is believed to date from the 15th century. The Renaissance altarpiece is from 1598 and is attributed to [[Abel Schrøder]] (c. 1602–1676). The pulpit is oak from 1859.  The Gothic baptismal font is of limestone, while the baptismal basin of brass is from southern Germany from about 1550-1575.
