==Current operations==
===Mutual funds===
In the 1960s, Fidelity was the first major American finance firm to market mutual funds directly to everyday people via direct mail advertising and door to door sales.<ref>Peter Lynch and John Rothschild, Beating the Street Simon & Schuster; Revised edition (May 25, 1994) 0671891634</ref> Previously, mutual funds had been marketed almost exclusively to high-income or high-wealth individuals, retirement funds for employers, and/or those already in the finance industry.

FMR has three fund divisions: Equity (headquartered in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]), High-Income (headquartered in Boston) and Fixed-Income (headquartered in [[Merrimack, New Hampshire]]). The company's largest equity mutual fund is [[Fidelity Contrafund]], which has $107.4 billion in assets,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/mutualfunds/snapshot.asp?symbol=FCNTX|title=Fidelity® Contrafund® Fund - NYTimes.com|website=markets.on.nytimes.com}}</ref> making it the largest non-indexed fund in the US and the largest fund managed by an individual. [[William Danoff]] has managed Contrafund since 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.com/money/3926809/fidelity-contrafund-mutual-fund-explainer/|title=Everything You Need to Know About The Fidelity Contrafund Mutual Fund|website=CNN Money}}</ref>

[[Fidelity Magellan]] is another large equity fund, with $15.5 billion in assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/mutualfunds/snapshot.asp?symbol=FMAGX|title=Fidelity® Magellan® Fund - NYTimes.com|website=markets.on.nytimes.com}}</ref> Its current manager is Jeffrey Feingold, who also manages the Fidelity Trend Fund. It was previously managed by [[Ned Johnson]] from May 2, 1963, to Dec. 31, 1971, [[Peter Lynch]] from May 31, 1977, to May 31, 1990, and Harry W. Lange from 2005 to 2012. Under Lynch's leadership Magellan averaged 29% a year, more than doubling the growth rate of the benchmark S&P 500, and remains the best-performing mutual funds in history over such an extended period.<ref name=tii>The Intelligent Investor, 2003, Commentary on the Introduction</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ajcunet.edu/story?TN=PROJECT-20121206050322|title=AJCU: Peter Lynch|publisher=[[AJCU]]|accessdate=15 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226131715/http://www.ajcunet.edu/story?TN=PROJECT-20121206050322|archive-date=26 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Donor-advised fund ===
Fidelity manages a [[donor-advised fund]], Fidelity Charitable, in 1991, becoming the first commercial DAF provider. As of 2017, Fidelity Charitable is currently the largest charity by donations from the public, surpassing the [[United Way of America|United Way]]. Tax donations to a DAF can be registered in the year of the donation, when the beneficiary may be being chosen. 

In a 2015 survey by Fidelity Charitable, 90% of donors who responded stated this benefit as the main reason for starting donations using a DAF. Donors also cite that this allows them to give more to charity. Investments in a DAF register interest until the distribution is given to a beneficiary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21719494-rise-dafs-may-be-much-about-tax-charity-philanthropic-boom|title=A philanthropic boom: "donor-advised funds"|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> Fidelity Charitable produces a report "Women and Giving" that examines differences in giving attitudes, strategies and priorities across generations and gender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/05/11/differences-generational-gender-based-giving-matter/|title=Generational and Gender-Based Differences in Giving: Do They Matter?{{!}} Nonprofit Quarterly|date=2017-05-11|website=Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations {{!}} Nonprofit Quarterly|access-date=2017-05-12}}</ref>

==Controversies==

=== Insiders' private investments competing with their customers  ===
A private venture capital firm, F-Prime Capital Partners, managed on behalf of owners and other key leaders of Fidelity Investments, has been described as directly competing with Fidelity Investments public funds. A 2016 Reuters investigation identified multiple cases where F-Prime Capital Partners <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-fidelity-family/|title=How the owners of Fidelity get richer at everyday investors' expense|website=Reuters|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}</ref> was able to make investments at a fraction of the price of Fidelity Investments. Because of SEC regulations, investments by F-Prime Capital Partners preclude Fidelity from making the same early investments. The investigation describes that this competition forces Fidelity to delay investing until later and at much higher prices than F-Prime Capital Partners, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/05/fidelity-danoff-pay-alibaba/|title=One of Mutual Fund Company Fidelity's Star Managers Made Millions off Alibaba's IPO|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}</ref>

Corporate governance experts have stated that the practice is not illegal, but that it poses a clear corporate conflict of interest.<ref name=":0" /> Fidelity spokesmen have stated that they are following all laws and regulations.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://riabiz.com/a/2016/10/14/after-fidelity-investments-and-its-owners-get-blasted-by-reuters-for-alleged-high-level-conflicts-of-interest-morningstar-accepts-the-boston-based-giants-explanation|title=After Fidelity Investments and its owners get blasted by Reuters for alleged high-level conflicts of interest, Morningstar accepts the Boston-based giant's explanation|work=RIABiz|access-date=2018-02-08}}</ref>

=== Appearance of insiders propping up private investments ===
The same Reuters investigation documents six cases (out of 10) where Fidelity Investments became one of the largest investors of F-Prime Capital companies after the start-up companies became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the F-Prime Capital investments, to the benefit of Fidelity insiders.<ref name=":0" />

Fidelity declined to comment on this aspect of the investigation.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

==Legal issues==
===Document retention fines===
In February 2007, the NASD, a division of the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]], fined 4 FMR-affiliated broker-dealers $3.75 million for alleged registration, supervision and e-mail retention violations. The broker-dealers settled without admitting or denying the charges.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2007/nasd-fines-four-fidelity-affiliated-broker-dealers-375-million-registration8 | title=NASD Fines Four Fidelity-Affiliated Broker-Dealers $3.75 Million for Registration, Supervision and Email Retention Violations | publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] | date=February 5, 2007}}</ref>

In 2004, Fidelity Brokerage paid $2 million to settle charges by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] that employees altered and destroyed documents in 21 of its 88 branch offices between January 2001 and July 2002. Fidelity has internal inspections every year to make sure it is complying with federal regulations. Management was accused of pressuring branch employees to have perfect inspections and gave notice of the inspections and that at least 62 employees destroyed or altered potentially improper documents maintained at branch offices including new account applications, letters of authorization and variable annuity forms.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2004-103.htm | title=SEC and NYSE File Settled Action Charging Fidelity Brokerage Services for Violating Federal Securities Laws and NYSE Rules in Connection with Document Alteration and Destruction | publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date=August 3, 2004}}</ref>

===Misrepresentations===
In May 2007, NASD fined two Fidelity broker-dealers $400,000 for preparing and distributing misleading sales literature promoting Fidelity's Destiny I and II Systematic Investment Plans, which were sold primarily to U.S. military personnel. As part of the settlement, the FMR affiliates were required to notify Destiny Plan holders who want to increase their investments in existing Destiny Plans that additional shares of the underlying fund can be purchased outside the Destiny Plans without paying the additional sales charges.<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2007/nasd-fines-two-fidelity-broker-dealers-400000-distributing-misleading-sales-literature | title=NASD Fines Two Fidelity Broker Dealers $400,000 for Distributing Misleading Sales Literature About Systematic Investment Plans Sold to Military Personnel | publisher=[[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] | date=May 8, 2007}}</ref>

==Ownership and management==
[[File:Fidelity-Inv-Boston.JPG|thumb|upright|Fidelity Investments Investor Center on [[Boylston Street]] in [[Boston]]]]

===Johnson Family===

The founding Johnson family, individually and through various trusts, owns stock representing a 49% voting interest in FMR, and have signed agreements pledging to vote all their shares as a bloc. [[Edward Johnson III]] was chairman of the group, but was replaced by his daughter, [[Abigail Johnson]]. Abigail was once the largest single [[shareholder]] with about 25% ownership, but in October 2005, it was reported that she had sold a "significant" portion of her shares to family trusts, and that there were doubts as to whether she was still in line to succeed her father.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2005/10/28/news/newsmakers/fidelity_johnson/ | title=Johnson still Fidelity successor? | work=[[CNN]] | date=October 28, 2005}}</ref>

===Employees and ex-employees===

Most of the remaining 51% of the company is held by various Fidelity employees and ex-employees, including fund managers and ex-managers, such as [[Peter Lynch]].<ref>Fidelity Investments (March 18, 2013). "Activities and Management of FMR. ''Proxy statement, special meeting of shareholders of Fidelity Advisor Series VII Fidelity Select Portfolios to be held on May 14, 2013''. p. 20.</ref>

Fidelity Management and Research in 2009 opened offices in both Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan to add capabilities to its small cap research.

In 2004, Fidelity established its first presence in India by opening an office in [[Mumbai]]. However, their offices in India mostly serve back-office function and do not make any investments related decisions.<ref name=heritage/> The company has over 4,000 employees in India. Its second largest software development facility (after the United States) is in [[Bangalore]] and [[Chennai]].

Fidelity Investments Ireland was established in 1996 as the European offshore development centre for Fidelity Investments and now employs over 1,000 people with offices in [[Dublin]] and [[Galway]]. Fidelity also has offices in [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Switzerland]] and [[London]] for its HR Solution business HR Access.

==Marketing==
===Paul McCartney marketing campaign===
Fidelity has experimented with marketing techniques directed to the [[baby boomer]] demographic, releasing ''[[Never Stop Doing What You Love]]'', a compilation of songs by [[Paul McCartney]]. McCartney became the firm's [[spokesman]] in 2005 in a campaign entitled "This Is Paul". On the day of the disc's release, company employees were treated to a special recorded message by Paul himself informing them that "Fidelity and [he] have a lot in common" and urging them to "never stop doing what you love".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2005/09/08/brand_on_the_run/ | title=Brand on the run: Struggling Fidelity turns to ex-Beatle to lure boomers | first=Jenn | last=Abelson | publisher=[[Boston Globe]] | date=September 8, 2005}}</ref>
