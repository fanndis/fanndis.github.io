The '''chief financial officer''' ('''CFO''') is [[Corporate title|officer]] of a company that has primary responsibility for managing the company's [[finance|finances]], including [[financial plan]]ning, management of [[financial risk]]s, record-keeping, and financial reporting. In some sectors, the CFO is also responsible for [[Data analysis|analysis of data]]. Some CFOs have the title '''CFOO''' for '''chief financial and operating officer'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Job_openings/CFOO|title=Job openings/CFOO - Wikimedia Foundation|website=wikimediafoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the typical term for a CFO is '''finance director''' ('''FD'''). The CFO typically reports to the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) and the [[board of directors]] and may additionally have a seat on the board. The CFO supervises the finance unit and is the chief financial spokesperson for the organization. The CFO directly assists the [[chief operating officer]] (COO) on all strategic and tactical matters relating to budget management, cost–benefit analysis, forecasting needs, and securing of new funding.

==Qualification==
Most CFOs of large companies have finance qualifications such as a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), [[Master of Science]] (in either [[Finance]] or [[Accounting]]), [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] or come from an [[Accountancy|accounting]] background such as a [[Certified Public Accountant]]. A finance department usually consists of qualified accountants such as Certified Public Accountant, [[Chartered Accountant]], [[Certified Management Accountant]], [[Chartered Certified Accountant]].

==Federal government of the United States==
The [[federal government of the United States]] has incorporated more elements of business-sector practices in its management approaches, including the use of the CFO position alongside, for example, an increased use of the [[chief information officer]] post, within public agencies.

The [[Chief Financial Officers Act]], enacted in 1990, created a chief financial officer in each of 23 federal agencies. This was intended to improve the government's financial management and develop standards of financial performance and disclosure. The [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) holds primary responsibility for financial management standardization and improvement. Within OMB, the Deputy Director for Management, a position established by the CFO Act, is the chief official responsible for financial management.

The [[Office of Federal Financial Management]] (OFFM) is specifically charged with overseeing financial management matters, establishing financial management policies and requirements, and monitoring the establishment and operation of federal financial management systems. OFFM is led by a [[Comptroller|controller]].

The CFO Act also established the CFO Council, chair by the OMB Deputy Director for Management and including the CFOs and Deputy CFOs of 23 federal agencies, the OFFM controller, and the Fiscal Assistant Secretary, the head of the [[Office of Fiscal Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]. Its mandate is to work collaboratively to improve financial management in the U.S. government and "advise and coordinate the activities of the agencies of its members" in the areas of financial management and accountability.

[[OMB Circular A-123]] (issued 21 December 2004) defines the management responsibilities for internal [[financial control]]s in federal agencies and addressed to all federal CFOs, CIOs and Program Managers. The circular is a re-examination of the existing internal control requirements for federal agencies and was initiated in light of the new internal control requirements for publicly traded companies contained in the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002.

While significant progress in improving federal financial management has been made since the federal government began preparing consolidated financial statements, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) reported that "major impediments continue to prevent [GAO] from rendering an opinion."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/press/mediaadv12152006.pdf|format=PDF|title=GAO: U.S. Financial Statements Receive Disclaimer of Opinion For 10th Straight Year|website=Gao.gov|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> In December 2006, the GAO announced that for the 10th consecutive year, the GAO was prevented from expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the government due to a number of material weaknesses related to financial systems, fundamental recordkeeping, and financial reporting.

At the same time, in calendar year 2007, the CFOC announced that for the second consecutive year, every major federal agency completed its Performance and Accountability Report just 25 days after the end of the fiscal year (2006).

==Changing role==
In recent years, the role of the CFO has evolved significantly. Traditionally being viewed as a financial gatekeeper, the role of the CFO has expanded and evolved to an advisor and a strategic partner to the CEO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/14/cfo-role-shifts-from-number-cruncher-to-business-leader/|title=CFO Role Shifts From Number Cruncher To Business Leader – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/03/26/with-ai-cfos-are-poised-to-evolve-their-role-within-organizations/#62b12a4e5175|title=With AI, CFOs Are Poised To Evolve Their Role Within Organizations|last=Harris|first=Aaron|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}</ref>  In fact, in a report released by McKinsey, 88 percent of 164 CFOs surveyed reported that CEOs expect them to be more active participants in shaping the strategy of their organizations. Half of them also indicated that CEOs counted on them to challenge the company's strategy.<ref>{{cite web|title=McKinsey on Finance.

According to one source, "The CFO of tomorrow should be a big-picture thinker, rather than detail-oriented, outspoken rather than reserved, prefer to delegate rather than be hands-on, emphasize what gets done rather than how things are done, and make collaborative rather than unilateral decisions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/272476|title=Good Chief Financial Officers Focus on Much More Than Finance|last=Zwilling|first=Martin|date=2016-03-18|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en}}</ref> The CFO must serve as the financial authority in the organization, ensuring the integrity of fiscal data and modeling transparency and accountability. The CFO is as much a part of governance and oversight as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), playing a fundamental role in the development and critique of strategic choices.

The uneven pace of recovery worldwide has made it more challenging for many companies. CFOs are increasingly playing a more critical role in shaping their company's strategies today, especially in light of the highly uncertain macroeconomic environments,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/22/1071706/|title=When Should Startups Hire A CFO? – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> where managing financial volatilities is becoming a centerpiece for many companies' strategies, based on a survey held by Clariden Global.<ref name="Clariden Global">{{cite web|url=http://www.claridenglobal.com/clariden_leadership_programs.php|title=Clariden Global|website=Claridenglobal.com|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> CFOs are increasingly being relied upon as the owners of business information, reporting and financial data within organizations and assisting in decision support operations to enable the company to operate more effectively and efficiently.

The duties of a modern CFO now straddle the traditional areas of financial stewardship and the more progressive areas of strategic and business leadership with direct responsibility and oversight of operations (which often includes procurement) expanding exponentially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/2016/01/14/why-cfos-need-to-be-chief-future-officers/|title=Why CFOs Need To Be Chief Future Officers|first=Jeff|last=Thomson|website=Forbes.com|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> This significant role-based transformation, which is well underway, is best-evidenced by the "CEO-in-Waiting" status that many CFOs now hold. Additionally, many CFOs have made the realization that an operating environment that values cash, profit margins, and risk mitigation is one that plays to the primary skills and capabilities of a procurement organization, and become increasingly involved (directly via oversight or indirectly through improved collaboration) with the procurement function according to a recent research report that looks at the CFO's relationship with procurement.<ref name="Ardent">{{cite web|url=http://ardentpartners.com/research/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=4_12&products_id=1|title=The CFO and the CPO: One World, Two Worldviews Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Procurement Officer (CPO)|website=Ardentpartners.com|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref>
