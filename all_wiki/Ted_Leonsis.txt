;Management
After purchasing the Wizards, Leonsis criticized the NBA's [[salary cap]] at a luncheon with business leaders. He was fined $100,000 by the league, for "unauthorized public comments regarding the league's collective bargaining negotiations."<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jJbRt6Q7QGB7OgRuB0Pv51kmidFg?docId=4676762]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> Leonsis has sought to roll-back changes to the Wizards and Capitals franchises that coincided with the opening of the Verizon Center in 1997. In 2007, he changed the Capitals team logo and its colors back to their original red, white, and blue, and in May 2011, received positive responses from media, fans, players and alumni when the Wizards unveiled a similar red, white and blue color scheme, along with uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the team under their former name, the Bullets, when they won the [[1978 NBA Playoffs|NBA Championship]] in [[1977–78 NBA season|1978]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wizards-insider/post/wizards-unveil-new-uniforms/2011/05/10/AFEH6chG_blog.html |title= Wizards Unveil New Uniforms|date = May 10, 2011 | work=The Washington Post |first=Tracee |last=Hamilton}}</ref> Additionally, he had taken under consideration restoring the Bullets name to the franchise,<ref>{{cite news|last=Lee |first=Michael |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/wizardsinsider/2010/10/ted-leonsis-hints-at-a-possibl.html |title=Wizards Insider – Ted Leonsis says name change to Bullets is 'under consideration' |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> though critics said that this would "send the wrong message" about [[Crime in Washington, D.C.|gun violence in Washington]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/08/AR2010100806452.html |title=From the Wizards back to the Bullets?

;Washington Capitals
Leonsis has owned the Washington Capitals since the spring of 1999, and in that timeframe the team has won ten Southeast Division titles, three Presidents’ Trophies, recorded more than 200 consecutive sellouts at Verizon Center (now Capital One Arena), and won a Stanley Cup Championship.<ref name="About Me: Ted Leonsis"/>

In the early years of his ownership, the Capitals went on to win back-to-back Southeast Division titles in 2000 and 2001, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. In summer 2001, the Capitals traded for [[Jaromír Jágr]] and signed him to what was at the time, the largest contract in NHL history. The trade was enthusiastically well received by fans and over 300 people showed up at Dulles International Airport to greet Jágr when he arrived.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/post/intern/stories01-12.htm|title=Jagr Arrives With a Message; Of Stanley Cup Win, New Capital Says, 'Hopefully We're Going to Do It'|work=The Washington Post|date=July 17, 2001|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> After Jágr was traded in 2004, Leonsis was criticized by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jan/28/20040128-010459-3265r/?page=2 |title=NHL to examine incident |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> He was involved in a physical altercation with a fan, who led a mocking chant of Leonsis during the game and hoisted a sign chiding him. In the altercation, Leonsis grabbed and threw the fan to the ground, which also caused a young child to fall to the ground. For his involvement in the scuffle, Leonsis was fined $100,000. He also received a suspension of one week, during which he was prohibited from having any contact with the team.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=1721387|title= Leonsis involved in incident with fine|publisher=[[ESPN]] |date = January 29, 2004}}</ref>  After the incident, Leonsis personally called the fan to apologize for his actions and invited him and his family to watch a game in the owner's box.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/27/sports/sp-caps27|title=Capital Owner, Fan Fight After Defeat|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 27, 2004|accessdate=February 12, 2014|first=Jason|last=La Canfora}}</ref>

In 2009, a season ticket holder informed Leonsis of a homeless man, Scott Lovell, who spent his nights sleeping outside Verizon Center. Leonsis found Lovell a part-time job as a restaurant kitchen worker and provided him with a paid and furnished apartment, a prosthetic leg and Capitals season tickets for life. In return, Lovell vowed to remain clean and sober.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2012/04/scott-lovell-goes-from-homeless-to-sober-clean-and-caps-fan-75373.html|title=Scott Lovell goes from homeless to sober, clean and Caps fan|publisher=ABC 7 News|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref>
