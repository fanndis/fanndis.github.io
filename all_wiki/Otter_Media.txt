==History==
In April 2014, [[AT&T]] and the [[Peter Chernin |Chernin Group]] established Otter Media as the 50:50 joint venture to offer [[over-the-top media service|OTT service]]s.

In January 2016, Otter Media invested in [[Van Toffler]] (former CEO of [[Viacom Media Networks]] Music Group) and Floris Bauer's Gunpowder & Sky, a digital content company which eventually merged with FilmBuff.<ref>{{cite web |title=Van Toffler Launches Digital Studio Backed by Chernin Group, AT&T |first=Todd |last=Spangler |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/van-toffler-chernin-att-gunpowder-sky-studio-1201678626/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mUfxArHQ?url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/van-toffler-chernin-att-gunpowder-sky-studio-1201678626/ |archivedate=December 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In November 2016, Otter Media and actress [[Reese Witherspoon]] formed [[Hello Sunshine (company)|Hello Sunshine]], a joint venture focused on telling female-driven stories on film, TV, and digital platforms.<ref name="hello">{{cite web |title=Reese Witherspoon, Otter Media Pact For New Company Hello Sunshine |first=Anita |last=Busch |url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/reese-witherspoon-otter-media-new-company-hello-sunshine-1201858003/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=November 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6nWs3QER4?url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/reese-witherspoon-otter-media-new-company-hello-sunshine-1201858003/ |archivedate=January 15, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In July 2017, AT&T was reportedly looking to acquire full ownership of the company along with other joint ventures inherited in its acquisition of satellite TV provider [[DirecTV]]. The company if it were to be fully acquired by AT&T will cost a valuation of $1 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.recode.net/platform/amp/2018/1/18/16906042/cbs-viacom-merger-media-market-landscape-streaming |title=Here’s the chart that explains why CBS and Viacom want to merge |website=www.recode.net |language=en |access-date=2018-06-27}}</ref> Since February 2018, its CEO is Tony Goncalves (who was an AT&T Digital executive).

In January 2018, Otter Media bought the remaining stake in Ellation, the owner of [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]] and [[Crunchyroll]], and integrated it as Otter Media's Consumer Division.<ref name=":0" />

On June 20, 2018, ''[[Recode]]'' reported that AT&T was close to buying out Chernin's stake in Otter Media, on the heel of its acquisition of Time Warner (whose digital media holdings included [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.recode.net/2018/6/20/17481532/at-t-otter-media-chernin-group-fullscreen-crunchyroll |title=AT&T is getting ready to acquire all of Otter Media, the streaming video company it co-owns with Peter Chernin |work=Recode |access-date=2018-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620153125/https://www.recode.net/2018/6/20/17481532/at-t-otter-media-chernin-group-fullscreen-crunchyroll |archive-date=2018-06-20 |url-status=dead}}</ref> On August 7, 2018, AT&T announced their acquisition of Chernin Group's stake in Otter Media for an undisclosed amount, believed to be around $1 billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/att-buys-out-chernin-groups-stake-in-otter-media-1202898339/ |title=AT&T Buys Out Chernin Group’s Stake in Otter Media |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=2018-08-07 |work=Variety |access-date=2018-11-22 |language=en-US}}</ref>

On August 22, 2018, Ellation formed Ellation Studios, a production studio with facilities in both the U.S. and Japan, to produce original content for Crunchyroll and VRV.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/ellation-studios-crunchyroll-originals-high-guardian-spice-1202912537/ |title=AT&T’s Ellation Launches Studios in Burbank and Tokyo to Produce Crunchyroll Originals |first=Janko |last=Roettgers |date=22 August 2018 |website=variety.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/deeper-dive-at-t-has-extra-svod-gems-crunchyroll-and-vrv |title=Deeper Dive—AT&T has extra SVOD gems in Crunchyroll and VRV |website=www.fiercevideo.com}}</ref>

On December 4, 2018, Otter announced a broad restructuring that would result in the layoff of about ten percent of its staff. As part of the reorganization, Machinima, which had been part of Warner Bros. Digital Networks, was re-organized under Otter Media. Ellation will now house Rooster Teeth, Crunchyroll, and VRV, while Machinima became a unit of Fullscreen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/otter-media-layoffs-machinima-reorg-1203079823/ |title=AT&T’s Otter Media Lays Off 10% of Staff, Will Absorb Machinima in Reorg |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=2018-12-04 |website=Variety |language=en |access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/01/22/machinima-wipes-youtube-channel/ |title=After Porting Its Creator Network To Fullscreen, Machinima Wipes Seminal YouTube Channel |last=Weiss |first=Geoff |date=2019-01-22 |website=Tubefilter |access-date=2019-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/19/18189611/machinima-youtube-fullscreen-warner-bros-multi-channel-network |title=Machinima, one of YouTube’s biggest and oldest channels, goes dark |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=2019-01-19 |website=The Verge |access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>
