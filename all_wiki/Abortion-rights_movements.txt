'''Abortion-rights movements''', also referred to as '''pro-choice movements''', advocate for [[abortion law|legal]] access to induced [[abortion]] services. It is the argument against the  pro-life movement. The issue of induced abortion remains divisive in public life, with [[abortion debate|recurring arguments]] to liberalize or to restrict access to legal abortion services. Abortion-rights supporters themselves are divided as to the types of abortion services that should be available and to the circumstances, for example different periods in the pregnancy such as [[Late termination of pregnancy|late term abortions]], in which access may be restricted.

==Terminology==
Many of the terms used in the debate are [[Framing (social sciences)|political framing]] terms used to validate one's own stance while invalidating the opposition's.  For example, the labels "pro-choice" and "pro-life" imply endorsement of widely held values such as [[liberty]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], while suggesting that the opposition must be "anti-choice" or "anti-life" (alternatively "pro-coercion" or "pro-death").<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Constructionist Research |author=Holstein |author2=Gubrium |name-list-style=amp |publisher= Guilford Press |year=2008 }}</ref>

These views do not always fall along a binary; in one [[Public Religion Research Institute]] poll, they noted that the vagueness of the terms led to seven in ten Americans describing themselves as "pro-choice", while almost two-thirds described themselves as "pro-life".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/06/committed-to-availability-conflicted-about-morality-what-the-millennial-generation-tells-us-about-the-future-of-the-abortion-debate-and-the-culture-wars/ |publisher=Public Religion Research Institute |title=Committed to Availability, Conflicted about Morality: What the Millennial Generation Tells Us about the Future of the Abortion Debate and the Culture Wars |date=9 June 2011}}</ref> It was found that, in polling, respondents would label themselves differently when given specific details about the circumstances around an abortion including factors such as rape, incest, viability of the fetus, and survivability of the mother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/02/the-big-pro-life-shift-in-a-new-poll-is-an-illusion.html|title=The Big 'Pro-Life' Shift in a New Poll Is an Illusion|last=Kilgore|first=Ed|date=25 May 2019|website=Intelligencer|language=en|access-date=23 July 2019}}</ref>

==Early history==
Feminists of the late 19th century were often opposed to the legalization of abortion, seeing it as a means of relieving men of responsibility.<ref>Gordon, Sarah Barringer.

Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, "be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Stella Browne.gif|thumb|right|[[Stella Browne]] was a pioneering feminist who campaigned for the liberalization of abortion law.]]
The movement towards the liberalization of abortion law emerged in the 1920s and 1930s in the context of the victories that had been recently won in the area of [[birth control]]. Campaigners including [[Marie Stopes]] in England and [[Margaret Sanger]] in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need.

In 1929, the [[Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929|Infant Life Preservation Act]] was passed in the [[United Kingdom]], which amended the law ([[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence.<ref>[[Hansard|HL Deb]]. Vol 72. [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1928/nov/22/preservation-of-infant-life-bill-hl|Col 269].</ref>

[[Stella Browne]] was a leading birth control campaigner, who increasingly began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of [[Havelock Ellis]], [[Edward Carpenter]] and other [[sexologists]].<ref name="Hall">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Lesley|title=The Life and Times of Stella Browne: Feminist and Free Spirit|year=2011|pages=27–178}}</ref> She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy.<ref>Jones, Greta. "Women and eugenics in Britain: The case of Mary Scharlieb, Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, and Stella Browne." ''[[Annals of Science]]'' 52 no. 5 (1995):481-502</ref> In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowbotham|first=Sheila|title=A New World for Women: Stella Browne, social feminist|year=1977|pages=66–67}}</ref>

In the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women's health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics.<ref name="Hall"/> These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman's right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture “The Right to Abortion” in front of the [[World Sexual Reform Congress]] in London.<ref name="Hall"/> In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an [[abortion]].<ref name="Hall"/> She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning.<ref name="Hall"/>

[[File:Aleck bourne trial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleck Bourne]] was acquitted for performing an abortion on a rape victim in 1938, a landmark case in the movement for abortion rights.]]
Other prominent feminists, including [[Frida Laski]], [[Dora Russell]], [[Joan Malleson]] and [[Janet Chance]] began to champion this cause - the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the [[British Medical Association]] council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion.<ref name="Hall"/> On 17 February 1936, [[Janet Chance]], Alice Jenkins and [[Joan Malleson]] established the [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] as the first [[advocacy]] organisation for abortion liberalization. The association promoted access to [[abortion in the United Kingdom]] and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles.<ref name="HindellSimms">{{cite journal|last=Hindell|first=Keith|author2=Madeline Simms|title=How the Abortion Lobby Worked|year=1968|journal=[[The Political Quarterly]]|pages=271–272}}</ref> In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members.<ref name="HindellSimms"/>

The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA's Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. [[Joan Malleson]], a progenitor of the ALRA.<ref name="HindellSimms"/> This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public.

In 1938, [[Joan Malleson]] precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year old [[rape]] victim to [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]] [[Aleck Bourne]]. He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion. Bourne was eventually acquitted in ''Rex v. Bourne'' as his actions were "...an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession".<ref>R v Bourne [1939] 1 KB 687, [1938] 3 All ER 615, [[Court of Criminal Appeal (England and Wales)|CCA]]</ref> This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause "mental and physical wreck".

The [[Abortion Law Reform Association]] continued its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s. President of the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] [[John Peel (gynaecologist)|John Peel]] chaired the committee advising the [[British Government]] on what became the [[1967 Abortion Act]], which allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks.<ref name="Commons 1967">House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee.

In America an abortion reform movement emerged in the 1960s. In 1964 [[Gerri Santoro]] of [[Connecticut]] died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement. Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as "[[Jane Collective|Jane]]" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find "Jane".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwluherstory.org/something-real-jane-and-me-memories-and-exhortations-of-a-feminist-ex-abortionist.html|title=Something Real: Jane and Me.

In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion. The forerunner of the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion.<ref>[http://www.nwhn.org/content/index.php?pid=106 National Women's Health Network | A Voice For Women, A Network For Change<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In late 1973 NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League.

The landmark judicial ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' ruled that a [[Texas]] statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional. The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]]. The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion. The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor. After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being in the decision [[Doe v. Bolton]], delivered concurrently.

From the 1970s, and the spread of [[second-wave feminism]], abortion and [[reproductive rights]] became unifying issues among various [[feminism|women's rights]] groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and Italy.<ref>LeGates, Marlene.

[[Abortion in South Africa|South Africa]] allows abortion on demand under its [[Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act]]. Most African nations, however, have abortion bans except in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk. A number of abortion-rights international organizations have made altering abortion laws and expanding [[family planning]] services in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[developing world]] a top priority.

Chapter XXIX of the [[Penal Code of Japan]] makes [[abortion]] illegal in Japan. However, the [[:ja:母体保護法|Maternal Health Protection Law]] allows [[:ja:母体保護法指定医師|approved doctors]] to practice abortion with the consent of the mother and her spouse, if the pregnancy has [[Pregnancy from rape|resulted from rape]], or if the continuation of the pregnancy may severely endanger the maternal health because of physical reasons or economic reasons. Other people, including the mother herself, trying to abort the [[fetus]] can be punished by the law.

{{main|Abortion in South Korea}}
Abortion has been illegal in South Korea since 1953 but on 11 April 2019, South Korea's Constitutional Court ruled the abortion ban unconstitutional and called for the law to be amended.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/asia/south-korea-abortion-ban-ruling.html|title=South Korea Rules Anti-Abortion Law Unconstitutional|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|date=11 April 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 April 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The law stands until the end of 2020. The Constitutional Court has taken into consideration abortion-rights cases by women because they find the abortion ban as unconstitutional. To help support the legalization of abortion in South Korea, thousands of advocates compiled a petition for the Blue House to consider lifting the ban. Due to the abortion ban, this has led to many dangerous self-induced abortions and other illegal practices of abortion that needs more attention. This is why there are advocates challenging the law to put into perspective the negative factors this abortion ban brings. By making abortion illegal in South Korea, this also creates an issue when it comes to women's rights and their own rights to their bodies. As a result, many women's advocate groups were created and acted together to protest against the abortion ban law.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Economist |date=9 November 2017 |title=A campaign to legalise abortion is gaining ground in South Korea |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/11/09/a-campaign-to-legalise-abortion-is-gaining-ground-in-south-korea |access-date=20 June 2019}}</ref>

===== Republic of Ireland =====
Abortion was illegal in the [[Republic of Ireland]] except when the woman's life was threatened by a medical condition (including risk of suicide), since [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|a 1983 referendum (aka 8th Amendment)]] amended the [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]]. Subsequent [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendments]] in 1992 (after the [[X Case]]) – the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|thirteenth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|fourteenth]] – guaranteed the right to travel abroad (for abortions) and to distribute and obtain information of "lawful services" available in other countries. Two proposal to remove suicide risk as a ground for abortion were rejected by the people, [[Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992|in a referendum in 1992]] and [[Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2002|in 2002]].

Their proposals, broadly supported by a cross-party Oireachtas committee, include repeal of the 8th Amendment, unrestricted access to abortion for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and no-term limits for special cases of fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/The-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Final-Report-on-the-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/|title=Final Report on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution - The Citizens' Assembly|website=citizensassembly.ie|language=en|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beta.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/32/eighth-amendment-constitution/|title=Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|date=24 January 2018|website=beta.oireachtas.ie|language=en-ie|others=Houses of the Oireachtas|access-date=24 March 2018}}</ref>

==== Poland ====

{{Main|Abortion in Poland}}
Poland initially held abortion to be legal in 1958 by the communist government, but was later banned after restoration of democracy in 1989.

Currently, abortion is illegal in all cases except for rape or when the fetus or mother is in fatal conditions.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Douglas |first=Carol Anne |title=Poland restricts abortion |date=1981-11-30 |language=en |magazine=Off Our Backs |volume=11 |issue=10 |page=14 |id={{ProQuest|197142942}}}}</ref> The wide spread of [[Catholic Church in Poland]] within the country has made abortion socially 'unacceptable'<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Feminists vs. the church |last=Douglas |first=Carol Anne |magazine=Off Our Backs |volume=24 |issue=3 |date=Mar 1994 |page=10 |id={{ProQuest|197123721}}}}</ref> <sup>.</sup> [[Pope|The Pope]] has had major influence on the acceptance of abortion within Poland<ref>https://search.proquest.com/docview/1411117675<nowiki/>{{Registration required}}</ref> <sup>.</sup> Several landmark court cases have had substantial influence on the current status of abortion, including [[Tysiąc v Poland|Tysiac v Poland]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Hewson |first=Barbara |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=Summer 2007 |page=34-35 |title=Abortion in poland: A new human rights ruling |magazine=Conscience |id={{ProQuest|195070632}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/24/polish-abortion-law-protesters-march-against-proposed-restrictions|title=Polish abortion law protesters march against proposed restrictions|agency=Associated Press|date=24 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=27 October 2016|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

==== United Kingdom ====
{{main|Abortion in the United Kingdom}}
In the United Kingdom, the [[Abortion Act 1967]] legalized abortion on a wide number of grounds, except in [[Northern Ireland]]. In Great Britain, the law states that pregnancy may be terminated up to 24 weeks<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7412118.stm|title=MPs reject cut in abortion limit|date=21 May 2008|work=BBC News|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> if it:

#puts the life of the pregnant woman at risk
#poses a risk to the mental and physical health of the pregnant woman
#poses a risk to the mental and physical health of the fetus
#shows there is evidence of extreme fetal abnormality i.e. the child would be seriously physically or mentally handicapped after birth and during life.<ref>{{UK-LEG|title=Abortion Act 1967|type=ukpga|path=/ukpga/1967/87}}.</ref>

However, the criterion of risk to mental and physical health is applied broadly, and ''de facto'' makes abortion available on demand,<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2002/297.html R v British Broadcasting Corporation, ex parte ProLife Alliance] [2002] EWCA Civ 297 at [6], [2002] 2 All ER 756 at 761, CA</ref> though this still requires the consent of two [[National Health Service]] doctors. Abortions in Great Britain are provided at no out-of-pocket cost to the patient by the NHS.

The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] are predominantly pro-abortion-rights parties, though with significant minorities in each either holding more restrictive definitions of the right to choose, or subscribing to an anti-abortion analysis. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is more evenly split between both camps and its former leader, [[David Cameron]], supports abortion on demand in the early stages of pregnancy.<ref>[http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/20th-june-2008/3/david-cameron-supports-abortion-on-demand David Cameron supports abortion on demand], [[Catholic Herald]], 20 June 2008.</ref>

Legal abortion is now allowed if the mother's life is in danger, and also in cases of fetal abnormalities that makes it not viable after birth (such as anencephaly) or produce difficulties for mother to take care of it after birth, such as major [[thalassemia]] or bilateral polycystic kidney disease.
