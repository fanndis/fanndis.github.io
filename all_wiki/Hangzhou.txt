It sits at the head of [[Hangzhou Bay]], which separates [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's [[West Lake]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among "Chinese Cities of Opportunity".

Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in [[mainland China]] by [[Forbes]]. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]], Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices. Hangzhou ranks 11th in the world and 6th in China (after [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shenzhen]] and [[Guangzhou]]) in terms of the number of billionaires according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2020.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-26|title=Shimao Shenkong International Center·Hurun Global Rich List 2020|url=https://hurun.net/EN/Article/Details?num=775CEFAE8BF8|website=Hurun Report}}</ref>

=== Medieval history ===
[[File:Hangzhou pic 10.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leifeng Pagoda]]]]

Hangzhou was made the seat of the [[zhou (Chinese province)|prefecture]] of Hang in {{nowrap|AD 589}}, entitling it to a [[Chinese city wall|city wall]] which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like [[Guangzhou]] and [[Fuzhou]], the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 114">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 114: "[…] the Grand Canal, dug between 605 and 609 by means of enormous levies of conscripted labour."</ref>

In the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Bai Juyi]] was appointed governor of Hangzhou.<ref name="Waley 1941, 131">Waley (1941), 131</ref> Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of [[West Lake]], but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old [[dike (construction)|dyke]] had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe [[drought]]. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a [[dam]] to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named "Bai Causeway", in his honor.

It is listed as one of the [[Historical capitals of China|Seven Ancient Capitals of China]]. It was first the capital of the [[Wuyue Kingdom]] from 907 to 978 during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].

In 1089, while another renowned poet [[Su Shi]] (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a {{convert|2.8|km|1|abbr=on}} long [[causeway]] across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by [[Su Shi]], and the Bai Causeway built by [[Bai Juyi]], a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The [[Baochu Pagoda]] sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.

Arab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the [[Song dynasty]], due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&q=mosque+ningbo&pg=PA210|title=Beyond the Great Wall: urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|year=1996|author=Piper Rae Gaubatz|publisher=Stanford University Press|edition=illustrated|isbn=0-8047-2399-0|page=210|accessdate=17 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527074939/http://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&pg=PA210&dq=mosque+ningbo&hl=en&ei=dAbcTebnL8bx0gH3w-zqDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=mosque%20ningbo&f=false|archive-date=May 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century.

From 1138 until the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as '''Lin'an''' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|臨安}}}}). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the [[civil service]]. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered "central China" in the north was taken by the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]], an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]].

Numerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as [[Su Shi]], [[Lu You]], and [[Xin Qiji]] came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD), his tomb being located in the [[Yuhang]] district.<ref name="Yuhang">Yuhang Cultural Network (October 2003).

During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian [[Jacques Gernet]] has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|title=Largest Cities Through History|website=Geography.about.com|date=2011-03-02|access-date=2011-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010218202126/http://geography.about.com/science/geography/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2001|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>Janet L.

Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.

Hangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing [[Mongol]] armies of [[Kublai Khan]] in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song.<ref name="gernet 15">Gernet, 15.</ref> The capital of the new [[Yuan dynasty]] was established in the city of [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]] ([[Beijing]]), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.

===Modern history===

The city remained an important port until the middle of the [[Ming dynasty]] era, when its harbor slowly [[silt]]ed up. Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], it was the site of an [[Qing Army|imperial army]] garrison.<ref>{{citation |last=Cassel |first=Pär |contribution=Excavating Extraterritoriality: The "Judicial Sub-Prefect" as a Prototype for the Mixed Court in Shanghai |title=Late Imperial China |volume=24 |date=2003 |issue=2 |pages=156–182 }}.</ref>

In 1856 and 1860, the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.

Hangzhou was ruled by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] government under the [[Kuomintang]] from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan]]. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the [[People's Liberation Army]] entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the [[Yangtze Delta]] to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.

[[File:Eastchina and Eastchina Sea tmo 2017313 geo.tif|thumb|A satellite image of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. The [[Yangtze]]'s natural [[Sediment transport|sediment discharge]] can be seen.]]

Hangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China]], which runs to [[Beijing]], in the south-central portion of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of [[Anhui]] province, and east to the coastal plain near [[Hangzhou Bay]]. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the [[Qiantang River]].

=== Climate ===

Hangzhou's climate is [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa'') with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is {{convert|17.0|°C|1}}, with monthly daily averages ranging from {{convert|4.6|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.9|°C}} in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1438|mm|1|abbr=on}} and is affected by the [[Meiyu|plum rains]] of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers [[typhoon]] storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains.<ref>[http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/hangzhou.htm Hangzhou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826021651/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/hangzhou.htm |date=August 26, 2006 }}.

The native residents of Hangzhou, like those of [[Zhejiang]] and southern [[Jiangsu]], speak [[Hangzhou dialect]], which is a [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern [[Jiangsu]]. As the official language defined by China's central government, [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] is the dominant spoken language.

There are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|中国丝绸博物馆}}), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|中国茶叶博物馆}}) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture. Zhejiang Provincial Museum ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|浙江博物馆}}) features collection of integrated human studies, exhibition and research with its over 100,000 collected cultural relics.

Many theaters in Hangzhou host opera shows. [[Yue opera]], originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like [https://web.archive.org/web/20140605035555/http://www.hzyxxh.com/en/ Impression West Lake] and the Romance of Song Dynasty.

Hangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the [[China Academy of Art]] and prominent painters such as [[Lin Fengmian]] and [[Fang Ganmin]].

Tea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating [[Longjing tea|Longjing]], a notable variety of [[green tea]], the most notable type being [[Longjing Tea]].<ref>{{cite book|title=China, Volume 10|author=Cummings, Joe and Robert Storey|publisher=Lonely Planets Publications|year=1991|isbn=0-86442-123-0|page=345}}</ref> Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village<ref name="the tea fields of Longjing"/> near [[West Lake]] in Hangzhou, hence its name.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon [[silk]] production, [[umbrella]]s, and Chinese hand-held folding [[fan (implement)|fans]].

=== Cuisine ===
[[File:Xi Hu Longjing Tea 01.jpg|thumb|Xihu Longjing ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|西湖龙井}}), Longjing tea planted near the West Lake]]
Hangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang provincial cuisine]], which is claimed as one of [[Chinese cuisine|China's eight fundamental cuisines]]. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be "fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance."

Generally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.

Dishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|片儿川}}), West Lake Vinegar Fish ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|西湖醋鱼}}), Dongpo Pork ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|东坡肉}}), Longjing Shrimp ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|龙井虾仁}}), [[Beggar's Chicken]] ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|叫化鸡}}), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves({{lang|zh-hans-CN|荷叶粉蒸肉}}), Braised Bamboo Shoots ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|油焖笋}}), Lotus Root Pudding ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|藕粉}}) and Sister Song's Fish Soup ({{lang|zh-hans-CN|宋嫂鱼羹}}) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.

{{citation needed span|The famous and signature|date=April 2020}} restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant ({{lang|zh-Hans|新丰小吃}}), Zhi Wei Guan ({{lang|zh-Hans|知味观}}), Grandma's Home ({{lang|zh|外婆家}}), Green Tea Restaurant ({{lang|zh-Hans|绿茶餐厅}}), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and {{citation needed span|combine with the western cooking methods|date=April 2020}}.

It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the [[Xiaoshan District]] with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of [[Air China]]. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.

===Rail===

Hangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is [[Hangzhou East railway station]] (colloquially "East Station" {{lang|zh-hans|东站}}). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for [[Shanghai]] with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other [[China Railway High-speed|CRH]] high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The [[Hangzhou railway station]] (colloquially the "City Station" {{zh|c=城站|links=no}}) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.

Direct trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to [[Beijing]] and more than 100 daily services to [[Shanghai]]; they reach as far as [[Ürümqi]]. The [[China Railway High-Speed]] service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of {{convert|350|km/h|abbr=on}}, shortening the duration of the {{convert|202|km|abbr=on}} trip to only 45 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/26/c_13575584.htm|author=[[xinhuanet]]|title=China unveils Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed railway; eyes network extension|date=2010-10-26|accessdate=2010-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029002208/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/26/c_13575584.htm|archive-date=October 29, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==

An ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:
:''"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below."'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|上有天堂，下有苏杭}})
This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases "Heaven on Earth".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as "the city of the earth" while Hangzhou is "the city of heaven".<ref>{{citation|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft#page/288/mode/2up|author=J.M. Dent|title=The travels of Marco Polo the Venetian|chapter=Chapter LXVIII: On the Noble and Magnificent City of Kin-Sai|year=1908|page=289|access-date=October 16, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402140626/http://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft#page/288/mode/2up|archive-date=April 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  The city presented itself as "Paradise on Earth" during the [[2016 G20 Hangzhou summit|G20 summit]] held in the city in 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://time.com/4477547/g20-summit-china-hangzhou-environment/ |title= China's Hanghzou Clears Out Pests—and People—as It Prepares to Host the G20 Summit |author= Hannah Beech |date= September 2, 2016 |access-date= October 16, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161017005023/http://time.com/4477547/g20-summit-china-hangzhou-environment/ |archive-date= October 17, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

Another saying about Hangzhou is:
:''"Be born in [[Suzhou]], live in Hangzhou, eat in [[Guangzhou]], die in [[Liuzhou]]."'' ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|生在苏州，活在杭州，吃在广州，死在柳州}})
The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of [[Guangxi]]) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]).
