"'''Party'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011). It features guest vocals from American rapper [[André 3000]], [[J. Cole]], and background vocals from [[Kanye West]] and [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]], and was released by [[Columbia Records]] as the fourth [[single (music)|single]] from ''4'' on August 30, 2011. The song was written by [[Kanye West]], [[Jeff Bhasker]], Beyoncé, [[Consequence (rapper)|Dexter Mills]], [[Doug E. Fresh|Douglas Davis]] and [[Slick Rick|Ricky Walters]] and produced by Beyoncé and West and co-produced by Bhasker.

A [[tempo|midtempo]] [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, "Party" exhibits elements of the 1980s [[funk]] and [[soul music]], and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] the 1985 song "[[La Di Da Di]]". It recalls the work of [[New Edition]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], among others. Built on an [[Roland TR-808|808]]-retro [[Beat (music)|beat]], multi-tracked harmonies, and a smooth [[Groove (music)|groove]], the song's [[instrumentation]] includes slow-bouncing [[synthesizer]]s, [[Keyboard (instrument)|keyboard]] tones, and [[drum]]s. Lyrically, "Party" gives ode to political themes such as [[feminism]] and sexual empowerment. In his rap verses, André 3000 references [[milk]] and gets philosophical about his own career.

"Party" was acclaimed by contemporary [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised André 3000's verses, as well as the production handled by West and Beyoncé's emphatic, yet sensual vocals. It was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Following the release of ''4'', "Party" charted at number 19 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]]. It debuted on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in July 2011, and peaked at number 2 on the chart for three consecutive weeks. The song reached number 50 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart based on radio support. "Party" was part of Beyoncé's [[set list]] for her ''[[4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé]]'' and the ''[[Revel Presents: Beyoncé Live]]'' residency shows.

<blockquote>
The majority of ''4'' consists of mid-tempo pieces, but unlike the filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while not be easy to grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast.

"'''Party'''" was officially remixed with vocals from American rapper [[J. Cole]], replacing those of André 3000. The verses of André 3000 were supplanted by those from Cole; all other elements of the remix are identical to the original. His rap is much shorter than that of André 3000. In his verse, Cole thanks God and [[Ice Cube]] for Friday, references [[Sade (band)|Sade]] and [[Petey Pablo]] and [[name-drop]]s the [[Bugatti]] brand. Cole revealed that he was originally supposed to appear on the album version and that Beyoncé later enlisted him to appear on the official "Party" remix. It was released worldwide as a [[Music download|digital download]] on October 24, 2011 as a single.

An accompanying [[music video]] for "Party" was shot in [[New Jersey]] and was directed by Beyoncé. Cole replaced André 3000 in the clip, which takes viewers back to an old-school backyard celebration full of colorful bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few cameo appearances, including sister [[Solange Knowles]] and former [[Destiny's Child]] bandmate [[Kelly Rowland]].

During an interview with [[WWKX]] (106.3&nbsp;MHz [[FM broadcasting|FM]] "Hot 106") ''Rise & Grind Morning Show'', Cole revealed that he was originally supposed to appear on the album version and that Beyoncé later enlisted him when she was ready to release "Party" as a single.<ref name="cole2"/> He also explained why his verse was cut short and recalled his "unforgettable" experience of working with Beyoncé:

<blockquote>
You know how many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [''4''] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [Beyoncé] reached out to me and she wanted me to get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for something shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [Beyoncé]. I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on.

===Reception===
Andrew Martin of ''Prefix Magazine'' complimented the remix stating: "[The remix] might replace André 3000's typically great guest feature with one from J.

And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/beyonce/party-f-j-cole-remix/57753/ | title=Beyonce: "Party" F. J.

====Synopsis====
Criticized by James Dinh of MTV News, "[The music video for] 'Party' takes viewers back to an old-school backyard celebration full of colorful bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [Beyoncé] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn."<ref name="mtv1673249"/> The video is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy outfits, wearing neon-colored, oval-shaped nails,<ref name="aoln">{{cite web|url=http://blog.music.aol.com/2011/10/25/beyonce-party-video-preview/ |title=Beyonce Lets Loose in 'Party' Video Preview – But Where Is Her Baby Bump? |first=Contessa |last=Gayles |publisher=AOL Music.

As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard BBQ, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as [[Solange Knowles|Solange]] is [[DJing]]. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit,<ref name="aoln"/> jeweled drop earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls lie in the sun and splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.

Once outside the pool, Beyoncé, now in a ruffled blue and white bikini,<ref name="aoln"/> is sitting on a chaise longue and licking a lollipop. Beyoncé then shifts to another chaise longue where she relaxes with a bowl of snack food in her hand. Now wearing sunglasses, a black butterfly turban, and a furry green vest,<ref name="aoln"/> Beyoncé lounges on a plastic chair around an inflatable pool toys next to lawn flamingos and beer bottle-filled kiddie pools. As she sings, she throws some snack food towards the camera. Cole arrives in a blue Bugatti car to rap his verse in the parking lot. In a different scene, he sits on the bumper of a truck with Beyoncé on his left hand-side. They swing by the parties once they hit the hotel room for a short after-hours. Later, Beyoncé is seen doing a retouch of her makeup, sitting on the toilet. [[Kelly Rowland]] and Beyoncé are then shown, propped up against a red muscle car. Beyoncé wears in a canary bird style, yellow feather coat while Rowland wears a short maroon dress, and they are both seen smiling and dancing. Beyoncé then mows the lawn <!--'''and she repurposes segments of her ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' photoshoot as vignettes for the clip.'''--> and the video ends when Rowland and Beyoncé smiling into the camera.
