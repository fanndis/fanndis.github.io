==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of pulmonary embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or many of the following: [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), [[tachypnea]] (rapid breathing), [[chest pain]] of a "pleuritic" nature (worsened by breathing), [[cough]] and [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood).<ref name="Elsevier Mosby">{{cite book| vauthors = Lewis S, Dirksen S, Heitkemper M, Bucher L |title=Medical-surgical nursing: Assessment and management of clinical problems|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis, MO|isbn=978-0-323-08678-3|page=552|edition=9}}</ref> More severe cases can include signs such as [[cyanosis]] (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), [[Collapse (medical)|collapse]], and [[shock (circulatory)|circulatory instability]] because of decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart. About 15% of all cases of [[Sudden cardiac death|sudden death]] are attributable to PE.<ref name=Goldhaber/> While PE may present with [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], less than 1% of syncope cases are due to PE.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Oqab Z, Ganshorn H, Sheldon R | title = Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with syncope. A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 551–555 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 28947223 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajem.2017.09.015 }}</ref>

On physical examination, the lungs are usually normal. Occasionally, a [[pleural friction rub]] may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with [[Infarction|infarct]]). A [[pleural effusion]] is sometimes present that is exudative, detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds, and vocal resonance. Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud [[heart sounds|pulmonary component of the second heart sound]], and/or raised [[jugular venous pressure]].<ref name="Goldhaber" /> A low-grade [[fever]] may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein PD, Sostman HD, Hull RD, Goodman LR, Leeper KV, Gottschalk A, Tapson VF, Woodard PK | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the coronary care unit | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 103 | issue = 6 | pages = 881–6 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19268750 | pmc = 2717714 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.11.040 }}</ref>

As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation, they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]] and [[syncope (medicine)|fainting]], but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels.<ref>Pregerson DB, Quick Essentials: Emergency Medicine, 4th edition. EMresource.org</ref>

PEs are sometimes described as massive, submassive and nonmassive depending on the clinical signs and symptoms. Although the exact definitions of these are unclear, an accepted definition of massive PE is one in which there is hemodynamic instability such as sustained low blood pressure, [[bradycardia|slowed heart rate]], or pulselessness.<ref name=AHA2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaff MR, McMurtry MS, Archer SL, Cushman M, Goldenberg N, Goldhaber SZ, Jenkins JS, Kline JA, Michaels AD, Thistlethwaite P, Vedantham S, White RJ, Zierler BK | display-authors = 6 | title = Management of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association | journal = Circulation | volume = 123 | issue = 16 | pages = 1788–830 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21422387 | doi = 10.1161/CIR.0b013e318214914f | others = American Heart Association Council on Cardiopulmonary, Critical Care, Perioperative and Resuscitation, American Heart Association Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease, American Heart Association Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Risk factors==
[[File:Deep vein thrombosis of the right leg.jpg|thumb|A deep vein thrombosis as seen in the right leg is a risk factor for PE]]
About 90% of emboli are from [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] leg [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=F|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor|date=2012|publisher=Mosby's|location=St. Louis}}</ref> DVTs are at risk for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. The conditions are generally regarded as a continuum termed ''[[venous thromboembolism]]'' (VTE).

VTE is much more common in immunocompromised individuals as well as individuals with comorbidities including:

* Those that undergo orthopedic surgery at or below the hip without prophylaxis.<ref name=":0" />
** This is due to immobility during or after the surgery, as well as venous damage during the surgery.<ref name=":0" />
* Pancreatic and colon cancer patients (other forms of cancer also can be factors, but these are the most common)<ref name=":0" />
** This is due to the release of procoagulants.<ref name=":0" />
*** Risk of VTE is at its greatest during diagnosis and treatment, but lowers in remission.<ref name=":0" />
* Patients with high-grade tumors<ref name=":0" />
* Pregnant Individuals<ref name=":0" />
** As the body puts itself into what is known as a "hypercoagulable state" the risk of a hemorrhage during childbirth is decreased and is regulated by increased expression of factors VII, VIII, X, [[Von Willebrand factor|Von Willebrand]], and [[fibrinogen]].<ref name=":0" />
* Those on estrogen contraceptives<ref name=":0" />

The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named [[Virchow's triad]] (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.
* ''Alterations in blood flow'': immobilization (after surgery, long-haul flight), [[Physical trauma|injury]], [[pregnancy]] (also procoagulant), [[obesity]] (also procoagulant), [[cancer]] (also procoagulant)
* ''Factors in the vessel wall'': surgery, catheterizations causing direct injury ("endothelial injury")
* ''Factors affecting the properties of the blood'' (procoagulant state):
** [[Estrogen]]-containing [[hormonal contraception]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
** Genetic thrombophilia ([[factor V Leiden]], [[prothrombin mutation G20210A]], [[protein C deficiency]], [[protein S deficiency]], [[antithrombin]] deficiency, [[hyperhomocysteinemia]] and [[plasminogen]]/[[fibrinolysis]] disorders)
** Acquired thrombophilia ([[antiphospholipid syndrome]], [[nephrotic syndrome]], [[paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]])
** [[Cancer]] (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)
Although most pulmonary embolisms are the result of proximal leg [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVTs), there are still many other risk factors that can also result in a pulmonary embolism.

* Risk Factors Include:
** [[Varicose veins]] caused by vascular damage<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Toplis|first=Emma|last2=Mortimore|first2=Gerri|date=2020-01-09|title=The diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917939/|journal=British Journal of Nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)|volume=29|issue=1|pages=22–26|doi=10.12968/bjon.2020.29.1.22|issn=0966-0461|pmid=31917939}}</ref>

** [[Diabetes]]<ref name=":1" />
** Traumatic hip fractures that immobilize the patient<ref name=":1" />
** Joint fixation (primarily in the legs)<ref name=":0" />

===Underlying causes===
After a first PE, the search for secondary causes is usually brief. Only when a second PE occurs, and especially when this happens while still under [[anticoagulant]] therapy, a further search for underlying conditions is undertaken. This will include testing ("thrombophilia screen") for [[Factor V Leiden mutation]], antiphospholipid antibodies, [[protein C]] and [[Protein S|S]] and [[antithrombin]] levels, and later prothrombin mutation, [[Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase|MTHFR]] mutation, [[Factor VIII]] concentration and rarer inherited [[coagulation]] abnormalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulmonary embolus|url=http://pacificschoolserver.org/med/ency/article/000132.htm|website=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|access-date=24 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425030617/http://pacificschoolserver.org/med/ency/article/000132.htm|archive-date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Hamptonshump.PNG|thumb|A [[Hampton hump]] in a person with a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism]]
In order to diagnose a pulmonary embolism, a review of clinical criteria to determine the need for testing is recommended.<ref name="ACRfive"/> In those who have low risk, age less than 50, heart rate less than 100 beats per minute, oxygen level more than 94% on room air, and no leg swelling, coughing up of blood, surgery or trauma in the last four weeks, previous blood clots, or estrogen use, further testing is not typically needed.<ref name=AM2015/>

In situations with more high risk individuals, further testing is needed.  A [[CT pulmonary angiogram]] (CTPA) is the preferred method for diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism due to its easy administration and accuracy.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Ullah|first=Saeed|last2=Jan|first2=Saeed Ullah|last3=Rehman|first3=Habib Ur|last4=Butt|first4=Najma Iqbal|last5=Rauf|first5=Muhammad Abdur|last6=Shah|first6=Sabir|last7=Jan|first7=Muhammad Yahya|date=2019-03-09|title=RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY IN PAKISTAN HEART JOURNAL FROM 2005 TO 2018: A SCIENTOMETRIC STUDY|url=https://www.pkheartjournal.com/index.php/pkheart/article/view/1763|journal=Pakistan Heart Journal|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.47144/phj.v52i2.1763|issn=2227-9199}}</ref> Although a CTPA is preferred, there are also other tests that can be done. For example, a proximal lower limb compression ultrasound (CUS) can be used.<ref name=":2" /> This is a test which is primarily used as a confirmatory test, meaning it confirms a previous analysis showing the presence or suspected presence of a pulmonary embolism.<ref name=":2" /> According to a cross-sectional study, CUS tests have a sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 96%.<ref name=":2" />

If there are concerns this is followed by testing to determine a likelihood of being able to confirm a diagnosis by imaging, followed by imaging if other tests have shown that there is a likelihood of a PE diagnosis.<ref name="ACRfive">{{Cite web |author1 = American College of Radiology |author1-link = American College of Radiology |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[American College of Radiology]] |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |access-date = August 17, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120416220509/http://choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Coll_Radiology.pdf |archive-date = April 16, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="PIOPEDrecommend">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein PD, Woodard PK, Weg JG, Wakefield TW, Tapson VF, Sostman HD, Sos TA, Quinn DA, Leeper KV, Hull RD, Hales CA, Gottschalk A, Goodman LR, Fowler SE, Buckley JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnostic pathways in acute pulmonary embolism: recommendations of the PIOPED II Investigators | journal = Radiology | volume = 242 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17185658 | doi = 10.1148/radiol.2421060971 }}</ref><ref name="ESC2014" />

The diagnosis of PE is based primarily on validated clinical criteria combined with selective testing because the typical clinical presentation ([[shortness of breath]], [[chest pain]]) cannot be definitively differentiated from other causes of chest pain and shortness of breath. The decision to perform medical imaging is based on clinical reasoning, that is, the [[medical history]], symptoms and findings on [[physical examination]], followed by an assessment of clinical probability.<ref name=Goldhaber/>

===Probability testing===
The most commonly used method to predict clinical probability, the Wells score, is a [[clinical prediction rule]], whose use is complicated by multiple versions being available. In 1995, [[Philip Steven Wells]], initially developed a prediction rule (based on a literature search) to predict the likelihood of PE, based on clinical criteria.<ref name=pmid7752753>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells PS, Hirsh J, Anderson DR, Lensing AW, Foster G, Kearon C, Weitz J, D'Ovidio R, Cogo A, Prandoni P | display-authors = 6 | title = Accuracy of clinical assessment of deep-vein thrombosis | journal = Lancet | volume = 345 | issue = 8961 | pages = 1326–30 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7752753 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(95)92535-X }}</ref> The prediction rule was revised in 1998<ref name=pmid9867786>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells PS, Ginsberg JS, Anderson DR, Kearon C, Gent M, Turpie AG, Bormanis J, Weitz J, Chamberlain M, Bowie D, Barnes D, Hirsh J | display-authors = 6 | title = Use of a clinical model for safe management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 129 | issue = 12 | pages = 997–1005 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9867786 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-129-12-199812150-00002 }}</ref> This prediction rule was further revised when simplified during a validation by Wells ''et al.'' in 2000.<ref name=pmid10744147>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells PS, Anderson DR, Rodger M, Ginsberg JS, Kearon C, Gent M, Turpie AG, Bormanis J, Weitz J, Chamberlain M, Bowie D, Barnes D, Hirsh J | display-authors = 6 | title = Derivation of a simple clinical model to categorize patients probability of pulmonary embolism: increasing the models utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer | journal = Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 416–20 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10744147 | doi = 10.1055/s-0037-1613830 }}</ref> In the 2000 publication, Wells proposed two different scoring systems using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule.<ref name=pmid10744147/> In 2001, Wells published results using the more conservative cutoff of 2 to create three categories.<ref name=pmid11453709>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells PS, Anderson DR, Rodger M, Stiell I, Dreyer JF, Barnes D, Forgie M, Kovacs G, Ward J, Kovacs MJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Excluding pulmonary embolism at the bedside without diagnostic imaging: management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism presenting to the emergency department by using a simple clinical model and d-dimer | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 98–107 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11453709 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-135-2-200107170-00010 }}</ref> An additional version, the "modified extended version", using the more recent cutoff of 2 but including findings from Wells's initial studies<ref name=pmid7752753/><ref name=pmid9867786/> were proposed.<ref name=pmid10739372>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanson BJ, Lijmer JG, Mac Gillavry MR, Turkstra F, Prins MH, Büller HR | title = Comparison of a clinical probability estimate and two clinical models in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations for a [[Medical algorithm|diagnostic algorithm]] were published by the [[PIOPED]] investigators; however, these recommendations do not reflect research using 64 slice MDCT.<ref name="PIOPEDrecommend"/> These investigators recommended:
* Low clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and based treatment on results.
* Moderate clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. ''However'', the authors were not concerned that a negative MDCT with negative D-dimer in this setting has a 5% probability of being false. Presumably, the 5% error rate will fall as 64 slice MDCT is more commonly used. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and based treatment on results.
* High clinical probability. Proceed to MDCT. If positive, treat, if negative, more tests are needed to exclude PE. A D-dimer of less than 750&nbsp;ug/L does not rule out PE in those who are at high risk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Es N, van der Hulle T, Büller HR, Klok FA, Huisman MV, Galipienzo J, Di Nisio M | title = Is stand-alone D-dimer testing safe to rule out acute pulmonary embolism? | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 323–328 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27873439 | doi = 10.1111/jth.13574 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

====Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria====
The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) helps assess people in whom pulmonary embolism is suspected, but unlikely. Unlike the Wells score and [[Geneva score]], which are clinical prediction rules intended to risk stratify people with suspected PE, the PERC rule is designed to rule out risk of PE in people when the physician has already stratified them into a low-risk category.

People in this low risk category without any of these criteria may undergo no further testing for PE: low oxygen saturations — [[Oxygenation (medical)#Oxygen saturation|Sa<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>]] <95%, unilateral leg swelling, coughing up blood, prior DVT or PE, recent surgery or trauma, age >50, hormone use, fast heart rate. The rationale behind this decision is that further testing (specifically CT angiogram of the chest) may cause more harm (from radiation exposure and contrast dye) than the risk of PE.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kline JA, Mitchell AM, Kabrhel C, Richman PB, Courtney DM | title = Clinical criteria to prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing in emergency department patients with suspected pulmonary embolism | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = 1247–55 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15304025 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.00790.x }}</ref> The PERC rule has a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 21.9% with a false negative rate of 1.0% (16/1666).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kline JA, Courtney DM, Kabrhel C, Moore CL, Smithline HA, Plewa MC, Richman PB, O'Neil BJ, Nordenholz K | display-authors = 6 | title = Prospective multicenter evaluation of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 772–80 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18318689 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.02944.x }}</ref>

===Blood tests===
In people with a low or moderate suspicion of PE, a normal [[D-dimer]] level (shown in a [[blood test]]) is enough to exclude the possibility of thrombotic PE, with a three-month risk of thromboembolic events being 0.14%.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrier M, Righini M, Djurabi RK, Huisman MV, Perrier A, Wells PS, Rodger M, Wuillemin WA, Le Gal G | display-authors = 6 | title = VIDAS D-dimer in combination with clinical pre-test probability to rule out pulmonary embolism.

When a PE is being suspected, several [[blood test]]s are done in order to exclude important secondary causes of PE. This includes a [[full blood count]], [[coagulation|clotting status]] ([[prothrombin time|PT]], [[aPTT]], [[thrombin time|TT]]), and some screening tests ([[erythrocyte sedimentation rate]], [[kidney function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[electrolyte]]s).

====CT pulmonary angiography====
[[CT pulmonary angiogram|CT pulmonary angiography]] (CTPA) is a [[pulmonary angiogram]] obtained using [[computed tomography]] (CT) with [[radiocontrast]] rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are that it is accurate, it is non-invasive, it is more often available, and it may identifying other lung disorders in case there is no pulmonary embolism.

====Low probability diagnostic tests/non-diagnostic tests====
Tests that are frequently done that are not [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitive]] for PE, but can be diagnostic.
*[[Chest X-ray]]s are often done on people with shortness of breath to help rule-out other causes, such as [[congestive heart failure]] and [[rib fracture]]. Chest X-rays in PE are rarely normal,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Worsley DF, Alavi A, Aronchick JM, Chen JT, Greenspan RH, Ravin CE | title = Chest radiographic findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: observations from the PIOPED Study | journal = Radiology | volume = 189 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–6 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8372182 | doi = 10.1148/radiology.189.1.8372182 }}</ref> but usually lack [[radiologic sign|sign]]s that suggest the diagnosis of PE (for example, [[Westermark sign]], [[Hampton's hump]]).
*[[medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] of the legs, also known as leg doppler, in search of [[deep venous thrombosis]] (DVT). The presence of DVT, as shown on [[ultrasonography]] of the legs, is in itself enough to warrant anticoagulation, without requiring the V/Q or spiral CT scans (because of the strong association between DVT and PE). This may be a valid approach in [[pregnancy]], in which the other modalities would increase the risk of birth defects in the unborn child. However, a negative scan does not rule out PE, and low-radiation dose scanning may be required if the mother is deemed at high risk of having a pulmonary embolism.

===Echocardiography===

In massive and submassive PE, dysfunction of the right side of the heart may be seen on [[echocardiography]], an indication that the [[pulmonary artery]] is severely obstructed and the [[right ventricle]], a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for [[thrombolysis]].

==Prevention==
{{See|Thrombosis prophylaxis}}
Pulmonary embolism may be preventable in those with risk factors. People admitted to hospital may receive preventative medication, including unfractionated [[heparin]], [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), or [[fondaparinux]], and anti-thrombosis stockings to reduce the risk of a DVT in the leg that could dislodge and migrate to the lungs.<ref>{{NICE|92|Venous thromboembolism: reducing the risk: Reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in patients admitted to hospital|January 2010}}</ref>

Following the completion of anticoagulation in those with prior PE, long-term aspirin is useful to prevent recurrence.<ref name=Chest2016/>

==Treatment==
[[Anticoagulant therapy]] is the mainstay of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as [[oxygen therapy|oxygen]] or [[analgesia]], may be required. People are often admitted to hospital in the early stages of treatment, and tend to remain under inpatient care until the [[International normalized ratio|INR]] has reached therapeutic levels (if warfarin is used). Increasingly, however, low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT.<ref name=Chest2016>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kearon C, Akl EA, Ornelas J, Blaivas A, Jimenez D, Bounameaux H, Huisman M, King CS, Morris TA, Sood N, Stevens SM, Vintch JR, Wells P, Woller SC, Moores L | display-authors = 6 | title = Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report | journal = Chest | volume = 149 | issue = 2 | pages = 315–352 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26867832 | doi = 10.1016/j.chest.2015.11.026 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22944455">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vinson DR, Zehtabchi S, Yealy DM | title = Can selected patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism be safely treated without hospitalization?

===Anticoagulation===
Anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. For many years, [[vitamin K antagonist]]s (warfarin or less commonly [[acenocoumarol]] or [[phenprocoumon]]) have been the cornerstone. As vitamin K antagonists do not act immediately, initial treatment is with rapidly acting injectable anticoagulants: unfractionated [[heparin]] (UFH), [[low molecular weight heparin]] (LMWH), or [[fondaparinux]], while oral vitamin K antagonists are initiated and titrated (usually as part of inpatient hospital care) to the [[international normalized ratio]], a test that determines the dose.<ref name=Chest2016/> In terms of injectable treatments, LMWH may reduce bleeding among people with pulmonary embolism as compared to UFH.<ref name=Robertson2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson L, Jones LE | title = Fixed dose subcutaneous low molecular weight heparins versus adjusted dose unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of venous thromboembolism | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD001100 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28182249 | pmc = 6464611 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001100.pub4 }}</ref> According to the same review, LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and reduced thrombus size when compared to heparin. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with unfractionated heparin.<ref name=Robertson2017/> Vitamin K antagonists require frequent dose adjustment and monitoring of the [[international normalized ratio]] (INR). In PE, INRs between 2.0 and 3.0 are generally considered ideal.<ref name=Chest2016/> If another episode of PE occurs under warfarin treatment, the INR window may be increased to e.g. 2.5–3.5 (unless there are contraindications) or anticoagulation may be changed to a different anticoagulant e.g. LMWH.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In recent years, a number of anticoagulants have been introduced that offer similar to warfarin but without a need for titration to the INR. Known as the [[Anticoagulant#Directly acting oral anticoagulants|directly acting oral anticoagulants]], these treatments are now preferred over vitamin K antagonists by American professional guidelines.<ref name=Chest2016/> Two of these ([[rivaroxaban]] and [[apixaban]]) do not require initial heparin or fondaparinux treatment, whereas [[dabigatran]] and [[edoxaban]] do.<ref name=Chest2016/> A Cochrane review found that there is no evidence of a difference between oral DTIs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban) and standard anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson L, Kesteven P, McCaslin JE | title = Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary embolism | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD010957 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26636644 | pmc = 6463831 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010957.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Vascular Group }}</ref>

In people with cancer who develop pulmonary embolism, therapy with a course of LMWH is favored over warfarin or other oral anticoagulants.<ref name=Chest2016/><ref name=NICECG144/> Similarly, pregnant women are treated with low molecular weight heparin until after delivery to avoid the known [[teratogenic]] effects of warfarin, especially in the early stages of pregnancy, but it can be used while breastfeeding.<ref name=RCOG37b/>

Anticoagulation therapy is usually continued for 3–6 months, or "lifelong" if there have been previous DVTs or PEs, or none of the usual transient risk factors is present.<ref name=Chest2016/><ref name=NICECG144/> In those without a known cause that can be reversed 2 years of treatment may be better than 6 months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mai V, Guay CA, Perreault L, Bonnet S, Bertoletti L, Lacasse Y, Jardel S, Lega JC, Provencher S | display-authors = 6 | title = Extended Anticoagulation for VTE: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = Chest | volume = 155 | issue = 6 | pages = 1199–1216 | date = June 2019 | pmid = 31174635 | doi = 10.1016/j.chest.2019.02.402 }}</ref> For those with small PEs (known as subsegmental PEs) the effects of anticoagulation is unknown as it has not been properly studied as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Hugo Hb|last2=Nunes-Nogueira|first2=Vania Santos|last3=Fortes Villas Boas|first3=Paulo J.|date=2 February 2020|title=Anticoagulant treatment for subsegmental pulmonary embolism|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD010222|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010222.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=7004894|pmid=32030721}}</ref>

===Thrombolysis===
Massive PE causing hemodynamic instability (shock and/or low blood pressure, defined as a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for >15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia or sepsis) is an indication for [[thrombolysis]], the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, it is the best available treatment in those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines.<ref name=ESC2014/><ref name=NICECG144>{{NICE|144|Venous thromboembolic diseases: the management of venous thromboembolic diseases and the role of thrombophilia testing|2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirsh J, Guyatt G, Albers GW, Harrington R, Schünemann HJ | title = Executive summary: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition) | journal = Chest | volume = 133 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 71S–109S | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18574259 | doi = 10.1378/chest.08-0693 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/lookup/pmid?view=long&pmid=18574259 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is also recommended in those in [[cardiac arrest]] with a known PE.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lavonas EJ, Drennan IR, Gabrielli A, Heffner AC, Hoyte CO, Orkin AM, Sawyer KN, Donnino MW | display-authors = 6 | title = Part 10: Special Circumstances of Resuscitation: 2015 American Heart Association Guidelines Update for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care | journal = Circulation | volume = 132 | issue = 18 Suppl 2 | pages = S501-18 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26472998 | doi = 10.1161/cir.0000000000000264 }}</ref>

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a new technique found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by  [[Interventional radiology|interventional radiologists]] or [[vascular surgeons]], and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuo WT, Gould MK, Louie JD, Rosenberg JK, Sze DY, Hofmann LV | title = Catheter-directed therapy for the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism: systematic review and meta-analysis of modern techniques | journal = Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology | volume = 20 | issue = 11 | pages = 1431–40 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19875060 | doi = 10.1016/j.jvir.2009.08.002 }}</ref> Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Engelberger RP, Kucher N | title = Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis for acute pulmonary embolism: a systematic review | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 12 | pages = 758–64 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24497337 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu029 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Inferior vena cava filter===
[[File:Inferior vena cava filter.jpg|thumb|right|Used inferior vena cava filter.]]
There are two situations when an [[inferior vena cava filter]] is considered advantageous, and those are if anticoagulant therapy is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] (e.g. shortly after a major operation), or a person has a pulmonary embolus in spite of being anticoagulated.<ref name="NICECG144" /> In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage.<ref name="NICECG144" /> In spite of the device's theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, there is a lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Tim|last2=Sriram|first2=Krishna Bajee|date=8 October 2020|title=Vena caval filters for the prevention of pulmonary embolism|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33027844|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD006212|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006212.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=33027844|via=}}</ref>

Less than 5 to 10% of symptomatic PEs are fatal within the first hour of symptoms.<ref name=ESC2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Konstantinides SV, Torbicki A, Agnelli G, Danchin N, Fitzmaurice D, Galiè N, Gibbs JS, Huisman MV, Humbert M, Kucher N, Lang I, Lankeit M, Lekakis J, Maack C, Mayer E, Meneveau N, Perrier A, Pruszczyk P, Rasmussen LH, Schindler TH, Svitil P, Vonk Noordegraaf A, Zamorano JL, Zompatori M | display-authors = 6 | title = 2014 ESC guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism | journal = European Heart Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 43 | pages = 3033–69, 3069a-3069k | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25173341 | doi = 10.1093/eurheartj/ehu283 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

There are several markers used for risk stratification and these are also independent predictors of adverse outcome. These include hypotension, cardiogenic shock, syncope, evidence of right heart dysfunction, and elevated cardiac enzymes.<ref name=ESC2014/> Some ECG changes including S1Q3T3 also correlate with worse short-term prognosis.<ref name=AHA2011/> There have been other patient-related factors such as [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]] and chronic heart failure thought to also play a role in prognosis.<ref name=ESC2014/>

Prognosis depends on the amount of lung that is affected and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to [[pulmonary hypertension]]. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by [[fibrinolysis]], or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker RH, Goodwin J, Jackson JA | title = Resolution of pulmonary embolism | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 4 | issue = 5728 | pages = 135–9 | date = October 1970 | pmid = 5475816 | pmc = 1819885 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.4.5728.135 }}</ref> Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Le Gal G, Righini M, Parent F, van Strijen M, Couturaud F | title = Diagnosis and management of subsegmental pulmonary embolism | journal = Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 724–31 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16634736 | doi = 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2006.01819.x }}</ref> and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.<ref name="pmid16738268"/><ref name=pmid16738276>{{cite journal | vauthors = Perrier A, Bounameaux H | title = Accuracy or outcome in suspected pulmonary embolism | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 22 | pages = 2383–5 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16738276 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe068076 }}</ref>

Once anticoagulation is stopped, the risk of a fatal pulmonary embolism is 0.5% per year.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = White RH | title = Risk of fatal pulmonary embolism was 0.49 per 100 person-years after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism | journal = Evidence-Based Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 154 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18836122 | doi = 10.1136/ebm.13.5.154 }}</ref>

[[Mortality rate|Mortality]] from untreated PEs was said to be 26%. This figure comes from a trial published in 1960 by Barrit and Jordan,<ref name=Barritt>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barritt DW, Jordan SC | title = Anticoagulant drugs in the treatment of pulmonary embolism. A controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7138 | pages = 1309–12 | date = June 1960 | pmid = 13797091 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(60)92299-6 }}</ref> which compared anticoagulation against placebo for the management of PE. Barritt and Jordan performed their study in the [[Bristol Royal Infirmary]] in 1957. This study is the only placebo controlled trial ever to examine the place of anticoagulants in the treatment of PE, the results of which were so convincing that the trial has never been repeated as to do so would be considered unethical. That said, the reported mortality rate of 26% in the placebo group is probably an overstatement, given that the technology of the day may have detected only severe PEs.

===Predicting mortality===
{{anchor|PESI}}
The PESI and sPESI scoring tools can estimate mortality of patients. The Geneva prediction rules and Wells criteria are used to calculate a pre-test probability of patients to predict who has a pulmonary embolism. These scores are tools to be used with clinical judgment in deciding diagnostic testing and types of therapy.<ref name=pmid17625081>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiménez D, Yusen RD, Otero R, Uresandi F, Nauffal D, Laserna E, Conget F, Oribe M, Cabezudo MA, Díaz G | display-authors = 6 | title = Prognostic models for selecting patients with acute pulmonary embolism for initial outpatient therapy | journal = Chest | volume = 132 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–30 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17625081 | doi = 10.1378/chest.06-2921 }}</ref> The PESI algorithm comprises 11 routinely available clinical variables.<ref name="ZhouBen2012">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou XY, Ben SQ, Chen HL, Ni SS | title = The prognostic value of pulmonary embolism severity index in acute pulmonary embolism: a meta-analysis | journal = Respiratory Research | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 111 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23210843 | pmc = 3571977 | doi = 10.1186/1465-9921-13-111 }}</ref> It puts the subjects into one of five classes (I-V), with 30-day mortality ranging from 1.1% to 24.5%.
