In the 1990s, the [[Euroméditerranée]] project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructures and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010: the tramway, the renovation of the [[Hôtel-Dieu]] into a luxury hotel, Le Silo, the expansion of the [[Stade Vélodrome|Velodrome stadium]], the [[CMA CGM Tower]], and other quayside museums such as the [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations|Museum of Civilizations of Europe and the Mediterranean]] ([[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations|MuCEM]]). As a consequence the city was named [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2013 and [[European Capitals and Cities of Sport Federation|European Capital of Sport]] in 2017. Additionally, Marseille hosted matches at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the [[Aix-Marseille University|University of Aix-Marseille]].

==Geography==
[[File:Marseille-corniche.jpg|thumb|left|View of the "Petit Nice" on Marseille's corniche ([[7th arrondissement of Marseille|7th arrondissement]]) with the [[Frioul archipelago]] and the [[Château d'If]] in the background]]

Marseille is the second-largest metropolitan area in France after Paris. To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as [[Cassis]], are the [[Calanque]]s, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small [[fjord]]-like inlets. Farther east still are the [[Sainte-Baume]] (a {{convert|1147|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} mountain ridge rising from a forest of [[deciduous]] trees), the city of [[Toulon]] and the [[French Riviera]]. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low [[Garlaban]] and Etoile [[mountain range]]s, is the {{convert|1011|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire|Mont Sainte Victoire]]. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of [[l'Estaque]]; farther west are the [[Côte Bleue]], the [[Gulf of Lion]] and the [[Camargue]] region in the [[Rhône]] [[river delta|delta]]. The [[Marseille Provence Airport|airport]] lies to the north west of the city at [[Marignane]] on the [[Étang de Berre]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Michelin Guide to Provence, {{ISBN|2-06-137503-0}}</ref>

The city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the [[Canebière]]) stretches eastward from the [[Old Port of Marseille|Old Port]] to the Réformés quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old Port—Fort [[Saint Nicholas|Saint-Nicolas]] on the south side and [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]] on the north. Farther out in the Bay of Marseille is the [[Frioul archipelago]] which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of [[Château d'If]], made famous by the [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Dumas]] novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebière at Rue St Ferréol and the Centre Bourse (one of the city's main shopping malls). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably Rue St Ferréol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the Hôtel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the [[6th arrondissement of Marseille|6th arrondissement]] are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the [[7th arrondissement of Marseille|7th]] and [[8th arrondissement of Marseille|8th arrondissements]], dominated by the [[basilica]] of [[Notre-Dame de la Garde]]. Marseille's main railway station—[[Marseille-Saint-Charles Station|Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles]]—is north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athènes to the Canebière.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> [[File:Marseille from ISS 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Marseille and [[Calanques National Park]] from the [[ISS]], February 2017]]

==History==
{{main|History of Marseille|Timeline of Marseille}}
[[File:Massalia large coin 5th 1st century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A silver [[drachma]] inscribed with MASSA[LIA] ({{lang|grc|ΜΑΣΣΑ[ΛΙΑ]}}), dated 375–200 BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]] of Marseille, bearing the head of the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]] on the [[obverse]] and a lion on the reverse]]

Marseille was a [[Gauls|Gallic]] port center that became the [[Colonies in antiquity|Greek colony]] of '''Massalia''' circa 600 BC, and was populated by Greek settlers from [[Phocaea]] (modern [[Foça]], [[Turkey]]). It became the preeminent Greek ''[[polis]]'' in the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] region of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Gaul|southern Gaul]].<ref>Patrick Boucheron, et al., eds. ''France in the World: A New Global History'' (2019) pp 30-35.</ref> The city-state sided with the [[Roman Republic]] against [[Carthage]] during the [[Second Punic War]] (218–201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the [[western Mediterranean]] even as Rome expanded into [[Western Europe]] and [[North Africa]]. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman [[Siege of Massilia]] in 49 BC, during [[Caesar's Civil War]], in which Massalia sided with the [[Optimates|exiled faction]] at war with [[Julius Caesar]]. Afterward the [[Gallo-Roman culture]] was initiated.

Marseille continued to prosper as a Gallo-Roman city, becoming an early center of [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] during the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the [[Visigoths]] in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of [[Charles Martel]]. It became part of the [[County of Provence]] during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and a sack of the city by the [[Crown of Aragon]] in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of [[René of Anjou]], Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], which threatened the ports and navies of [[Genoa]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the [[Great Plague of Marseille]] in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid-century. In 1792 the city became a focal point of the [[French Revolution]] and though France's [[national anthem]] was born in Strasbourg, it was first sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille, hence the name the crowd gave it: ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and establishment of the [[Second French colonial Empire|French Empire]] during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German [[Wehrmacht]] in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as [[French Algeria]].

==Economy==
Marseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine ''L'Expansion'' named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Neumann |first=Benjamin |date=1 May 2005 |title=Les villes qui font bouger la France |trans-title=Cities That Are Moving France |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/economie/les-villes-qui-font-bouger-la-france_23845.html |magazine=L'Express |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Roularta Media Group |access-date=28 January 2008}}</ref> Marseille is also France's second largest research centre with 3,000 research scientists within [[Aix Marseille University]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Port===
{{see also|Marseille-Fos Port}}
[[File:1 marseille vieux port pano.jpg|thumb|upright=2|The entrance to the Old Port, flanked by Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Saint-Nicolas]]
Historically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with [[Metropolitan France]]. The Old Port was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and docks, which experienced decline in the 1970s after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], have been recently redeveloped with funds from the [[European Union]]. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the Quai des Belges of the Old Port.

The economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth [[List of busiest ports in Europe|European port by cargo tonnage]], which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in [[Fos-sur-Mer]]. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents 4 billion euros added value to the regional economy.<ref name="fos">{{Cite web |date=5 February 2013 |title=Record Container Year as Marseilles Fos Sets Vision for Future |url=http://www.marseille-port.fr/en/Content/Documents/Presse/2013/10/news_port_marseille_fos_0502_2013.pdf |access-date=8 March 2013 |website=Port of Marseille-Fos}}</ref> 100&nbsp;million tons of [[Cargo|freight]] pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe.

Petroleum is shipped northward to the Paris basin by pipeline. The city also serves as France's leading centre of oil refining.

The urban operation [[Euroméditerranée]] has developed a large offer of offices and thus Marseille hosts one of the main business district in France.

Marseille is the home of three main [[technopole]]s: Château-Gombert (technological innovations), Luminy (biotechnology) and La Belle de Mai (17,000 sq.m. of offices dedicated to multimedia activities).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Technopôles |url=http://www.marseille-provence.fr/index.php/competences/developpement-economique/technopoles |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402170503/http://www.marseille-provence.fr/index.php/competences/developpement-economique/technopoles |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=12 March 2013 |website=Marseille Provence Metropole}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Marseilles Euroméditerranée: Between Europe and the Mediterranean |url=http://www.euromediterranee.fr/fileadmin/multimedia/EUROMEDITERRANEE%20GB.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104901/http://www.euromediterranee.fr/fileadmin/multimedia/EUROMEDITERRANEE%20GB.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015 |access-date=8 March 2003 |website=Euroméditerranée |publisher=Etablissement Public d'Aménagement Euroméditerranée |page=5}}</ref>

[[File:Secteurs de Marseille 2014.svg|thumb|Political majority in each sector since 2014]]
The city of Marseille is divided into 16 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]], which are themselves informally divided into 111 neighbourhoods (French: ''quartiers''). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 sectors, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in [[Arrondissements of Paris|Paris]] and [[Arrondissements of Lyon|Lyon]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mairies d'Arrondissements |url=http://www.marseille.fr/vdm/cms/accueil/mairie/mairie_arrondissements |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105082851/http://www.marseille.fr/vdm/cms/accueil/mairie/mairie_arrondissements |archive-date=5 January 2009 |access-date=16 November 2007 |language=fr}}</ref> Municipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by sector. There are 303 councilmembers in total, two-thirds sitting in the sector councils and one third in the city council.

The [[9th arrondissement of Marseille]] is the largest in terms of area because it comprises parts of [[Calanques National Park]]. With a population of 89,316 (2007), the [[13th arrondissement of Marseille]] is the most populous one.

From 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] (PS) and [[French Communist Party|Communist]] (PCF) stronghold. [[Gaston Defferre]] (PS) was consecutively reelected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by [[Robert Vigouroux]] of the [[European Democratic and Social Rally]] (RDSE). [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]] of the right-wing [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] was elected Mayor of Marseille in 1995. Gaudin was reelected in 2001, 2008 and 2014.

In recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] has received significant support. At the [[2014 French municipal elections|last municipal election]] in 2014, Marseille was divided between the northern arrondissements dominated by the left (PS) and far-right (FN) and the southern part of town dominated by the right-wing (UMP). Marseille is also divided in [[Cantons of Marseille|twelve cantons]], each of them sending two members to the [[Departmental councils (France)|Departmental Council]] of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] [[Departments of France|department]].

===Immigration===
{{Update|section|date=June 2017}}
Because of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan [[melting pot]]. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.<ref>{{harvnb|Liauzu|1996}}</ref>{{sfn|Duchêne|Contrucci|1998|loc=page needed E}}{{page needed|date=November 2015}}

Economic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;<ref name="eu">{{Cite web |title=Local0631EN:Quality0667EN |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/pubdocs/2006/31/en/1/ef0631en.pdf |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guillemin, Alain |title=Les Vietnamiens a Marseille |url=http://newvietart.net/index4.3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323092304/http://newvietart.net/index4.3.html |archive-date=23 March 2014 |language=fr}}</ref> [[Corsica]]ns during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; [[Maghrebis]] (both [[Arab people|Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]]) in the [[interwar period|inter-war period]]; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; [[Maghrebi Jews]] in the 1950s and 1960s; the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]] from the former [[French Algeria]] in 1962; and then from [[Comoros]]. In 2006, it was reported that 70,000 city residents were considered to be of Maghrebi origin, mostly from Algeria. The second largest group in Marseille in terms of single nationalities were from the Comoros, amounting to some 45,000 people.<ref name="eu" />

Currently, over one third of the population of Marseille can trace their roots back to Italy.<ref>[http://histgeo.ac-aix-marseille.fr/pedago/ecjs/paro_001.htm Citoyenneté et intégration : Marseille, modèle d'intégration ?], report by Patrick Parodi, Académie d'Aix-Marseille.</ref> Marseille also has the second-largest [[Corsica]]n and [[Armenians|Armenian]] populations of France. Other significant communities include [[Maghrebis]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Comorians in France|Comorians]], Chinese, and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 December 2005 |title=Diverse Marseille Spared in French Riots |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5044219 |access-date=1 February 2010 |publisher=Npr.org}}</ref>

In 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Michèle Tribalat |date=2007 |title=Les concentrations ethniques en France |url=http://www.societe-de-strategie.asso.fr/pdf/agir28txt4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916215150/http://www.societe-de-strategie.asso.fr/pdf/agir28txt4.pdf |archive-date=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Since 2013 a significant number of Central- and Eastern European immigrants have settled in Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities of the immigrants are Romanians and Poles.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Insee – Population – Les immigrés récemment arrivés en France – Une immigration de plus en plus européenne |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?reg_id=0&ref_id=ip1524 |website=insee.fr}}</ref>

Marseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chris Kimble |title=Marseille Culture |url=http://marseillecityofculture.eu/marseille-culture.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501040521/http://marseillecityofculture.eu/marseille-culture.html |archive-date=1 May 2013 |access-date=5 May 2013 |publisher=Marseillecityofculture.eu}}</ref> Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important [[opera house]], historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants.

Marseille has a large number of theatres, including La Criée, Le Gymnase and the Théâtre Toursky. There is also an extensive [[arts centre]] in [[La Friche]], a former match factory behind the Saint-Charles station. The Alcazar, until the 1960s a well known [[music hall]] and [[Variety show|variety theatre]], has recently been completely remodelled behind its original façade and now houses the central municipal library.<ref>[https://www.bmvr.marseille.fr/patrimoine/a-l-origine History of library]</ref> Other music venues in Marseille include Le Silo (also a theatre) and [[GRIM]].

Marseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including {{Interlanguage link multi|Victor Gélu|fr}}, [[Valère Bernard]], [[Pierre Bertas]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pierre Bertas |url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n87144504/}}</ref> [[Edmond Rostand]] and [[André Roussin]]. The small port of [[l'Estaque]] on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Auguste Renoir]], [[Paul Cézanne]] (who frequently visited from his home in [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]]), [[Georges Braque]] and [[Raoul Dufy]].

=== Multi-cultural influences ===
Rich and poor neighborhoods exist side-by-side. Although the city is not without crime, Marseille has a larger degree of multicultural tolerance. Urban geographers<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Ingram |first=Mark |date=2009 |title=Euro-Mediterranean Marseille: Redefining State Cultural Policy in an Era of Transnational Governance |magazine=City & Society |volume=21 |pages=268–292}}</ref> say the city's geography, being surrounded by mountains, helps explain why Marseille does not have the same problems as Paris. In Paris, ethnic areas are segregated and concentrated in the periphery of the city.  Residents of Marseille are of diverse origins, yet appear to share a similar particular identity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moreau |first=Alain |title=Migrations, identités, et territoires à Marseille.Migrations, identités, et territoires à Marseille |publisher=Hamattan |year=2001 |location=Paris |pages=27–52}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite magazine |last=Dickey |first=Christopher |date=March 2012 |title=Marseille's Melting Pot |magazine=National Geographic Magazine |volume=2012 |number=3}}</ref> An example is how Marseille responded in 2005, when ethnic populations living in other French cities' suburbs rioted, but Marseille remained relatively calm.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Williams |first=D |date=27 October 2005 |title=Long Integrated, Marseille Is Spared.

Marseille served as the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2013 along with [[Košice]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marseille Provence 2013: European Capital of Culture |url=http://www.marseille-provence2013.fr/index.php?lang=english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826004257/http://www.marseille-provence2013.fr/index.php?lang=english |archive-date=26 August 2010}} {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/898811423]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/897642695]] cite #43 – please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

[[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}</ref> The European Capital of Culture was also the occasion to unveil more than 600 million euros in new cultural infrastructure in Marseille and its environs, including the [[MuCEM]] designed by [[Rudy Ricciotti]].

Early on, immigrants came to Marseille locally from the surrounding Provence region. By the 1890s immigrants came from other regions of France as well as Italy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=Peter |title=European Cities and Towns |publisher=Oxford |year=2009 |location=Oxford, England |pages=283, 247}}</ref> Marseille became one of Europe’s busiest port by 1900.<ref name=":0" /> Marseille has served as a major port where immigrants from around the Mediterranean arrive.<ref name=":1" /> Marseille continued to be multicultural. Armenians from the Ottoman empire began arriving in 1913. In the 1930s, Italians settled in Marseille. After World War II, a wave of Jewish immigrants from North Africa arrived. In 1962, a number of French colonies gained their independence, and the French citizens from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia arrived in Marseille.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |date=4 October 2013 |title=Marseille, the Secret Capital of France |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The city had an economic downturn and lost many jobs. Those who could afford to move left and the poorest remained. For a while, the mafia appeared to run the city, and for a period of time the communist party was prominent.<ref name=":2" />

Multi-cultural Marseille can be observed by a visitor at the market at Noailles, also called Marché des Capucins, in old town near the Old Port.  There, Lebanese bakeries, an African spice market, Chinese and Vietnamese groceries, fresh vegetables and fruit, shops selling couscous, shops selling Caribbean food are side by side with stalls selling shoes and clothing from around the Mediterranean. Nearby, people sell fresh fish and men from Tunisia drink tea.<ref name=":2" />

===Tarot de Marseille===
[[File:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 13.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tarot of Marseilles|Marseille tarot card]]]]
The most commonly used [[tarot]] deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the ''[[Tarot of Marseille|Tarot de Marseille]]'' since the 1930s—a name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of B–P Grimaud. Previously this deck was called ''Tarot italien'' (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being ''de Marseille'', it was used to play the local variant of [[tarot|tarocchi]] before it became used in [[cartomancy]] at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]]. The name ''Tarot de Marseille'' (Marteau used the name ''ancien Tarot de Marseille'') was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as ''Tarot de [[Besançon]]''; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).<ref>see:

Another local tradition is the making of [[santon (figurine)|santons]], small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Provençal Christmas [[Nativity scene|creche]]. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port.

===Opera===
[[File:Laika ac Marseille (9491261832).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Opéra de Marseille]]]]
Marseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the [[Opéra de Marseille|Opéra]]. Located near the Old Port and the Canebière, at the very heart of the city, its [[architectural style]] was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in [[Lyon]] and [[Bordeaux]]. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone [[colonnade]] and [[peristyle]] from the original façade.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Opera in Genoa, Nice, Marseille, Montpellier, Barcelona |url=http://www.capsuropera.com/seasonschedules.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223222843/http://www.capsuropera.com/seasonschedules.php |archive-date=23 December 2008 |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Capsuropera.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Schmap Marseille Sights & Attractions – 6th arrond |url=http://www.schmap.com/marseille/sights_6tharrond/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430013244/http://www.schmap.com/marseille/sights_6tharrond/ |archive-date=30 April 2008 |access-date=5 May 2009 |publisher=Schmap.com}}</ref> The classical façade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly [[Art Deco]] style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opéra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Actualités |url=http://opera.marseille.fr/ |website=Opéra de Marseille |language=fr}}</ref>

Since 1972, the [[Ballet national de Marseille]] has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was [[Roland Petit]].

===Popular events and festivals===

There are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fête du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of France's [[Fête de la Musique]], featuring music from all over the world. Being free events, many Marseille residents attend.

Marseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted [[Europride]], an international [[LGBT]] event, 10 July{{ndash}}20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Marseille 2013 |url=http://www.europride.com/en/archives/marseille-2013/ |access-date=20 April 2015 |website=EuroPride}}</ref> At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.<ref>{{Cite web |title=March 2013 Newsletter |url=http://www.fidmarseille.org/dynamic/index.php?lang=english |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007235027/http://www.fidmarseille.org/dynamic/index.php?lang=english |archive-date=7 October 2012 |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=FIDMarseille}}</ref>
At the end of September, the electronic music festival [[Marsatac]] takes place.
In October, the ''Fiesta des Suds'' offers many concerts of world music.<ref>{{Cite web |title=octobre, 2012 – Dock des Suds : festivals, concerts de musique et location de salles à Marseille |url=http://www.dock-des-suds.org/fiesta-des-suds/ |access-date=12 March 2013 |publisher=Dock des Suds |language=fr}}</ref>

===Hip hop music===
Marseille is also well known in France for its [[French hip hop|hip hop music]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/arts/music/19rap.html?pagewanted=all "In Marseille, Rap Helps Keep the Peace"], Article in [[New York Times]], December 2007

Other known groups include [[Fonky Family]], [[Psy 4 de la Rime]] (including rappers [[Soprano (rapper)|Soprano]] and [[Alonzo (rapper)|Alonzo]]), and [[Keny Arkana]].
In a slightly different way, [[ragga music]] is represented by [[Massilia Sound System]].

It is also the driest major city with only {{convert|512|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, especially thanks to the [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]], a cold, dry wind originating in the [[Rhône]] Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the [[Sirocco]], a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The hottest temperature was {{convert|40.6|°C|1}} on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was {{convert|-16.8|°C|1}} on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave.<ref name=marseilleobsnormals/>
