Most of Steinbeck's work is set in [[central California]], particularly in the [[Salinas Valley]] and the [[California Coast Ranges]] region. His works frequently explored the themes of fate and injustice, especially as applied to downtrodden or [[everyman]] [[protagonists]].

His father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), served as [[Monterey County]] treasurer.

[[File:SteinbeckHouse.jpg|thumb|The [[John Steinbeck House (Salinas, California)|Steinbeck House]] at 132 Central Avenue, [[Salinas, California]], the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home where Steinbeck spent his childhood.]]
Steinbeck graduated from Salinas High School in 1919 and went on to study English literature at [[Stanford University]] near [[Palo Alto]], leaving without a degree in 1925. He traveled to New York City where he took odd jobs while trying to write. When he failed to publish his work, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and caretaker<ref name="Benson"/> at [[Lake Tahoe]], where he met Carol Henning, his first wife.<ref name="NSC"/><ref name="Benson" /><ref>Introduction to 'The Grapes of Wrath' Penguin edition (1192) by Robert DeMott</ref> They married in January 1930 in Los Angeles, where, with friends, he attempted to make money by manufacturing plaster [[mannequins]].<ref name="Benson"/>

When their money ran out six months later due to a slow market, Steinbeck and Carol moved back to [[Pacific Grove, California]], to a cottage owned by his father, on the [[Monterey Peninsula]] a few blocks outside the [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] city limits. The elder Steinbecks gave John free housing,  paper for his manuscripts, and from 1928,  loans that allowed him to write without looking for work. During the [[Great Depression]], Steinbeck bought a small boat, and later claimed that he was able to live on the fish and crab that he gathered from the sea, and fresh vegetables from his garden and local farms. When those sources failed, Steinbeck and his wife accepted welfare, and on rare occasions, stole bacon from the local produce market.<ref name="Benson"/> Whatever food they had, they shared with their friends.<ref name="Benson"/> Carol became the model for Mary Talbot in Steinbeck's novel [[Cannery Row (novel)|''Cannery Row'']].<ref name="Benson"/>

In 1930, Steinbeck met the marine biologist [[Ed Ricketts]], who became a close friend and mentor to Steinbeck during the following decade, teaching him a great deal about philosophy and biology.<ref name="Benson"/> Ricketts, usually very quiet, yet likable, with an inner self-sufficiency and an encyclopedic knowledge of diverse subjects, became a focus of Steinbeck's attention. Ricketts had taken a college class from [[Warder Clyde Allee]], a biologist and ecological theorist, who would go on to write a classic early textbook on [[ecology]]. Ricketts became a proponent of ecological thinking, in which man was only one part of a [[Great chain of being|great chain of being]], caught in a web of life too large for him to control or understand.<ref name="Benson"/> Meanwhile, Ricketts operated a biological lab on the coast of Monterey, selling biological samples of small animals, fish, rays, starfish, turtles, and other marine forms to schools and colleges.

Between 1930 and 1936, Steinbeck and Ricketts became close friends. Steinbeck's wife began working at the lab as secretary-bookkeeper.<ref name="Benson"/> Steinbeck helped on an informal basis.<ref>Jackson J.

==Career==

===Writing===
Steinbeck's first novel, ''[[Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, With Occasional Reference to History|Cup of Gold]]'', published in 1929, is loosely based on the life and death of [[privateer]] [[Henry Morgan]]. It centers on Morgan's assault and sacking of the city of [[Panama]], sometimes referred to as the "Cup of Gold", and on the women, brighter than the sun, who were said to be found there.<ref name="Bio"/>

Between 1930 and 1933, Steinbeck produced three shorter works. ''[[The Pastures of Heaven]]'', published in 1932, consists of twelve interconnected stories about a valley near Monterey, which was discovered by a Spanish [[corporal]] while chasing runaway [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] slaves. In 1933 Steinbeck published ''[[The Red Pony]]'', a 100-page, four-chapter story weaving in memories of Steinbeck's childhood.<ref name="Bio"/> ''[[To a God Unknown]]'', named after a [[Vedic]] hymn,<ref name="Benson"/> follows the life of a [[Homestead Act|homesteader]] and his family in California, depicting a character with a primal and pagan worship of the land he works. Although he had not achieved the status of a well-known writer, he never doubted that he would achieve greatness.<ref name="Benson"/>

Steinbeck achieved his first critical success with ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' (1935), a novel set in post-war Monterey, California, that won the California [[Commonwealth Club of California|Commonwealth Club]]'s Gold Medal.<ref name="Bio"/> It portrays the adventures of a group of classless and usually homeless young men in Monterey after [[World War I]], just before U.S. [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. They are portrayed in ironic comparison to mythic knights on a quest and reject nearly all the standard mores of American society in enjoyment of a dissolute life devoted to wine, lust, camaraderie and petty theft. In presenting the 1962 Nobel Prize to Steinbeck, the Swedish Academy cited "spicy and comic tales about a gang of ''paisanos'', asocial individuals who, in their wild revels, are almost caricatures of [[Round Table|King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table]]. It has been said that in the United States this book came as a welcome antidote to the gloom of the then prevailing depression."<ref name=nobel/>
''Tortilla Flat'' was adapted as a [[Tortilla Flat (film)|1942 film of the same name]], starring [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[John Garfield]], a friend of Steinbeck.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Railsback |first1=Brian E. |last2=Meyer |first2=Michael J. |title=A John Steinbeck Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-29669-7 |page=387 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NikZBtGvy_gC&pg=PA387 |language=en}}</ref> With some of the proceeds, he built a summer ranch-home in [[Los Gatos]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Steinbeck began to write a series of "California novels" and [[Dust Bowl]] fiction, set among common people during the [[Great Depression]]. These included ''[[In Dubious Battle]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. He also wrote an article series called ''[[The Harvest Gypsies]]'' for the ''San Francisco News'' about the plight of the migrant worker.

''Of Mice and Men'' was a [[drama]] about the dreams of two migrant agricultural laborers in California. It was critically acclaimed<ref name="Bio"/> and Steinbeck's 1962 Nobel Prize citation called it a "little masterpiece".<ref name=nobel/>
Its stage production was a hit, starring [[Wallace Ford]] as George and [[Broderick Crawford]] as George's companion, the mentally childlike, but physically powerful itinerant farmhand Lennie. Steinbeck refused to travel from his home in California to attend any performance of the play during its New York run, telling director [[George S. Kaufman]] that the play as it existed in his own mind was "perfect" and that anything presented on stage would only be a disappointment. Steinbeck wrote two more stage plays (''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' and ''[[Burning Bright]]'').

''Of Mice and Men'' was also adapted as a [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|1939 Hollywood film]], with [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] as Lennie (he had filled the role in the Los Angeles stage production) and [[Burgess Meredith]] as George.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |title=Of Mice and Men (1939) |website=The Internet Movie Database |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030200117/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031742/ |archive-date=October 30, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Meredith and Steinbeck became close friends for the next two decades.<ref name="Benson"/> Another film based on the novella was made in 1992 starring [[Gary Sinise]] as George and [[John Malkovich]] as Lennie.

Steinbeck followed this wave of success with ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), based on newspaper articles about migrant agricultural workers that he had written in San Francisco. It is commonly considered his greatest work. According to ''The New York Times'', it was the best-selling book of 1939 and 430,000 copies had been printed by February 1940. In that month, it won the [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]], favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the [[American Booksellers Association]].<ref name=nyt1940>"1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked as Work Which Failed to Get Due Recognition", ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1940, p. 25.

''Grapes'' was controversial. Steinbeck's [[New Deal]] political views, negative portrayal of aspects of capitalism, and sympathy for the plight of workers, led to a backlash against the author, especially close to home.<ref>Keith Windschuttle (June 2, 2002). {{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm |title=Steinbeck's myth of the Okies |accessdate=August 10, 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040204193303/http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/20/jun02/steinbeck.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2004 }}.

Of the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, "The vilification of me out here from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the [[Okie]]s hate me and have threatened to kill me for lying about them. I'm frightened at the rolling might<!-- OK here: don't correct it --> of this damned thing.

The film versions of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and ''Of Mice and Men'' (by two different movie studios) were in production simultaneously, allowing Steinbeck to spend a full day on the set of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' and the next day on the set of ''Of Mice and Men.''{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Ed Ricketts===
In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Ed Ricketts]] strongly influenced Steinbeck's writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast to give himself time off from his writing<ref name="Journey" /> and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their coauthored book, ''Sea of Cortez'' (December 1941), about a collecting expedition to the [[Gulf of California]] in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well.<ref name="Journey">{{Cite journal|title=A Journey into Steinbeck's California|author=Susan Shillinglaw|publisher=Roaring Forties Press|year=2006}}</ref> However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as ''[[The Log from the Sea of Cortez]]'', under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.<ref>[http://www.seaofcortez.org/ A website devoted to Sea of Cortez literature, with information on Steinbeck's expedition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720104329/http://www.seaofcortez.org/ |date=July 20, 2009 }} Retrieved July 6, 2009.</ref>

Although Carol accompanied Steinbeck on the trip, their marriage was beginning to suffer, and ended a year later, in 1941, even as Steinbeck worked on the manuscript for the book.<ref name="Benson"/> In 1942, after his divorce from Carol he married Gwyndolyn "Gwyn" Conger.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fensch|first=Thomas|title=Steinbeck and Covici |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXE_v1etBjMC&pg=PA33|series=New Century exceptional lives|year=2002|publisher=New Century Books|isbn= 978-0-930751-35-7|page=33}}</ref> With his second wife Steinbeck had two sons, [[Thomas Steinbeck|Thomas ("Thom") Myles Steinbeck]] (1944–2016) and [[John Steinbeck IV]] (1946–1991).

Ricketts was Steinbeck's model for the character of "Doc" in ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' (1945) and ''[[Sweet Thursday]]'' (1954), "Friend Ed" in ''[[Burning Bright]]'', and characters in ''[[In Dubious Battle]]'' (1936) and ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939). Ecological themes recur in Steinbeck's novels of the period.<ref name=bruce>Bruce Robison, "Mavericks on Cannery Row," ''[[American Scientist]]'', vol. 92, no. 6 (November–December 2004), p. 1: a review of Eric Enno Tamm, [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/mavericks-on-cannery-row ''Beyond the Outer Shores: The Untold Odyssey of Ed Ricketts, the Pioneering Ecologist who Inspired John Steinbeck and Joseph Campbell''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604181032/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/mavericks-on-cannery-row |date=June 4, 2009 }}, Four Walls Eight Windows, 2004.</ref>

Steinbeck's close relations with Ricketts ended in 1941 when Steinbeck moved away from Pacific Grove and divorced his wife Carol.<ref name="Journey"/> Ricketts' biographer Eric Enno Tamm notes that, except for ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'' (1952), Steinbeck's writing declined after Ricketts' untimely death in 1948.<ref name=bruce/>

===1940s–1960s work===
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}
Steinbeck's novel ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'' (1942), about the [[Socrates]]-inspired spirit of resistance in an occupied village in [[Northern Europe]], was made into a film almost immediately. It was presumed that the unnamed country of the novel was Norway and [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|the occupiers]] the Nazis. In 1945, Steinbeck received the [[King Haakon VII Freedom Cross]] for his literary contributions to the [[Norwegian resistance movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sumnerandstillman.com/pages/books/13190/john-steinbeck/the-moon-is-down|title=THE MOON IS DOWN by John Steinbeck on Sumner & Stillman|website=Sumner & Stillman}}</ref>

In 1943, Steinbeck served as a World War II [[war correspondent]] for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and worked with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (predecessor of the CIA).<ref>Introduction to ''The Moon Is Down'' (Penguin) published 1995, by Donald V. Coers</ref> It was at that time he became friends with [[Will Lang, Jr.]] of ''Time''/''Life'' magazine. During the war, Steinbeck accompanied the commando raids of [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]]'s [[Beach Jumpers]] program, which launched small-unit diversion operations against German-held islands in the [[Mediterranean]]. At one point, he accompanied Fairbanks on an invasion of an island off the coast of Italy and used a Tommy Gun to help capture Italian and German prisoners. Some of his writings from this period were incorporated in the documentary ''[[Once There Was a War]]'' (1958).

Steinbeck returned from the war with a number of wounds from [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] and some psychological trauma. He treated himself, as ever, by writing. He wrote [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s movie, ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944), and the film, ''[[A Medal for Benny]]'' (1945), with screenwriter [[Jack Wagner (screenwriter)|Jack Wagner]] about [[Compadre|paisanos]] from ''[[Tortilla Flat]]'' going to war. He later requested that his name be removed from the credits of ''Lifeboat,'' because he believed the final version of the film had racist undertones. In 1944, suffering from homesickness for his Pacific Grove/Monterey life of the 1930s, he wrote ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'' (1945), which became so famous that in 1958 Ocean View Avenue in [[Monterey]], the setting of the book, was renamed Cannery Row.

After the war, he wrote ''[[The Pearl (novel)|The Pearl]]'' (1947), knowing it would be filmed eventually. The story first appeared in the December 1945 issue of [[Woman's Home Companion]] magazine as "The Pearl of the World." It was illustrated by [[John Alan Maxwell]]. The novel is an imaginative telling of a story which Steinbeck had heard in La Paz in 1940, as related in ''The Log From the Sea of Cortez'', which he described in Chapter 11 as being "so much like a parable that it almost can't be".<!--the citation is The Log From the Sea of Cortez, see chapter 11--> Steinbeck traveled to [[Cuernavaca]],<ref>Title: Cuernavaca, Mexico, 1945 - Mrs. Stanford Steinbeck, Gwyndolyn, Thom and John Steinbeck

In 1947, Steinbeck made the first of many{{how many|date=October 2018}} trips to the [[Soviet Union]], this one with photographer [[Robert Capa]]. They visited [[Moscow]], [[Kyiv]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Batumi]] and [[Stalingrad]], some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the [[communist revolution]]. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, ''[[A Russian Journal]]'', was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].

In 1952 Steinbeck's longest novel, ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', was published. According to his third wife, Elaine, he considered it his ''magnum opus'', his greatest novel.

In 1952, John Steinbeck appeared as the on-screen narrator of [[20th Century Fox]]'s film, ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]''. Although Steinbeck later admitted he was uncomfortable before the camera, he provided interesting introductions to several filmed adaptations of short stories by the legendary writer [[O. Henry]]. About the same time, Steinbeck recorded readings of several of his short stories for [[Columbia Records]];  the recordings provide a record of Steinbeck's deep, resonant voice.

Following the success of ''Viva Zapata!'', Steinbeck collaborated with Kazan on ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'', [[James Dean]]'s film debut.

''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' is a travelogue of his 1960 [[road trip]] with his [[poodle]] Charley. Steinbeck bemoans his lost youth and roots, while dispensing both criticism and praise for America. According to Steinbeck's son Thom, Steinbeck made the journey because he knew he was dying and wanted to see the country one last time.<ref>[http://www.commonties.com/blog/2006/09/13/steinbeck-knew-he-was-dying/ Steinbeck knew he was dying] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20070927223449/http://www.commonties.com/blog/2006/09/13/steinbeck-knew-he-was-dying/ |date=September 27, 2007 }}," September 13, 2006.

Steinbeck's last novel, ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' (1961), examines [[moral decline]] in America. The protagonist Ethan grows discontented with his own moral decline and that of those around him.<ref name="Student" /> The book has a very different tone from Steinbeck's amoral and ecological stance in earlier works like ''Tortilla Flat'' and ''Cannery Row''. It was not a critical success. Many reviewers recognized the importance of the novel, but were disappointed that it was not another ''Grapes of Wrath''.<ref name="Student">Cynthia Burkhead, ''The students companion to John Steinbeck'', Greenwood Press, 2002, p. 24 {{ISBN|0-313-31457-8}}</ref>
In the Nobel Prize presentation speech next year, however, the Swedish Academy cited it most favorably: "Here he attained the same standard which he set in The Grapes of Wrath. Again he holds his position as an independent expounder of the truth with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American, be it good or bad."<ref name=nobel/>

Apparently taken aback by the critical reception of this novel, and the critical outcry when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,<ref name=floodjan2013/> Steinbeck published no more fiction in the remaining six years before his death.

===Nobel Prize===
[[File:John Steinbeck 1962.jpg|thumb|alt=|Steinbeck in Sweden during his trip to accept the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962]]
In 1962, Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature for his "realistic and imaginative writing, combining as it does sympathetic humor and keen social perception." The selection was heavily criticized, and described as "one of the Academy's biggest mistakes" in one Swedish newspaper.<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713132223/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |archive-date=July 13, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The reaction of American literary critics was also harsh. The ''New York Times'' asked why the Nobel committee gave the award to an author whose "limited talent is, in his best books, watered down by tenth-rate philosophising", noting that "[T]he international character of the award and the weight attached to it raise questions about the mechanics of selection and how close the Nobel committee is to the main currents of American writing. ... [W]e think it interesting that the laurel was not awarded to a writer ... whose significance, influence and sheer body of work had already made a more profound impression on the literature of our age".<ref name=floodjan2013/> Steinbeck, when asked on the day of the announcement if he deserved the Nobel, replied: "Frankly, no."<ref name="Benson" /><ref name=floodjan2013/> Biographer Jackson Benson notes, "[T]his honor was one of the few in the world that one could not buy nor gain by political maneuver. It was precisely because the committee made its judgment ... on its own criteria, rather than plugging into 'the main currents of American writing' as defined by the critical establishment, that the award had value."<ref name="Benson" /><ref name=floodjan2013/> In his acceptance speech later in the year in Stockholm, he said:

{{quote|the writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man's proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit—for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, these are the bright rally flags of hope and of emulation.

Fifty years later, in 2012, the Nobel Prize opened its archives and it was revealed that Steinbeck was a "compromise choice" among a shortlist consisting of Steinbeck, British authors [[Robert Graves]] and [[Lawrence Durrell]], French dramatist [[Jean Anouilh]] and Danish author [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013/> The declassified documents showed that he was chosen as the best of a bad lot.<ref name=floodjan2013/> "There aren't any obvious candidates for the Nobel prize and the prize committee is in an unenviable situation," wrote committee member [[Henry Olsson]].<ref name=floodjan2013/> Although the committee believed Steinbeck's best work was behind him by 1962, committee member [[Anders Österling]] believed the release of his novel ''[[The Winter of Our Discontent]]'' showed that "after some signs of slowing down in recent years, [Steinbeck has] regained his position as a social truth-teller [and is an] authentic realist fully equal to his predecessors Sinclair Lewis and Ernest Hemingway."<ref name=floodjan2013/>

Although modest about his own talent as a writer, Steinbeck talked openly of his own admiration of certain writers. In 1953, he wrote that he considered cartoonist [[Al Capp]], creator of the satirical ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', "possibly the best writer in the world today."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationarchive.org/2008/05/biography-al-capp-2-cappital-offense_08.html |title=ASIFA-Hollywood Animation Archive: Biography: Al Capp 2- A CAPPital Offense |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324000815/http://www.animationarchive.org/2008/05/biography-al-capp-2-cappital-offense_08.html |archive-date=March 24, 2009 }}. animationarchive.org (May 2008).</ref> At his own first Nobel Prize press conference he was asked his favorite authors and works and replied: "[[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s short stories and nearly everything [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] wrote."<ref name="Benson"/>

In 1967, at the behest of ''[[Newsday]]'' magazine, Steinbeck went to [[Vietnam]] to report on the war. He thought of the [[Vietnam War]] as a heroic venture and was considered a [[War Hawk|hawk]] for his position on the war. His sons served in Vietnam before his death, and Steinbeck visited one son in the battlefield.  At one point he was allowed to man a machine-gun watch position at night at a [[fire support base|firebase]] while his son and other members of his platoon slept.<ref>Steinbeck, ''A Life in Letters''.</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:John Steinbeck with Elaine Scott 1950.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|John and Elaine Steinbeck in 1950]]
In May 1948, Steinbeck returned to California on an emergency trip to be with his friend Ed Ricketts, who had been seriously injured when a train struck his car. Ricketts died hours before Steinbeck arrived. Upon returning home, Steinbeck was confronted by Gwyn, who asked for a divorce, which became final in August. Steinbeck spent the year after Ricketts' death in deep depression.

In June 1949, Steinbeck met stage-manager [[Elaine Anderson Steinbeck|Elaine Scott]] at a restaurant in [[Carmel, California]]. Steinbeck and Scott eventually began a relationship and in December 1950 Steinbeck and Scott married, within a week of the finalizing of Scott's own divorce from actor [[Zachary Scott]]. This third marriage for Steinbeck lasted until his death in 1968.<ref name="Bio"/>

In 1962, Steinbeck began acting as friend and mentor to the young writer and naturalist [[Jack Rudloe]], who was trying to establish his own biological supply company, now [[Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory]] in Florida. Their correspondence continued until Steinbeck's death.<ref>T. Manning, Matos S., Addler B.

==Death and legacy==

John Steinbeck died in New York City on December 20, 1968, during the [[Hong Kong flu|1968 flu pandemic]] of [[heart disease]] and [[congestive heart failure]]. He was 66, and had been a lifelong smoker. An autopsy showed nearly complete [[Stenosis|occlusion]] of the [[Aorta|main coronary arteries]].<ref name="Bio" />

In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and interred on March 4, 1969<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011213225021/http://www.steinbeck.org/About.html Burial in timeline at this site, taken from '&#39;'Steinbeck: A Life in Letters'&#39;'].

He had written to his doctor that he felt deeply "in his flesh" that he would not survive his physical death, and that the biological end of his life was the final end to it.<ref name="Journey"/>

The day after Steinbeck's death in New York City, reviewer Charles Poore wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "John Steinbeck's first great book was his last great book. But Good Lord, what a book that was and is: ''The Grapes of Wrath''." Poore noted a "preachiness" in Steinbeck's work, "as if half his literary inheritance came from the best of [[Mark Twain]]—and the other half from the worst of [[Cotton Mather]]." But he asserted that "Steinbeck didn't need the Nobel Prize—the Nobel judges needed him."

Steinbeck's incomplete novel based on the [[King Arthur]] legends of Malory and others, ''[[The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights]]'', was  published in 1976.

Many of Steinbeck's works are required reading in American high schools. In the United Kingdom, ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of the key texts used by the examining body [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] for its [[English Literature]] [[GCSE]]. A study by the Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature in the United States found that ''Of Mice and Men'' was one of the ten most frequently read books in public high schools.<ref>[http://www.ericdigests.org/pre-9214/book.htm Books taught in Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164439/http://ericdigests.org/pre-9214/book.htm |date=October 12, 2007 }}, Center for the Learning and Teaching of Literature.

===Literary influences===
Steinbeck grew up in California's Salinas Valley, a culturally diverse place with a rich migratory and immigrant history. This upbringing imparted a regionalistic flavor to his writing, giving many of his works a distinct [[sense of place]].<ref name="Biography" /><ref name="Bio" />
Salinas, Monterey and parts of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] were the setting for many of his stories. The area is now sometimes referred to as "Steinbeck Country".<ref name="Journey" /> Most of his early work dealt with subjects familiar to him from his formative years. An exception was his first novel, ''[[Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, With Occasional Reference to History|Cup of Gold]]'', which concerns the pirate [[Henry Morgan]], whose adventures had captured Steinbeck's imagination as a child.

In his subsequent novels, Steinbeck found a more authentic voice by drawing upon direct memories of his life in California. His childhood friend, [[Max Wagner]], a brother of Jack Wagner and who later became a film actor, served as inspiration for ''The Red Pony''. Later he used actual American conditions and events in the first half of the 20th century, which he had experienced first-hand as a reporter. Steinbeck often populated his stories with struggling characters; his works examined the lives of the working class and [[migrant worker]]s during the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]].

His later work reflected his wide range of interests, including [[marine biology]], politics, religion, history and [[mythology]]. One of his last published works was ''[[Travels with Charley]]'', a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] of a [[road trip]] he took in 1960 to rediscover America.

The [[National Steinbeck Center]], two blocks away at 1 [[Main Street]] is the only museum in the U.S. dedicated to a single author. Dana Gioia (chair of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]) told an audience at the center, "This is really the best modern literary shrine in the country, and I've seen them all." Its "Steinbeckiana" includes "Rocinante", the camper-truck in which Steinbeck made the cross-country trip described in ''Travels with Charley''.

His father's cottage on Eleventh Street in Pacific Grove, where Steinbeck wrote some of his earliest books, also survives.<ref name="Journey" />

In Monterey, [[Pacific Biological Laboratories|Ed Ricketts' laboratory]] survives (though it is not yet open to the public) and at the corner which Steinbeck describes in ''[[Cannery Row (novel)|Cannery Row]]'', also the store which once belonged to Lee Chong, and the adjacent vacant lot frequented by the hobos of Cannery Row. The site of the Hovden [[Sardine]] Cannery next to Doc's laboratory is now occupied by the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]]. In 1958 the street that Steinbeck described as "Cannery Row" in the novel, once named Ocean View Avenue, was renamed [[Cannery Row]] in honor of the novel. The town of Monterey has commemorated Steinbeck's work with an avenue of flags depicting characters from ''Cannery Row'', historical plaques, and sculptured busts depicting Steinbeck and Ricketts.<ref name="Journey" />

In 2019 the Sag Harbor town board approved the creation of the John Steinbeck Waterfront Park across from the iconic town windmill. The structures on the parcel were demolished and park benches installed near the beach. The Beebe windmill replica already had a plaque memorializing the author whom wrote from a small hut overlooking the cove during his sojourn in the literary haven.

==Religious views==
Steinbeck was affiliated to the St. Paul's Episcopal Church and he stayed attached throughout his life to [[Episcopalianism]]. Especially in his works of fiction, Steinbeck was highly conscious of religion and incorporated it into his style and themes. The shaping of his characters often drew on the [[Bible]] and the theology of [[Anglicanism]], combining elements of [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]].

Steinbeck distanced himself from religious views when he left Salinas for Stanford. However, the work he produced still reflected the language of his childhood at Salinas, and his beliefs remained a powerful influence within his fiction and non-fiction work. William Ray considered his Episcopal views are prominently displayed in ''The Grapes of Wrath'', in which themes of conversion and self-sacrifice play a major part in the characters Casy and Tom who achieve spiritual transcendence through conversion.<ref>Ray, W.

Steinbeck's contacts with [[leftist]] authors, journalists, and [[trade union|labor union]] figures may have influenced his writing.  He joined the [[League of American Writers]], a Communist organization, in 1935.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dave Stancliff |title=Remembering John Steinbeck, a great American writer |url=http://www.times-standard.com/letters/ci_22658148/remembering-john-steinbeck-great-american-writer |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140629134544/http://www.times-standard.com/letters/ci_22658148/remembering-john-steinbeck-great-american-writer |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2014 |newspaper=[[Times-Standard]] |date=February 24, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 }}</ref> Steinbeck was mentored by radical writers [[Lincoln Steffens]] and his wife [[Ella Winter]].

Documents released by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in 2012 indicate that Steinbeck offered his services to the Agency in 1952, while planning a European tour, and the Director of Central Intelligence, [[Walter Bedell Smith]], was eager to take him up on the offer.<ref>Brian Kannard, ''Steinbeck: Citizen Spy'', Grave Distractions, 2013 {{ISBN|978-0-9890293-9-1}}, pp. 15–17.

Steinbeck was a close associate of [[playwright]] [[Arthur Miller]]. In June 1957, Steinbeck took a personal and professional risk by supporting him when Miller refused to name names in the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] trials.<ref name="Bio3" /> Steinbeck called the period one of the "strangest and most frightening times a government and people have ever faced."<ref name="Bio3">Jackson J. Benson, ''John Steinbeck, Writer: A Biography'', Penguin, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-014417-X}}</ref>

In 1967, when he was sent to Vietnam to report on the [[Vietnam war|war]], his sympathetic portrayal of the [[United States Army]] led the ''[[New York Post]]'' to denounce him for betraying his liberal past.

===Government harassment===
Steinbeck complained publicly about government harassment.<ref>https://www.biographyonline.net/writers/john-steinbeck.html accessed Jan 12, 2019</ref> Thomas Steinbeck, the author's eldest son, said that [[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the [[FBI]] at the time, could find no basis for prosecuting Steinbeck and therefore used his power to encourage the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]] to audit Steinbeck's taxes every single year of his life, just to annoy him. According to Thomas, a true artist is one who "without a thought for self, stands up against the stones of condemnation, and speaks for those who are given no real voice in the halls of justice, or the halls of government. By doing so, these people will naturally become the enemies of the political status quo."<ref>[[Huffington Post]], September 27, 2010, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-steinbeck/michael-moore-steinbeck-award_b_738727.html John Steinbeck, Michael Moore, and the Burgeoning Role of Planetary Patriotism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930050328/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-steinbeck/michael-moore-steinbeck-award_b_738727.html |date=September 30, 2010 }}</ref>

In a 1942 letter to United States Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]], John Steinbeck wrote: "Do you suppose you could ask Edgar's boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I am an enemy alien. It is getting tiresome."<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/steinbeck1.html Steinbeck Political Beliefs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022031947/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/steinbeck1.html |date=October 22, 2005 }}, Smoking Gun Part 1.

==Major works==

===''In Dubious Battle''===
{{Main|In Dubious Battle}}
[[File:Dorothea Lange - Migrant Family in Salinas, CA.tif|alt=Salinas migrant workers|left|thumb|Salinas migrant workers, photo by Dorothea Lange]]
In 1936, Steinbeck published the first of what came to be known as his Dustbowl trilogy, which included ''Of Mice and Men'' and ''The Grapes of Wrath''. This first novel tells the story of a fruit pickers' strike in California which is both aided and damaged by the help of "the Party," generally taken to be the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], although this is never spelled out in the book.

===''Of Mice and Men''===
{{Main|Of Mice and Men}}
''Of Mice and Men'' is a tragedy that was written as a play in 1937. The story is about two traveling ranch workers, George and Lennie, trying to earn enough money to buy their own farm/ranch. As it is set in 1930s America, it provides an insight into The Great Depression, encompassing themes of racism, loneliness, prejudice against the mentally ill, and the struggle for personal independence. Along with ''The Grapes of Wrath'', ''East of Eden'', and ''The Pearl'', ''Of Mice and Men'' is one of Steinbeck's best known works. It was made into a movie three times, [[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|in 1939]] starring [[Burgess Meredith]], [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], and [[Betty Field]], in 1982 starring [[Randy Quaid]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]] and [[Ted Neeley]], and [[Of Mice and Men (1992 film)|in 1992]] starring [[Gary Sinise]] and [[John Malkovich]].

===''The Grapes of Wrath''===
{{Main|The Grapes of Wrath}}
The ''Grapes of Wrath'' is set in the [[Great Depression]] and describes a family of [[sharecropper]]s, the Joads, who were driven from their land due to the dust storms of the [[Dust Bowl]]. The title is a reference to the [[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]. Some critics found it too sympathetic to the workers' plight and too critical of capitalism,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-grapes-of-wrath-literary-criticism-critical-analysis.html|title=The Grapes of Wrath: Literary Criticism & Critical Analysis|website=Study.com}}</ref> but it found a large audience of its own. It won both the National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize for fiction (novels) and was adapted as a [[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|film]] starring [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Jane Darwell]] and directed by [[John Ford]].

===''East of Eden''===
{{Main|East of Eden (novel)}}
Steinbeck deals with the nature of good and evil in this Salinas Valley saga. The story follows two families: the Hamiltons&nbsp;– based on Steinbeck's own maternal ancestry<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/IN-STEINBECK-COUNTRY-As-America-celebrates-the-2869887.php|title=In Steinbeck Country|last=Nolte|first=Carl|date=February 24, 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922051900/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/IN-STEINBECK-COUNTRY-As-America-celebrates-the-2869887.php|archive-date=September 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>&nbsp;– and the Trasks, reprising stories about the Biblical Adam and his progeny. The book was published in 1952. It was made into a 1955 movie directed by [[Elia Kazan]] and starring [[James Dean]].

===''Travels with Charley''===
{{Main|Travels with Charley: In Search of America}}
In 1960, Steinbeck bought a pickup truck and had it modified with a custom-built [[campervan|camper top]]&nbsp;– which was rare at the time&nbsp;– and drove across the United States with his faithful 'blue' [[standard poodle]], Charley. Steinbeck nicknamed his truck ''[[Rocinante]]'' after [[Don Quixote]]'s "noble steed". In this sometimes comical, sometimes melancholic book, Steinbeck describes what he sees from [[Maine]] to [[Montana]] to California, and from there to [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] and back to his home on [[Long Island]]. The restored camper truck is on exhibit in the [[National Steinbeck Center]] in Salinas.
