The '''United States Department of Justice''' ('''DOJ'''), also known as the '''Justice Department''', is a [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] of the [[United States]] government responsible for the enforcement of the [[law]] and [[administration of justice]] in the United States, and is equivalent to the [[Justice ministry|justice]] or [[Interior ministry|interior ministries]] of other countries. The department was formed in 1870 during the [[Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant administration]], and administers several [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agencies]], including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS), the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF), and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). The department is responsible for investigating instances of [[Securities fraud|financial fraud]], representing the United States government in legal matters (such as in cases before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]), and running the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud|title=Fraud Section (FRD) {{!}} Department of Justice|website=Justice.gov|date=March 25, 2015|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/jmd/organization-mission-and-functions-manual-attorney-general|title=Organization, Mission & Functions Manual: Attorney General, Deputy and Associate {{!}} DOJ {{!}} Department of Justice|website=Justice.gov|date=August 27, 2014|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> The department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local [[law enforcement]] as directed by the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act|Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/conduct-law-enforcement-agencies|title=Conduct of Law Enforcement Agencies {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|website=Justice.gov|date=August 6, 2015|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>

The department is headed by the [[United States Attorney General]], who is nominated by the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Advice and consent|confirmed]] by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and is a member of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]. As of February 2019, the Attorney General is [[William Barr]].

==History==
The office of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] was established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] as a part-time job for one person, but grew with the [[bureaucracy]]. At one time, the Attorney General gave legal advice to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], as well as the [[President of the United States|President]]; however, in 1819, the Attorney General began advising Congress alone to ensure a manageable workload.<ref name="About USDOJ">{{cite web|title=United States Department of Justice: About DOJ|date=September 16, 2014|url=https://www.justice.gov/about/about.html}}</ref> Until March 3, 1853, the salary of the Attorney General was set by statute at less than the amount paid to other Cabinet members. Early attorneys general supplemented their salaries by running private law practices, often arguing cases before the courts as attorneys for paying litigants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madan|first1=Rafael|title=The Sign and Seal of Justice|journal=Ave Maria Law Review|date=Fall 2008|volume=7|pages=123, 127–136|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/09/08/rmadan-signsealjustice.pdf|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

Following unsuccessful efforts in 1830 and 1846 to make attorney general a full-time job,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madan|first1=Rafael|title=The Sign and Seal of Justice|journal=Ave Maria Law Review|date=Fall 2008|volume=7|pages=123, 132–134|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/09/08/rmadan-signsealjustice.pdf|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref> in 1867, the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]], led by Congressman [[William Lawrence (Ohio)|William Lawrence]], conducted an inquiry into the creation of a "law department" headed by the Attorney General and also composed of the various department solicitors and [[United States attorney]]s.  On February 19, 1868, Lawrence introduced a bill in Congress to create the Department of Justice. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed the bill into law on June 22, 1870.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Acts of the Forty First Congress|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=197}}</ref>

Grant appointed [[Amos T. Akerman]] as Attorney General and [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] as America's first solicitor general the same week that Congress created the Department of Justice. The Department's immediate function was to preserve civil rights. It set about fighting against domestic terrorist groups who had been using both violence and litigation to oppose the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution.<ref name="chernow-p700">{{cite book |title=Grant |author=Chernow, Ron |publisher=Penguin Press |year=2017 |page=700}}</ref>

Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s.  In the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was "better" or "stronger" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists.<ref>Smith 2001, pp. 542–547.</ref> [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]], who succeeded Akerman in December 1871, continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the spring of 1873, during Grant's second term in office.<ref name="Willams_p123">Williams (1996), ''The Great South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials, 1871–1872'', p. 123</ref> Williams then placed a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on Klan prosecutions partially because the Justice Department, inundated by cases involving the Klan, did not have the manpower to continue prosecutions.<ref name="Willams_p123" />

The "Act to Establish the Department of Justice" drastically increased the Attorney General's responsibilities to include the supervision of all United States attorneys, formerly under the Department of the Interior, the prosecution of all federal crimes, and the representation of the United States in all court actions, barring the use of private attorneys by the federal government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=016/llsl016.db&recNum=197 |title=Act to Establish the Department of Justice |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |access-date=January 27, 2012}}</ref> The law also created the office of [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] to supervise and conduct government litigation in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/about|title=About DOJ – DOJ – Department of Justice|date=September 16, 2014}}</ref>

With the passage of the [[Interstate Commerce Act]] in 1887, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] took on some law enforcement responsibilities, and the Department of Justice tasked with performing these.<ref name="langeluttig-p9">{{cite book |title=The Department of Justice of the United States |author=Langeluttig, Albert |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |year=1927 |pages=9–14}}</ref>

In 1884, control of federal prisons was transferred to the new department, from the [[United States Department of Interior|Department of Interior]]. New facilities were built, including the penitentiary at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth]] in 1895, and a facility for women located in [[West Virginia]], at [[Alderson Federal Prison Camp|Alderson]] was established in 1924.<ref name="langeluttig-p14">{{cite book |title=The Department of Justice of the United States |author=Langeluttig, Albert |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |year=1927 |pages=14–15}}</ref>

In 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued an executive order which gave the Department of Justice responsibility for the "functions of prosecuting in the courts of the United States claims and demands by, and offsenses [''sic''] against, the Government of the United States, and of defending claims and demands against the Government, and of supervising the work of United States attorneys, marshals, and clerks in connection therewith, now exercised by any agency or officer..."<ref>Executive Order 6166, Sec. 5 (June 12, 1933), at [https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/06166.html].</ref>

==Headquarters==
{{Main|Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building}}

The U.S. Department of Justice building was completed in 1935 from a design by [[Milton Bennett Medary]]. Upon Medary's death in 1929, the other partners of his Philadelphia firm [[Zantzinger, Borie and Medary]] took over the project. On a lot bordered by Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues and Ninth and Tenth Streets, Northwest, it holds over {{convert|1000000|ft2}} of space. The sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]] served as overall design consultant for the entire building, contributing more than 50 separate sculptural elements inside and outside.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Various efforts, none entirely successful, have been made to determine the original intended meaning of the [[Latin]] motto appearing on the Department of Justice seal, ''Qui Pro Domina Justitia Sequitur'' (literally "Who For Lady Justice Strives"). It is not even known exactly when the original version of the DOJ seal itself was adopted, or when the motto first appeared on the seal. The most authoritative opinion of the DOJ suggests that the motto refers to the Attorney General (and thus, by extension, to the Department of Justice) "who prosecutes on behalf of justice (or the Lady Justice)".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madan|first1=Rafael|title=The Sign and Seal of Justice|journal=Ave Maria Law Review|date=Fall 2008|volume=7|pages=123, 125, 191–192, 203|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/09/08/rmadan-signsealjustice.pdf|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

The motto's conception of the prosecutor (or government attorney) as being the servant of justice itself finds concrete expression in a similarly-ordered English-language inscription ("THE UNITED STATES WINS ITS POINT WHENEVER JUSTICE IS DONE ITS CITIZENS IN THE COURTS") in the above-door paneling in the ceremonial rotunda anteroom just outside the Attorney General's office in the Department of Justice Main Building in Washington, D.C.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madan|first1=Rafael|title=The Sign and Seal of Justice|journal=Ave Maria Law Review|date=Fall 2008|volume=7|pages=123, 192–203|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2013/09/08/rmadan-signsealjustice.pdf|access-date=December 8, 2014}}</ref> The building was renamed in honor of former Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 2001.  It is sometimes referred to as "Main Justice".<ref>{{cite web|title=PRESIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM DIRECTS DESIGNATION OF MAIN JUSTICE BUILDING AS THE "ROBERT F.

=== Law enforcement agencies ===
Several [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agencies]] are administered by the Department of Justice:
*[[United States Marshals Service]] (USMS) – The office of U.S. Marshal was established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]]. The U.S. Marshals Service was established as an agency in 1969, and it was elevated to full bureau status under the Justice Department in 1974.<ref>Larry K. Gaines & Victor E.

*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) – On July 26, 1908, a small investigative force was created within the Justice Department under Attorney General [[Charles Bonaparte (Attorney General)|Charles Bonaparte]]. The following year, this force was officially named the Bureau of Investigation by Attorney General [[George W. Wickersham]]. In 1935, the bureau adopted its current name.<ref>''The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide'' (Oryz Press, 1999, ed. Athan G. Theoharis), p. 102.</ref>
*[[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP) – the Three Prisons Act of 1891 created the federal prison system. Congress created the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1930 by Pub. L.

In March 2003, the [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service]] was abolished and its functions transferred to the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]. The [[Executive Office for Immigration Review]] and the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]], which review decisions made by government officials under Immigration and Nationality law, remain under jurisdiction of the Department of Justice.  Similarly the Office of Domestic Preparedness left the Justice Department for the Department of Homeland Security, but only for executive purposes.  The Office of Domestic Preparedness is still centralized within the Department of Justice, since its personnel are still officially employed within the Department of Justice.

In 2003, the Department of Justice created LifeAndLiberty.gov, a website that supported the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. It was criticized by government watchdog groups for its alleged violation of U.S. Code Title 18 Section 1913, which forbids money appropriated by Congress to be used to lobby in favor of any law, actual or proposed.<ref name="dotgovwatch">[http://www.dotgovwatch.com/?/archives/17-Department-of-Justice-Website-Illegally-Lobbies-Congress-LifeAndLiberty.gov.html Dotgovwatch.com], October 18, 2007</ref> The website has since been taken offline.
