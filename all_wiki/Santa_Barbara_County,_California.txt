'''Santa Barbara County, California''', officially the '''County of Santa Barbara''', is located in the [[Southern California|southern region]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 423,895.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06083.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> The [[county seat]] is [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]],<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|access-date=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> and the largest city is [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]].

Santa Barbara County comprises the '''Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]'''. Most of the county is part of the [[California Central Coast]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher=California Department of Recreation | url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=872 | title=Central Coast | work=California State Parks | access-date=July 26, 2014}}</ref> Mainstays of the county's economy include engineering, resource extraction (particularly petroleum extraction and diatomaceous earth mining), winemaking, agriculture, and education. The software development and tourism industries are important employers in the southern part of the county.

Southern Santa Barbara County is sometimes considered the northern cultural boundary of [[Southern California]].<ref>Leilah Bernstein, "Then and Now" - Los Angeles Times, December 31, 1999, page 1</ref>

==History==
The Santa Barbara County area, including the Northern [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], was first settled by Native Americans at least 13,000 years ago. Evidence for a Paleoindian presence has been found in the form of a fluted [[Clovis culture|Clovis]]-like point found in the 1980s along the western Santa Barbara Coast, as well as the remains of [[Arlington Springs Man]] found on [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa Island]] in the 1960s. For thousands of years, the area was home to the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] tribe of Native Americans, complex hunter-gatherers who lived along the coast and in interior valleys leaving [[rock art]] in many locations, including [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park|Painted Cave]].

Europeans first contacted the Chumash in AD 1542, when three Spanish ships under the command of [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] explored the area. The [[Santa Barbara Channel]] received its name from Spanish explorer [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] when he sailed along the California coast in 1602; his ships entered the channel on December 4, the day of the feast of [[Saint Barbara|Santa Barbara]]. Spanish ships associated with the [[Manila Galleon]] trade probably made emergency stops along the coast during the next 167 years, but no permanent settlements were established.

The first land [[Portola expedition|expedition]] to explore California, led by [[Gaspar de Portolà]] explored the coastal area in 1769, on its way to [[Monterey Bay]]. The party traveled the same route on the return to San Diego in January 1770. That same year, a second expedition to Monterey again passed through the area.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=161–269 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi: Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b233487;view=1up;seq=1 |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library}}</ref> The [[Juan Bautista de Anza|DeAnza expeditions]] of 1774-76 followed Portola's trail.

[[File:SB Mission 20150914 (21995024668).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Mission Santa Barbara]] from [[Mission Park, Santa Barbara|Mission Park]], Santa Barbara]]
The [[Presidio of Santa Barbara]] was established in 1782 (4th of 5 in California), followed by [[Mission Santa Barbara]] in 1786 – both in what is now the city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. The presidio and mission kept Vizcaino's denomination, as did the later city and county – a common practice which has preserved the names of many of the 21 [[California Missions]].

European contacts had devastating effects on the Chumash people, including a series of disease epidemics that drastically reduced Chumash population. The Chumash survived, however, and thousands of Chumash descendants still live in the Santa Barbara area or surrounding counties. A tribal homeland was established in 1901, the Santa Ynez Reservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santaynezchumash.org/reservation.html|title=Santa Ynez Reservation|website=santaynezchumash.org}}</ref>

Following the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|Mexican secularization]] of the missions in the 1830s, the mission pasture lands were mostly broken up into large ''[[California Missions#Rancho period|ranchos]]'' and granted mainly to prominent local citizens who already lived in the area. [[List of Ranchos of California|604 of these land grants]] were later confirmed by the state of California, with 36 in Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.countyofsb.org/pwd/Surveyor/downloads/Ranchos.pdf|title=Santa Barbara County Rancho Map}}</ref>

Santa Barbara County was one of the 27 original counties of California, formed in 1850 at the time of statehood.<ref>1850 Calif. Stats., Chap. 15, § 4.</ref> The county's territory was later divided to create [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] in 1873.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ventura.org/rma/planning/pdf/programs/CHB/Points_of_Interest.pdf |title=Ventura County: Historical Landmarks and Points of Interest |publisher=County of Ventura, General Services Agency|access-date=January 1, 2016 |page=xiii}}</ref>

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|3789|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|2735|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1054|sqmi}} (27.8%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=October 4, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Four of the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]] – [[San Miguel Island]], [[Santa Cruz Island]], [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa Island]] and [[Santa Barbara Island]] – are in Santa Barbara County. They form the largest part of the [[Channel Islands National Park]] (which also includes [[Anacapa Island]] in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]]).

Santa Barbara County has a mountainous interior abutting several coastal plains on the west and south coasts of the county. The largest concentration of population is on the southern coastal plain, referred to as the "south coast" – meaning the part of the county south of the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]]. This region includes the cities of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], and [[Carpinteria, California|Carpinteria]], as well as the unincorporated areas of [[Hope Ranch, California|Hope Ranch]], [[Summerland, California|Summerland]], [[Mission Canyon, California|Mission Canyon]], [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], and [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]], along with stretches of unincorporated area such as [[Noleta]]. North of the Santa Ynez range in the [[Santa Ynez Valley]] are the towns of [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]], [[Solvang, California|Solvang]], [[Buellton, California|Buellton]], [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]]; the unincorporated towns of [[Los Olivos, California|Los Olivos]] and [[Ballard, California|Ballard]]; the unincorporated areas of [[Mission Hills, California|Mission Hills]] and [[Vandenberg Village, California|Vandenberg Village]]; and [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], where the Santa Ynez River flows out to the sea. North of the Santa Ynez Valley are the cities of [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]] and [[Guadalupe, California|Guadalupe]], and the unincorporated towns of [[Orcutt, California|Orcutt]], [[Los Alamos, California|Los Alamos]], [[Casmalia, California|Casmalia]], [[Garey, California|Garey]], and [[Sisquoc, California|Sisquoc]]. In the extreme northeastern portion of the county are the small cities of [[New Cuyama, California|New Cuyama]], [[Cuyama, California|Cuyama]], and [[Ventucopa, California|Ventucopa]]. As of January 1, 2006, Santa Maria has become the largest city in Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.keyt.com/news/local/2771606.html|work=KEYT|access-date=May 11, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312045405/http://www.keyt.com/news/local/2771606.html|archive-date=March 12, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The principal mountain ranges of the county are the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]] in the south, and the [[San Rafael Mountains]] and [[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre Mountains]] in the interior and northeast. Most of the mountainous area is within the [[Los Padres National Forest]], and includes two wilderness areas: the [[San Rafael Wilderness]] and the [[Dick Smith Wilderness]]. The highest elevation in the county is 6820 feet (2079 m) at Big Pine Mountain in the San Rafaels.

North of the mountains is the arid and sparsely populated [[Cuyama Valley]], portions of which are in [[San Luis Obispo County|San Luis Obispo]] and [[Ventura County|Ventura]] Counties. Oil production, ranching, and agriculture dominate the land use in the privately owned parts of the Cuyama Valley; the Los Padres National Forest is adjacent to the south, and regions to the north and northeast are owned by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] and the [[Nature Conservancy]].

===Channel Islands===

The four [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] in Santa Barbara County are [[Santa Barbara Island]], [[San Miguel Island]], [[Santa Rosa Island (California)|Santa Rosa Island]], and the large [[Santa Cruz Island]]. All of them contain native and endemic wildlife, like the island oak and Torrey Pine. All four have the deer mouse living on them, the three latter, the island fox, and the two latter, the island spotted skunk. There used to be skunks on San Miguel Island, but due to predation from marine life, birds, and foxes, the San Miguel Island skunk has gone extinct.

===Climate===
Santa Barbara County has a mild [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate]]. Along the coast, temperatures rarely exceeds {{convert|100|°F}} in the summer, but rarely dip below freezing in winter. In the interior, however, summertime temperatures can soar over {{convert|100|°F}}. Above {{convert|2000|ft|-1|abbr=off|sp=us}}, temperatures can frequently fall below freezing during the winter months. The area experiences nearly all of its rainfall during the winter months, and rarely sees any rain at all during the summer months.

The area's dry, warm summers often lead to high wildfire danger in the fall. An example of this is the massive [[Thomas Fire]], which started in Ventura County and rapidly spread into southern Santa Barbara County in December 2017. At the time, the fire was the largest wildfire ever to burn in California in terms of geographical size, but was topped only eight months later in the [[Mendocino Complex Fire]] in northern California. Heavy rainfall occurred the following January, causing massive mudslides and debris flows from the steep, fire-denuded hillsides. The community of Montecito was especially hard-hit. As of February 3, 2018, 21 are known dead and 2 are still missing.<ref>"‘It was not sufficient’: California officials reevaluate evacuations after deadly mudslides". Washington Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/it-was-not-sufficient-california-officials-reevaluate-voluntary-evacuations-after-deadly-mudslides/2018/02/03/9a19410c-003d-11e8-9d31-d72cf78dbeee_story.html]</ref>

===Air quality===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}
Air quality in the county, unlike much of southern California, is generally good because of the prevailing winds off of the Pacific Ocean. The county is in attainment of federal standards for [[ozone]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]]. In July 2020 the county was designated as attainment for the state ozone standard, but it still does not attain the state PM10 standard.

The population of the area south of the Santa Ynez Mountain crest—the portion known as "South County"—was 201,161 according to the 2000 census; thus the population is almost exactly split between north and south. Recent years have shown slow or even negative growth for regions in the south county, while areas in the north county have continued to grow at a faster rate.

==Government==
The County is governed by a five-member Board of Supervisors. The Board's three-vote majority has shifted over the years between the north and south. The Board majority now includes three members from the southern portion of the County.

The Board of Supervisors appoints a County Executive Officer, who serves at the pleasure of the Board, to operate the County governmental organization. The County government includes 4296 employees and a budget of $757 million. The County provides various services ranging from health services to law enforcement.

===Federal and state representation===
All of Santa Barbara County is located within {{Representative|cacd|24|fmt=district}}.<ref>{{Cite GovTrack|CA|24|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref> Prior to the 2012 redistricting in California, the county was divided into two congressional districts, which reflected the north and south divide – the hallmark of the county's politics. Lois Capps represented the coastal areas, while [[Elton Gallegly]], a Republican, represented the northern part of the county.

In the [[California State Senate]], Santa Barbara is in {{Representative|casd|19|fmt=sdistrict}}.<ref>{{Cite web

===Policing===

The Santa Barbara County Sheriff provides court protection, jail management, and coroner service for the entire county. It provides patrol and detective services for the unincorporated areas of the county and two cities by contract. Incorporated municipalities within the county that have their own municipal police departments are Santa Maria, Lompoc, and Santa Barbara City. Carpinteria and Goleta by contract with the Sheriff.

==Politics==
For most of the 20th century, Santa Barbara County was a Republican stronghold. From 1920 to 1988, it was only carried by two Democrats: [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Lyndon Johnson]]. However, the county has leaned to the left in recent years. Overall, Santa Barbara is a Democratic-leaning county in [[President of the United States|Presidential]] and [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections. The last Republican to win a majority in the county was [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election in California, 1988|1988]]. However, there is a dramatic difference in gradient between the "conservative" northern areas and the "liberal" southern areas of the county.

Santa Barbara County has long been divided between competing political interests. North of the [[Santa Ynez Mountains]], agricultural activities and oil development have long provided jobs. The northern portion also contains a large military base, [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]], and thus military interests are prominent. These influences have created a Republican-leaning northern half.

On the other hand, the southern portion of Santa Barbara county has had an economy based on tourism, with a significant percentage of people with white-collar jobs, formerly in aerospace but more recently in software and other high-tech pursuits. Additionally, the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] contributes to a liberal populace. The southern portion of the county has a strong history of left-wing activism, with anti-war protests common in Santa Barbara. It is generally believed that the inspiration for [[Earth Day]] was the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]]; however, [[Gaylord Nelson]], the [[United States Senator|senator]] who proposed the idea, has never directly cited any direct cause for the establishment of the holiday.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/outdoors/general/columns/story?columnist=swan_james&page=g_col_swan_Fred-Bear_Earth-Day|title=What to do about Earth Day?|work=[[ESPN]]|last=Swan|first=James |date=August 17, 2005|access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

On November 4, 2008, Santa Barbara County voted 53.1% against [[California Proposition 8|Proposition 8]] which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It was the only county in Southern California to vote against it.

===Proposed county splits===

In 1978, some residents of the northern area initiated an effort to create a "Los Padres County" out of the northern area of the county; in a referendum, this effort was defeated by a 3-1 margin.<ref>''CA County: Journal of the California State Association of Counties'', Vol. 20, page 68 (2004).</ref>

In 2006, northern county organizations initiated a similar secession proposal, to create a proposed "Mission County." Then Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] appointed a formation commission to research the viability of the proposed northern county, which reached the conclusion, stated in its final report (March 28, 2005), that "the proposed County, upon formation in 2006, would not be economically viable at current levels of service."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missioncountyformation.org/finalreport/summaryreport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315153044/http://www.missioncountyformation.org/finalreport/summaryreport.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 15, 2007|date=March 15, 2007}}</ref> The proposed new Mission County would have included the cities of Santa Maria, Lompoc, Guadalupe, Buellton, and Solvang, as well as the Cuyama Valley and Santa Ynez Valley, including [[Lake Cachuma]]. Most of the south coast of Santa Barbara County, along with the Channel Islands, would have remained with that county, with the exception of the stretch from [[Hollister Ranch]] to [[Point Conception]]. Most of the Los Padres National Forest also would have remained with Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missioncountyformation.org/maps.asp|title=Santa Barbara}}</ref> But in June 2006, voters rejected the formation of the new county, with more than 80% voting no.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sbcvote.com/elect/resources/results6_2006/results-1.htm|title=Direct Primary Election; June 6, 2006 Certified Results|work=sbcvote.com|date=June 29, 2006|access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Voter registration===
Most cities have a majority of voters registered as Democrat, while the cities [[Buellton, California|Buellton]] and [[Solvang, California|Solvang]] have a Republican majority as of the year 2000.<ref>McCormack, Don (1999).

==Economy==
[[Oil production]] began in 1886 with drilling in Summerland.<ref name=Finnegan>Finnegan, Michael (August 18, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-santa-barbara-fracking-20140818-story.html "In Santa Barbara County, oil firms and environmentalists square off"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> Enormous oil fields such as the [[Orcutt Oil Field|Orcutt]], [[Lompoc Oil Field|Lompoc]], Santa Maria Valley, and [[Cat Canyon Oil Field|Cat Canyon fields]] provided jobs and a steady supply of oil, gas, and asphalt since the first oil discovery in the Solomon Hills in 1901. [[Protests]] have marked periodic resistance to the impact of oil drilling over the years. A protest in 1929 in Santa Barbara expressed the frustration of the wealthy who came here to get away from it all. The [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill|largest spill in California waters]], credited as a spark for the modern environmental movement, coated the beaches and Santa Barbara Harbor with a thick crude in 1969. In recent years, major oil companies have left the area, turning over their oil leases to small independents, and decommissioning some leases areas that were no longer profitable. Concerns about the economy were foremost when, in 2014, Measure P was placed on the county ballot. If approve by the voters the measure would ban "high-intensity petroleum operations" in the county.<ref name=Finnegan/>

The city of Santa Barbara and other coastal communities support a significant tourism economy. White-collar jobs, previously with an emphasis in aerospace but more recently in software and other high-tech pursuits are encouraged by proximity to the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] has traditionally had a large economic impact in the northern portion of the county and continues to be the site of frequent satellite launches.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is the top major producing industry as of 2016. Strawberries are the county's top crop, with $413 million in production making up more than a third of all county agricultural production. Wine grapes are number two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kclu.org/post/santa-barbara-county-ag-production-14-billion-2016-strawberries-remain-top-crop|title=Santa Barbara County Ag Production At $1.4 Billion In 2016; Strawberries Remain Top Crop|first=Lance|last=Orozco|work=KCLU}}</ref>

County farmers began growing [[hemp]] after it was [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act|removed from a list of controlled substances]] along with other provisions of the [[Hemp Farming Act of 2018]]. These provisions were included in the [[2018 Farm Bill]] which made hemp legal for agricultural uses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2019/09/18/cbd-oil-hemp-crop-ventura-county-predicted-to-bring-100-million-payoff/2237319001/|title=CBD oil price likely factor in $100 million payoff predicted for Ventura County hemp crop|last=Wilson|first=Kathleen|newspaper=[[Ventura County Star]]|language=en|access-date=2019-09-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Cannabis and hemp plants have a similar look and smell making it hard to tell the difference.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://keyt.com/news/cannabis/2020/01/02/new-device-helping-santa-barbara-county-test-hemp-vs-marijuana/|title=New device helping Santa Barbara County test hemp vs. marijuana|last=Santos|first=Senerey de los|date=2020-01-03|website=KEYT {{!}} KCOY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

====Wine country====
The first wine grapes in Santa Barbara County were planted by the missionaries associated with [[Mission Santa Barbara]] late in the 18th century. Since commercial viticulture rebounded in the 1960s, Santa Barbara County has become a prominent [[viticultural]] region. The 2004 [[Alexander Payne]] film, ''[[Sideways]]'', set in the Santa Ynez Valley, brought additional attention to the county as a wine region, especially for its Pinot noir wines.

The region, also noted for its [[Chardonnay]] wines, is gaining a reputation for [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] varietals including [[Syrah]] and [[Viognier]]. Santa Barbara wine grapes now command among the highest prices anywhere in the state.

Many of the areas planted with wine grapes are mixed in with the rolling hills, ancient oak trees, oil fields, cattle ranches, and natural areas in the central part of the county. The county now claims more than 115 wineries and {{convert|21000|acre|km2}} of vine, with the vast majority of the vineyards in the county's [[Central Coast AVA|Central Coast American Viticultural Area]]s: [[Santa Maria Valley AVA]], [[Santa Ynez Valley AVA]], [[Sta. Rita Hills AVA]], and [[Happy Canyon AVA]] each with its own distinct terroir. The county continues to split into AVAs, with [[Los Olivos AVA]] and [[Ballard Canyon AVA]] currently going through necessary procedures to become their own official AVAs.<ref>Virbila, S. Irene (June 4, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-find-that-winery-santa-barbara-vintners-releases-new-viticultural-maps-20140603-story.html "Find that winery: Santa Barbara Vintners releases new viticultural maps"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

;;Foxen Canyon Wine Trail
The '''Foxen Canyon Wine Trail''' is situated about an hour above Santa Barbara, and several miles above [[Los Olivos, California|Los Olivos]]. Throughout the year numerous events are held in this area by the Foxen Canyon Wine Trail Association.

The trail is home to many wineries including [[Andrew Murray Vineyards]], [[Fess Parker|Fess Parker Winery]] and [[Firestone Vineyard]]. One of the wineries along the trail, [[Cambria Estate Winery]], was featured in the 3rd episode of [[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]], an American reality television series, Season 15, on January 17, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cambria Winery Estate|title=Cambria Estate Winery to be Featured on ABC's Hit Romance Reality Series The Bachelor|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cambria-estate-winery-to-be-featured-on-abcs-hit-romance-reality-series-the-bachelor-113272429.html|publisher=PR Newswire}} {{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Katie|title=The Bachelor comes to Cambria|url=http://katie.cambriawines.com/?p=692|publisher=Katie's Blog}}</ref>

Pinot Noir and Chardonnay are common all long the trail while the southern part also has many Rhone style wines due to the warmer climate. In the North, [[Burgundy (wine)|Burgundy]] styles tend to predominate more due to the cooler [[maritime (wine)|maritime]] weather.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wineries Near Los Alamos, Santa Maria and Los Olivos|title=Foxen Canyon Wine Trail|url=http://www.experience-wine-country.com/foxen-canyon-wine-trail.html|publisher=Experience Wine Country}}
