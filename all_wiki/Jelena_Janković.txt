==Family and early life==
Janković was born in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], as the third child of Veselin and Snežana, both economists.<ref name="wta">{{cite web |url=https://www.wtatennis.com/players/100153/jelena-jankovic/bio |title=Jelena Jankovic:WTA Profile |website=wtatennis.com |publisher=[[Women's Tennis Association]] |access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> She has two brothers, Marko and Stefan.

==Tennis career==
She was ranked [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] for 17 consecutive weeks until she was overtaken by [[Serena Williams]] on 2 February 2009. She was the year-end world No. 1 in 2008, the first player in the history of the [[WTA Tour]] to do this without winning a Grand Slam title.

Janković has reached the singles final of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and the singles semifinals of the Australian Open and the French Open. In 2007, she became the first female Serbian player to win a Grand Slam title when she won the [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] mixed doubles title with British partner [[Jamie Murray]].<ref name="BC Sport">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6282720.stm|title=Murray and Jankovic win Wimbledon Mixed title|publisher=BC Sport|date=8 July 2007|access-date=8 May 2010|first=Piers|last=Newbery}}</ref>

===2004–2006: Rising success===
In October 2003, Janković entered the top 100 at No. 90 for the first time, after winning her first ITF title in Dubai. Three months later, Janković garnered her first top-10 win against [[Elena Dementieva]] in the first round of the [[2004 Australian Open]]. In May, Janković won her first WTA title, a Tier V event, in [[Budapest Grand Prix|Budapest]], defeating [[Martina Suchá]] in the final. Following her win in Budapest, she reached No. 51 in the world. Elsewhere in her 2004 season, she defeated top-20 players [[Nadia Petrova]] (twice), [[Vera Zvonareva]], [[Patty Schnyder]], Elena Dementieva and [[Paola Suárez]]. Janković finished 2004 ranked no. 28 in the world.

In March, at [[Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]], she advanced to the final following Serena Williams's retirement in the semifinal. Janković then lost in the final to [[Lindsay Davenport]] in three sets. She made her first Tier I semifinal in [[WTA German Open|Berlin]], losing to [[Nadia Petrova]]. In June, she reached her first grass-court final at [[DFS Classic|Birmingham]], but lost to [[Maria Sharapova]]. In October, Janković reached her third final of the year in [[Hansol Korea Open Tennis Championships|Seoul]], ranked No. 17 in the world, her highest ranking at that time, losing to 16-year-old [[Nicole Vaidišová]] in straight sets. Her ranking at the end of the season eclipsed her 2004 record at No. 22.

Janković lost in the second round of the [[2006 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to world No. 188 [[Olga Savchuk]]. That was the first of ten straight losses, not winning a match from late January into early May. She later said this run caused her to consider quitting tennis. Janković ended her losing streak by beating world No. 17, [[Elena Likhovtseva]] in the first round of the [[Rome Masters|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome, before eventually losing to [[Venus Williams]] in three sets in the quarterfinals. At the French Open, Janković reached the third round for the first time, where she lost to world No. 1, [[Amélie Mauresmo]].

At [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], Janković defeated sixth-seeded and defending champion Venus Williams in the third round in three sets. Competing in the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time, she lost to ninth-seeded [[Anastasia Myskina]]. In August, Janković reached her fifth career final and first of the year at the [[East West Bank Classic|JPMorgan Chase Open]] in Los Angeles, defeating [[Serena Williams]] (ranked world no. 108 at the time after a lengthy injury lay-off) in the semifinals, before losing to third-seeded Elena Dementieva in the final. The [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] saw Janković defeat world No. 10, Vaidišová in the third round, world No. 7 and former champion [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the fourth round, and world No. 5, Dementieva in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. In the semifinals, Janković lost to world No. 2, [[Justine Henin]] in three sets, after Janković had led 6–4, 4–2. Janković argued with the chair umpire, when the umpire refused to offer an opinion as to whether a service call had been correct, suggesting that Janković use one of her electronic challenges. Janković then lost ten consecutive games.

Janković continued her strong form in the aftermath of the US Open. Of the six tournaments she played during the remainder of the year, she reached the quarterfinals at five. This included a run to the semifinals at the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in Beijing, defeating world No. 7, Nadia Petrova in the quarterfinals, before losing to world No. 1, Mauresmo, in a third set tiebreak. Janković finished the year at a career-high ranking of world No. 12.

===2007: World No. 3===

To begin the year, Janković won the second title of her career at the [[WTA Auckland Open|ASB Classic]] in [[Auckland|Auckland, New Zealand]], defeating Vera Zvonareva in the final. The following week, at the [[N.S.W Open/Medibank International|Medibank International]] in Sydney, Janković defeated world No. 7 and former No. 1, [[Martina Hingis]] and top-seeded Amélie Mauresmo on the way to the final, where she lost to [[Kim Clijsters]] after serving for the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/tennis/clijsters-beats-jankovic--and-crowd/2007/01/12/1168105183727.html |title=Clijsters beats Jankovic and Crowd |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= 13 January 2007|access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> Janković's strong start to the year meant that some considered her a title threat at the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]]; however, she was eliminated in the fourth round by the eventual champion Serena Williams, who was ranked 81st in the world at the time. Because of her results at these tournaments, her ranking rose to world No. 10, the first time she had been included in the top 10.

Janković reached two semifinals in the Middle East in the spring, retiring against Mauresmo due to an ankle injury at the [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], and losing in three sets to [[Justine Henin]] at the [[Qatar Total Open]] in Doha. Janković rebounded in the clay-court season, defeating Venus Williams on a third set tiebreak in the semifinals of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in Charleston, South Carolina. She went on to defeat [[Dinara Safina]] in the final to win the first Tier I title of her career. On European red clay, after losing to world No. 1 Henin in three sets both in the semifinals of the [[J&S Cup]] in Warsaw and the quarterfinals of the [[WTA German Open|German Open]] (failing to hold a 4–0 lead in the third set in the latter), Janković won her second career Tier I title at the [[Rome Masters]], defeating second-seeded [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the final. This results meant she entered the top 5 in the world rankings for the first time. Janković was the fourth seed at the [[2007 French Open|French Open]] and one of the favorites for the title. After registering her third consecutive victory over Venus Williams in the third round, she went on to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam for the second time in her career, but lost there to eventual champion Henin. This improved her ranking to a new career-high of world No. 3.

On grass, Janković captured the [[DFS Classic]] title in Birmingham, beating top-seeded Maria Sharapova in the final. Sharapova led 3–0 in the third set, before Janković rallied to win the match. The next week, Janković reached the final of the [[Ordina Open]] in the Netherlands and became the first player since [[Chris Evert]] in 1974 to win 50 matches in the first half of a year.<ref name=age>{{cite web |url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/tennis/serbs-an-ace-20080105-ge6ks2.html |title=Serb's an Ace |website=theage.com.au |date=5 January 2008 |access-date=12 June 2020}}</ref> Janković, suffering from a hamstring injury, lost the final to [[Anna Chakvetadze]]. At [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Janković was the third seed, but lost in the fourth round to the surprise eventual finalist [[Marion Bartoli]]. In the mixed doubles competition at Wimbledon, Janković teamed with doubles specialist [[Jamie Murray]] to win the title in three sets by beating the fifth-seeded team, [[Jonas Björkman]] and [[Alicia Molik]].<ref name="BC Sport"/>

During the North American summer hard-court season, Janković reached the semifinals of the [[East West Bank Classic]] in Carson, California, but lost there to fellow Serb [[Ana Ivanovic]], having held two match points in the final set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-08-12/ivanovic-sees-off-jankovic-to-reach-la-final/637356 |title=Ivanovic sees off Jankovic to reach LA final – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2007-08-12 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> The following week, Janković reached the final of the Tier I [[Canada Masters|Rogers Cup]] in Toronto, where she lost to Henin on Henin's sixth match point. Janković had leads in the first and second sets, but was unable to maintain her lead. At the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Janković lost to [[Venus Williams]] in the quarterfinals.

Janković's form tailed off following the US Open. At the [[2007 Commonwealth Bank Tennis Classic|Commonwealth Bank Tennis Classic]] in [[Bali]], Janković was upset in the quarterfinals by former [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], in Davenport's first singles tournament since giving birth. The following week at the [[China Open (tennis)|China Open]] in Beijing, Janković defeated Davenport, but lost in the final to Hungarian teenager [[Ágnes Szávay]], after Janković had a match point in the second set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1734 |title=Back From The Brink in Beijing |publisher=Sonyericssonwtatour.com |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> Janković finished the year on a six-match losing streak, losing all three of her round-robin matches on her debut at the year-end [[2007 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]] in Madrid. She finished the year ranked world No. 3. At the end of the year she had won 72 matches in a solar year, a true record of the WTA.

Janković had successful nose surgery immediately after Madrid to correct a breathing problem. The surgery prevented her from practicing for three weeks.

[[Olympic Committee of Serbia]] declared her the sportswoman of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oks.org.rs/?page_id=462&lang=sr-latn |title=Trofej OKS – Najuspešniji sportisti, Olimpijski komitet Srbije |publisher=Oks.org.rs |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820135109/http://www.oks.org.rs/?page_id=462&lang=sr-latn |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}</ref>

===2008: World No. 1 and first Grand Slam final===
[[File:Jelena Jankovic at the 2008 WTA Tour Championships.jpg|thumb|Janković at the [[2008 WTA Tour Championships]]]]
Janković lost in the semifinals of the [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] to eventual champion Maria Sharapova in straight sets, having defeated defending champion Serena Williams en route. In March at the Tier I [[2008 Pacific Life Open|Pacific Life Open]] in Indian Wells, Janković lost in the semifinals to Ana Ivanovic. The following fortnight, Janković reached her first final of the year at the [[Miami Masters]], losing to Serena Williams in three sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7332424.stm|title=Serena battles to fifth Miami win|work=BBC Sport |author=Piers Newbury|date=5 April 2008|access-date=2 August 2008}}</ref>

Janković started the clay-court season by losing in the quarterfinals of both the Family Circle Cup in Charleston and the German Ope] in Berlin. Janković then successfully defended her Tier I Internazionali BNL d'Italia title in Rome, after defeating Venus Williams in three sets in the quarterfinals, receiving a walkover from the injured Sharapova in the semifinals, and defeating French teenager [[Alizé Cornet]] in the final. This was Janković's first singles title of the year. She went into the French Open among the favorites, following the sudden retirement of four-time champion Justine Henin. However, she lost to compatriot and eventual champion Ivanovic after leading by a break in the third set. Janković was the only player to win a set against Ivanovic during the entire tournament. This marked Janković's fourth defeat in four career Grand Slam semifinals. She would have become the world No. 1 had she reached the final. However, she did reach a new career-high of world No. 2 in the week following the tournament.

At Wimbledon, Janković injured her knee during her third-round match against Caroline Wozniacki.<ref>[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/match_reports/2008-06-28/200806281214665988140.html Janković hobbles to hard-fought win] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630192407/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/news/match_reports/2008-06-28/200806281214665988140.html |date=30 June 2008 }}</ref> Although she won that match, it visibly hindered her during her fourth-round loss to [[Tamarine Tanasugarn]].

Janković's reign as the world No. 1 lasted only one week, after she lost in the quarterfinals of the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]] to eventual silver-medalist Safina. This meant Ivanovic reclaimed the world No. 1 position. Janković was the second seed at the US Open, where she defeated Olympic gold-medalist Elena Dementieva in the semifinals to reach her first Grand Slam final. There, she lost to fourth-seeded Serena Williams. Janković would have reclaimed the world No. 1 position if she had won the event.

Janković became the world no. 1 again during the fall in the midst of winning three consecutive tournaments. At the [[2008 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], Janković defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova in two sets to win the title. The following week, Janković played in the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart, where she defeated Venus Williams in the semifinals and Nadia Petrova in the final. In the [[Kremlin Cup]] in Moscow, Janković defeated defending champion Dementieva in the semifinals before triumphing against Vera Zvonareva in the final for her third title in three weeks, the first time for a player on the WTA Tour to do so since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2699|title=Jankovic Beats Zvonareva for Kremlin Cup Title

In all, Janković lost to eventual champions at six tournaments (including three Grand Slam tournaments) during the season. Janković was later named the ITF World Champion for her performance in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=2834|title=Jankovic Named ITF World Champion|publisher=WTA website|date=17 December 2008|access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref> She won four titles during the season, the most of anyone on the tour along with Serena Williams and Safina.

===2009–2010: Continued success as top-ten player===

This tournament revitalized her career and opened her path to a successful Chinese hard court season, right after the second round of the [[2015 Rogers Cup|Rogers Cup]] and an excellent semifinal in [[2015 Western & Southern Open|Cincinnati]] after beating Madison Keys and eight-seeded [[Karolína Plíšková]] en route. Janković then suffered a shocking loss to wildcard [[Océane Dodin]] in the first round of the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|US Open]].

Janković completed a great Asian swing and confirmed her excellent results in China by winning her 14th career title in [[2015 Guangzhou International Women's Open|Guangzhou]], her first since 2013. She saved match point in the semifinals against Yanina Wickmayer, before losing just two games in the final against [[Denisa Allertová]]. At the [[2015 Wuhan Open|Wuhan Open]], Janković defeated [[Heather Watson]] in the first round in three sets. She faced sixth seed Angelique Kerber in the second round but lost in three sets. Janković won her third title of the season (and milestone 15th career WTA title) at [[2015 Hong Kong Tennis Open – Singles|Hong Kong]] by battling past Venus Williams in the semifinals in a tight two sets win. Janković then hung tough against world No. 9 and top-seeded Angelique Kerber (Janković's third top-ten win of the year), coming back from a set down to capture the title with a three-set victory.

She ended the year ranked 153, her worst ranking since January 2003.

===2018–2019: Uncertainty looms===
Due to her back surgery in October 2017, Janković missed the entire 2018 and 2019 seasons.<ref>[https://www.wtatennis.com/players/100153/jelena-jankovic List of WTA matches involving Janković.

===2020: Tentative return===
Janković did not participate in any WTA tournaments prior to the suspension of the tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Janković announced on Instagram that she will participate in an exhibition tournament in [[Belgrade]], partnering with [[Novak Djokovic]] in a mixed doubles match. This will be her first tennis match since September 2017, and Djokovic stated that Janković was "returning to tennis after a very long time," perhaps indicating that Janković will return to professional competitive tennis in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.essentiallysports.com/novak-djokovic-and-jelena-jankovic-announce-surprising-news-for-fans-tennis-news/|title=Novak Djokovic and Jelena Janković Announce Surprising News for Tennis Fans|work=Essentially Sports|access-date=6 June 2020}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
===Janković vs. Ivanovic===
{{Main|Ivanovic–Janković rivalry}}
A prominent rivalry in women's tennis was the one between Janković and fellow Fed Cup teammate and Serbian compatriot [[Ana Ivanovic]].<ref>[https://archive.is/20130217025525/http://sports.yahoo.com/news/ivanovic-leads-jankovic-serbian-rivalry-204418670--ten.html Ivanovic leads Jankovic in Serbian rivalry]</ref> They have met 12 times, with Ivanovic leading 9–3 overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/h2h/100243-86757.html |title=A.

Both players were touted as future top players following their breakthrough in [[2007 WTA Tour|2007]] and [[2008 WTA Tour|2008]], however, both have since underperformed on the WTA Tour and dropped out of the Top 10 in contrasting circumstances.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisearth.com/news/tennisNews/Australian-Open-2013-Ana-Ivanovic-Vs-Jelena-Jankovic-3rd-Round-Preview-396224.htm |title=– Australian Open 2013: Ana Ivanovic Vs Jelena Jankovic 3rd Round Preview |publisher=Tennisearth.com |date=2013-01-18 |access-date=2013-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114048/http://www.tennisearth.com/news/tennisNews/Australian-Open-2013-Ana-Ivanovic-Vs-Jelena-Jankovic-3rd-Round-Preview-396224.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/sports/tennis/at-us-open-former-no-1s-ana-ivanovic-and-jelena-jankovic-fight-to-end-droughts.html?_r=0 At U.S. Open, Former No. 1s Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic Fight to End Droughts] ''New York Times''</ref> Matches between Janković and Ivanovic are often given the nickname "The Battle of Serbia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fistpumpsandajdes.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/ivanovic-wins-the-battle-of-serbia/ |title=Ivanovic Wins The Battle of Serbia &#124; Fistpumps and Ajdes |publisher=Fistpumpsandajdes.wordpress.com |date=2013-01-18 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/tennis/article2368152.ece |title=Ana Ivanovic wins the battle of Serbia to claim No1 position |work=The Times |date=2008-06-06 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> Since the end of 2008, both have struggled at the Grand Slams, with Janković only being able to reach the semi-finals of the [[2010 French Open – Women's Singles|2010 French Open]] and the quarter-finals of the [[2013 French Open – Women's Singles|2013 French Open]] and Ivanovic the quarter-finals of the [[2012 US Open – Women's Singles|2012 US Open]] and [[2014 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2014 Australian Open]], and the semi-finals of the [[2015 French Open – Women's Singles|2015 French Open]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/02/26/can-serbias-women-return-to-their-best-in-2013/ |title=Can Serbia's women return to their best in 2013? |work=The Roar |date=2013-02-26 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref>

Their most important meeting to date was in [[2008 French Open – Women's Singles#Finals|the semifinals of the 2008 French Open]]; the match was one of historic proportions as it would decide which of the two would become the first Serbian player, male or female, to gain the [[List of WTA number 1 ranked players|world No. 1]] ranking.<ref>{{cite news|first=Les |last=Roopanarine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jun/05/frenchopen.tennis2 |title=French Open: Battling Ivanovic joins Safina in Roland Garros final |work=The Guardian |date= 5 June 2008|access-date=2013-05-02 |location=London}}</ref> In a match that lasted three sets and saw one player try to gain authority over the other, Ivanovic prevailed; the result saw Ivanovic claim the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, however Janković would herself claim the ranking later that year.

The pair were involved in a long-running feud in early 2010, arising from Ivanovic's decision not to play in Serbia's [[2010 Fed Cup World Group Play-offs#Serbia vs. Slovakia|Fed Cup World Group play-off against Slovakia]] due to her poor form at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstennisblog.com/2010/03/29/ana-ivanovic-decides-to-skip-fed-cup-tie-against-slovakia/ |title=Ana Ivanovic decides to skip Fed Cup tie against Slovakia &#124; Ana Ivanovic |publisher=Womenstennisblog.com |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> They met in a controversial encounter at the [[2010 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open – Women's Singles|Madrid Premier Mandatory]] tournament in May that year, in which Janković appeared to criticise and imitate Ivanovic's fist-pumping habit following a three-set victory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/tennis/ana-ivanovic-and-jelena-jankovic-have-buried-past-issues/story-fnbe6xeb-1226557047593 |title=Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic have buried past issues |work=The Australian |date=2012-09-28 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> It was only Janković's third (and most recent to date) victory against Ivanovic, after previously winning in 2006 and 2008.

At [[2011 BNP Paribas Open – Women's Singles|Indian Wells]] in 2011, Janković was the defending champion, but Ivanovic defeated her in the fourth round, ending her title defence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnpparibasopen.com/news/tennis/2011/tournament/wta-tuesday-ivanovic-defeats-jankovic.aspx |title=BNP Paribas Open – Ivanovic Ousts Defending Champion Jankovic |publisher=Bnpparibasopen.com |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> That would be their last meeting in a WTA Tour match until the [[2013 Australian Open – Women's Singles|2013 Australian Open]], where Ivanovic prevailed in the third round.<ref name="AusOpen2013"/> Their most recent meeting was in the semi-finals of the [[2014 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix – Singles|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in 2014]] with Janković losing again in straight sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-27/maria-sharapova-to-meet-ana-ivanovic-in-stuttgart-wta-final/5413666|title=Maria Sharapova to meet Ana Ivanovic in Stuttgart WTA final|work=ABC News|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 April 2014|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>

===Janković vs. Zvonareva===
Jelena Janković and [[Vera Zvonareva]] have met 14 times with Zvonareva leading their head-to-head 8–6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tennis.wettpoint.com/en/h2h/86757-78873.html |title=J. Jankovic – V.

They met six times in 2008 with Janković winning four of the six meetings, including three consecutive times in three consecutive tournaments during the fall. The third match in this streak was the final of the [[2008 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]], which was the third consecutive title won by Janković in a stretch which also included titles in [[2008 China Open (tennis)|Beijing]] and [[2008 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Stuttgart]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Serbian Jankovic bags Kremlin Cup title |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20081012-serbian-jelena-jankovic-wins-kremlin-cup-title-tennis-moscow-crown |website=france24.com |access-date=2 September 2020 |date=12 October 2008}}</ref> Janković had defeated Zvonareva on her way to the two titles which preceded the Kremlin Cup. However, Zvonareva would defeat Janković at the [[2008 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Tour Championships]] later that year; this would be the start of an ongoing five-match winning streak against Janković.

Their only meeting at a Grand Slam tournament was at [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon in 2010]], in the tournament's fourth round. Zvonareva won, reaching her first quarter-finals of the grass court Major (and eventually went on to reach the final), after Janković retired whilst trailing in the second set.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rothenberg |first1=Ben |title=Wimbledon: No. 4 Jelena Jankovic Injured, Retires Against No. 21 Vera Zvonareva |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2010/6/28/1540919/wimbledon-2010-tennis-score-day-7-monday-jelena-jankovic-vera-zvonareva-upset-injury-hurt-fell-back |website=sbnation.com |access-date=2 September 2020 |date=28 June 2010}}</ref>

===Janković vs. Venus Williams===
Jelena Janković and [[Venus Williams]] have met twelve times and each player has won six times. Janković leads 4–2 on clay courts and 1–0 on grass, whilst Venus leads 4–1 on hard. Their rivalry is one of the most competitive and even in women's tennis. Only three of their matches have been decided in straight sets: their first meeting in the quarter-finals of the 2005 East of the West Bank Classic, which Venus won; the second was in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] which Janković won with 6–0, 6–1; this was the worst ever defeat in Venus Williams' entire career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-07/ivanovic-comeback-gathers-pace-in-rome/425324 |title=Ivanovic comeback gathers pace in Rome – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-05-07 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> and their third and most recent meeting in the second round of the [[2012 Family Circle Cup]], which Venus won in straight sets.

They have met three times in Grand Slam tournaments.

They have also met twice at the [[WTA Tour Championships]], both times in the semifinals with Williams winning in three sets on both occasions. Their most recent meeting transpired in the [[2017 BNP Paribas Open]] in Indian Wells, California. Janković appeared on her way to victory in this second round meeting at 6–1, 4–1 up before Williams came racing back to win a 2nd set tiebreak and force a decider, which she proceeded to win 6–1 en route to the quarterfinals.

===Janković vs. Serena Williams===
Janković and [[Serena Williams]] have met 14 times, with Serena leading 10–4 overall. Their first seven matches and the last match were on hardcourts, which Serena leads 7–3. The eighth and tenth match were on clay and the ninth was on grass.

In 2004, they played their first match in San Diego; Serena won in three sets. The second match was at the [[2005 Dubai Tennis Championships]] semifinal, with Janković causing an upset (Serena was world No. 4). When Janković was leading 6–0, 4–3, Serena retired. She is one of nine players who won a 6–0 set against Serena: [[Alexia Dechaume-Balleret]], [[Mary Joe Fernández]], [[Justine Henin]], [[Patty Schnyder]], Venus Williams, [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]], [[Simona Halep]]) and [[Johanna Konta]].

Janković won at the [[LA Women's Tennis Championships]] in 2006 in straight sets, and Serena won at the [[2007 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open in 2007]]. At the [[2008 Australian Open – Women's Singles|Australian Open in 2008]] quarterfinal, Janković won in two sets.

At the [[2008 Sony Ericsson Open]], Miami, they met in a final for the first time. Serena won in three sets. They played again in the final, and again in USA – at the [[2008 US Open – Women's Singles|US Open in 2008]]. Serena won in two sets. In the second set Janković had 5–3 and three consecutive set points on Serena serve. Later, when she was serving for the set at 5–4, she missed one more set point. However, Serena saved all set points and won four games in a row for [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] title.

Two years later, in the semifinal of the [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] Janković won in three sets, saving match point in doing so and coming back from 5–2 down in the final set tie-break. In the quarter-final she had defeated Venus Williams, becoming the only woman to defeat both of the [[Williams sisters]] in a 24-hour period.

Their opening round match at the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics]] was their first and only match on grass. Janković wasn't seeded and Serena won in two sets before going on to win the gold medal.

At the final of the [[2013 Family Circle Cup]], Charleston, Serena won in three sets. Again in 2013, at [[2013 China Open (tennis)|China Open]], they met in the final and Serena won in two sets. At [[2013 WTA Tour Championships|WTA Championships]] Serena won their semifinal match after losing second set convincingly, 6–2.

Their most recent meeting occurred in the quarterfinal of the [[2014 Western & Southern Open]], where Serena won in straight sets. Serena improved to 6–0 record since it was 4–4.

===Janković vs. Justine Henin===
Jelena Janković and [[Justine Henin]] met ten times over a span of six years with Henin prevailing each time. They never met on carpet or grass. Five of their matches were on clay and five on hard courts. Six of their matches went three sets. The majority (7) of their matches occurred during the 2007 season. They met twice in Grand Slams (2006 U.S. Open semifinals, 2007 French Open semifinals) as well as the round-robin stage of the 2007 tour championships. Despite their lopsided head to head results, their matches were always highly competitive.

==Playing style==
Jelena Janković is a defensive baseliner, and is often regarded as a [[counterpuncher]]. Janković is known for being able to slide effectively on all surfaces. Janković has very consistent groundstrokes and prefers to go down the line more often than crosscourt. Her biggest weapons are her two-handed [[backhand]], especially down the line, and the drop shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2013-08-29/201308291377798620037.html?chip=2 |access-date=17 February 2017 |url-status=dead |title=Jankovic routes sentimental favorite Kleybanova |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003022215/http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2013-08-29/201308291377798620037.html?chip=2 |archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref> She also has a decent [[forehand]]. Her net game has improved as a result of additional doubles play, meaning that she is now able to hit effective drive, drop and swinging volleys. Her main weakness is her serve. She likes to spin it in on the first and second serve which can lead to her getting broken many times in matches. Her weakest surface is considered grass and her best surface is fast hard courts, where she can use her defensive skills and speed to win matches. However, given the fact that six of her fifteen titles have come on clay, this could also be considered her best surface.  One of the most high-profile achievements of her career occurred on grass in the third round of the [[2015 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2015 Wimbledon Championships]], when she defeated Petra Kvitová, the defending champion, a two-time Wimbledon title holder, then-no. 2 in the world (when Janković had dropped to world no. 30), and the [[2015 Serena Williams tennis season|only player]] who had defeated Serena Williams that year.  Janković's ups and downs are often caused by her fragile mindset (see US Open 2006 vs Henin), and they have resulted in her being nicknamed 'Queen Chaos.'{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}<!--While prevalent among blogs, and obscurely referenced by sportscasters there does not seem to be a WP:Legit source for this. Jun 2020 -->

==Personal life==
Janković was the subject of the 2008 autobiographical documentary, ''[[Jelenin svet]] (Jelena's World),''<ref name="Jelena's World">{{cite web|url=http://www.talas.info/jelenas_world.html |title=Jelena's World |publisher=Talas.info |date=2004-01-01 |access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref> featuring [[Justine Henin]], [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]], [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Elena Dementieva]], [[Anna Chakvetadze]] and other notable players.<ref name="Jelena's World"/>

On 5 December 2007, Janković became a [[UNICEF]] [[List of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors|National Ambassador]] for [[Serbia]], for Children's Fund. "I am happy to have become a UNICEF ambassador for Serbia. This is a great honour for me and I will try to justify the role that has been given to me", she said. Janković is the second Serbian tennis star to have volunteered to help promote the rights of children and collect funds for UNICEF after [[Ana Ivanovic]] became an ambassador in September.

==Endorsements==
[[File:Jelena Janković Reebok 5.jpg|thumb|right|Janković promoting a sportswear brand]]
Janković is currently sponsored by Italian sportswear company [[Fila (company)|Fila]]. Previously, Janković had endorsed [[ANTA Sports|Anta]] and [[Reebok]] sportswear, and had her own line with them for her tournament wear. Janković also has an endorsement with [[Prince Sports]]: in her early career until 2007, she played with the original Prince O3 Red; from 2008 to 2010 she used the Prince O3 SpeedPort Pro White; from 2011 to 2013 Janković played with different types of racquets and in 2012 and 2013 she chose blacked out ones; since January 2014 Janković has been playing with the Prince O3 Red LS.
