Kaepernick and his 49ers teammate [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]] said they choose to kneel during the anthem to call attention to the issues of [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]] and police brutality. "After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from [[Nate Boyer]], a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and former NFL player, we came to the conclusion that we should kneel, rather than sit, ... during the anthem, as a peaceful protest," said Reid. "We chose to kneel because it's a [[respect]]ful gesture.

Kaepernick has said on numerous occasions that the sole purpose of kneeling during the national anthem is not to disrespect the military personnel at all, but rather that his goal is to use his social platform to bring topics regarding police brutality and  oppression of people of color to light. "I am not going to get up to show pride in a country that oppresses black people and people of color."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/opinion/football-protests-police-violence-anthem.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Football Players Are Protesting Police Violence, Not the Anthem|last=Cauley|first=Kashana|date=2018-08-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Kaepernick has expressed his concerns about how his actions have been labeled as "anthem protest", since he considers this to be a diversion strategy from his critics to deviate the discussion from what really matters. "I am not protesting the anthem or the nation, I'm protesting organised brutality. To me, this is much bigger than football and it would be selfish to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”<ref>{{Cite news|title=getting-away-with-murder|doi = 10.1163/2210-7975_hrd-1323-0125}}</ref>

After Kaepernick started his campaign to create awareness about excess police brutality towards minorities, especially African-Americans, commentators have mainly shifted focus to the patriotic aspect of kneeling rather than the meaning behind it; thus weakening Kaepernick's primary goal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/sep/16/colin-kaepernick-protest-racial-iniquity-nfl-american-football|title=Colin Kaepernick's critics are ignoring the target of his protest|last1=Graham|first1=Bryan Armen|date=2016-09-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-10|last2=Carpenter|first2=Les|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> One political person that players believe completely misinterpreted the act of kneeling was President Trump, since he repeatedly claims that players are protesting the flag and the national anthem; however, players are for the most part protesting the lack of accountability in the judicial system, and the way police officers can easily get away with police brutality towards African-Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/09/why-the-nfl-is-protesting/540927/|title=They Took a Knee|last=Garber|first=Megan|date=2017-09-24|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref>

Kaepernick was not able to sign a contract with any NFL team even after he opted out of his contract with the 49ers and became a free agent in 2017, presumably because of his actions of taking a knee.<ref name="Reid">{{Cite web|url=https://theundefeated.com/features/how-colin-kaepernick-became-a-cause-for-activists-civil-rights-groups/|title=How Colin Kaepernick became a cause for activists, civil rights groups and others|last=Reid|first=Jason|date=2017-08-22|website=The Undefeated|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> Nevertheless, even though Kaepernick was no longer on the sideline, his movement did not stop but rather gained more participants.<ref name="Reid"/>

Kneeling during the national anthem became a symbol of resistance, similar to the [[Raised fist|black power fist]].

=== NFL national anthem policy ===
The previous national anthem policy by the NFL written about a decade before the new policy in May 2018 contained vocabulary that allotted more leeway in the players' behavior during the national anthem before games. It required players to be on the sideline but only stated that players should, not must, stand during the national anthem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mannersmentor.com/u-s-flag-pledge-of-allegiance-and-national-anthem-etiquette/|title=U.S. Flag, Pledge of Allegiance, and National Anthem Etiquette|date=July 3, 2019|website=Manners Mentor}}</ref> Colin Kaepernick used this fact to an advantage and conducted his act of a peaceful protest which remained inconspicuous until President Trump posted his tweets on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/sports/national-anthem-nfl.html|title=N.F.L.

To address the backlash, the NFL released a national anthem policy in May 2018, stating that players and team personnel were required to stand during the national anthem. Those who chose not to stand were required to remain in the locker room.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000941064/article/nfl-anthem-policy-on-hold-under-standstill-agreement|title=NFL anthem policy on hold under standstill agreement|website=NFL.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> Though NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] said the vote was unanimous among all NFL owners, [[Jed York]], the owner of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and Kaepernick's previous team said he abstained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533|title=NFL owners pass new national anthem policy|last1=Seifert|first1=Kevin|last2=Graziano|first2=Dan|date=2018-05-23|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> During an interview, President Trump said that the NFL did "the right thing" of releasing the new policy.

Since passing the new national anthem policy in May 2018, the policy was put on hold in July 2018. This occurred when the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] filed a grievance against the NFL's national anthem policy, stating that the policy violated the players' rights because there were no prior discussions between the NFL and NFLPA. The policy remained suspended until [[Super Bowl LIII]] and will remain suspended until further notice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-super-bowl-2019-kneeling-policy-leaves-that-decision-up-to-players-15867537|title=What To Know About The NFL's Kneeling Policy Ahead Of The 2019 Super Bowl|last=Friedmann|first=Sarah|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>

During the [[George Floyd protests]] on June 4, 2020, about 20 players released a video reciting the names of victims, demanding that the NFL condemn racism and admit its policy against peaceful protests were wrong and to affirm that black lives matter. [[Roger Goodell]] did so in a video message on June 5, and encouraged everyone to protest peacefully.<ref name="week" /> On June 3, quarterback [[Drew Brees]] reiterated his opinion against the national anthem protests, generating considerable criticism, including from his teammates. Though he did not endorse the action of kneeling during the anthem, Brees apologized, prompting criticism of the apology from President Trump. Brees replied to Trump on Twitter that he has come to understand the protests were never about the American flag, and said it was wrong to use the flag to turn people away or distract people from issues facing African-Americans.<ref name="week" /> In August, after the [[shooting of Jacob Blake]], a black man, Goodell said that he wished the NFL had listened earlier to Kaepernick's reasons for kneeling.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jori|last=Epstein|title= Dallas Cowboys VP Stephen Jones declines chance to back Roger Goodell’s stance on Colin Kaepernick's protests|date=August 27, 2020|newspaper=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2020/08/27/stephen-jones-does-not-back-roger-goodell-colin-kaepernick-stance/5652302002/|accessdate=August 29, 2020}}</ref>
