In the '''2019 Democratic Progressive Party presidential primary''', the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) of [[Taiwan]] determined its nominee for the [[President of the Republic of China]] in the [[2020 Taiwan presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. The DPP candidate for the President was selected through a series of nationwide opinion polls held from 10 June to 13 June 2019.

==Background==
The chance of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen seeking for re-election was heavily crippled after the Democratic Progressive Party's devastating defeat in the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections|2018 local elections]], where the DPP lost seven of the 13 cities and counties it previously held. The DPP’s share of the vote also fell from 56 to 39 per cent since the 2016 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan’s ruling party faces serious challenges in 2020|url=http://www.atimes.com/taiwans-ruling-party-faces-serious-challenges-in-2020/|date=2018-12-11|work=Asia Times}}</ref> Tsai resigned as the party chairwoman after the defeat. However, Tsai kept trailing behind in the polls as the surveys found most Taiwanese would not support Tsai in the 2020 election but would support [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[William Lai|Lai Ching-te]], who also resigned from the premiership for the electoral defeat in January 2019.

On 19 February 2019, Tsai Ing-wen told CNN in an interview she will run for re-election, despite facing calls from senior members of her own party to not seek re-election. Before her announcement, Tsai had received a bump in the polls after she gave a robust speech saying that her people would never relinquish their democratic freedoms, as a response to the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s speech in January describing Taiwan's unification with the mainland as "inevitable".<ref name="tsairun">{{cite news|title=Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says she will run for re-election in 2020|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-says-will-run-for-re-election-in-2020|date=19 February 2019|newspaper=The Straits Times}}</ref>

On 18 March, Lai Ching-te registered to run in the party's presidential primary, saying that he could shoulder the responsibility of leading Taiwan in defending itself from being annexed by China.<ref name="lairuns"/> This is the first time in history where a serious primary challenge has been mounted against a sitting president.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, is challenged by a former underling|url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/03/23/tsai-ing-wen-taiwans-president-is-challenged-by-a-former-underling/|date=2019-03-21|work=The Economist}}</ref>
